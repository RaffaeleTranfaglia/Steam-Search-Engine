            "review_text": "-------------- Pro's: -------------- * The game is unique, with its own idea of the puzzle genre, using a cube to roll around and navigate a constantly changing, atmospheric world.  * The music is great, and is one of the main elements to the game that will cause you to have random nostalgiac dance sessions.  * As the price is considerably low at 7.99 US Dollars, I would reccomend to wait for a sale, as I have seen two 90% off sales within `30 days.  * Can be played as casually, or as rage enducing as you would like, with the level completion system being an A-D grading system, alongside counting the amount of fails and checkpoints you have.  *A fun 'Pick up and play' game, not having to have any knowledge or skill prior to using this game. (However, I would reccomend that you already know how to use your keyboard, eyes, and reactions.)  * Quick download, low amount of space required, and little to no set up. This encourages people to jump right into the game, without having to mess with tons of configuration files to get a smoot, nice gameplay experience  -------------- Con's: -------------- * The settings tab doesn't have very many choices in terms of render quality. (But the game isn't graphically intensive, so this is ruled out.)  * The controls are solid, but it is hard to enterperate what it will do sometimes. This is only very few amount of times, so don't let it deter you from getting this masterpiece of a puzzle game.  -------------- In Conclusion: -------------- This game is alot of fun for anyone, with interesting gameplay elements that get you engaged, without giving you a lot of stress like most puzzle games give you nowadays, as at some moments, it will get you on the EDGE... See what I did there? Anyway, I would give this Indie title a 9 out of 10, and I strongly reccomend you BUY THIS GAME AND GO PLAY IT!",

There are a bunch of obsticles, such as moving platforms, buttons, and even a thing that lets you turn into a miniture version of yourself. the game is simple, but the controls are a bit weird, and even tripy. I find myself playing with the controller more, to satisfy myself. Now, when I say weird, I don't mean that they're bad controls. It's the game's diagonal view-point that makes them weird, and why I use control when playing this game.  Overall, this is a decent game. It's difficult, i will say that, but it is fun. I recommend this game to people who have a good tolerance, for both difficulty and tripy things.",

Each level features three different additional goals: a survival element, a collect-a-thon element, and a time trial element. The amount of nuance put into the last aspect is what makes the game perfect for speedrunners. Not only do the collectibles, in addition to being necessary for an S+ rank, increase your speed for a short amount of time, but any extra time you'd normally incur can be negated with the use of EDGE time - that is, your cube will stick to walls and edges, and any time spent hanging there does not factor in to your final level time. This adds an additional layer of strategy and timing which is sure to have you replaying the same levels again and again.  The controls are a bit clumsy at first, but you'll become acclimated soon enough (and you can change the direction of 'up' in options). The graphics are not the best, but they at least accomplish what they're supposed to, and there's no ambiguity with what's traversable and what's not. The soundtrack is stellar, and makes it difficult to get very mad at the game. Overall, a rousing success, and as it's only eighty cents in the current sale - well, it's really a no-brainer.",

The levels get harder and harder, but getting to the end isn't really that hard. You are basically just trying to finish as quick as you can. Some of the maps are long and interesting, but alot of them are a pain. Too many levels where your cube dissappears and you have to move around and then your cube falls through the floor and you start over.

You can move and Edge hang along walls, and that's about it. This simplicity is stretched to an unfathomable length by creative puzzles and obstacles to navigate, forcing you to think in multiple dimensions. It's complex enough to provide a challenge, but minimal enough so that virtually any player can get into it. Most levels have their own charm to them, and got more than a laugh or two out of me. The electronic music is vast, varied, and catchy. The controls aren't too precise, however; you rarely ever feel like you have control of the cube unless you find that 'sweet spot' with the arrow keys, Plus, the isometric perspective doesn't help. Despite this, the game rarely gets frustrating, and death is more a learning experience than a punishment.

This game is really too easy, there is no punishment for death and surviving yeilds no sense of accomplishment. It's like most indie games, it will let you commit cube suicide 56 times in a row without making you repeat any content. The gameplay is fun but the experience is mediocre. Out of the near-limitless selection of bargain bin iPhone conversion shovelware with sparse, me-too indie graphics, this is the cream of the crop, and I mean that. Certainly buy this metered, bite-sized gamelike experience on sale for 1-3 dollars. Just don't expect an epic journey.",

My only real criticism is that small precise movements can sometimes be a pain because of the way your block tends to teeter on it's side.",

            "review_text": "I have never in my whole life sworn at a game as much as I have at this game. The controls infuriate me beyond belief. I've read some of the other negative comments, but I have played isometric puzzlers since Ant Attack on the ZX81 and Marble Madness on the AtariST. It's not the NW/NE/SW/SE thing that really irritates me (as it does others), it's the way the controls REACT DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STUFF ON THE SCREEN!!!  You're a cube, and unlike most cube games where you ROLL along nicely, in this game, there's inertia and proper physics. Have you ever tried to ROLL a cube? It's about as much fun as shaving your privates. It's why the square wheel never really took off.   The Physics engine is tied to the frame rate, so when there's less on the screen, the cube reacts a lot faster to your controls, and falls back at a different rate too. So a light tap on the up key in one part of a level might allow you to lift yourself gently and get some 'edge time', while at another, it'll flip you boldy completely over two tiles and into the chasm.    The name, and the point of the game are to 'hang' on your 'edges', but hanging on edges is so flipping HARD with keys. I've worn a little gap in the surface of my down arrow repeatedly trying to get the 60 second edge-time achievement (bloody hard).   So, What do I think about the game? It's music and aesthetics are okay.. The controls are clunky, variable, and highly annoying. The level design is interesting and sometimes actually fun.  Would I recommend this game? If you haven't played Rush yet, yes. If you've already played Rush, then this will be more of the same, with a much more irritating control system. The only thing which really makes this stand out are the mobile levels which 'morph' on the click of a button. That was fun.. But the 'click a button, then dodge a piece of flying platform' mechanic gets old.   Yes, if this game is a few quid, get it, play it, then move on. I'd give it a 'Meh' out of 10.   ADVICE: Play this game on a high-end PC and frame limit it to 60fps. Then the controls will at least be uniform across the game.",
