            "review_text": "Astroloco: Worst Contact is a point and click adventure styled after 16-bit advneture games. That being said for the price I can't not recommend this game. Its fun, slightly funny (off beat humor) and casual as can be.   Pros: 1. Easy to learn controls 2. Slight humor makes some more tedious tasks enjoyable 3. Best 16-bit graphics that 32-Bit can render 4. FUN!! 5. Price  Cons: 1. No widescreen options limited to 4:3 ish scales 2. Cut Scenes  3. Limited controls for volume, screen, and controls (once again point n click) 4. Has option to mute commentary (not Bad) but then I have to read all the Voices aloud when I'm let's Playing it.  Other than that I have thouroughly enjoyed playing the 1st ACT and am looking forward to checking out the rest of the game!!",
