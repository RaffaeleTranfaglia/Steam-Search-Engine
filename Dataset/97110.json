            "review_text": "Kohan is a unique strategy game which blends the rts and turn based strategy genre together. It borrows many concepts from other games and add some features of its own which creates a very enjoyable experience. All things considered, Kohan is a hidden gem that has long been forgotten but has aged quite well. It has lenghty campaigns, great multiplayer and offers quite a challenge.  The game plays like a realtime Heroes of Might and Magic combined with rts combat that requires more strategy and planning instead of fast reaction like most rts games do. It's all about training well balanced companies that can overcome the enemy and taking the terrain to your advantage. You need to conquer cities, outposts and ressources in order defeat your opponents.  The ressource system is also fairly unique and allows for some strategizing, instead of gathering ressources you can erect different buildings which give you ressources which are used by other buildings or units. If you lack any ressources, this will be compensated by a heavy gold cost. This allows for some variation and is pretty flexible.  Overall it's highly recommended for players who are longing for an unique and great rts.  The only downside that I can think of is that the graphics are dated and that you can't change the resolution. Nevertheless the sprites and animations are really good for such an old game.",
