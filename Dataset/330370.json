            "review_text": "OVERVIEW  Reload is just what it claims to be: a MIL/LE simulation-style rail/range FPS, only, instead of shooting live baddies, you're shooting target representations of them in varying circumstances. In addition, some less combat-oriented levels are included. It accomplishes this premise in a mostly enjoyable fashion, with some flaws.  GAMEPLAY  The levels are pretty well-designed and nicely explained, and it's not that difficult to get a handle on how things work, while also not being so easy that you're bored. The eyewear and camouflage unlockables are great touches that make obtaining platinum on levels feasible, while also adding a sense of accomplishment. There's enough variety in the types of levels to give the game good replay value. Enemies that shoot back in some levels are quite nice. Really dig the move-and-shoot factor on some stages. Controls are good.  On the negative, the tutorial thingies are quite excessive. You should be able to turn them off. The F key is definitely your friend once you get the hang of the game. Also, in the first skeet shooting level, at least, when it says you have less ammo this go around, it's...meaningless, because you've still got hundreds and hundreds of rounds you won't need even if you're a terrible shot. Quite odd. Also, it's irritating that the game zooms in every single time you get a pumpkin or a small target in the sniper levels. The first times, fine; every time, no thanks. The grenade levels are poorly designed, as it's unclear as to what you have left to shoot. The most irritating factor of all is how poorly the reflexive fire rifle level is. Its platinum (and even gold) rating is absurdly difficult, not to mention that the two pop-up targets in the very back are nigh impossible (if not impossible?) to shoot (the shotgun level with hostages had a similar issues). The dot can be right on them and firing does nothing. Really bad hitboxes. In fact, that entire level is broken - you don't get any bonuses from one of the rounds, no matter how you do, which is probably exactly why platinum is borderline impossible.  GRAPHICS  Quite decent, once you change them to the highest resolution - why the default is so low, I'm not sure. There are some slight glitches, but overall it's quite nice.  AUDIO  Sound is pretty good, from the instructor's voice to the gun effects. Music is OK and it fits well with the game.  STORY  You're some random dude who's learning some mad skills. That's about it. I did, however, use these skills to save the girl I love and the world (plus every other world out there), so I guess the idea is to just create your own story in real life, like I did. Thanks, Reload!  CONTENT  Nothing to say here. It's a clean, classy game in which you're preparing to toast bad guys 4 realz by toasting them in their simulated forms. Zero profanity, sexual content, worldview issues, or anything else.  INTERFACE  I'm assuming the word 'Interface' works for this...Anyway, I'm talking about stuff like options and such. It's pretty basic but solid, with some problems, such as the aforementioned tutorial pop-ups, and the fact that, when you start a new career, it ditches all of the unlocked levels, too. That's...quite annoying. I assumed it would just delete campaign progress and that was it, letting you play all the scenarios straight through, but it doesn't. One other minor negative is that start-up is just a tad slow - staring at 'Copyright 2014' (paraphrasing) gets old fast. Some other minor issues are, for instance, the lack of proper grammar in, 'Exit to windows?', and it saying you unlocked two of...the same thing, or using 'Unlocked' in reference to locked things (I can kinda understand the last one, but it's a bit weird. It would also be nice if it told you what some of the changes actually did (almost all are obvious). On El Presidente, it says to watch out for hostages...But there aren't any. Also, sometimes the game says, 'Better luck next time', for...seemingly no reason. The 'All Weapons Drills' don't work for me yet (I can't select anything), but it doesn't say why. In the mounted machine gun levels, reloading is still there even though it's irrelevant.   (Note, of course, that a lot of these are quite minor, 'polish' issues - I'm just trying to list everything I can, positive and negative.)  CONCLUSION  The more I played this, the more I liked it, which one other reviewer alluded to (more skill, more fun). For five bucks, it's not bad. Its simplicity is rather attractive.   Overall, I think I'd give it about 6/10, maybe a 7. If you'd like a casual, at least remotely realistic FPS sim, then I'd recommend giving Reload a try.  I hope you found my review helpful. Thanks for reading, and Godspeed.",
