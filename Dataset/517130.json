            "review_text": "For most rhythm/music based games, the worst thing about them is that you depend on an algorhithm to determine the beats. Some games will painstakingly create beat maps for each song, but then you're limited to the songs they've done. This one fixes both by giving the beat map creation to the players of the game.   One song can have multiple beat maps, so you're able to see various 'interpretations' of a song, and in some cases, a variety of difficulties.   This game is still a bit rough in some places though. Right now it's plagued by occasional slowdowns while playing and creating song beat maps.   Some things I liked:     Each song 'challenge' is tied to a particular video, so you can't have someone play the 12 minute extended disco version while someone else plays the 3 minute radio edit and put them both on the same scoreboard.     If you see a video challenge that looks interesting but then comes up disappointing for some reason, make your own!     In VR, it records all the movements you make even if you don't punch so you can feel free to be expressive with your 'dance'   Things I didn't care for very much:     At this time, you can't see your friend's activity without directly putting their name on the website.     The game is plagued by slowdowns while creating beat maps. It may or may not still happen during normal play (not sure yet).     If your song choice isn't on youtube, you're out of luck (I guess you can try to make an account and upload it yourself?)     the 'boxing gloves' are set at an awkward angle so you have to hold the controllers differently from other games to line it up properly   Overall, this is a great game, and I expect to see much improvement as the developer is still working on it. If I had to choose between this and AudioShield, I'd pick this game.",

            "review_text": "Very nice game although like all of the VR dance games out right now (Audioshield, Holodance) suffers from a few major issues. This game is unique in that all the beat maps are player generated in game - a great way to increase the quality of beatmaps compared to the autogenerated beatmaps of audioshield. Users can vote on beatmaps so the idea is that the good ones float up to the top. It seems, however, the demographic that is playing this game is primarily interested in anime and videogame songs thus the top of the popular chart seems to be litered with this. It would be nice to have a better option to sort these songs out if you're not interested in them. Additionally, the interface is somewhat buggy, graphics are mediocre and challenge level is overall low. Increasing challenge buy making better use of a roomscale environment would be welcome. Unfortunately, it seems that the developer has not had any major updates recently.   Ultimately, this game a lot of potential and is currently 'tied' in my view with audioshield. I believe that the better game will ultimately be the one that has the best developer support.",

            "review_text": "First ever steam review - just wanted to say that THIS is what I was hoping to get out of audioshield from the beginning: Making your own beatmaps is incredibly fun, and the little recorded avatar makes for some hilarious situations. I was able to start out an enigma song by meditating for example, and it is super fun to see others' personalities in their beatmaps.   I'd love to see some sort of ranking/review system for beatmaps in the future, and the occasional slowdown needs to be addressed, but seriously, this is the most fun I've had on my vive thus far.  Awesome game!",

            "review_text": "When this game works it s great - when it doesn't it's annoying!  In my experience: More often than not the game says 'cannot resolve connection to the soundboxng online address' which enables me to play the game - and when I do make a connection, more often than not, it's constantly buffering and the YouTube video never starts. I have a very fast reliable nternet connection, all my other internet usage stuff works so it's not down to my internet speed. In addition to this the game doesn't support local file support - in other words you need to be online to play. The developer seems nice enough but the game is lacking bang up to date updates and the developer hasn't acknowledged recent issues/posts on the game's discussion boardboard - if I could refund I would!  However, aside from a few bugs, when the game works it's great - really really great, but in my experience I can't recommend the game because more more often than I'm left disappointed...  ",
