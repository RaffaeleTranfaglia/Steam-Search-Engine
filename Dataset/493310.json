According to some there are work arounds but me personally I don't want to encourage, publishers from digging up any old devs non-working corpse of a game. Requiem Avenging Angel makes Bethesda games look bug free. What gets my goat is the game itself isn't half-bad. It was just eaten up in the Half-life 1 hype.",
