    "description": "Magical Brickout offers a new twist on the beloved classic Breakout formula. Instead of moving a small paddle back and forth across the screen you rotate the bricks in a circular fashion as you frantically try to keep the ball in the play area. This fast-paced and addictive gameplay is only half of the fun.",
