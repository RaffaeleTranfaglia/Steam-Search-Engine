            "review_text": "Monochroma is a very interesting platformer. Without any story told, you will pickup your little brother and help him go through all the obstacles you are facing and escape from bad people.  Pro: -Graphics: The graphics are REALLY good. I love the black'n white with hint of red style. Feels reqlly unique (despite this is not the first platformer who offer this, check out Limbo an excellent platformer). -Sound: The music is really good, feels like 1950's musics, with a bit a jazz, it is a good experience for your ears. -Puzzles: Puzzles feels rewarding when solved, almost all of them are well designed, there some that could use a visual hint or two (like the double lift, I was looking at the wrong solution for quite a long time, had to look up for the solution as I couldn't see it but just the one I was trying which at some point seemed possible). I tink sometimes visual hints to go backward could have been good. -Story: Despite being without any background, this is a success I think. You understand things one bit at a time, the background is the narrator. The story told here is not very big, it rely mostly on helping your brother. You get attached to that task.   Cons: -Controls: Controls are sluggish at time. It is not that important except when you need to do timed jump, and at that time the game gets frustrating. The tutorial was not clear enough about the jumping system, as I was succeeding all my jump, I didn't give any thought at first, and then you are in a chase scene and you need to do thing fast and it is not well responding, then you start yelling at your jump. Specially on the achievement Conscience to save a robot from crushing under a press. Looked up a playthrough online, and the layout of the button was different from mine (perhaps a different build than the final one), You have to do some timed jumps and be very reactive, I was trying really hard for at least 15min, then doing more or less the same thing as before, the jump activated as wished and I was able to complete it. I should'nt stop you from completing the game but a bit of polishing on the control would have been good. -Bugs: I found some bugs, mostly collision, when that happens you are a bit in a bind as you have to restart the whole checkpoint, despite them being well spread it's still a bummer.  To conlude: I finished the game in about 4h (a bit more with the achievement of the robot), found 9 out of 16 secrets (I will probably look up for info in order to get them all). Will you, like me, help your brother? I do hope so. I do recommend this game to people who like platformers (specially if you liked Limbo, this one should be in your taste).  Luuna.",

            "review_text": "The word that best describes Monochroma is 'annoying'.  1)The puzzles aren't really puzzling. You pretty much see what needs to be done immediately.  2)Your character's movements seem way more sluggish then they need to be. For example - running is slow as balls &amp; there seems to be too much downtime while recovering from a jump or fall. I understand that this may be a design feature to enhance the drama of the chase. But it feels unnecessary &amp; bothersome at times.  3)The difficulty in this game stems from having to be precise. However, your character handles like crap. sometimes refusing to grab onto switches &amp; ledges. And other times just plain refusing to let go of switches &amp; ladders. This causes you to fail the timed puzzles &amp; redo them, over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; I think I made my point. (&amp; so you don't think I'm complaining because of 'lack of skill' check my progress on 'Limbo'. I'm fine with deaths &amp; having to be precise, but the game's controls better not be a stumbling block.)  4)The backgrounds are beautifully made. However the character animations look rigid.  5)For what this game is. It's WAY overpriced. Glad I only paid $4.99, but I still feel ripped off.  Play Limbo or wait for Inside.",

The only thing complainworthy so far is the lack of onscreen controller prompts in the tutorial; just the keyboard controls are shown, so those opting for a controller have to work things out by trial and error. Other than that, I love it so far.",

For everybody who is searching for this kind of games I highly recoomend it ;)",

            "review_text": "Got the game during a sale based on the primarily positive reviews. Spoiler free review.    What I liked:    Overall aesthetic of universe.    The universe starts out normal enough but as your journey forth, it reveals a more menacing side.  (I love that about this and how everything escalates into an intriguing world.)   The monochromatic color scheme.    Is overall lovey and colors become even more enhanced through your experience while you play through. At several moments in the game, I found the game genuinely beautiful. The design felt complete and well thought out,   The soundtrack.    In the rare moments where the music comes into play, it builds tension, atmosphere and pacing beautifully.     What I was disappointed about:    The silence between the brothers.    I'm not asking for actual conversation, but even the smallest suggestions of dialogue should happen between the brothers. Instead, they are silent and do not have anything to say about the environment or the complex situations they find themselves in.    Compare to the interactions of the brothers from 'Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons' and you'll see what I mean.    Functionality of the controls.   There are times where certain puzzles are very time based. This is frustrating when your character doesn't jump when he needs to. This will happen multiple times where you literally have to start the puzzle over because your character didn't react fast enough.     At times, I came across puzzles where I thought I was unable to solve to puzzle...only to realize I was going about it the right way and the controls weren't responding the way I had wanted.    Puzzles.    There were a couple times where I felt very accomplished after solving a puzzle, but that is far and few in between.The majority of the puzzles are actually very straightforward and not too difficult to figure out.    In addition, nearing the end of the game, involving a boss battle, the ingenuity felt strangely lacking. It wasn't immediately clear what needed to be done and made for a lot of trail and error. Not the good kind.    Your main characters.   Having the little brother being carried throughout 90% of the story made for the brother to be a nuisance than someone you'd protect.  The entire game is essentially an escort mission. The little brother doesn't feel alive, but rather an item you carry that can consequently die and restart your game.   You don't get to know the brothers much throughout this long journey.  No small interactions/ conversations between the brothers and how they react to the world around them.    The logic of the younger brother only wanted to be left behind in light made sense in the beginning, but as the puzzles started getting more complicated, it got a little silly.  (ie. 'Sure, bro, I'll just leave you on this conveyor belt where you might get crushed. But it's OK. There's a light, so it's safe.')     Summary:  I can feel what this game is trying to do, but when I reached the end, I only felt relief that I didn't have to play more and disappointment that they didn't do more with the universe they created.  The aesthetic is beautiful, but the world feels empty and unlived in.  You're forced to invest your time in characters you have a hard time caring about. And the only thing to get you to come back to playing the game is the aesthetic.   Overall, if you want to try the game, get it during a sale. It's definitely not worth full price.",

            "review_text": "Despite the comparisons to Limbo this game has its own charms, and for a quick (4-5 hours) play through I found it moderately enjoyable. It's probably best purchased on a sale.  Its strengths lie in its atmospheric touches. At times it hews closer to cinema than solid gameplay, and if you're looking for a standout platformer, there are other games that provide more satisfaction.  The story is mostly implicit. On the one hand I appreciated what it accomplished without dialogue, or even interaction between the brothers. Unlike some others here I enjoyed the story's progression and its ending. That said, I found it difficult to sympathize. Many times you are forced to place your brother in what is a comically dangerous and contrived situation, which elicits humor in the midst of a very dark dystopia. Sometimes that contrast is entertaining, other time it is frustrating.  I suspect that the latest update fixed some of the control issues, but I found some puzzles still suffered in that it's obvious what you need to do but the precision to do so is wanting.  ",

I'm not really a fan of platfomers since I've been gaming for over 30 years and I'm hard to impress, but I was easily wrapped up in this gem.  I was a little weary of this game because a review said that the control isn't tight but I didn't have any issues. You just need a little practice, which this game will give you plenty of. (I used a wired Xbox 360 controller to play). Game design so far is exceptional. The game is very, very much like Limbo, but in this game, you need to escort your injured brother and the puzzles are unique because of this mechanic. The puzzles so far are challenging and you may scratch your head for a moment before you get it. This is better and unlike many games where you just do things because you can and therefore you can assume you are 'supposed to' (figuring puzzles out on accident). Not in this game. You figure out how to die or get your brother killed on accident. :-)  The graphics and effects are great. First time you launch the game it's at 720p and I didn't even notice because they looked so good. I put it at 1080p and it was very sharp. The music is good. The sound is good. The control is tight. I found myself able to jump at the last second every time to just barely make the jumps like challenging platform jumping should be. So you will need smarts and good timing in this game. The checkpoints are kind and fair and I have not been frustrated at all.",

I reached out in the forum but have not heard from the developer with any ideas, just silence. up to that point it was pretty fun but since I can no longer play it and it crashes steam, I cannot recommend it.  I just heard from the developer, they are aware of the issue and are trying to find what is causing it for Linux users. I have sent whatever info I can to help so hopefully this will be fixed soon. If I am able to continue playing with no more technical issues I will definitely recommend the game as I don't have any controls issues etc, that some are claiming.",
