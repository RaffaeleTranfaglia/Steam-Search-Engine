    "description": "Player bases are located on asteroids, which travel within the Oort Cloud. Once they’ve acquired the appropriate skills, players can control their asteroid’s movements. Mass-combat enthusiasts will love the Arena: here, players can battle it out against alien races or other Astro Lord players.",

            "review_text": "This game is as free as any mobile city building/quest game. Its a free to download game where you pay to speed up your progress which otherwise will take you weeks to months to be on par with other players who will already be in your games with better ships and equipment .  AstroLords is a game where you build your city and then go on different quests such as boss fights,pvp and defense agains aliens .You can play agaist AI but very often some veteral player will get into your game and woop your ♥♥♥ with bigger ship . Most games like this are Pay to Win and it does feel underwelming for new player when my ship has 100 defense and the other guy has 170 or more .  I think this game is trying to be like multiplayer Spacerangers which is not a bad thing .It is a really cool concept and game has a lot of depth behind it more so than boom beach and games of that type . I speak russian and game is still hard to learn . If you don't speak russian well I don't think you will get very far not undestanding any skills and perks .  I mean its a good game but I just not gona drop cash just because it takes 3 days to build some ♥♥♥♥ otherwise . If you like games where you are forced to take brakes sometimes because you run out of things to fight with then by all means you will love this game .",

Anyway I miss here command of bigger fleets, just 1 ship is not enough! The entire game start to be pretty boring. for example in Kingdom Wars i can build anything if i have the money, here you must pay real money to build more that 2 buildings in same time lol.  The battlesystem is just, boring. You have just 1 ship to move, not a fleet.  Its Not RTS here or Strategy its just an RPG.",
