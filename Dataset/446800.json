            "review_text": "This is a great game but It got some really annoying problems.  This review is for people who came here because they used to love OTTD or Simutrans. If you loved Transport Tycoon, Simutrans etc. and you came here looking for something like that: BUY IT. It is not as complexe as those but it looks nice, is fair priced and has enough features to provide a good amount of fun.  So I give it a 6/10, without the points made below it would've been a 9/10.  - When you upgrade a trainstation all the trains heading there will turn arround and try to find a new route (even if you make changes in pause) This really kills alot and forces you to pay close attention to no ruin your trainsystem.  -If you want to have onewaytrack-systems utilized by many lines and big stations with platforms to choose for those lines - forgett it. A line randomly decides wich of the platforms in the station it uses and each and every single train of this line will use it. There is no 'who comes first chooses platform'.  -There are only 'path-signals' - nothing else. (and if you red the points above they're 'semi-functioning'  -The landscaping is a bad joke. You get 3 options (raise, lower, flatten) and 3 strengths to choose from. The tool is a TINY circle and you just wont be able to do anything productive with it.  - For my personal taste to few graphs and numbers. I compare it to simutrans where you could compare almost every numbers in nice graphs.  Transport fever gives you numbers but no window to select and compare them. The finances-tab is verry basic, no nice graphs and only the big numbers are listed.     Thanks for reading and don't get me wrong this is a good game. But it wasted a good amount of potential and needs some fixes.",

            "review_text": "First review I have ever written on Steam. The reason why, is because of the missleading negative user reviews from people who have no idea what this game is about or run the game on a wooden potato.  So first up, graphics: This game looks amazing on some moments, especially when seeing the modeled boats, trucks and trains, they all look gorgeous. Some other aspects like font and trees look low res, but bear in mind you ll play this game mostly zoomed out.  Gameplay: Okay, prepare to restart the game a lot of times. I am an experienced Train Fever player and I still had to restart like 5 times when playing on hard and mountain map. The goal of this game is to set up a transport line as profittable as possible, causing to grow cities on the map. It's the kind of game you ll fire up and still be playing 5 hours later.  Cons: -upgrading stations or platforms causes cargo/passengers to disappear, this is an issue we had in Train Fever as well and there is no excuse for the devs this is still in the game, it is ridiculous. -Performance may get a hit when building the map full of moving detailed vehicles and having everything set to ultra. -More info and the how and why should be given. I see there is a tutorial now so for new players that might be the best place to start.  Pro: -Addictive gameplay -One of the few transport or tycoon games with good graphics -Tons of replayability -Big modding community   Conclusion: This game is far from a 10/10 game, but for a tycoon or transportation economical management game this game should deserve some credit for it as well. For me this game has a 7.5-8/10 and could possibly become a 9/10 if better mods are added and if they fix the issues listed before. People who are saying the game is unplayable have no idea what this game is about and can return to their OTTD and stick with that. People also dont like to admit the game is too hard for their understanding so they go around rating it as a bad game. Dont let yourself be fooled, this game is tons of fun.",

If you're the kind of guy that likes fine-tuning and spent hours perfecting his track-layouts in Railroad Tycoon 3 - this is the one game to get! I have not written a review in about a decade. So this praise is ment from the heart as I can feel the love that went into making this work of art.  I have not had any of the technical problems that i see mentioned in other reviews. The game worked fine since release with only a few quirks and not a single crash in hundreds of hours playing, including frequent switches into the background. To keep this short: Of course certain gameplay aspects could be done differently, but many are done very well. If i had single wish: More of these wonderful campaigns (by DLC).",

            "review_text": "I am not a guy who likes to give a public review on games, and who knows why i am here to give this game a review.  This game is, without any doubt, a good game. Taking loans and building up transportation network is what you need to do in the game. The network in this game also introduces a supply chain system, for example, a unit of steel is produced in a steel plant, from a unit of coal and a unit of iron ore which are delivered from a coal mine and a iron mine. and you need to ship the steel to a workshop for tools or machine manufacture, and you may need more than one kind of other resources from other supply chain like oil-fuel-plastic, wood-planks, grain-food/biofuel, etc. The sites are separated in the entire map,it is very common that your supply chain circles many rounds before reaching.thefinal destination, but dont worry, the.longer it goes the.more payment you get. Finally, you have to deliver the final products to cities to support their growing need.  There are several things you may want to know before you buy this game or new to this game.  a)In 1x speed time mode, it would take nearly 10s to pass a day in the game, a vehicle may need a year to travel across the map, so the game is extremely slow-paced, I always forget my time in reality, which made.me sick this afternoon.  b)unlike city:skyline or simcity, removing a building costs money, you need to pay extra money when removing commercial/residential/industrial buildings. You can't build any commercial/residential/industrial buildings either, but they can be built automatically ehen city need is satisfyied in late game.  c)building tunnels or bridges costs huge amount of money, so dont unless.you have to.  d) loans are will charge you a small amount of interests every year untill you payback, which is very different from the loan in reality.  English is not my first language, so forgive me if my expression is not satisfied. I will update this review after other useful things come into my mind. I hope you can enjoy this game as I do, but not at the cost of sleeping too late.",

It did have a few initial glitches but many have already been remedied and given the Urban Games track record of responding so well to Train Fever's similar initial problems, I have no doubt that any problems will be quickly addressed. They care and are very responsive.  Track and road buiding are so improved over Train Fever. The industrial products and businesses are greatly improved also. The graphics are beautiful. Just let it run and watch the wonderful details in the buldings pass by as you follow a realistically detailed stage coach.  The Steam Workshop (already bursting with cool new content) will insure that the game will not get stale but only get better and better. This will be the Transport Tycoon for the next 20 years.  Okay, it's not an action-packed shooter type game. It's an enjoyable relaxing city/transportation builder which will bring you hours and probably years of fun. I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "I enjoy good business simulation games and I was really excited when I saw the presentation videos. Unfortunately behind a game with good building mechanics you will find various terrible economy and AI mechanics. Some of the things can be patched though.  The funny part is that the devs designed the campaign missions in a way that the flaws the game has become so extremely obvious.  First of all let's look at the trains which is usually the focus of these types of games as people usually like to build their own train network and watch it work. The problems here probably the easiest to fix, because they are more a balance issue. Trains are extremely expensive compared to other forms of transportation and in addition they have much higher running costs. So when starting a new game you are pretty much forced to use trucks and busses to get profits before you can actually start building a train network. Unfortunately due to the high initial costs it is tricky to approach this without going bancrupt the first few times. When I used trains to deliver cargo they barely made any profit even when if they had little to no wait time and sometimes I even had them running at a loss while trucks easily made their money back within the first few months of operation.  So at the moment It looks like trains are only good to transport passengers as they bring in more money. However even here other types of transportation are better (as they are cheaper to operate). Why the devs did it this way is a mystery to me.   Let's take a look at the planes. The pilots and air traffic controllers in this game seem to monkeys. There is no structure or proper priority designation for planes on the ground and in the air. planes on the ground when finished with loading passengers simply roll to the runway and depart even if another plane is about to land. And the go around functionality causes these planes then to fly very long paths which causes them to get in trouble with other planes causing even more delays. This system has to be reworked completely. Even the very old transport tycoon did it better. At the moment a runway for an aiport is barely able to handle the planes on one line. If you think about setting up several lines going to the same airport don't even try. The income of your air lines will be completely destroyed. It looks like the devs wanted to be realistic here, but failed with programming the AI properly.  Ships are huge work horses in Transport Fever that are slow but can load quite a bit of cargo. However this also causes problems as ships can only carry one type of cargo at any given time. If you have 10 tons of tools, 15 tons of bread and 26 tons of construction material the ship with a loading capacity of 100 tons will only take the 26 tons of construction material as it has the highest priority. This is a system that also affects other vehicles but isn't noticable there as the train waggon for example has a lower loading capacity and therefore you have various waggons able to load smaller numbers of different cargo types. So the devs implemented ships without thinking about what makes ships different.  The economy machanics require the player to seriously look at all factories in range, because if you start with one cargo line you have to build several others at the same time. If for example you deliver iron ore to a steel factory without delivering coal as well, the iron ore mine will shut down quickly as soon as the steel factory has the maximum number tons of iron ore it can receive. The same goes if you don't take the steel the factory produces and deliver it somewhere. As soon as the factory is full and if no cargo is taken away everything that is connected will shut down.  This is also different to other games in this genre. Usually the industry defines how much cargo is produced and needs to be transported. Here you as the transport company increase the production by delivering more and more over time. If you don't transport anything the factories will not produce cargo. This also means that with each new line you create you start with a loss and have to wait for the production to increase to turn loss into profit. Doesn't that sound like fun?  There is also game freezing and crashes. So the game still has some problems with stability that have to be solved.   I want to like this game, but just like train fever this game has to many issues to be considered good. It looks like they went two steps forward (more options in terms of transportation, better construction) and one step back (unfinished game with a terrible economy system)",

            "review_text": "The simulation is done well including the pathfinding. As some reviewers already pointed out there is no chance to let trains automatically find a new platform if a different train is blocking it, neither is there any chance to let the train find a different route if the actual one is blocked. These two points did keep me from buying the game.  What can I say, I did buy it and the pathfinding is okay. This is just because you can rewiew the path and tweak it, which i rarely needed to. Same goes for the automatic selection of the platform in a station: You can just force any train into the platform of your choice by sending him to a waypoint just in front of it.  To be honest, there are some caveats. The performance is okay, i guess (Core i7 2600, GTX 550 Ti, 8GB RAM), the Framerate drops to single digit values occasionally, but the game plays fine. This isn't a FPS after all. The loading times however, are tremendous (HDD 7200 rpm).  Some aspects of the game are subject to each and every ones taste. The overall progress of the player in the game is relatively slow, while the timeline flies like an arrow. If you are more into trains, your first and third train are from different epochs.  The track building progress is more fun than in other games (I didn't play Train Fever though) and the result looks like in real life, especially the track fields (Gleisvorfelder) of larger stations. Signalling is fine yet simple. Somehow i managed to build a setup with no deadlocks - yet.  For die hard fans of Transport Tycoon and its successors, this game is a must have. It feels a lot like Trucks and Trains Tycoon, but has almost everything done right.  Despite the performance issues this game is worth its while and the price tag is somewhat okay. If you can snatch the game in sale, you won't regret it.",

In Normal mode you'll probbly struggle for the first 4 to 10 hours until you understand the basics, but then you'll be able to turn some nice profit which is quiet rewarding. But it all boils down to hard mode really. Only 0.2% of all the Transport Fever have managed to get the 'important' achievements in that mode. Being one of them let me tell you that it's taken me quiet a while to do so and i experienced that challange as very unique, BUT there is one big flaw in my opinion. Now this will be more of a Wake up call to the Creators than a Review. Sorry bout that but i dont really know where else to place this comment. When i connect very many resources and cities i totally loose control over what is happening and when why where and in which quantity my goods are beeing transported. Transporters start only picking up e.g. 3 of 300 possibly accessible goods of one kind in one spot and bringing them across the intire map while more of the same good is need elsewhere much closer. Also i experience a shortage of a good in one place while there is loads of that exact good just a stonethrow away and transporters are travelling form that one place straight to the other not picking up anything. CONCLUSION: GREAT GAME BUT! Either give us the possibilities to control what is beeing transported where in which amaount (if available) or dont take away that control from us and mess it all up. If i have a farm and oil plus oil procession available in an area give me the chance to tell the 'plastic factory' that i want it to use processed oil and oil only instead of sucking up all my crops while the population in town is not recevieng any food etc.  ",

The free play mode scenario allows you to pick your region (Europe or America); Terrain type (Flat, medium, hilly); and Start year (you can pick any 10 year from 1850-1990)  3. The game does come with a mod you can have in free play that make every thing in the game free. 4. The UI is a little confusing when you first start the game. (There is a tutorial that helps a little) 5. Building track can be a little clumsy, especially when building long stretches of track/road.  6. There are no AI competitor. 7. There are no Vehicle or train collisions.  Some of these things future updates will fix as well as the modding community.  If these have you on the fence still, wait for a few updates or a sale. I bought this game at full price and have no regrets.",

Awesome simulation, very nice AI for good routes, everything is working smoothly and looks really nice.   Yes, this game is maybe not for kids. There is a learning curve and its a game where you take a bit of time off and think about your investments, instead of randomly just building stuff and still creating a virtual profit.  Im in my mid thirties and i really find this an absolute blast. Lost a whole night yesterday, pondering how to get goods distributed and a plastic industry running. Simply put - I like the 'not killing but building stuff' genre a lot. Its good relaxation after a day of work and evening with kids.   In conclusion. If you still remember Transport Tycoon, if you do enjoy titles like Cityes Skylines, Simcity series, Banished, etc - its for you. If you seeks simple klick and profit and do not know what is a tape recorder, stick to your own, but also please keep the negativity to your self. Game too hard? Maybe your simply not used to thinking.  For me its a 10/10.",

UI was 'improved' so it looks modern but still lacks usability. The only thing which really got some love is production chains and cargo generations, but these are the things which must have been in old train fever game, not in the new one.",

            "review_text": "Edit after 48 hours in:  Still can't recommend and quite deeply disappointed now after reaching the later game.  1) Industries are behaving strangely. You are supposed to use long trains as the production can be up to at least 6400 units per year and when you best wagon carries 18 units, you see there is lot of wagon loads there. However, if the input buffers run empty, production ramps down very quickly. And when that happens, demand (industry is demand driven) at your raw material source goes down and it also starts reducing output. Net effect is that these 2 feed each others until your production hits 0 and you start again.  2) When a production plant, let's say for example tool factory upgrades, it resets the supply chain. So steel mill will gradually go to 0 and remain 0 until the end of that month. Naturally this damages your coal and iron supply and you are screwed.  3) One artic/semi trailer truck costs 305k and upkeep for a year is 54k. One train wagon costs 1.1 million (or was it 1.3) and costs 200k upkeep per year and carries only 18 units when truck carries 19. Also of course you need an engine for few million and with 800k upkeep per year. How are train supposed to be used other than in heavy duty long train - long distance haulage? Oh, but that doesn't give you the frequency needed which then feeds to the industry problem number 1, input buffers running dry.   4) To have frequent enough deliveries you need to bring something in all the time and then trucks are far better than trains. Except that cargo station are awful for a large amount of trucks and everythig slows down again with long ques around your cargo stations.  5) Stations have catchment area and cargo is automatically transferred to other station within catchment area if there is demand. But catchment area itself is not expanded accordingly. So, you can have train bringing goods in to a station, and part of it is transferred to truck station. Now, you need to truck it around the corner to feed those shops and industries in that catchment area. Effectively you'll end up with lot of cargo stations around the city to be able to distribute everything nicely. Which means more lorries, which means lot of problems with ques at your cargo stations.   All in all, game is not balanced and well thought at all and in these 5 samples you see the main frustration points and funnily old Train Fever was better balanced in many senses compared to this.   Also performance takes a nose dive when cities get big and you get about 5 FPS on average over big cities with GTX760Ti. There is lot of unnecessary high detail graphic content in this game which contribute to that. Nice, but i'd rather have well balanced enjoyable game with good performance than nice looking graphics on a game which is boring and frustrating to play.  --------- Old review after 2 hours of play under here ------- If you bought Train Fever, you know what to expect. Just like that, this game is poorly tested and is full of all kind of issues from crashing to lot of bugs and bad behaviour of the track laying tool. For example railway creates quite sharp uphill/downhill sections on both sides of the road to align the railway into road, and not otherway round.   New flexibility is great, but it also allows end buffers to be created in the middle of a station or anywhere else in the track and then trains run happily through them. Not game breaking, but shouldn't be possible either. Just a little sample of so called 'finesse' this game has.  Give it 5-6 months and check again when it is on sale.",

To me, this game is a better version of Cities in Motion 2 which I already enjoyed. Seeing your towns grow and become more modern (from pedestrians on paved street to modern cars usage on wide street) is an exciting feature. The goods production chain is excitingly challenging, having you wisely laying down highways to connect your industry and make sure the whole chain doesn't break.  I love the fact that the game doesn't force you toward one way of playing, you can choose to exclusively transport goods or to exclusively focus on passenger transport if you want to. You can only develop a boat (or planes or rail or bus) network and totally ignore the others. That freedom allows you to play many games that feel like complete difference experiences. And once you are familiar with what transport will be soon be unlocked, it helps you better plan your network and adds more depth. And if you want new challenges, simply switch to the other type of map (either European or American) and the transports will be different.  Anyway, endless fun for my coming months (years?)",

You'll probably start off small but, once you pay off your loan you'll start expanding into trains and air lines.

Also the modles are vary well detailed and the graphic are awesome. If you played transportation tycoon back in the day this game is a lot like it.

The game is based on the same engine and game mechanic and players of Train Fever will find themselves in a familiar situation. However, this game has improved and expanded upon its predecessor in many ways.  There are more vehicles, better graphics, more details, more modding capabilities, more types of transportation, more flexible track and street building, better GUI, Workshop Support, two campaigns complete with modding support for own scenarios, etc... Of course, some of the old problems are not gone completely. Sometimes, strange things may happen that are not always easily explained.  The game offers great capabilities for users to play it the way they like to play it. Starting from hard-on economic decisions down to a 'train set' replacement on PC, every player should be able to find their sweet spot. Modding allows a vast majority of new vehicles, buildings an asset to arrive on the simulated world of every player and leave almost no wish open. Of course, the devs cannot be praised directly for all the modded content. However, the game was developed to be modable right from the start, with many features only implemented to allow modification by the player. This also takes time and is better invested there instead of the devs creating more vehicles for the base game. So, I'm totally happy with the current situation here.  One of the big issues seems to be the performance. I personally do not have bigger problems with bad performance but I can confirm, that Transport Fever is definitely not the smoothest-running game there is ;) I can however see a good improvement of performance compared to Train Fever and I can also confirm first hand, that the devs are continuously improving the performance. Let's see, what the future will bring.   It is hard to write every aspect of the game and my personal pros and cons here in this text. People that now my videos on Youtube now, that I both love and hate this game. I am definitely no 'all-forgiving fanboy' and are well aware of the &gt;not so good&lt; parts of the game. However, when I look at the overall picture, I recommend this game and therefore, I give a 'thumbs up'.  To sum it up: every player that is into transportation games should at least take a look at this title. Transport Fever may not be perfect but it covers a lot and receives constant updates and patches from the devs and features an increasing number of mods in the workshop.     Buy  if you are into transportation games, or just trains, if your want to build your own transportation empire in sweet 3D graphics, are willing to learn to handle the game mechanics and invest time in understanding why things work the way they do (or just use the sandbox mode and be happy with it, which is also possible of course).  Don't buy  if you expect a perfect game without bugs and are expecting everything to be self-explanatory.   One last word: I received this game for free due to attending the closed Beta.

If youre expecting the same amount of AI and the huge number of tools at your disposal you will be misslead. This indeed is a fantastic transport game and it has a much needed new gen look to it than the originals. If you like to build railways and watch your profits grow or manage your own trucking line or even own a multi million dollar air line then this is the game for you!  A list of pros and cons will help i think.  Pros:   The Cargo and demand tree is great. I love how it works. Just like in real life you need to have consumers first before a product can be sold. Very much dependant on the consumers in this game. Make em happy? Make Money! Make em sad... and not so much.  Very nice vehicle models for a 3d game and a good amount of them. In fact i think more than the original transport tycoon and Open.  Good landscape for realistic route planning and tools to modify it. Makes it feel real.   A good game pace for learning the area and how things work early game and a fantastic pace for micromanaging even late game if you feel up to it.  A CAMPAIGN!!!! Not MIssions... A CAMPAIGN! With great voice acting to boot!   The ability for people to mod!!! This game will be great with the amount of content surely to be created!  Train routing (love snap route tracking for multi lines/roads) and signals are so much easier now!!! Its great. Try it.  The Cons:  No overlay for where people are going such as simcity 4 or cities skylines. Would be nice for rout planning.  No option for a depot drop off only. So as to move the goods or people (moreso the goods) to another form of transportation... was bummed about that. Will be testing tho for further insight if it does that automaticly tho.  Pop ups for stats are a bit hodge podge on the screen but managable through manual window snapping.  A bit slow early game but theres always a fast forward button... just saying people... use it.  A lack of Computer AI Opponents. But could be solved by MP or a patch that introduces some age old contenders from throughout the ages.  No gradient tracking aside from ground height realative to the cursor. (easy fix tho im sure)  Ill conclude there for now but overall i see this as a really good successor to many of the other transport games and it is worth a look or play. Everything they had set out to do for it was done! They didnt lie to us (as other recent developing studios have... hello games cough* cough*) and they did deliver.  There is always room for improvement on any game youll play. Thats a given. And based on their community involvment and their game portfolio, im sure they will love to expand on this game. Especially when theres other games that they can learn from and the passionate players that play them. You guys... So be nice, give some slack, a little feedback and most of all thank a game developer for a game that does what its intended to do! No supprises.",

Pros - Good graphics something rare in this genre - Attention to detail - Making profits is hard and thus challenging - Mod support already looks good - Love the way you can model the terrain while making tracks (If you disagree then you are using the build tool incorrectly, just connecting things end to end is not how to use it) - FUN  Cons - Some bugs during release (Black terrain, crashes etc issues which have workarounds if you look at the discussion page) - Few industry chains to work with - UI can be improved (I hate the window boxes opening at places hiding their close button) - Make stations more flexible/better - Needs more complex signalling for tracks - FPS drops while construction/destruction - Update the model for Airport - Don't like the freight docks and the way they work  Overall I would still recommend this game because the cons are mostly small issue which will eventually be patched up or modded.

My advice would be to save your money untill the game is fixed, I wanted to recommend this game as when it does work it is fun, but £20+ for a game that doesn't work properly is not worth it. If the game gets fixed I will change this to a recommend.  Edit. Changed this to a recommend now that the majority of crashes and bugs have been sorted out, well done Dev's.",

Yes, you can complain a bit about the performance and there are some areas with the UI that could use some polish and optimization but these are minor complaints.

This is SURELY the spiritual successor to Railroad Tycoon 3 (with a lot of Transport Tycoon too): Take that game, bring the graphics up to date and add other modes of transport and you have 'Transport Fever'. It even has huge helpings of humour!  RT3 was one of my favourite all time games. There may be elements that TF is missing (I believe there was a company shares dynamic? Perhaps the dev will add this later?) but that's made up for by a huge range of transport options as per Transport Tycoon of old.  The difficulty level is just about right and its quite easy to get carried away and go bankrupt if you extend yourself too much.  Just like TT, once you have got to a certain level of complexity in your network you feel a real sense of creative achievement.  Oh, and I LOVE the TT-esque multiple window interface with fully rendered real time 3D cameras of each unit, brilliant!!  Oh and the voice naration is perfect!",

Still has the most realistic track building I've seen in a game. You can't just build tracks straight up a mountain, you have to pay attention to slope and turn radius all of which impact the speed of your trains.  To be fair this is more of a refinement of Train Fever, which I spent way too much time playing, rather then an innovative sequel. Transport Fever fixes most of my gripes with its predecessor, while introducing a few new modes of transport. The graphics really look the same, and I suspect theres some optimizations still needed.  My only real gripe is the American Campaign. It doesn't seem like the devs have spent much time in america, as the entire west is protrayed as a giant desert full of outdated, somewhat racist indian jokes and other western stereotypes. The whole connect east and west scenario has already been done to death by earlier railraoding games like Railrood Tycoon anyway.  Euro campaign is off to a great start however and I am Enjoying it.   ",

I found out by the end of the week I couldn't let go of the game and that was enough proof for me to buy it.  Transport Fever is what I was waiting for ever since I played transport tycoon when I was in primary/grade school wishing for a sequel....it never came, until I stumble upon this release and decided to give it a try.  My conclusion, is that it is not only the best but the most endearing to the first modern revolution of indie gaming that started with transport tycoon, and because of that, it is today's benchmark for indie gaming.  The criteria for indie gaming lies in this game's pros: - Best music (Most people don't know but the secret to profound and impactful indie gaming lies in its ambient sound) - Best interface (Indies or indie gamers play for that casual kickback awesome feel, you do not want to be hampered down by having to learn the interface before you actually make progress in the game) - Best tycoon gameplay mechanics having largely borrowing and owing to transport tycoon's concept and pushing it even further: a) The maintainence cost for your transport assets are now gonna tear a hole in your shallow credit pockets. Oh no, im sure you will definitely end up borrowing a loan...don't take it personally, thats what a tycoon should be made to feel, especially when they are new, not the way transport tycoon did, a linear profit gain that is rigid and uninteresting b) The growing cities and evolving landmarks are finally brought back into an indie tycoon game...why were they never included in any other modern tycoon games to date is beyond my comprehension. Every business decision you make in the game will have an impact on the targeted localities but they are time sensitive, which means precarious building of transport systems are ill advised, they have to not only be gradual but also have to be precise. THAT is what a tycoon should be made to feel to achieve c) Not learning how actual transport system works, like railway lines WILL BE PUNISHING! However, fixing them is not rocket science...its simply high school logic. You'd have to use everything the developers have provided for you in the game buttons and construction options to make your railway lines work the way you want it to without endangering the lives of your employees d) Instead of cardboard papermache graphics, I can actually appreciate my worker for once sitting idly driving the ♥♥♥♥ I ask him to do to gain profit for both of us. Not only that, I can ask him to put on VR cam for me to see through his eyes even when its 1850. Not only that, I can even see the dumb asses who pay me the dough wait for years for a single bus on a single bus stop in a million acre radius. In essence, they pushed the boundary of what transport tycoon gave us in terms of graphics to include a little bit of personality into your tycoonians e) The line manager is a much needed interface add on to the transport tycoon based concept games. It fills a nice cosy tertiary role of keeping your ♥♥♥♥ together or clearing it off quick before it burns your budget - Best Sandbox Every tycoon game should have this...its retardish not to. What makes it the best is the inclusion of all the pros above with the freedom to do whatever you want and POV or follow cam even. Don't expect roller coaster tycoon of course...you want that, go get RCT 3 or something but its nice to have an indie feel in an indie game where you watch your ♥♥♥♥ do stuff whilst you admire the view and let the game progress.  Cons: - It did not offer those neat subcription offer missions in sandbox or free game mode that sort of act like missions in transport tycoon...that's too bad. I would have loved playing free game mode infinitely if I had random missions pop up like, ' Help transport us to that city, we pay you good for a year!' - No multiplayer?!! I mean its transport tycoon! Why would you not want to transport your friends silly side headed passengers and creepy goods?! Just ask your friend to pay up or side track their trains for good! Bahahaha  The cons weren't really a necessity for an indie tycoon game however they were those prestige hallmarks that would have made the game, wait for it.....",

It seems like a Railroad Tycoon-esque game in terms of mechanics such as Produce &gt; Industry &gt; City Supply, which is simple yet rewarding once you manage to set up your first sucessful trade lines.  It does feel from a novice point of view a little confusing at first, with the tutorials being more 'read and do' rather than the game 100% locking you out of features and adding them 1 by 1, kind of like taking your hand, which I feel would of helped me figuring out its mechanics at first, but after a good 10 hours of trial and error and plenty of lets plays on YouTube, i think I have just about figured most of it out.  I have a i kind of beefy computer, which surprised me as I encounter quite heavy FPS drops from time to time, mainly when laying rails. I also however encounter a permenant below 1FPS after a solid 3-4 hours gameplay, but for now thats nothing a quick save and game reload can't fix, so I'm not too worried about this.  So far, I am enjoying the game considerably. Other than the obvious performance issues, I would quite like to see some Cities Skyline type of addition, where you can freely place cosmetic assets to fill an otherwise empty landscape. An extensive map editor would also be an amazing feature.  I love these types of creative games more for the creative aspect rather than the management side of things, so any feature that would make this a possibility would be greatly received.

Transport Fever is basically Train Fever that changed its name and started selling again for full price. Seriously play both games side by side and the only difference you will notice is a million times more bugs in the renamed Transport Fever. At best you can say Transport Fever is a a DLC package that cost $35 and only adds airplanes, not counting the 1,000,000 bugs.   About every 10 minutes I encounter a 100% game breaking bug that takes me 20 minutes to find a work around to only repeat the process and that is not an exaggeration. Even alt-tabbing for more than 30 seconds causes the game to slow below 1 FPS until you relaunch. Also the game freezes for about 10 seconds every minute due to a poor autosave mechanic.  I would not recommend anyone to get this game at all or any game made by this developer as repackaging the orginal game with a new name and selling it for more is one of the shadiest things I have seen on steam and you will spend more time trying to get the game to work properly than you will spend playing it.

Pros    LOD has improved from Train Fever   BIGGER MAPS!   customization of vehicles   a more complex industry model   campaigns and tutorials   powerful track/road laying tools   better line management    Cons    clipping issues with planes and ships, and minor clipping in first person   low frame-rate going into late game   some missing textures   (kinda funny) spinning tailfin on the Dornier Do-B Merkur (bug)   stability issues   some campaign maps are buggy   I will edit those bullets as updates come out.  The missions are very unique with real-life history backgrounds, but with a little twist to change it up. Altough I fairly enjoyed the missions, some of them were a little confusing getting past some barriers. Europe Missions 5 &amp; 6 just to name a few. I had to 'cheat' my way through those by means that the devs did not intend. And some of them are also fairly laggy and unstable, but I did not experience any game crashes. Just some stuttering here and there mainly in Europe Mission 6. And mind you, I have a GTX 970 card, AMD FX-6300 (quad core) cpu, and 8gb RAM, so this game should run almost flawlessly.  They really beefed up the prices including the maintenance costs on the trains. You have to be very careful of how you use them. It is not hard to lose a lot of money in this game. (Tip: Passenger service will almost certainly earn you money, that is if you know how to properly set it up)  It will take some experience to get used to the game. Just give it some time and have an open mind when you play. Every game is different, and this one sure is from all the other transport games. If you can't seem to make money, just look up tutorials on YouTube, there are a lot of experienced players out there willing to share their ideas. Colonel Failure to name one of them, has a nice tutorial of how to be successful early on.  It is a true successor to Train Fever, which lacked some features that I'm not going to get into at the moment, you can just read the reviews there to find out more. I would definitely recommend this game, even to new players. The devs will be working out the crashes and stability issues over time. Have patience my friends!   Summary:   Rating: 7.5/10  Despite the clipping and some missing textures and minor stability issues, you can experiene a nice gaming experience which can get you lost in time.",

If I were to suggest a way to make things nicer, it would be to allow you to earn different medals on different playthroughs while keeping the old ones. Its extremely difficult to get all the medals in one run. But asides from that, I would gladly recommend this game to people who enjoy transportation and management games.",

            "review_text": "If you loved the old Railroad Tycoon games, or SimCity, Cities Skylines or Cities XL, this is the game for you! Take control of your own diverse transport empire, building trains, trucks, busses, trams, planes, pretty much any vehicle to haul cargo or passengers around the map and make your fortune. THis is one of those games you can sink hours and hours into, and the attention to detail and realism blows the mind! One of my favorite things about this game is that it is a transport simulator, not a city builder, so you aren't in control of placing residential and commercial units, but rather in charge of optimizing the transport of passengers and freight. As long as you lay roads in the towns, and do a good job of increasing goods coming into them, they will grow on their own, and it makes for an organic experience that you're involved in, but not totally in control of. This takes away some of the micromanagement aspects of games like Cities Skylines, but gives you tons of freedom to build things the way you want, and influence the growth of towns ina different way. I recommend this game highly to anyone who is a fan of this genre of game, and I feel like the devs are responsive to feedback as well, which is a big bonus. The tutorial could stand to be a bit more in depth, but everything makes sense once you understand it. There are loads of Youtubers making excellent videos on this game, so if you're stuck, that's a resource to take advantage of.",

            "review_text": "An Unpolished Gem.  Transport Fever is an excellent transportation tycoon game but it suffers from a lack of polish and refinement. The User Interface is a prime example. During the campaign - which is a fabulously fun series of missions based on well known historical events and figures - the objectives are listed in a panel on the left hand side of your screen. When you click on a vehicle, its information panel will very often open behind your objectives forcing you to grab the corner of the hidden window and drag it to where you can see what you needed to. Small oversights like this are an irritation but not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very enjoyable tycoon game.   Many of the issues that have been mentioned already have a corresponding mod to fix the problem. Don't like the time-scaling? There's a mod for that. Wish your oil well and oil refinery weren't so very far apart? There's a mod for that too. On top of the dedicated modding community the developers have also pledged themselves to supporting and further refining Transport Fever as time moves on.   Some people have compared this game to Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) but in my experience it has more in common with Sid Meier's Trains (which I rather liked). Some people have also complained that you have to complete supply chains or production will stop; i.e. You can't endlessly deliver logs to a sawmill without shipping the lumber. I find this complaint utterly ridiculous! How many planks will a sawmill pile up in the real world before they say 'We should really sell some of these before we buy another train full of logs...' !?   In summation, I truely believe Transport Fever is an unpolished gem. It is a very enjoyable game in its current state for those willing to put in the work and it holds immense promise for the future due to the continued support of the developer.   If you like tycoon games, trains, transport or struggling through crushing debt until you have your very own $75million to bore a tunnel clear through a mountain to connect the bustling metropolis YOU fueled with industry to the final tiny hamlet nestled high in the mountains...then this game is for you.",

Much like Sid Meiers Trains, it just seems to randomely generate resources across the map in ways that don't make sense. Two lumber mills spawn right next to each other and the only forest that spawns on the map is on the other side of the world. It doesn't make sense. I would have also liked the resource assets to blend into the map instead of being visualized as a square plot that is just sort of slapped down at weird angles. The maps just look too random and unrealistic in an otherwise very well visualized game. It kind of kills free mode for me. My only other complaint visually is the quality of the smoke.     ",

Trains just flip direction instantly. Theres no stations that are both cargo and passenger. ( even if its not realistic, they mentioned it was possible to make passenger and cargo stations, but yet no one has managed to do it. ) There were curved stations shown in a trailer, but thats only made from mods, and no one has done that yet. even though for some people it would be helpful to have it.  I think that the new update made the game alot better, and its more optimized too!  ( especially the memory leaks, its WAY better now! ) ( Also i can use 12k x 12k maps from this update! )",
