            "review_text": "Genre - Choose your own adventure  I was a lover of these type of books as I was growing up as they were a great alternative to board and computer games. This game tries to follow a similar platform but with a lot less reading and more art style.  There is no combat system so each choice will either lead to one of three lives lost or progression towards the end goal. You don't have an inventory, but certain interactions will benefit you later on, or decide your fate.  The first completion should be quite quick. However, there is scope to go back and try different paths for achievements but also the pure enjoyment of failing and succeeding by various means.  It doesn't take itself to seriously and the parodies come thick and fast. As the price is fair for what you get. It is worth grabbing for a quick slice of choose your own adventure fun.",

It's interesting to discover all the right, but also all the wrong paths, by selecting various options and waiting to see the outcome. There's a lot of unexpected turns, NPC's who can help, characters you can save or kill, even help them if you're willing... and all your decisions end up deciding what kind of ending you may get - if you survive to see it.",

I give a applaud to the authors of this game, but what confuses me is the scenes were all desicions either gets you to a new area or to the same area everytime. 9/10 otherwise. Good game ",

That said, the different ways you can meet your demise on this game do make you want to keep replaying and making different choices, just so you can see all of the different possible outcomes.   Tbf, £2 would probably be far less than what you might pay for a comic with this much artwork, so I don't think you're being hard done by when buying this game. Although you would expect a game to provide more play time usually, this is a pretty cheap game, and is still worth the money.   It is an interesting and enjoyable world that the game is set in. I found it entertaining, and so would recommend this game if you have the spare change burning a hole in your pocket.",
