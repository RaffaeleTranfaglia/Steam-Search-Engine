    "description": "Arma Tactics is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where you take control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it‘s up to you to decide how you will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives.",

Also, it's just a cheap port of a mobile game, so go figure.  If you're a fan of the genre, feel free to skip over this unless you really want another game to play. If you're new, it's a decent starting game, but I would still suggest trying to get into a better game like X-COM.",

            "review_text": "'Let's make a mediocre turn-based tactics game and slap the ArmA brand on it!' That's the game in a nutshell. It has nothing to do with ArmA and it doesn't even remotely offer the depth of an ArmA game.  The gameplay mechanics are pretty similiar to the new XCOM. Everyone of your soldiers has two actions per turn. You can move, shoot or use an item, reload your weapon, etc.. You can, of course, use both your actions to move further or take an aimed shot, too. Just like XCOM, it also relies heavy on the use of cover and just like in XCOM there is also high and low cover, high cover of course providing more protection. You also don't need to worry about ammo, as you have unlimited, but you need to reload, when you've emptied your weapons.  Items like grenades or explosives have to be bought before a mission from the armory. You can also upgrade your weapons or buy new ones, but be aware that you can only use one weapon at a time. There are only four weapons, btw: an assault rifle, a LMG, a sniper rifle and a shotgun. There are also no sidearms. You do have a knife though, which you can use in close combat. Your team always consists of the same four people. If anyone dies, it's game over and you can restart the mission. None of them is able to climb even the smallest obstacle. If you can't reach a place by walking, you won't get there.  Oh, and if you decide to restart a mission, you lose the items you have used. Yes, whatever you have used, be it grenades, medkits or something else, are gone and you need to buy them again, which is utter stupid. If you restart a mission you should get the gear, with which you've started the mission, back.  Now let's talk about the AI, shall we? They are incredibly stupid. They love to run out of cover and right at you. Quite often they even shoot with their first action and THEN come closer to you. I've also witnessed them running into cover with their first action and with their second action they ran out of cover again... Also more than once the AI wouldn't react to getting shot. They'd just stand there, doing nothing. They also seem to be deaf as they often don't react to gunshots, even if they should be in hearing range.  And the game seems to be quite buggy, too. On one mission I was teleported to the objective, while it was the enemy's turn, which pretty much broke the game, so I had to load the last save, which didn't help, because the game teleported me AGAIN. It did that also a third time, although that time it was actually my turn, which didn't help me much, because I was surrounded by enemies. Another time I healed a character from across the level. And another time one of my grenades landed UNDER the floor, where it exploded and did nothing. And while we're at grenades: it seems sometimes you can't throw them over cover for no apparent reason.  I'm not going much into the graphics, as the game is a mobile port, but it looks bad. It's pretty much the same with the sound design. The voice acting is pretty bad and the subtitles often don't match what they're actually saying. The camera is also quite bad.  All in all, this is a really bad game. If you really want a TBT game, you're MUCH better off with XCOM. And if you want the, imo, best in the genre, get Jagged Alliance 2. Combined with patch 1.13 this is by far the best TBT game you can get, even though it doesn't look like much nowadays.",

            "review_text": "Bought this game beause I enjoyed playing XCOM so much. If you liked XCOM and are wanting more squad focused, turn-based strategy then do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. The game does not flow well at all, no thanks to the poorly designed maps and an interface that leaves much to be desired. Your men get 2 'action points' per turn. However each AP is only worth about 5 feet of actual movement, combined with the narrow maps and you are left with your squad inches from each other at all times. The game has clearly been designed with close combat in mind, but when your 'highly trained' soldier constantly misses enemies literally 5 feet from him it just comes off as rushed and poorly put together. Combine that with the terrible voice acting/storyline and the cutscenes where characters talk without moving anything, let alone their mouth, and you are left with a game that is not only unplayable, but not worth playing in the first place.",

Apparently, these super soldiers are also expert computer hackers. So good, in fact, that they can actually hack into your game and delete your save files. Really crafty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, these super soldiers.  Hands down, one of the most broken games on Steam. BI's willingness to sell you this garbage is a pretty good indication of their integrity. Things might be different if there was a note from the developer on the store page that said something like 'Hey guys, this is a PC port of a mobile game and it's really, really broken. We don't have any plans to actually fix it, as you can see, but watching some of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ that happens in this game is still pretty good for a laugh so we think $0.50 is fair.'  LMAO!   No!",

Friendlies can spot enemies from a mile long. Is that behaviour equal to enemies AI? You never know. This is a funny fact: A guy in house roof can spot you INSIDE THAT house (bionic vision). That's nothing comparing to the fact that they can hit you indeed.  A friendly kill gives experience to the wrong guy. Enemies giving you their back can spot you. But, not always...
