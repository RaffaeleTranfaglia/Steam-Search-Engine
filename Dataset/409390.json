            "review_text": "an excelent example of how not to design a vr game.   opens with a camera move backwards to reveal the title/menu. So instnatly feels dissorienting. But it at least prepares you for how the rest of the game feels.   I bought it on sale because i loved marble madness. had i paid full price i would have been annoyed. It is unplayable for me and pretty much everyone i have shown it to. the camera (your head) moves with the marble, if the marbel twists and winds around a rail, you follow it the whole way, swaying side to side.   The dev has said they have attempted to make the movement system work for as many people as possible but the intro and the fact the camera is really locked to the marble says otherwise. hopefully one day they will make this game mor eof a roomscale experience with no forced movement or someone else will make that game, because right now i cannot recommend this unless you have no vestibular system.",

But the needlessly dynamic camera is a killer in VR. Should look great on my monitor in 2D, but not here. Even the menus are nausea inducing thanks to flashy camera movements.",
