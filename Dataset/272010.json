            "review_text": "If you have already made experience with RPG Maker games and found them decent enough, you will find this game decent. If you like these games, you will like this one.  A classic Top-down RPG game.  It shows it was not made with a budget to speak of. This is noticable from the beginning, as the 'Options' menu is the bare minimum. There is no resolution to choose from. Windowed is not recommended because of the resulting low resolution setting. The sound is also restricted to On/Off with no option to choose a specific level. Button remapping is also a thing dearly missed by me.  Still, i find it enjoyable. The story (2h in) is written well enough to keep me interested. Both keyboard and mouse controls are viable. Combat is simple with a classic turn based system.  If you are someone who needs a lot of options in the options menu and are more used to modern style games, you will be disappointed. But, If you are looking for a classic turn based RPG experience, I can recommend this game to you. It feels quite nostalgic.  I've also researched a little bit about this series and found out, that all parts of the 'Orbs of Magic' series (this is part 1 of 4) are already available for download at  amaranthia.com  for 10.99USD, though i recommed getting the game during a Steam sale or promotion, as the standard price is set a little bit too high.  In the end, it is a game made by only a few people, enthusiastic about old school rpg's and it shows.",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game with caveats. If you like 'old-skool' RPGs with turn-based battles and 16-bit graphics, then this just might be your thing. However, if you also like getting a complete game, then be aware that this is just a chapter in an ongoing series.  The interchange between characters was nice, but it wasn't frequent enough for me. The journal just contained basic descriptions of the main and side quests you'd undertake. However, not all side quests get logged, so, how do you know when that NPC is just yapping or if there is an actual quest to be had? I also found myself being lost a number of times. Where do I go, what do I do? I eventually had to resort to a walkthru. I used it as sparignly as I could. There is no widescreen resolution but controller support was appreciated. Combat was the typical pick your actions and then take turns.   For the most part I enjoyed this game. I'll look for the later chapters to be on sale and pick them up then. Overall, I'd give this a C+ or a B-. If the dev would make the journal better to include all quests and allow you to talk to your team members for hints as to what to do next, then I would have given it a solid B.",

Pros: Developed Story and World  Cons: Slow movement, overly large maps, combat bland  This game has promise, and the limitations may in part be the tool used to make it. If you are VERY patient with your RPG experiences, go for it. Otherwise try one of the others in indy RPG field.  ",

So I go to the options menu and find it's lackluster at best, yes or no kinda bad.  Once in the game it looks ... okay, I mean it's not bad. Just looks so standard and unimaginative. The tutorial is ... weird, you choose between keyboard and mouse controll and then completly ignores the other option even though you will use both methods. Once in the game it gets better, the gameplay is standard and so is the plot. Oh, and there is apparently humor.  All in all a okay game, even if it is a bit on the boring side.",
