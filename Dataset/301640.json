Even if you don't have friends , you should be able to finish the story and Horde without any problems.  All in all a good game , but you shouldn't expect something new since the genre is kinda overused.  See it as a fun game that you can play when you're bored from all the other stuff and you should have a blast.",

            "review_text": "For those of you that own NZA 1 &amp; 2, this game is a bit of a let down i'm afraid. I really enjoyed NZA 1 &amp; 2, but this one has fallen short. I'll run through a few things that I don't like with the new game: * They have removed the binoculars,.......making it extremely hard to find bottles of blood. * You can no longer climb up on objects/walls/vehicles etc..... * Skeletons have been made WAY TOO easy to kill. * Regular soldier zombies now require more shots to kill them because the aim is 'off' therefore using more ammo &amp; wasting more time...... * Rifles do less damage &amp; it's alot harder to get the 5-for-1 or 10-for-1 kills we used to get regularly in NZA 1 &amp; 2..... * Pistols do considerably less damage,...even headshots,.....the only pistol worth using is the Webley, but it has a low rate of fire &amp; reload time. Not even the Colt .45 does one-shot-kills, I've found myself firing two or even three shots to the head to kill enemies. * MG turrets are a waste of time &amp; again do alot less damage, which is a pity cause the MG-42 was a feared weapon of WW2, nicknamed 'The Buzzsaw' for a reason!.... * The fire soldiers that the Fire Demon spawns are WAY too easy to kill &amp; have been slowed down so they don't run as fast. * Searching corpses now wastes more time as you have to 'Hold E' instead of 'Pressing E' * The shotgun has had it's damage reduced &amp; is now less effective. * The cross-hairs on the Preacher are now bigger making aiming more difficult &amp; is now less effective &amp; does less damage. * Explosives do less damage. *Hoarde mode has a large annoying scoreboard that blocks a quarter of the screen *New colour palate has reverted to a green-ish colour, instead of the red hell-ish colour in NZA 2. *The 'kick' has been over-buffed so now in parts you just have to stand there &amp; kick enemies &amp; not use any ammo.... *SMG'S do alot less damage, the only one worth using is the Blyscawica, &amp; even then still does less damage than in NZA 1 &amp; 2.  So overall I think Rebellion has dropped the ball on this one guys, so save your money &amp; don't bother wasting it on this game. Even the 'new &amp; improoved' versions of NZA 1 &amp; 2 in this trilogy suck big time!......because of all the alterations. The originals are still the best.  'If it ain't broken,.....don't fix it!'........   Thanks for a steaming pile of crap Rebellion!........game deleted!  Waste of money! :(",

            "review_text": "What happens when you take a franchise based on stealth and percision elimination and pit players against a large, loud, and dumb cavalcade of zombies? Well 'fun' certainly doesn't happen.  Pros: + Decent variety of WWII weaponry. + Very atmoshperic. + Lots of collectables and 'chieves if you're into those things. AND TRADING CARDS! + The soundtrack that I've heard is well done but often looped. + Customizable difficulty tweaks. Seemed relatively balanced for my gameplay duration. + Playing with L4D characters reminded me that I have better games in my library I could be playing.  Cons:  - Levels feature short ranges, confined buildings, and lots of obscuring fog and smoke. Why the hell are you making sniping the focus when literally EVERY other attack I have works better in most situations? - Enemy variety isn't very inspired. Ranged juggernauts that need an insane amount of headshots to take down, lightning quick kamikaze style enemies, and the boring shambling Nazi zombies that are very rinse/repeat. I understand it's the zombie and sniper maxim to 'aim for the head', but frequently resurrecting non-headshotted enemies gets quite annoying. - Bad checkpoints. Often we'd have to restart a 30 minute segment because the enemies in the last 5 minutes would obliterate us. - Lots of weapons are blatantly better than others. While in the main Sniper Elite games, you might ditch the semi-automatic magezine loaded rifle for something with greater range and stopping power. Most all enemies die in one headshot and are within a joke of a range for a sniper: you have no reason not to take the M1 Garand / Carbine every time. Some secondaries and pistols are near useless as well. - Equipment is based on a stealth element. Tripwire, landmines, and dynamite that needs to be shot to be triggered. Only in the infrequent hold-out events (which give you probably 10-15 seconds to set up) are these defenses remotely useful. They were meant to gate off your sniping position in the main Sniper Elite games, but yield little benefit here. I'd rather just carry double grenades - There's nothing 'cooperative' about co-op. In games like L4D, co-op synergy is TIGHT. You rely on your team mates to heal you, scavange supplies for you, cover you while you accomplish objectives, revive you, kill enemies pinning you, etc. In this game, the only benefit to having a companion along is that they can revive you. I have the same amount of banal 'not fun' playing this alone as I do with friends. - Again. The sniper theme. WHY?! Who in the right mind would prefer a percision weapon when there are literally hundreds of enemies?! Extra mags for secondary SMG/Shotgun and pistol are heavily reduced. Sniper clips/bullets/mags are in sheer abundance. You're supposed to be using (scoped only) rifles.  - Bad net coding. I play L4D, Killing Floor, and now this with a group of Steam friends a few states away. Those former two games are MUCH more responsive when it comes to hit detection and third party animations.  I bought this 66% off for about $15, and even that was way too much for this game. Sniper Elite is ketchup, zombies are ice cream. They're fine on their own but you need to be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to attempt to mix them. If you insist on using outdated weaponry against zombies of a politically unfavorable preference, then buy CoD World at War or Black Ops 1. This game has almost nothing going for it.",

In a market that has become increasingly saturated over the years, mostly due to the ongoing popularity of Call of Duty's Zombie modes, it is refreshing to play something that feels so balls out ridiculous and designed purely for enjoyment.   There are no deep metaphors about the state of the human race, no morally ambiguous choices to make, just waves and waves of Zombie scum to obliterate in any means you deem fit. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a place for a deeper exploration of the Zombie theme in gaming, but it's just so refreshing to see something deviate so whole heartedly from that and pull it off without just seeming like a stupid cash in.   Obviously this is not a game that will suit everyones tastes, but if you have any kind of love for classic B movie zombie fare or just want to spend a few hours watching heads explode with a few mates, I can't recommend this highly enough.

First, this game is a spin off of the Sniper Elite franchise, where Hitler found a way to control the dead, so your primary weapon would be a Sniper Rifle where in other games will only work if you are veeeeery far from the horde, but here, the rifle has properties that make it the best weapon in  your arsenal and if you need to engage at very close quarters, you have secondary weapons for those situations.  Also, being a familiar of Sniper Elite, you have the X-Ray shots, that are a reward for making an exceptionaly long killing shot, showing where the bullet hit and also what organs you destroyed (nuts included). At the begining that looks very cool, but after, you¬¥ll switch it off because you¬¥ll be full of seeing shattered skulls a lot (if you have good aim for the headshot).  The game as the name sugest, are three games in one, making it a very long road to the end, that in my opinion, is a good thing, comparing it with games that you finish in 5 hours, and also a good cast of characters (including the cast of Left 4 Dead 1 and 2), multiplayer of 4 players and horde mode (also, for 4 players) it¬¥s just the icing in the cake, but after you finish the game, unless you have other 3 friends to play, the game is not going to see much action after that.  This is a good deal either if it has or not has a promotion, so, if you like zombie games, this is a good option.",

The zombies can carry random weapons like metal rods of any variaton and even limbs of others. There are 'special' zombies too. Suicide zombies, big dudes with a machinegun, skeletons...  Maps: ACTUAL GERMAN LOOKING TOWNS unlike other Nazi Zombie games *looks at Call Of Duty* The maps in this game, location and ambience, make this game feel so awesome. Especially when you know that the maps are german towns where it would make sense to have nazi zombies.  Missions: The missions i have played yet are mostly just walking through a map and killing zombies, while every once in a while a mini boss or a boss shows up. So that's a minus point. Maybe it gets more interesting further into the game. I'll update the review once i get further.  Playable characters: You can choose from eight players, 16 if you cound the DLC L4D characters. 8 male and 8 female characters from various countires, including an ex Wehrmacht Fighter. So the game really feels like a bunch of people just got together to fight to survive.  All in all, this is one of my favourite zombie games that exist.  ",

While your main weapon was a sniper rifle.(You must have good aim and good graphic card so that the game would not hang and all your shots will miss like crazy)  For what I like about this game, Firstly, I would really recommend the graphic and the x-ray kill shot but it gets annoying especially when you are fighting with hordes of zombie.   Secondly, There are different zombies in this game which make it more interesting(sucider, normal, skeleton, soldier elite/ chainsaw and fully armoured zombie) but this game will get bored after awhile it became repeated.  Thirdly, I would recommend gamers that really like nazi(HITLER FANS) but the finally boss is quite easy in my opinion.  Overall, I would hope that you will enjoy this game as I do. ",

Well i`d give it a 9/10  Audio-Both the Music and the Sound of this game are brilliant.I was thrilled by it while i was scoping out dozens of zombies.All 3 of the episodes had intense moments packed with an even more exhilarating music.  This one scores(From me) an 10/10  Gameplay:It`s the Sniper Elite Formula(but with Zombies),so you know its good(9/10)  Multiplayer:Sadly,this is where the game struggles the most.It came as a surprize for me that the game was almost shrouded in shadow(Expecially as the game was made by Rebellion,wich is not a small company),If it wasnt of the random gaming news channels that ussually uploads trailers for upcoming games i would never knew about the game(or at least i would have heard of it a lot later).This is why(especially mid week) the servers are mostly empty However if you have a buddy(or 3...that works too) and even some randoms you will have a lot of fun  If it wasn`t for the lack of players this game would have been better than it is now(and its still good)  8.5/10",

You shoot, you run, you get trapped by magic fog, but that's OK because you get to shoot Zombies in the head. Would you like to play an open world shooter where decisions matter to the story ? That's not this game, but you do get to shoot Zombies in the head. You can play in co-op mode, Shoot even more Zombies in the head with your friends. Turn on or off Friendly fire, your choice.  The Game is linear, it's 'old school' console man, meaning you can't save your progress, ever! Each time you start a level, you'll play without the resources you worked so hard to collect, no one knows why, best not to think about it too much. You have the Peta factor of playing thru a whole level just to get to the boss battle you quite last time because you were frustrated with being surrounded and thus couldn't shoot Zombies in the head fast enough. Ain't Old school charming, but; you get to shoot Zombies in the head.  There are zombies: Shoot in the head. Elite Zombies that shoot back: Shot in the head; a lot. Zombies with explosives: Shoot anywhere. Sniper Zombies: Ditto. Zombies en fuego: Ditto Zombies summoning other zombies: Shoot in the head. Overall, there is a lot of shooting, you can also kick.   It's an entertaining game, if a bit repetitive, It's not immersive, the story is as shallow as a Presidential candidate, but some battles are creative, you can blow things up, some zombies are on fire, and there is gratuitous Zombie shooting, in the Head.  Is it art ? alas no, but you get to shoot Zombies in the head.",

            "review_text": "First things first, this is the only version of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army that should be sold. Having the first two installments as individual packages not only narrows the amount of players in multiplayer, but also divides the market. I had previously purchased Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie, and I thought this would have all three as separate games. It's actually all three packed into one. The improvements are notable, however, it still seems unfair to those who bought the first games already.  This game is pretty damn fun, and for the amount of enjoyment it has given me alone I'd recommend this. Even if you own the previous two games already, this one is worth picking up for the modifications in the gore system, and all three campaigns in one. There is a Horde mode I haven't played much of, and so far it didn't seem to offer the same excitement that the campaign does, but I suppose I should hold off on judging that aspec of the game.  If you like similar games as Killing Floor, this one would easily be among your favorites. Mindless slaughter, although I will say the hitboxes do matter. So not so mindless as you should choose where you shoot your enemies. Head is most effective but you can dismember basically an entire zombie before you put it down. Chop off its legs, its arms, watch it crawl around for awhile, then pop it in the head.",

Reason is, in solo play, this game becomes tiresome very quickly, mainly because there is no real sense of progress, it's just 'move to this spot &amp; defend against the hoarde' over &amp; over again, only occasionally interrupted by a slightly harder to kill boss.  I know this sounds a little harsh, but at times this just feels like a glorified tower defense game.  On the positive side the bullet mechanics are really good fun, and the weapons have a good sense or realism, unfortunately you soon realise that there are onlyt a couple that stand out and are considerably more effective zombie slayers and this massively contributes to the games overriding sense of 'meh'  HOWEVER................... This game is spectacular fun in co-op multiplayer, which is why I'm going to recommed it - even tho part of me wants to say no To sum up, by all means get this if you love a social slaughter-fest with your chums, but if you are looking for a decent solo shooter, wait until DOOM is on sale &amp; get that instead",

I can't even figure out why the L4D chars were attached to this mess. Excessively linear 'story' mode. I've never played a game on such rigid rails. I think multiplayer could be fun if you know people, but don't expect to get in a PUG game. Everything I've read actually says the multiplayer servers are empty when there isn't a sale filling them with new suckers. Movement controls feel like your character is neck deep in quick sand, aiming is laborious and spastic at the best of times and god help you if anything gets inside of 10 meters because the close range weapons are garbage.  The environments are immersive and kinda pretty really, but the game mechanics shove it all out the window. This is a $5 game from that bargain rack by the checkout at your bookstore. Pay no more than that, ever. The only reason I'm not filling out a refund form right now is my very slim hope that maybe some day, years from now, some great modder will make a L4D total conversion lol.

I never had any of this trouble in left four dead 2 at all. They put in this idiotic mechanic that makes the bullets veer off with wind or whatever. How stupid! Wind doesn't make a bullet veer off in 35 feet unless it's almost a hurricane! They think you're back in the Revolutionary war firing muskets. Yeah, muskets veer off at that sort of range, but world war 2 weapons were made pretty well. They were accurate at short-medium range with light winds. Also the rifles completely lose reticles for about one second after firing. If you've ever been to a firing range and fired rifles, any good rifleman can fire off one shot after another in rapid succession into a smaller size target at 50 feet without missing. I know I can!  Conclusion: the game's not worth playing if your bullets are veering off at close too medium range. The aiming and firing mechanics are unrealistic and lame!  These firing mechanics would be fine if it was a pre-Civil War musket game.",

For instance, it forces you to conserve ammunition as much as possible but also it makes you use a variety of World War Two sniper rifles and each one has its own cons and pros. The most wonderful thing about it is that it puts you back into World War Two which we have not seen many people do anymore due to the whole idea of 'Nazi Zombies' being a sort of lost and dead item. It provides unique weaprony from World War Two and the maps are well thought out, long someitmes, and well detailed. The downside is that it uses the 'Mainstream' weapons of the Second World War, like the MP40, PPSh41, Thompson M1, etc.. instead of the common weapons like the MP38, BAR, Type 99, and other popular not well known weapons. It doesn't really give a decent variety on pistols and SMG varriants. Which yeah it is meant to be mainly a sniper game but at least let those who prefer an SMG to be able to get one and use it. Now the concept it wants to show is a wonderful idea. However, they could do more work to the game like adding a story, more dialogue with the characters and other things that really would make a difference. The Four characters go ALL THREE GAMES without speaking. A little strange isn't it?",

Then you throw in Zombies, which are also my favorite genre/theme of game. But then I've never played this game, nor really heard of it. I've played a few 'Sniper' games in my past and they've always felt more like a Metal Gear 'Sneaky Sneaky' mixed with a rail shooter, which are not my types of games. I prefer Left 4 Dead, H1Z1, etc. or pretty much anything that's more 'Free-Roaming' so naturally I passed over this game multiple times. But! Then I saw it had the Left 4 Dead players which immediately perked my interest, so I watched some videos and was immediately awestruck and ashamed I did not own this sooner. So through that confession I must say this game is a MUST OWN, especially if you like Co-Op shooters similarly to Left 4 Dead, it's 3rd person which I kind of like more in the end, and the graphics are well done, the gameplay is fluid and responsive. I cannot suggest this game enough, I've only played it 30 minutes and I know without a doubt this will consume years of time. Well done to the creators, I am sorry I judged before I played.",

And like any Sniper Elite game the good old x-ray camera returns. Watch as your bullet pierces through flesh, bone and brain as you kill zombies with headshot after headshot.  I'd be more than happy with this game if it just gave me zombies to kill, but there is also different types of zombies to contend with. You have the Suicidal Zombies which pretty much sound just like what they are. The Zombie Snipers which I love. And the Super Elite Zombie who scared the hell out of me the 1st time I saw it. And even Skeletons which I just love kicking apart.  There is a good selections of weapons to choose from to do your killing with. Rifles, Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols and a few explosives to boot as well. Enough to keep anyone who loves to kill zombies happy.

I've only played the first three levels of Chapter 1 but so far amazing! -The mood is great.  -I really enjoy the long levels, each one takes me about an hour and gets a bit longer with each level after.  -Combat and shooting is awesome with a great variety of weapons from WWII.  -Story is a bit entertaining. -The levels are really cool and well made. -I got scarred a couple times when the zombies horde up right in front of me and i'm low on ammo... -or when they jump out in front of you. -I feel like I'm playing through a really intense book or movie. The action shots are a very nice touch. ",

Single player is decent but really the game shines in co-op. It's really a shame that not many people play this game anymore, it's sometimes a miracle to find a session.  But in terms of quality, it is definitely a recommend even though the fun factor is stifled with an almost dead community.",

This is the next best thing to a zombie horde game to be completely honest! I've only put in 4 hours, but plan to get in several more with other pals of mine on this. The combination of WW2, zombies, sniping, and co-op is beyond awesome, and it's 100 times better playing with your friends. Not sure about the price of it though, I feel 45 bucks is a little steep for the game for all that it offers you. I'd call it more of a $30 at most. But if you find it on sale for 9 bucks, it's a total steal!  10/10 would ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• zombies again!",

You won't find the story very deep or thought provoking, but that's not what it's about. I'm loving the gore and the graphics. Headshots are what count in this game, so you have to be very accurate with your shooting. The combat is good overall and the environments are outstanding. I don't know if I'd spend $45 on it, but it's a bargain at it's current sale price. Go for it!",
