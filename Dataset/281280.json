Mashed is a racing game where the main objective is to  win other cars by distance or by destroying them . Each racing session is composed by rounds where each round gives/takes points depending on which place you've ended on the respective round, the first who gets its points bar full wins the racing session. If you lose and the round is still occuring, you can airstrike others until the round ends.   This game is a blast of a fun!",

I would recommend getting that version on said platform.  The main problems with this game on this platform is that it's an outdated version hence the title. The port is a complete mess as it is unable to keep a consistent frame rate.",

            "review_text": "YOU KNOW THOSE FUN GAMES THAT PEOPLE CALL 'DESTROYER OF FRIENDSHIPS'?  this is one of those, the game is highly competitive due to the weapons in the game and how they can be used is entirely to your imagination, you can either rely on sheer skill or just be a ♥♥♥♥ to your friends if you want to, either way sometimes it won't always feel like your loss in the race is justified, but it will, trust me, just be really competitive int his game otherwise you're screwed, if you want a mariokart-esque kind of game for stem then this one is the game you're looking for. Also there is an anti-butthurt system in the game, if you die before your friend int he race you start playing as the camera that lets you lock on on any caracter in the race that you want and shoot a homing missile at it, so if you feel you got screwed over or trolled by that friend of yours, you can exact revenge, expecially considering that there is no limit to the amount of times you can use those missiles, so trolls, beware for butthurt gamers. A cheap fun game, what more do you want, get it, get it now, it's not like you can't afford it.  8/10 I gave it an 8 because despite it's competitiveness the game is just plain fun to play and easy to pick up too, unfortunately there is no online multiplayer option sadly.",
