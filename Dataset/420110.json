Secks. - An actually decent plot that gets surprisingly emotional at times. - Heroines that change as the plot progresses. - An uncensored patch exists. And IT'S GLORIOUS. - Sayori drew this. And Sayori is amazing. - Good music. - Gorgeously animated.  Cons:  - Sexy time costs extra - Sexy scenes lag if you have a crappy computer. - ♥♥♥♥ mosaics - You can't seduce Cinnimon until the next game comes out.  Overall, I highy recommend this game for not only the cute anime catgirl booty, but also for its dynamic plotline, beautiful visuals, and its lovely pair of heroines. Paying extra for the mating sessions is sort of lame though.",

Heck I'd be fine with catboys, as long as they looked like Felis or Schrodinger, then that'll be fine too.   I liked the petting function, the story was not bad, some of the dialouge was pretty cringey at times but you look past it when you see the cute catgirls. Chocola is as dumb as nails (bless her heart) and Vanilla is your 'Rei' type, quiet, snarky but cute when she wants to be.   The other catgirls? Coconut is just a butterfingers and Azuki is the [insert Loli] character with an attitude and I forget the others, they get like one line, Maple is just a pervert, but I like that ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) .Personally I don't see the draw to Chocola or Coconut, Vanilia is hands down best neko.

            "review_text": "I got to feel Coconut's Coconuts ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  So I am not one to normally do reviews but I thought I should make an exception for this so allow me to begin with a quote from the game itself.  'I want Master to completely fill up my baby bakery with his man batter'  Is this what they meant by the term 'heartfelt catgirl comedy' because the whole thing is filled with other crackers like that. So Nekopara is a animated VN that if you are on this page you already know about and at this moment in time is one of the top rated games on Steam. But what has changed from the first game and prequel? Well nothing much apart from the petting feature has returned and you can even pet the catgirl that you met in the first game now. The story now focuses on 2 of the different catgirls all though Chocola and Vanilla are still given their fair share of time.   So I am a sucker for stories that can be emotional and surprisingly for what is considered a 'single player game so you play with yourself' game that is what is you get, these emotional scenes typically come about after the 18+ scenes when the protagonist is bonding? With the catgirl who he has just spent the past 25 minutes inside of.   Now the 18+ scenes that is what most of you are really here for.  Straight off the bat there has been an official 18+ patch that can be bought which is a nice change from the previous games. And the scenes themselves are.. good quality? I honestly don't play a lot of VNs hell I rarely even review games. I started referencing Nekopara in an ironic way but then it just sort of became something that stuck with me.  So should you buy Nekopara? Well if you don't mind appearing offline for the time you are planning on playing it and if you are prepared for any 'what the ♥♥♥♥ are you playing' questions then yeah it is a pleasant little VN with an average but nice story with a few twists and turns which are predictable no doubt but still nice enough to not come across as too cliche, and the 18+ scenes are well put together as opposed to being crammed in without any warning.   I can't wait for Volume 3 to be released so I can be a huge let down to my friends and family even more! ",

The story is a lot better this time around and seems to give a lot more depth to the two girls than Vol 1 did with Chocola and Vanilla, that's all I really have to say about the SFW part of this.  Playing this with the +18 patch is really where the game comes to life, mainly because we finally get to see scenes where there are actual fat cat tats to jiggle around and really make use of that bounciness slider I assume every last one of you want to smash up to full like myself. The lewd parts are better this time around purely because there are actual cat tats bouncing around and being quite aesthetically pleasing, I also believe the quality of the CG's has gone up.  Overall, this one is better than Vol 1 and Vol 0 combined. Shame we have to wait another year for Vol 3...  ",

It shows the busy life of his now highly rated bakery, and thats where our 2 new very loved cat girls come into play. Coconut and Azuki. Ill start with Coconut. She had a very good story about being a clumsy kitty, but over time with kashou's 'special' training, they get right too it. Her sex scene was pretty intense, and I would highly reccomended it if ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s/ titjobs are your thing. On the other hand, We have Azuki, a tiny petite girl and the oldest of all the cat girls. She was spoiled by Kashou in this volume and oh man is she cute. She is near the end of the story, by my god, her sex scene is SO worth it. I will hope Nekopara vol 3 comes out soon so we can complete our Cat Girl Harem. I Highly reccomended you try this , and dont forget. Download the adult patch, Please.",

A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost.

And Coconut suffers from lack of confidence and admires Kashou also calling him 'Brother'.  It's the usual like in the first one you get to read, pet and have intimate releationship with the girls(Patch required!).  Overall very well produced and delivered. I quite like it. Though I felt that the story didn't center around Coconut much. Felt like she was a subject to be had but a quick one. Skipping over to more favoured Azuki. But both had their moments.",

Hopefully it's fixed in the next few days, but please be aware that this steam version does contain that bug  **FIXED**  9/10, for not including Maple in the big four. Would totally buy 20 copies for that.  EDIT: Wow, after completing the game, it feels alot shorter than vol 1.

This time, the visual novel shows a more attention to some of the other catgirls, mostly being Coconut and Azuki. Vanilla and Chocolat still have their own scenes, and also comment on not being given much attention. You can now interact with the catgirls, just like in Nekopara Vol. 0, and there seem to be new facial expressions as well. If you want the adult version, you may buy the adult patch from the official website for $10. The game is well worth the $10. It's a heartwarming story about a guy with his little sister and catgirls running a bakery.",

(hoping for a Vol 4 as well &gt;3&lt;). I also want to say that I give Nekoworks a big thank you for keeping a somewhat steady pace of Chocola and Vanilla content (especially in the first chapter with that 'scene' (¬ ͜ʖ¬) ) throughout Vol 2 as I expected Vol 2 to be entirely focused on Coconut and Azuki and ignoring the other Nekos but there were still many scenes with Chocola and Vanilla which I'm really happy to see because they didn't forget about the two best nekowaifus &lt;3. Overall there's a lot of content from Chapters 1-6 but the only thing that I was unsatisfied with Vol 2 was the final chapter, Chapter 7 as I felt that they just completely toss Nekopara out the window because that Chapter was extremely short and it's 1 chapter off of Vol 1 since Vol 1 had 8 chapters instead of 7. I want more content in chapter 7 (I apologize for being greedy) instead of a complete goodbye for now because Vol 1 had 8 chapters and a fitting ending that was really touching to my heart and feels, in my opinion Vol 1 is the best out of the 3 avaliable volumes (0,1,2) atm, probably because i love Chocola and Vanilla the most &lt;3. I just felt ripped apart seeing the difference between Vol 1's ending and Vol 2's ending as Vol 1's ending was really developed, thought out and it gave me the feeling that I was Kashou in that moment wanting to find my two nekos that love and adore me more than anything in the world ;w; (OK I CRIED AT THAT MOMENT IM SORRY CHOCOLA AND VANILLA ARE MY WAIFUS) tho like any other Visual Novel that has a male protagonist with no voice, i'm assuming Kashou is suppose to be the reader which is me xP, while Vol 2 was imo a simple goodbye for now as Vol 3 is coming obviously. 10/10 of course with the patch as always XP, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Nekos and Visual Novels as Nekopara actually has the characters move in their Visual Novel which is the unique trait about this series since most Visual Novels just shows the characters standing in one place. I'm looking forward to Vol 3, the anime adaptation and Vol 4 possibly? Please? ;w; (I don't want this series to end after Cinnamon and Maple becomes Kashou's catpanions in Vol 3, I love Chocola and Vanilla so much ;w;) Anyway thanks for reading my long review of Nekopara, even though it may sound that I'm not apperciating Nekowork's creation of Nekopara by my criticism earlier of how I felt that they 'toss' Nekopara out of the window by giving us a short Chapter 7, I'm extremely grateful that they gave us this wonderful visual novel that I will always revisit and never get tired of. (This is the only Visual Novel that I never get tired of actually kappa.) Chocola and Vanilla will always be the first and only true catpanions for Kashou, i mean for me of course &gt;3&lt;.",
