            "review_text": "Small fish beat bigger fishes, get DNA and food, breed bigger fishes (and warships?) then goes on to conquer the whole world! There is even a surprise after you beat the 'last boss' as game changes from conquering everything to another mode.  Gameplay varied but basically you pilot a fish and direct a fish school (and/or crustaceans) and fight off enemy fishes. It can be seen as a third person bullet hell of sort, Control is underwater which gives it a fluidity and gravity that’s different that airship vehicles games. There is strategy involved in using skills, motions, and allies.  The best thing in the whole game, to me, was looking at my crabs shedding their skins to regenerate, lol.  Thing of it as the best fish shooter out there!  -Lost",

            "review_text": "I know I only have about 30 minutes played on this account. But I played a good hour or two while at a friends house.  So what is this game? Well. You start by choosing an animal that represents you. A sardine... A salmon... Or the mighty crab. You go around with your squad of fish, shooting lazers at your enemies and taking over their reefs. When you kill enemies you gain different types of materials that you can use to breed different types of animals for your group. Each type have different stats and weapons, so theres a reason to try out different combinations of creatures.   It's a fun silly game. Reminds me a lot of Tokyo Jungle but in the sea. The complaints I do have though is that, since the game is REALLY Japanese. Some of the translations are bad and the controller support isn't great. The performance of the game also seems pretty poor with how basic of a game it is. Other than that. Really fun and simple game.",

            "review_text": "As if the first installment wasn't disturbing enough, NEO AQUARIUM go and drop a second seizure-inducing bombshell.  If this is a ♥♥♥♥ idea gone too far, then it's the best ♥♥♥♥ idea for a game I've ever played. It takes a degree of creative talent, to immerse a player into the perspective of a lowly Red Frog Crab, Scittering frantically across the sea floor in search of food.  And then, it takes a degree of 'ah, ♥♥♥♥ it', when immersion is told to promptly ♥♥♥♥ off because I want my crab to shoot phaser beams out of it's face and rip it's legs off into homing missiles, to blast the living ♥♥♥♥ out of a squadron of plankton-firing sardines.   Ace of Seafood delivers exactly that, with the added touches of authentically poor japanese-to-english translation, graphics from a time gone by and so many glitches you'll believe that they're meant to be in the game.  Become an Ace of Seafood, don't let your dreams be dreams",
