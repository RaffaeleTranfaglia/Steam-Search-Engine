            "review_text": "Tribloos 2 is a very unique and nice puzzle/management/action game. It's hard to describe because not many games are like it.  In Tribloos 2, you control Tribloos throughout the game and assign them to different tasks: Reparing pipes, harvesting wood, using the sawmill, harvesting scrap, harvesting crystals, building houses... There's at least 30 different types of buildings to make and items to harvest or process. The game contains 10-20 hours of content, 75 story levels, 15 challenge levels and 5 bosses.  You can play at your own pace because the time limit is only there if you want to get gold times to showoff that you completed the levels very quickly. This means the game is suitable to almost any kind of players&nbsp;and you can take your time!  What more can I say... The game features about 15 well-made soundtracks that plays throughout the game, the story is fun to read, the game is really fluid; overall it's worth the purchase!  To anybody that was looking foward to buying this game, it really gives you enough content for the price!",

I'm thinking about finishing it up since they have added Steam Trading Cards since I put it down. It's a cute time management game with a story line to it. I can't speak for how good the story is since I never finished it. For all I know everyone blows up at the end. If you can get it for a few bucks and like time management games, I reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "This is a really nice game about building, well buildings, and other things. Often buildings have other buildings as requirements so you have to build those first. This may result in some complex build orders in later levels.  This game is a race against the clock but just for bonus points, so if your timer runs out before you could finish a level you will just lose some bonus points which is how it should be.  There are some broken pipes in later levels... those are rally annoying but aside from that this is a great game with a cute story and a definite recommendation from my side.",
