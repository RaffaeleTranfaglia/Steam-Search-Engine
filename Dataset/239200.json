            "review_text": "There is a lot of people that hate this game, and I know why:  TDD was a fad. The game became popular because of one thing, and one thing only: it was scary. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands likely bought this game because they wanted to get scared; they wanted a joyride complete with overwhelming fear. I don't blame them. The game is pretty scary, but here's the thing:  It seems that most people do not understand that Amnesia, and the games before it, were not just haunted-house amusement park rides like they like to act like it is. No, it's a lot more than that. The game has thick atmosphere, superb pacing and storytelling backed by a very dark story that keeps you curious from beginning and even to the end. To be able to truly appreciate TDD, you need to look further than the scare factor; it is not the only thing that made the game great. Guess what the Chinese Room capitalised on? The story. They wanted to tell a story, much like TDD did. MFP was much more of a psychological experience; the game did not need to scare you with darkness or spooky monsters, all it needed was an incredibly wicked story. This was fulfilled. I expected an atmospheric, thought-provoking horror experience that would keep me on the edge and this is exactly what the game did.  But what did everyone else expect? Probably something entirely different. They probably just wanted to get scared. Most of the fanbase is filled with people that appreciated TDD for nothing more than its scare factor, and therefor this is all they had expected from MFP. They are probably the kind of people that either skipped or skimmed through most of TDD's note readings, not givng a ♥♥♥♥ about the backstory whatsoever. They just wanted to get to the next 'scare.' The bad reception for this game purely comes from delusioned expectations, is what I believe. Horror is a much deeper genre than you'd think. Read up.",

            "review_text": "Play for the story and the creepy atmosphere. No horror game excels Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in those regards.  IMPORTANT NOTE to anyone who has played Amnesia: The Dark Descent:  Please do not take this game as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. What many people do wrong with this game is that they go with the mindset of the previous Amnesia - going for the horror.  Now, I'm not saying it's wrong to play horror games for the horror in them, and it definitely is not a surprise why people think of this as a sequel, what with the blaring 'Amnesia' in the name. However, while the game does make an occasional reference to the original, it's significantly better to think of this as a stand-alone game.  Amnesia: The Dark Descent was made by Frictional Games. They have made a name for themselves by bringing back the horror in the horror genre. Their games have that creeping atmosphere that you can never be rid of. From Penumbra: Black Plague onwards, they took a theme of defenselessness, which definitely has been a big asset.  Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was made by The Chinese Room. When Frictional Games thought about making a sequel to the Amnesia series, they decided to have an other company make it instead. Being impressed by Dear Esther, they approached The Chinese Room for sharing similar mindsets in their game development. Frictional Games did not want The Chinese Room to make a game that is similar to the original, they wanted them to make a game in their own way.  Two different companies make a game of the same world, with the same theme. It's obvious there'll be differences.  From Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, you'll get to experience a creepy, gross, horrifying story of a mad man trying to redeem himself. From Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll get a full-blown horror blast in your face. Scrreeeaaaam.",

            "review_text": "Oh man. This game is such a dissapointment. If ''The Chinese Room'' didnt get involved this could've been so much better. They didnt try to make Amnesia 2, they tried to make a sequel to Dear Esther.  I loved the story in TDD, it had the perfect balance between gameplay and story. This one is more focused on the story but I couldn't really get into it because it's so effin boring. There was not a single scary moment in this game and the 'monsters' you'll face later on are no threat to you and you can just casually walk past them. Your character is never in any actual danger. You couldn't check your sanity; tinderboxes and oil didn't exist. You don't have an inventory so don't even bother exploring. But why mention it? You can't do that anyway since every door in this game is locked unless you have to actually go through it. If you loved grabbing random sh*t in TDD and throwing it at the enemy or just against a wall - you can't do it in this one cause everything is locked in place.  The nerve wrecking atmosphere from TDD is completey lost, you don't have to worry about oil for your lantern cause it is unlimited.   I quit the game 3 times but I kept giving it a chance because I WANTED it to be good but there is really no hope for this. A Machine for Pigs is a complete let down to every The Dark Descent fan. The fact that this game is 3-5 hours long is a joke. So I will say this: This is one of the worst Horror Games I've ever played in my entire life. It's not even worth a 1 out of 10 so I won't bother rating it.",

Sure it's not as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descend, but still, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a brilliant game. First of all, it is story-rich and has an awesome plot, although the story might be a little difficult to understand if English isn't your first language.   Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a very enjoyable game that is both scary &amp; story-rich. Sure, it's got its flaws like every other game such as being very boring in the beginning (Doing almost nothing for the first 1.5 hours) but Frictional Games, teamed up with the Chinese room has created a good game. However, the absence of the 'sanity mechanic' somewhat makes this game 'incomplete'.  If you like really good stories, mixed in with some horror, then this game is for you.   I'd give it a solid 7.5/10   PS: 'SPOILER' I wish we had the choice at the end of the game, of either destroying the machine, or let it do its job and 'save' humanity.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I think people are too hard on this game.   Is it as scary as Amnesia: Dark Descent? Not necessarily, but then Dark Descent was such an unexpectedly delirious and exhilerating experience. It was a surprise. The difference with its sequel is that people have been expecting A Machine For Pigs for a while; based on those expectations, some were disappointed.   I was not. A Machine For Pigs doesn't need to be as scary as Dark Descent. Of course there are plenty of moments in that game which made my blood run cold, such as the infamous chase through the flooded Archives with a monster snapping at your heels, the damned Prison area which gave me plenty of mini heartattacks, and just the growl of those disgusting monsters. Yet I remember only a few moments from that game, which to me are not as important as the overall experience. What was the most scary for me was actually the story, and learning about Daniel. At the beginning, he's a man that drank the Amnesia potion to make himself forget the horrors the Baron had inflicted. But of course, as we descend deeper into Brennenberg, we realize the truth. Near the end, I wasn't even sure Daniel deserved to be saved (which is why the three different endings pleased me so much).   A Machine For Pigs has a story that is just as good, and in some respects, better than Dark Descent. It has its moments too, but A Machine For Pigs is all about how it leaves you feeling than the individual moments you can remember. The core element of discovering the story through notes, and the journal entries of Oswald, is still there. We learn he's a drunkard (wine is, after all, its own form of Amnesia). We learn he's a butcher. We learn he wants to be more effective at butchering through the use of technology. We learn his wife died in childbirth, which clearly has a bad affect on his sanity (like a true madman, he wants mmotality, and creates a machine to that effect). He apparently wants to save his children, and is guided by a vaguely familiar and sinister voice over the scattered telephones. His journal entries are distrubing enough, littered with contempt, hatred, anger, dispair, and revolting descriptions, all which offer a glimpse into his deranged mind.   You really need to appreciate the briliance of this, along with the other core elements that made Dark Descent amazing, which A Machine For Pigs definitely has: the sound, the constant oppressive and immersive atmosphere, the music, the voice acting, and the mystery. Despite the tension which keeps you constantly on edge, you want to keep exploring the machine. You feel compelled to descend further down, past the scraping metal, the wails of steam, the screams and groans of the machinery, the flickering lights, the thick, putrid smell as its often described, the pulsing of the engines-A Machine For Pigs does a fantastic job of creating the setting. The fact that I felt no relief when I was briefly outside is also a testament to that accomplishment. The rain slicked and gloomy London streets offered no breath of fresh air.   A Machine For Pigs is memorable for its hauntingly beautiful settings. Now, one of my complaints is that there is not really a sense of urgency. That's practically a requirement given the premise, but unlike the constant fear of having the Shadow chase you in Dark Descent, A Machine For Pigs takes its time delivering on the scares. To be sure, there are scares to be had, and there are a few jumpscares right from the very beginning. The urgency comes in bursts, mostly from being chased by the grotesque pig-men. The puzzles are mostly unnecessary (like the Sanity meter in Dark Descent, which did little more than blur the screen) and mostly frustrating.   Interestingly, while I was playing, I couldn't stop thinking of Pink Floyd's video for Another Brick In The Wall. That's totally a good thing! I also couldn't shake the eeriness, the dread. The disgust, eventually, because just as I felt ultimately repulsed by Daniel, Oswald proved to surpass even Daniel's selfishness and brutality. That's why A Machine For Pigs is so good, in my opinion: the sum of its parts is an experience worth your time and careful attention.   The blood splattered walls of the factory where the pigs are slaughtered take on an even more vile nature when you read Oswald's diary because his descriptions of people, often as 'swine,' sends chills down your spine. Pigs are closest to humans, biologically speaking. And Oswald's pursuit of fortune, and of leaving a legacy which survives flesh and bone is accomplished without scruples and through ruthlessness which makes Daniel seem like a saint. His creation is the machine, and the setting of Industrial Revolution era London, with all of its distinct British cruelty, child labour, capitalism, and new technology is simply perfect to tell a story that is fundamentally about greed. And the bloody path we carve to sate it.  And there are scares. Some require a bit more thinking and putting the pieces together, some require running away and hiding, some can make you yell and flinch away from the screen. It's good we don't have to gather oil for the lantern (it runs on electricity now, anyway) or that we need to gather an inventory because I think in this context, it would become tedious. Instead, we can focus on the atmosphere, story, and the scares. We can get lost in the growls and squeals, the heavy, incessant labours of the machine, and simply unravel the insanity within.  So is A Machine For Pigs scary, all in all? That depends on your definition of scary; it will scare you when and where it's supposed to, in a heart pounding, sweaty hands sort of way. Think of it as a rush, a wave of fear that crashes into you, whereas Dark Descent was a constant flood.   Yet instead of comparison, we should enjoy A Machine For Pigs rather as its own unique, interesting, and dark vision of human nature. So I think the real question should be: is A Machine For Pigs horrifying? And the answer is absolutely. That is the point, after all.    Truly, I am not a fan of horror. I was intrigued by Dark Descent because my friends wouldn't shut up about it, with good reason. Dark Descent became the game which urged me to consider some other ones, and Dark Descent quickly became my favourite horror game, with Outlast being a very close second. I've found that the genre is deeply rooted in all the sorts of sad, brutal, sick and twisted ways humans strip away their humanity (usually by trying to become more than what we are; most of the time, the sacrifices aren't worth it). This game is no exception.   A Machine For Pigs is certainly deserving of sharing the same panicked breath with Dark Descent.",

Pros: + Capable control system + Simple dynamics, allowing storytelling to take centre stage + Unique story &amp; setting + Excellent musical score  Cons - No innovation over Amnesia: The Dark Descent - Short Playthrough (my play time is the full game, including replaying two chapters when it crashed) - Unthreatening enemies - very few scares or threats - Unchallenging puzzles - Dated graphics - A few technical issues (Two crashes on playthrough, gamma settings altered on system after game closed)  Overall there's nothing amiss with this game, but it's not particularly worth playing if you've already experienced Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The storyline never felt compelling enough to push me forwards, the twists were predictable, and I never felt particularly threatened, scared or under pressure.",

            "review_text": "First thing's first - I don't understand the angry rant about this game. People literally drown it in pig♥♥♥♥ while other really crappy titles manage to get away. Often the reason why players hate AMFP is that they beleive it's far worse than the original Amnesia. I suggest you should consider these two as completely different games. The Chinese Room (the developer I put highest hopes on and will defend) did their thing. OK, they got rid of core Amnesia gameplay elements (lantern oil, thunderboxes), but I think they did it for the good sake of the story. For story and atmosphere are the basis for Machine For Pigs. Storytelling is just plain dark, almost pitch-black and somewhat Lovecraft-ish as it's predecessor. Game is sophisticated as it is asks global and complex existential questions. Ominous atmosphere is here allright, driven by classy frightening sound desing and music. And YES, this Amnesia is scary - not too scary, but still.. Although it's hard to terrify a Survival Horror vet like me, AAMFP did that. And this what I ♥♥♥♥in' expect from a horror game! Ain't no need to throw ♥♥♥♥ at gamer's face, more of that - no need to drop them off their seats. Freeze them on the spot so they are afraid to move a finger! That's the real horror. And here's the thing some will consider DarkDescent-blasphemy: maybe removing oil tanks, thunderboxes and difficult puzzles was necessary for this particular project, like blinding a man makes his hearing sharper. Cutting the gameplay elements allowed story and setting take the spotlight. IMHO it's better than solving riddle after riddle after riddle in similar tunnels in Penumbra: Overture. Amnesia AMFP isn't an interactive movie though - you do things besides walking. I will however admit it lacks some hard puzzles. And dying. Yeah, I dropped dead TWO (!) TIMES. Anyway, it helped me to percieve the story better. Game's not short too - if you take time and won't charge your ♥♥♥ forward you'll get your healthy 8 hours as I did. To summerize, game's great, all I've expected from the sequel. Dark Descent fans should give it a fair chance, I think. Bare bones of the franchise, huh? Hell of a skeleton then.

The game is also set in the same dark and twisted universe as the previous one, though in an entirely new time setting and features a new cast. The game features a rich and breathtakingly horrifying story.   Where the first game took place in Prussia in 1839, the second installment to Amnesia is now set in London 1899 on New Year's Eve. The protagonist, Oswald Mandus, who is a wealthy industrialist and butcher, has returned from an expedition to Mexico and has contracted a fever. At the beginning of the game, Mandus finds himself awakened in his mansion from his fever, which has lasted for several months. Only guided by the voices of his two sons, Enoch and Edwin, Mandus ventures out to find them, all while they lead him deeper into the abysmal depths of London...  The story is the main drive behind the game. Exploring the dark underworld of London is a thrilling experience. However, going through the game a 2nd time is less exciting, as all of the mystery will be gone. The replayability of the game is therefore nothing to brag about.   Control &amp; Gamplay: Amnesia is a first person game, where the main goal is to explore and delve deeper into a frightening world, and survive. You are armed with nothing but a lantern, thus rendering you utterly helpless should you be confronted with the horrors that await you. Therefore, running and hiding are your only options. This is one of the defining elements of the game. Being unable to defend yourself, you feel constantly threatened, danger lurks behind every corner and you are always on your toes, ready to run away and hide and beg god the thing chasing you doesn't find you.  The game itself is not difficult. The real challenge is in actually daring to advance further in the game before you get another heart attack. There are no real puzzles as in the previous Amnesia game, which is a shame. The 'puzzles' that are present are very obvious and annoying. For the most part, the controls are good. However, when you have to use the few items in the game, the controls can feel clunky and difficult to coordinate.   Graphics: The visual aspect of the game is not impressive. However, the slightly dated graphics create a more gloomy and sinister atmosphere that fits very well with the overall mood of the game.  Sound:  The soundtrack is my favourite aspect of the game. It is deep and melancholic and it fits the dark and twisted mood of the game.  Conclusion: The game offers hours of horror, mystery and heart attacks. Amnesia is a horrifying and exciting universe that must be experienced, especially under the cover of night and preferably all alone. However, in light of its predecessor, The Dark Descent, this game offers little new in terms of mechanics and features. The puzzles feel little more than inconvenient stops in the progression and they have been unnecessarily simplified. On the other hand, the story plays a more significant role, as it often comes across as eluding and perplexing. Thus, even after the credits have rolled, Amnesia will keep you pondering about what exactly has occurred throughout the course of the game.  For both old and new players to the Amnesia universe there is a twisted, yet compelling, story in wait, which is definitely worth the money.  Score: 8/10",

            "review_text": "As a big fan of good, subtle horror, and amazing stories, I was a huge admirer of 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent', and when I heard about the second game, I couldn't contain my excitement. That was sort of my first mistake. Having huge expectations after the first game, I sadly had to be let down. This does not mean the game is bad, this just means, that after 'The Dark Descent' it probably just had to go downhill. And even though I would love to judge the two games separately, comparing the two is sort inevitable.  On the up side, I believe the story in this game is way more interesting, heart touching, and creepy at the same time, than the intricate, but slightly… “whatever” story in the first game. It is more personal, and emotional, and the outcome is way more disturbing. The music has definitely left an impression, and I still listen to 'Mors Praematura' from time to time, cause the atmosphere it created was divine. Graphics are noticeably better, as the game is a fresher release.  Yet, as I moved through the empty house, as I watched Mandus' story unwind, I felt complete peace. And this is not what you want to feel, when playing a horror game. Maybe I have developed a strong resistance to scares, cause of my love for horror, but as hard as the game tried - I just could not get scared.   Even though I love the design of the monsters in this game (whom I will refrain from calling by their name, in case you would rather be surprised), I found it hard to fear them. Found them extremely disturbing, but also had a strong sense of pity for them. They just couldn't get me in the 'oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, running away' mode, that the first game had me in most of the time.  Also the puzzle difficulty in this game is very low, and doesn't require any real thinking skills. Which can be considered an advantage by some, but for me is again, very disappointing.  So in conclusion, I would suggest playing this game for the interesting story, which left a strong unease in my heart, and the amazing music that stays with you for a long time. But if you are expecting getting really scared, or a good mind boggling puzzle, you will probably be left with a feeling of letdown. All in all, not a bad game, just probably not what you would expect. ",

            "review_text": "Once in a while, a great game comes out. That game becomes famous. And then, when a sequel comes out, it’s made simpler, easier and more “accessible”. That’s what happened here.  The only good things about it are the extraordinary voice acting and the story. The actors knew this was a serious game and took it that way and the story is good enough to keep you from uninstalling before you finish it.  You no longer have to manage which torches or candles you light up. There’s no more insanity, so you can be in the dark and look at enemies all the time you want. Puzzles are mostly just picking something up and taking it from one place to the other.  This game is also hardly scary. It only scared me three times in four hours. It doesn’t have many jump scares, but you don’t need them to make a game scary. Some of the things that made the prequel scary were moments like hiding in a room and then, when an enemy entered the room, hoping he wouldn’t look at where you were. Or having an enemy chasing you and you knew you couldn’t outrun it. You had to close doors or setup obstacles on your way. The sequel has none of this.  My main problem with it is the difficulty. I’ve been playing video games regularly since 1993 (even earlier, if you count electronic games) and this was the very first non-racing/sports/strategy game ever that I finished without dying. And I’m not even that good. Before this, my best survivability record was only dying twice when I finished “Sonic Chaos” for the first time with Tails, when I was a teenager. When I became aware of my “invincibility”, I stopped being afraid of the pigs.  “Amnesia: The Dark Descent” will be known in History as one of the greatest horror games. “Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs” will be a footnote saying there was a sequel. Well, I hope Frictional Games made plenty of money with this use of the Amnesia name.",

            "review_text": "Alright. Before I go on, I will start by saying this is an excellent game in its own right, and it is very much worth playing, the vast majority of my concerns for this game stem from comparing it to it's predecessor. But more on that in a moment.  What I liked about A Machine for Pigs: The music. Music in games is always a big factor for me, and this soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I adore Jessica Curry, and her work here is just as well-crafted as in Dear Esther. It absolutely defines the atmosphere, and complements everything going on in the game wonderfully.   The atmosphere. Very, very well-done. The game starts in a very domestic atmosphere, which has it's own nightmarish qualities, and eventually segues into this vast demonic machine complex which is confusing and oppressive, and I love it. Very dark, very tense, very good.  The plot and themes (mostly). [POTENTIAL SPOILERS] The plot of this game draws a lot on the concepts of the first. Self-induced amnesia, in an attempt to undo the unspeakable deeds the protagonist has committed, nothing new. But it is the context in which this is done that sets it wildly apart. Whereas the first game has the protagonist a victim, slowly turned psychotic in his work, this one has the protagonist as a monster on such a larger scale. The themes of industrialization and dehumanization are fascinating, and portrayed in very unnerving and gut-wrenching modes. I say that I mostly liked the plot, however, because I am utterly baffled by the ending. Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but I just did not understand it at all. I feel like there was some huge twist and it was completely lost on me.   What I did not like: Other elements of the plot [VAGUE SPOILERS CONTINUE] were poorly delivered, jarring, or incredibly predictable. Twists and revelations fell flat because you had seen them coming from ten miles away. I'm not sure if the character of Mandus is in massive denial or if he's just that dense sometimes, at the repetition of certain elements of the story. Overall the story really felt incomplete.[END SPOILERS]  Removal of literally every gameplay element from the first game. Your lamp is unlimited, tinderboxes are not a thing that exists, you have no health or sanity bar. I think the sanity thing is the worst offender. There is now no consequence for looking at monsters, which destroys half of their menace, there is no consequence for sitting around in the dark the whole time. And now that your health regenerates, there;s really no sense of desperation if you come away from a creature encounter poorly.  The horror. It was weak at best. I was infinitely more unnerved by the themes, setdressing, and practices of Mandus' processing plant than I was by any of the game's overt attempts to scare me. I think the moment I realized this was going to be disappointing in the horror department was my first concrete encounter with a monster. I saw it turning a corner and I froze and put my lamp away, all well and good, got the adrenaline flowing just like old times, but then I go down to where it is, and after hiding in the corner trying to get past it, it sees me, chases me into a dead end, and proceeds to..... do nothing? I'm not sure if this was scripted so that your first encounter with a monster was tense but safe, or if it was just a glitch. Either way it ruined the scariness of the monsters from then out.Even after that though, the monsters are unresponsive, slow, and generally less than terrifying. There were a few moments of true terror in this game, but they were few and far between, and not due to the monsters at all.   Overall, I have some very saddened disappointment toward this game. I expected it to be everything the first was, if not more, and that was my mistake.  Regardless, it is an excellent game, especially viewed in it's own light and not in comparison to it's precursor. 7/10",

            "review_text": "Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs satisfied my persistent morbid curiosity and my craving for an atmospheric horror game.  The game relies on heavy-handed, fantastical themes, and it commits to them fully throughout. It works. The writing is over-embellished, yes, and it suits the game just fine and is fun to read.  It is a great little horror story, one of my favorites in gaming.  This game shares a few similarities with Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but should not be regarded as a sequel. I adore The Dark Descent, and I assure you this is not the way to replicate that experience. A Machine for Pigs is simply a  similar  game which shares the main essential plot device: you play as a character who wakes up with amnesia, and you need to explore to unravel the mysteries of recent events and what happened to you. This framework is very effective and A Machine for Pigs is justified in putting it to use once again for another romp through horror-filled corridors.  For those that do play The Dark Descent first, you will find a few nods to its story within A Machine for Pigs, allowing for more layers of terror.  So, A Machine for Pigs:  You will explore, and you will glimpse things, but the information you gather is where the real horror lies. I like that about this game. I found that I was more frightened by what I could not see, as is often the case with the human imagination.  This is a short game. It doesn't overstay its welcome. The story is concise and the pace is very good. While playing through I appreciated how tight everything was. In this case I'll take a short, powerful punch of a game over something drawn out with filler for the sake of a few extra hours of gameplay.  I appreciated that there was virtually no backtracking and no repetitive fetch missions. Each new environment felt fresh and progress never halted.  The story drives the gameplay. You can feel the weight of it. A series of horrific events now culminate in this conclusion - where we join the game - where a character's journey will unfold over the course of a single feverish evening.  In most games time is very abstract, but not here. These events feel like they're passing in real time which is a great effect.  The mansion was very creepy with some unique imagery. It comes off as memorable, almost a character in its own right.  I'm glad there were almost no jumpscares, and they kept 'chase sequences' to a minimum so they did not lose their effect.  I enjoyed the gruesome nature of the game, and I was left wanting more information and details. In regards to morbid curiosity, there was plenty to gawk at.  I thought the character models would benefit from a few aesthetic changes. They were nearly perfect but needed to be tweaked to be truly scary. The animations were lacking for me.  The lightsource was necessary only at some points. I thought it could have been implemented better, and it should have flickered more sporadically.   I must insist the game benefits  greatly  from being completed in one sitting, or a single day. Considering the runtime of 4-5 hours, I urge players to save it for when you can play to completion. It is important to immerse in the game, read all of the writings and infer what you will about 'what lies beneath...'   Buy it on sale!  When I found out the game was shorter with simpler gameplay, I just stalked it forever on Steam until it finally went on sale for the first time. It was a long wait but I wanted to play it and I got it for a price I thought was fair.  I am very happy to have this game in my growing horror collection on Steam. If you're anything like me (if you love horror but find that nothing scares you) my advice is to try to let yourself be scared. Similar to when you're viewing a horror movie, it's much more fun if you go in with the right attitude of wanting to be scared. You have to buy-in in order to get the experience. Always play in the dark with headphones and avoid distractions or interruptions. (Old, tired sentiments, I know. But I have to remind myself to buy-in sometimes.)",

Between the design of the eponymous Machine and the incredible sound design, 'A Machine for Pigs' does a fantastic job of creating a tense, oppressive environment as you wander the vast, claustrophobic passages of the groaning behemoth.  So with the understanding that any sense of actual fear (though not unease, by far) will evaporate after about the third Manpig encounter, and that the game isn't that much longer than a Peter Jackson film, I still recommend giving this game a try.",

Anyways, Machine for Pigs (No, I have not finished it) so far is a much simplier story, one of which a father is looking for his children, while exploring the giant slaughter house that he inhiereted from his father's rich pork business. Yes, there is not that many scares, and with the few there is are harmless.  So pretty much just flip-flop the two focuses of the two games.

Four things really bother me about it...  1) the lack of an inventory 2) not being able to light candles lamps ect. (no tinderboxes) 3) its to dark 4) 90% of the game looks the same  I originally thought the game was bugged. I pressed every key trying to find the open inventory button, then I find out that you have no inventory, really? Puzzles are solved by carrying the needed object which is more often then not very close to where you need to use it, making for an easy to solve (almost boring) puzzle system. I liked in the dark decent how objects need to sometimes be carried long distances before you find a use for them *note the chemical puzzle in the dark decent, where you need to combine the 4 acids.*  The game takes place in 1899. Electricity has just been invented and is not widely popular, so why is there so few candles and oil lamps? No tinderboxes? no light-able light sources? I think this is what I dislike most about the game. In the original, players could light candles and torches whenever they feel insecure (which is most of the time). In 'a machine for pigs', its so dark and without the option to use light sources, after about 30min the player gets use to it, and the scary effect is lost. Jump scares are one thing, and this game has many of them, but atmosphere is just as important.   You're given a battery powered lamp that never runs out of juice. A good thing considering 90% of the game is almost pitch black. However, I really wish they used an oil lamp instead. Or even a battery powered lamp that runs out over time. I liked in the first game how you needed to keep a close eye on your oil so you don't run out at a time when you need it most. Back to the game being to dark... In the first game there were really bright rooms occasionally, sometimes with the moon light shining in. As you play the game and come across a room like this, its a breath of fresh air. It makes you appreciate the dark rooms a whole lot more. A nice change of atmosphere, keeps the game fresh and enjoyable to play. A machine for pigs is pretty much dark all the time, get use to it...  I understand that the game is based around old steam technology, which I found very appealing at first. Especially the part where you have to start the massive steam engine. Watching that huge flywheel turn around, gave me goosebumps. Very well done on that part! However 90% of the game looks the same. Your constantly walking through maintenance corridors full of steam pipes. It got dull very quickly. I just wanted to see something green again, but it never happened.  Overall, this game is worth checking out if your an amnesia fan. If not, I would probably pass it by. I don't regret buying it, but I probably wont play it a second time.",

            "review_text": "This is a true masterpiece, and a revelation for the Survival Horror genre. I had played the game's predecessor, and completed it years ago, and it was the first truly good horror game I had played, in-fact it had set the bar for any future experiences with the horror gaming genre. I first heard about the game a few months before it's initial release and had brought it soon after it came out for Mac, however it wasn't until a long time later that I began to play the game.   I recently started playing this and I wasn't too sure about how it would be, as overall the reactions from people who had played the predecessor were generally negative. Nonetheless, I started this game and noticed a lot of differences straight away. First of all, I noted that the graphics were a fair part better than the graphics in 'The Dark Descent'. Secondly, I realised that, unlike in Amnesia:The Dark Descent, you cannot move objects around anywhere near as much in this game. In-fact only a few objects, such as chairs, can be moved around in this game. As I walked around, I noted the suprisingly good level of attention to detail in the level design and I began gathering all the notes I could find, as I did in the previous game. The grammar, of course, was perfect, something that a suprisingly large amount of games miss out on.  As I walked around the first area in the game, upon entering various rooms, I had recieved telling flashbacks from the mind of Oswald Mandus, the character you play as. From the start of the game, I knew that Oswald had two twin boys, Edwin and Enoch, aswell as a wife that died giving birth to the latter twin. I progressed through the first part of the game fairly quickly and witnessed the story unravel as I played through. Please note that a good portion of the story is revealed in notes and other found documents, it is important to read a few of these notes as they can help in puzzles and often give interesting information to the backstory of the game's characters. The story to Amnesia:The Dark Descent was, in my opinion, absoloutely brilliant. As I played through the first portion of the game, I still kept my opinion of the predecessor's story being far better, however as I got closer and closer toward the end, I found myself preferring the story of A Machine for Pigs.   Now, of course, this isn't just a game for the story. This is a horror game. I thoroughly enjoyed the scares of The Dark Descent, not at the time of course, but I did find the scare sequences in this game somewhat lacking. The AI of the Manpigs is still lacking, but is a definite improvement from the enemies of The Dark Descent. To give a balanced review of the scares, let's look at what makes monsters in games scary. First of all, the appearence. The Manpigs are not scary based on appearence alone, I mean don't get me wrong, if one was chasing me in real life I would be absoloutely terrified, but in a horror game, especially the sequel to such an amazing horror, they were definitely lacking in scare-factor. Secondly, the buildup. The buildup tells a different story, apart from one or two encounters, the buildup was equally as great as The Dark Descent. Overall, however, The Dark Descent was definitely more scary. There are definitely a few encounters, and not just with the Manpigs, that were incredibly tense. How tense, you ask? Remember the first time you saw the Water Lurker in The Dark Descent? THAT tense.  Overall, the story in this game is absoloutely amazing and, based on story alone, I would give this game a solid 9/10. This is a horror game, and the scares were definitely lacking overall, but some encounters were extremely tense and I could feel my heart race afterwards. On the scare-factor alone, I would rate this game 7.8/10. Other than those two aspects, you have to bear in mind the puzzles, the graphics and the atmosphere. Firstly, the puzzles in this game are definitely easier than in The Dark Descent, but are still good. I would rate the puzzle factor 6.5/10. The graphics, for the year it was made, are not brilliant. But this is no Elder Scrolls game, and so long as the graphics are good enough to get immersed, then that is all that is necessary. For the graphics alone, bearing in mind what I just said, I would give it an 8/10. The atmosphere in this game was a lot better than I expected it to be, the soundtrack was fantasic, the attention to detail in the level design was brilliant and the other aspects, such as lighting was awesome. In fact, I would go as far to say that the atmosphere in this game was better than the one in The Dark Descent, which was not far from perfection itself. For atmosphere, I would rate this game a 9.2/10. So using maths to figure out the score average...  Ladies and gentlemen, this masterpiece of a game scores a well deserved: 8.1  With great atmosphere, good puzzles, amazing story, and some extremely tense monster encounters, this is a true masterpiece.  If you liked Amnesia:The Dark Descent, or any horror game in general, then I highly recommend that you order this game.",

A big focus on story and setting which can be both great and dissappointing since most of the time you'll love the creepy sounds and 'what ifs' around the corner and some of the times you will wish an enemy would just show up to at least spice things up a bit. When they do come it's always greeted with open limbs but those moments are few and far between. Overall this game deserves a playthough from any fan of the horror genre.  Pros: - Extremely well crafted atmosphere with a great art style - Unnerving and surreal setting on par with early Silent Hill games - Disturbing music and unsettling sound effects that makes up for the lack of enemy encounters - Great disturbing story with impressive voice acting through out -Pigs   Cons: - Very short which can be a turn off for fans of lengthy horror games - Less about survival like The Dark Descent and more about soaking up the disturbing story and setting - Last hour drags on for a bit which can leave you wanting it be over - Pigs",

            "review_text": "Let me say in the beginning: 'Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs' sure is a nice horror game, but mostly if you never played or saw the previous 'part' The Dark Descent.   You play Oswald Mandus, the owner of an industrialised slaughterhouse in 1899.  While you proceed through the game, it already starts with the name of the game and continues with multiple bits of information, that you constantly think 'What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is/was going on here'. I liked that most in the game, same as in The Dark Descent. From the beginning to almost the last minute, you add pieces of information to finally understand what kind of **** is going on here.   On the other hand, after completing 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent' multiple times, I was really disappointed in the horror-atmosphere, which was the strongest part in Amnesia, compared to other games of the genre. The Dark Descent was so strong, because it used a few simple mechanisms of fear. Most important, you almost never saw what was called 'enemy'. In TDD you ♥♥♥♥ your pants because you have no freaking idea whats behind you, what it can do with you, how close it is to you, and how long you need to run until you get rid of it.   Now, A Machine for Pigs and also, in my opinion, Outlast (I don't say it's a bad game, not at all) lack that kind of atmosphere since you know a lot about your pursuers. For me, the enemies in AMFP were neither scary nor did they chase me in a horrifying or atmospheric way, simply, if you know WHAT is chasing you, it loses way too much of its horror. The loss of atmosphere is in my opinion the biggest contra compared to TDD.   Too long, didn't read/All in all:   I recommend this game. The story is pretty cool for the genre, the music and sounds create a good atmosphere, but answer the following questions before you buy it.  1) Have you played The Dark Descent before and want to play the next part? Buy it.  2) Have you played The Dark Descent before and hope for an even better experience? You will not find it here in my opinion.  3) Have you never played or watched a Let's play of The Dark Descent before and do you look for a good horror game?  Start with The Dark Descent.

A Machine for Pigs is a lot darker than the previous installment and the features they took out from the first game aren't actually necessary for A Machine for Pigs.   The game is a lot more story driven and is written beautifully, the eerie sense that the machine gives is full of dread and claustrophobia. This is also supported by the game's soundtrack, which is one of the few game soundtracks I have bought.  Jessica Curry's soundtrack written for the game is some of the best horror music I've ever heard out of any form of horror, whether it be movies or other games.   This being said, a good majority of the time I was frightened by the music and found myself screaming for it to stop. (Locked inside my dorm room by myself with no lights whatsoever is really the only way to play a horror game).  In conclusion, this shouldn't be compared to the first game at all. It would be rather dull if the predecessor of a game was exactly like the new one coming out and the creators should not be shunned for trying something different, especially when the game industry has recently been pumping out AAA titles that are no different than the previous games they have made.  Personally, I enjoyed this game a lot more than the first Amnesia, it's different yes, but it's a whole new flavor, one that people may or may not like depending on their idea of horror.",

Upon finishing the game I was forced to admit (despite not initially liking the game) that I thought the story was much better than that of the first game, even if it was substantially shorter and not near as terrifying. Should you play this game? It depends on what you want to get out of it. If you're playing it for a compelling story about a father's search for his missing children, then it delivers and you'll be pleased.

The gameplay is rather simple, in a good way; unlike the first game, you can't manipulate most of the objects in the game and there are no mechanics pertaining to the player (i.e. inventory, sanity, etc) except for health. Most of the game involves solving moderately challenging puzzles (not so easy as to be boring, and not so hard as to require the aid of the internet), with a few action scenes wherein the player must flee monsters or escape pipes filling with hot steam. The level design is relatively realistic and rather expansive in multiple cases, and the graphical design of the game is rather excellent. The actual graphics are somewhat average -- this was not a game intending to boast its graphics, but some of its textures are noticably low quality, and the same goes for some unimportant static meshes. These things aren't too prevalent however, and shouldn't bother most people (I just happen to be the kind of person that examines the textures, models and graphical FX closely in games whenever given the chance).

Perhaps I wasn't as engaged as I should have been, but I was confused throughout the entire story. A not-creepy-but-very-annoying blue fog is in nearly every level, making it impossible to see things and putting a weird bloom effect on everything. Other players suggested removing the file for the fog, which I never did, arguing that a game worth my time wouldn't drive players to change files to make the game bearable.  The 'monsters' are not psychologically damaging in any way to the senses, as they were in Amnesia - The Dark Descent. There is no chase music, and the creatures simply aren't scary.  This review is in no way a reflection on the abilities of thechineseroom, rather the situation that thechineseroom was put in. To my understanding, thechineseroom makes art games and indie stories, such as Dear Esther (which was beautiful and wonderfully written), and do not have the mindset to make horror stories.

This review won't be very detailed simply because there's just not alot to do.  Most of the time you're just walking along a linear path until you reach a locked door, then you find a way to unlock it. The solution is usually in an adjacent room. Occasionally you'll have to sneak past some creatures, but the level design makes it totally obvious which route is safe. Repeat for 4 hours.  The story is told through a mixture of finding journal pages, and listening to someone talk over an intercom. Most of it just comes across as random nonsense, whilst replacing the word 'man' with 'pig' to sound deep and edgy. Because we're all filthy, greedy creatures, I guess.  Trying to think of good things to say. It didn't crash. And it lets you save anywhere, which is something that many more high profile games don't give you the freedom to do these days.

The game itself has beautiful visuals and the story line was pretty decent, not nearly as f-ed as the original, but still.

My friends who had played the game gave me a very mixed feel on the game, plenty of negative to go with the positive, so I went in with somewhat lowered expectations. I played Dark Descent years ago, and the Penumbra trilogy more recently, and right out of the gate it was obvious that though this game shared the Amnesia moniker, it was not a Frictional endeavour.   The only Chinese Room game I've played before was Dear Esther, and as much flak as that game receives I found enjoyment in the atmosphere the developers were able to build into such a short experience. MfP helps the developers carry on that trend, but it gives them much more breathing room. The extended length (~4-7 hours depending on your hurry) plays to the developers' favor and shows they can make a full length experience with a beginning, middle, and end. The world MfP builds for the player is as much a social commentary on recent human history as it is a spooky romp through underground, industrial revolution England with tons of pig-based imagery. While the ties to Dark Descent are minimal and fleeting, MfP manages to stand on its own as a new narrative in a new setting with new characters and still be captivating. However, if you don't listen closely to the various notes and conversations scattered throughout the campaign, things can get a little confusing. Even after beating the game I found myself googling portions of the plot to get a better understanding of what had just happened.  The main complaint I see/hear for MfP is that the horror pales in comparison to Dark Descent and I'm inclined to agree. While Dark Descent terrified me from beginning to end, MfP suffers from the same issues as the Slender series in that after a certain point, prolonged exposure to the intiially 'mysterious' creepies haunting you makes them significantly less mysterious, and minimizes their ability to inspire terror in the player. However, I don't feel like it was Chinese Room's intent for the monsters to be the source of horror the whole way through the game. Without going into plot spoilers, the narrative makes it a point to expose the monsters to the player to help make sense of the plot, and the horror stops being this abstract thing going bump in the night to an internal sense of fear and anxiety over the actions of the player.  With that last statement in mind, I can totally agree with the Bioshock comparisons. MfP is every bit as deep as Bioshock Infinite, without the paradoxical nature of the protagonist running around gunning down hundreds of NPC's for the sake of AAA gun-play mechanics.   So if you're interested in an Irrational-style mind-trip, MfP is the game for you. Just don't go in expecting to be scared out of your wits the whole way through.",

Perhaps this was a choice by The Chinese Room, who made the snorefest 'Dear Escher.' On the other hand, it's not like the puzzles in Dark Descent were actually GOOD. So, if you're after the same thing I'm after--impeccable set design full of dark winding passages and horrifying creatures lurking just out of sight--you'll be pleased once again. In fact, this game has something that Dark Descent was lacking: a truly striking and effective story. It makes a surprisingly big difference, I found, grounding the protagonist's goals in a search for his missing children. And once you discover the true nature of the evil lurking in the tunnels under London, it will give you a lot more to think about than the rituals of Alexander ever did in Dark Descent.",

It was a collaboration between The Chinese Room and Frictional Games (who made the original Amnesia). I played the game and I have to say that I loved it.  'This world is a Machine. A Machine for Pigs. Fit only for the slaughtering of Pigs. From the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Dear Esther comes a new first-person horror game that will drag you to the depths of greed, power and madness. It will bury its snout into your ribs and it will eat your heart.'  The game takes place 60 years after the events of The Dark Descent. You play as Oswald Mandus, an industrialist who wakes up in a cage in a huge house. Oswald hears his children calling for him to find them, so he sets off in a descent, determined to find his two sons, Edwin and Enoch. As you make your way through the way the story is unvieled, just like in TDD. A Machine for Pigs uses the same engine as the original Amnesia, and shares some similar aspects. The detailed graphics in AMFP have upgraded so much since the first Amnesia, and there provide more of an immersive feeling, which I love.  If you are expecting an Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2, then you probably won't like the game. Most things have changed between games, such as a new terror meter, and hardly any objects are moveable anymore. I found the couple hours of the game scary, with the eerie atmosphere and the creepy enemies patrolling the areas, but after that they seemed to cease.  The story (or plot) of the game was the greatest aspect. If you read the notes the story makes perfect sense...or if you go to the wiki. I won't spoil anything, but i'll say one thing, and that is; READ THE NOTES! This was complemented by very nice voice acting.  Overall rating: 8/10  Why 8/10?  I am rating it an 8 because of how the game because lIke I mentioned in the 4th paragraph the scares stop after the first 90 minutes, and that was disappointing. Also, because of some parts in the story don't really feel Amnesia-like and that ruined part of the immersion. But overall it was a great game and I loved playing it!",

I think there is a desire for a scary experience in all of us(vicariously)!

Even on my laptop A10 quad it chugged, so best to have at least an nice 3+ quad to run it at 1080P. So, it looked nice. BUT. It was becoming a walking simulator with a few spooky things here and there - a few jump scares ( thank god not too many ) and super duper easy to figure out puzzles. If you have FOV issues, this will give you a headache, it did me. Could only play a bit at a time.   Now, then at the 80% I was thinking to myself - 'it's sorta nice with the well written story, just not really scary'. A lot of work went into this game, it's not just slapped together. I waited for more. And then....kinda past the point where you meet some actual piggies - and they don't really kill you as you re-spawn right about where you died - it started getting seriously creepy. Not in the 'boo!' sense, but storywise it did not turn out exactly how I had envisioned. I won't spoil it. The mood changes as you get horrid scenes of death, massacre, waterfalls of blood!, chased from piggues A LOT, and then just the vile realization of what the guy is and what he did. It's nota ' OH. MY. GOD' surprising horror feel, but you'll get a definte 'Man, that's like really sick. ' out of it. And then the ending...i thought it was over, but kept going. And I personally liked it. It does not rush and not does stay to long in one area. Well paced for what feels mostly like it was stretched a bit at the end. You have to esacpe from certain clutches and sneak around Hitman style somewhat without any weapons...I liked that the most. Puzzles, etc just kept me busy but I really liked sneaking rather than kill kill kill bang bang bang which is what most scary games involve ( Rez Evil 5 on up I am looking at you ). It kept me going to the end. So, for my $0.02 it's worth it...for $5. Honestly, a $20 price tag? C'mon. $15 would have been better to start. $5 on sale for me was justified.",

This is a cheaper and more pretentious attempt at a sequel for Amnesia, even though the links to the previous title are inconsequential at best.  The gameplay mechanics suffer significantly as you no longer have an inventory, a health bar or a sanity meter. This means you also no longer have to collect tinder or oil. Removing such critical components from the gameplay mechanic strips away much of what made Amnesia such an engrossing title in the first place. The tension and immersion of the first game are all but gone, as well as complex puzzle solving. The world is also far less interactive and as a result you will spend far less time exploring the world around you. Although Amnesia was certainly a linear game this title just feels somewhat rushed or lazy. The creatures are also fairly cartoonish looking and never add tension or fear, opting me to run or jump around them rather than sneak past them. All these small issues together amass into an experience that pales to the one felt previously.  Where Amnesia managed to create a story that continuously propelled itself forward and beckoned you to uncover it's mystery, aided by characters you became invested in, A Machine for Pigs goes for a very different route. Nearly non-existent characterisation and prose so purple and hamfisted you will alternately cringe or roll your eyes. Where Amnesia had you thirsting for the few pieces of paper that might further clue you in to the story A Machine for Pigs showers you with notes every few steps, dousing you in tautological prattle that could drown a room full of bad writers.  Perhaps I sound overly critical of this game but nothing about it will truly offend nor shock you with its awfulness. It is simply a mediocre and pretentious game that is made to look worse if compared to the game it is supposed to followup.

Don't buy this game expecting a worthy sequel. I really regret preordering this game and would advise anybody NOT to buy this game.",

            "review_text": "Well this will definitely be a hard one. After finishing this and the first game back to back i'm having really mixed feelings about it. If you're looking for a good interactive story with a fairly well thought out plot you'll probably have a blast with A Machine for Pigs. If you're, however, looking for a successor to The Dark Descent with a similar atmosphere, gameplay and terrifying setpieces you probably will be sorely disappointed.  + The story told is by all means good. + While different, the atmosphere AMFP creates is unique and foreboding on it's own right. + Late 1890's London is an amazing locale for a game and in my opinion much more interesting than the castle in the first title.  Aand that's pretty much where the positives end. The rest of this 'review' will probably sound like a rant, so i'd just like to point out at this point that if you can get the game for 5 bucks or so i'd definitely recommend it as i enjoyed the things the game did good a lot. There are however some pretty glaring issues i just can't overlook and that really hamper the game from being really good.  - They removed most of the gameplay mechanics from the first game, like, literally most of them. - No sanity meter. - No oil to refill your lantern, it now has it for an infinite quantity. - No tinderboxes to light candles. - No inventory system to collect items in, instead all the puzzles are done a la Half-Life 2 item dragging. (It sucks by the way.) - Since you basically don't have to deal with the darkness anymore, nearly all of the games spooks are handled via jumpscares. Gone is the near traumatizing atmosphere of the first game in which you really were ♥♥♥♥ed beyond imagination if you ran out of tinderboxes and oil. - About 4 hours long, which is about half the length of TDD. This could also be a positive because if it was any longer i swear to god i would have dropped it halfway through for the sake of padding out the game. - No puzzles. Yes, you read that right. Sure, there are valves to turn and buttons to press but they require absolutely NO effort whatsoever. I was kinda sceptical about the whole 'Walking simulator' thing people have been throwing this game at but to be entirely honest it isn't all that far away from the truth. - The main antagonists of the game are not scary, like, at all.  So yeah, i really can't give this a positive review no matter how hard i try. If you can get it for cheap it's definitely worth it for the story and some cheap thrills but that's about it. Even the modding scene is worse than in TDD because there are literally almost no mechanics to play with in the game.",

            "review_text": "For fans of games or horror, this cannot be recommended.  This 'game' is more of a 3d story, with little attention paid to a coherent or immersive design. In many ways, this feels like a take on storytelling similar to Bioshock, except all the concept of gameplay or immersiveness taken out. The game doesn't really show you anything, it just keeps telling this or that happened. Even during some of the more 'climactic' moments in the storytelling, it just felt like they wanted to do something, couldn't make it happen, and then just gave up.  The monsters in this game are relatively rare, and are near inescapable unless one simply runs, which takes away any pretense of fun or interactivity. There's no puzzles, just moving a thing from here to there and pressing a buton. All the effort seemed like it was put into making the game artful, but then all the levels have invisible barriers despite being twisty corridors and cramped ones at that! After the first Amnesia's fetishization of 'and then a skeleton popped out' horror, this game is the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of any sense of anything.  If you are looking to play a game with a sense of strangeness, horror, suspense, anything, buy the Penumbra trilogy and figure out which was the first and play those. You'll get at least 12+ hours of composed levels, mind-fiddling, and strangess from the trilogy. AMfP is a hand-holding mess with the only positive thing to say is it can be completed without crashing (though your framerate will show even the engine couldn't be managed properly).  After being a huge fan of their Penumbra games, and hoping Amnesia: The Dark Descent only came about by an independent company starting a 'modern' game on weak footing, this application shows what happens when design is mismanaged and poorly implemented compared to a focus on making a good game first.  Edit: After posting I feel compelled to comment on the controls, and more, as well.  The controls in this game and the way you interact with the world is terrible, at best. This is not a commentary of the manual manipulation system which is unique to these game designers and was implemented quite well, previously. The game will frequently wrest control of your view or make you pace slowly, despite their being nothing interesting happening. As one gets further into the game this happens with greater frequency, and it is frustrating to walk into a room eager to explore, and be forced to asthmatically stumble. Similarly the game sometimes lets you interact with objects, with no indication as to why or how, other than to twist or turn something innocuous. As the Penumbra Trilogy had physical puzzles as a core mechanic, to see the game nearly completely remove object interaction is simply disgusting. If you like picking up chairs or swivelling a headrest, this game may interest you, but you won't be able to climb anywhere or do anything with the things that swivel.  Despite the hype for the profound horror of the pigs and the machines the game tries to convey, there is at most three separate kinds of pigs, in the entire game, you get to even be near. The machines in the game are as interesting as loose curtains or wall paint, because you're always held behind glass, or handrails, or other nonsense. A game with screaming sawblades one foot from you, but posing absolutely no danger, intentional or otherwise, is shameful. As mentioned before, while the narrative tries to convey the horrors and atrocities, you don't get to see insanity in action, it's as if they wanted to make a horror game safe for children, and AMfP is not only the only thing they could come up with, it wasn't even tested to see if it was satisfactory.",

I found myself unchallenged and instead bored by them, since most of them were 'find the next hidden switch to open the secret door'  Yhe monsters weren't as scary or intimidating as the grunts and brutes of Dark Descent...and the rooms you encounter them in are more like cat and mouse chase.

After cringing through a painfully loud and uninteresting intro sequence attempted to hold onto the giddiness I felt. Once I had control of my character I immediately fiddled with the controls. (I come to expect that since I'm a lefty) Once I set things to the best I could I headed out the door. It didn't take long for me to realize that the X and Y were not on the same sensitivity regaurdless of the settings. So I sucked it up and carried on. (For the record that did get better at somepoint although I have no idea when or why) As I fumbled room to room and down the hallways I began to realize I had not even been playing for 10 minutes and they had already used up every strerotypical scare tactic I've ever seen or known about in movies and video games. If your a fan of horror this will disturb you FAR more than the 'scares' this 'game' attempted to provide. And yes I said 'game', it's not a game it's a slow trudge though a boring narration. Nevertheless I trudged onward with my slow and clunky character looking around (which finally decided to work) wondering to myself why I can't use numerous objects within the house as my weapon of choice to gut the inevitable monster that Amnesia was always known to provide. Sadly the humor I found in that was overridden and my focus was pointed toward the pain inside my head. I pressed pause, turned away from my screen and it struck me that of course the game was responsible for that TOO! So here is point when I take a third trip to the growingly familiar Settings screen. If you haven't guessed where this story is going already you shouldn't be surprised when I tell you that I am presented with a huge lack of anything to adjust the lighting of this game. That was when I had enough. I quit the game. No game should make us pay for a headache, and it shouldn't take you down with it. Save yourself the time, money, and hard-drive space. Thank you.",

Gone are most of the game mechanics from the first game: hiding from abominable creatures, scavenging for lamp fuel, and choosing when to keep that lamp lit or deal with the eroding sanity effects of the darkness. All that is kept is the general mise en scene and the periodic acquisition of notes filling in story details. Sadly those details are so dripping with poetry and convultion that they rarely add up to anything making much sense. Visually the game is virtuall unchanged from the original and still seems to be using utilizing now ancient Source engine. Here too they've managed to strip away some of what the original game brought to the table by covering the entire screen with a procedurally generated fog that serves only to muddy every single view in the game. Even after removing the fog (via save file editing) it's obvious that The Chinese Room (in taking on stewardship of the property) misunderstood that 'dark' means shadows and not, 'there's no strong light sources anywhere, ever.' I found myself squinting my way through the game's 5 or so hours and lamenting that I could never quite see what appeared to be a somewhat detailed and visually interesting world.  I could have given A Machine for Pigs a pass for getting rid of the horror game play elements of the original Amnesia as a trade off for a deeper narrative experience, but unfortunately the game fails to succeed in this task.

            "review_text": "To start if you want a first impression of the game I have done a Let's Play:  {LINK REMOVED}  bit.ly/1pm704k   Prelude:  Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is almost nothing like Amnesia: The Dark Decent. The only semblance of connectivity is that you have a lantern, the name, and the Amnesia. However, don’t let that dissuade you from buying this game, if it is on sale. $20 USD, is a bit much to ask for this game, however I bought it for $5 USD and I would say that it was worth it.   Review: To start, if you have never played either Amnesia game, play The Dark Decent, it is the closest to perfection in the Horror genre. A Machine for pigs cannot hold a candle to it that however, does not make it a bad game, just a not-so-good follow up. For the majority of this review I will assume you have played The Dark Decent.  The real meat of the Amnesia The Dark Decent was the atmosphere which was only expanded upon with the Sanity meter, the longer you were in the dark or the longer you looked at an enemy the more insane you went, is gone. The game starts in a similar way lulling you in, you’re in a large house that is almost castle like in a Victorian way that however, is quickly swept away as you start to venture into the steam powered machinery. Now this atmosphere itself is quite eerie, all of the creaking machinery and the steam pipes bursting with unknown animal noises sounding off. The atmosphere has changed and it doesn’t quite produce the same terror a dark, dingy, pink puss filled, musty castle has but it works for the setting.  The major element in The Dark Decent that really added to the atmosphere was the Lantern and the Tinder Boxes. The Lantern stays, however the oil, the finite source that powered the lantern, is gone. In this steam powered world the Lantern never dies, which doesn’t add anything to this game. In fact if you have played The Dark Decent you would know that this has actually taken something away the atmosphere. You no longer need to keep an eye on your oil consumption, which means that you no longer need to hide in the dark. There is no reason to be scared for most of this game.  You may have noticed that I didn’t say anything about the Tinder Boxes. Well that because there is also no inventory. At all, it’s gone. Another finite source, that you used as back up to maintain your sanity and to see, is gone. You also no longer pick up keys, something is blocked, open or jammed. So basically every aspect that you had some sort of control over is gone. Which you might think would add to the horror, but it doesn’t. You may not have control over anything but you also have no finite sources you only have an unlimited use to your magical lantern.  Now one of my favorite parts of The Dark Decent was the puzzles. Luckily A Machine for Pigs kept this aspect. However, many of them are either too easy or offer no real direction. Many of the puzzles are just turn this crank or pull this lever. However there are some that really show how crazy Mandus really is, with corridors and objects disappearing after solving them. There were a few puzzles that made me feel great after solving them, which were quite a few puzzles in The Dark Decent. There were too many that were on polar extremes unfortunately, either too easy or unexplained.  Another one of my favorite things about The Dark Decent were the enemy’s. For 90% of the game you need to NOT look at them, your sanity meter will thank you. For most of the game you can only seem them in passing or for a brief moment making them something elusive and terrifying, never knowing where they are going to come from or what is going to happen. With A Machine for Pigs, I only felt true terror and was unnerved about the enemy’s when they brought out the special variant enemy. The Pigs themselves however, just aren’t frightening. They’re actually kind of endearing, which an enemy in a horror game shouldn’t be. They also don’t make many appearances, leaving the game to be unsettling but never really praying on your vulnerability.  In conclusion: By now you would probably assume that I’m going to take a large dump on this game. Well, no. While it doesn’t have quite the same feeling as The Dark Decent, they did a good job with what they did. The story, which I’m not going to touch for risk of spoilers, keeps you in the dark for a very long time keeping you wondering what it really going on and occasionally punching you right in the feels. The unsettling atmosphere is great, it would just have been nice if they could have really instilled fear in me. It is definitely obvious that they focused on the story more than anything, which I appreciate. It also made me want to go back and play The Dark Decent again, which I also love. So in the end, as game on its own I would say if it’s on sale play it, I beat it in 3.5 hours not worth $20. As an Amnesia game I would definitely say just watch a let’s play or buy it during one of the rare 75% off sales.  And if you do want to watch a Let’s Play here’s mine:  {LINK REMOVED}  bit.ly/1pm704k  ",

During the last 1 1/2 hours of gameplay, I found myself rushing just to finish the game and move on.  I cannot recommend this game, but the original Amnesia is definitely worth playing.

            "review_text": "Whilst Dark Descent was formidable horror with ending totally screwed up, Machine for Pigs is generally the opposite. Most of the quest you just wander somewhere amongst cogwheels pulling the levers, spinning the valves and doing other Half-Life stuff. Enemy is rare and dumb. It appears from nowhere and vanishes into the air by chance, that's not fair. Moreover, I believe it's ok to arouse some suspense by sudden sounds, but (!) when you hear footsteps behind your back and you're totally sure nobody could come from THAT DIRECTION, that crap is not frightening anyone, it becomes teasing and annoying. I'd say, cheap &amp; dull horror methods here.  Mechanics are simplified, good physics sandbox potential we know since Penumbra series is likely ignored.  So, don't expect this game to be really scary as original Amnesia, although it tries, really tries, and even sometimes it succeed, thanks for brilliant sound effects - ambience, surround &amp; music (rare, but surprisingly good).   To be honest, I originally wanted to push 'Not recommended' button here, since Machine for Pigs feels so ugly &amp; imperfect over against Dark Descent, but not after I finished the game. The last 4 hours of gameplay offset all the boring Half-life wandering with exciting action and come to a terrific ending. The story is definitely the forte of this game, Yūgen-part is heavy and fits well the things not covered by the journal and character's insights. That's why I can say the game worths playing.  So, + story sound &amp; music voices (actors)  - not so much scary awful outdated graphics too casual simplified mechanics.",

Obviously I don't agree with the protagonist's (possessed) actions in this story but will say that without all of the fluff; 'A Machine for Pigs' sums up, succinctly, the way that I too see life most days.  A good story, pleasing graphics, sounds and ambience. The only thing I can scold AMFP for is that it is too long. I'm seven hours in and only now getting close to the very end. I would say it feels like I've sat through, at least, an hour and half of drag-on filler; perhaps to prevent critics from complaining it a short game.

I almost wonder if this game was pushed through development way too fast in an effort to piggyback on the success of the first one.  A lot of the things that made the first Amnesia so good are gone: No sanity changes, no inventory, far fewer scares, and a much less interative environment. Something about the physics feels off and when your character slows to a snail's pace during voiceovers way too often it's very annoying. I'm halfway through the game and I've rarely seen monsters, I'm practically skipping through the levels without feeling threatened and have thought several times about shelving it and just watching a Let's Play instead.  Don't buy it at full price, it isn't worth it. On average, people beat it in 3.5 hours, so even based on gameplay time alone I don't think it's worth $20.

AMFP was designed to focus more on the details of the story and setting rather than the scares from the creatures you encounter, which is why it is one of my favorite horror games. The blunt truth is that ATDD was designed for the scares and only the scares which is why many Dark Descent veterans (such as myself) found AMFP very different than TDD. Here are some examples. 1) Physical Scares 2) Lack of custom stories 3) Very different environments/monsters 4) Characters  Since AMFP has no custom story option many such as myself play the game once and never launch it again, which is actually fine.  AMFP is truely a masterpiece and I recommend the game to anyone who has played the dark descent or other horror games.  9/10 ",

            "review_text": "I did not wish for the 6 hours of my life back, but I do hold a lot of issue with this game.   When I went into Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (from here on referred to as MfP) I expected an exploration, suspense game that utilizes mechanics in order to protray a story. Would I say MfP is /not/ that game? No. It is that game, but the mechanics in MfP were poorly designed at best, the story was not adequately portrayed for how complicated it was, and the suspense was lacklustre at best.   This game, first of all, does not follow in anyway the mechanics from Dark Decent. There is no sanity, so the player has the wonderful ability to really focus on the story and watch it unfold. The joke is absolutely on you though because you can't do anything with this new found freedom except read the same note style plot entries in a terrible font just like DD. The notes make it so all plot points are exposed to the player equally. Major or minor, significant or non. This means that perhaps thorughout the game I was a bit confused because I didn't disect every inch of every note along the way.   In the beginning I felt I was given a lot of information. There were a lot of monologues from our protagonist, but as the game progressed the monologues decreased in frequency and so did my understanding of the plot. As the chapters progressed past about 5 or 6 the monologues stopped and the information flow basically ceased. We learned about the slaughtering process, the components of Compound X, how the pig people are taken care of, but none of these are really /plot/ related. So at this point you are 10 or 11 chapters in (out of 17) and you STILL don't know why you are here. You are looking for your children in a slaughterhouse or a sewer because that's where children go, right? There's someone trying to break the machinery and you need to fix it to get your kids which are trapped in it? These things are logical gaps in story-telling that made continuing forward infuriating at times. Lack of tangible character motivation is inexcusable, tell me why I'm here. It should have been laid out at the beginning of the game who you are and what the machine was to you so that the twist that occurs 3/4 of the way through was even bigger and hit the player even harder.   It is inexcusable to have a luck-of-the-draw, guesswork level. And that was the pitch-black pig level. You can't use your lantern, there are no lights. Good luck. It's never scary, it legitimately stupid and lazy on the designers and I nearly gave up playing at that point.   Mechanics. Mechanics, mechanics, mechanics. You have the constant and readily available ability to pick up and rotate chairs, but WHY? This is wasted effort. This is wasted time and money and it is a useless mechanic in a game that really could have used a few more mechanics to it. You have a lantern, the lantern flickers when there's a threat, that's a good mechanic, but then you can't use it when you need it. Playing in complete darkness is not scary, it's not suspenseful and it's JUST. NOT. FUN. I feel like Chinese Room and Frictional forgot halfway through that they were making a game. Do not make me play in darkness when your settings are so neat. Your doing both you and I a major disservice. There were times you need to pick something up and bring it somewhere and I relished those times. A GAME. FINALLY. But they were rare. There were times the surroundings played tricks with your mind and I awaited moments like those around every corner but they were fleeting and infrequent.   My ultimate review for this game is that I wanted more. I wanted more cutscenes, deeper plot drops, and better portrayal of information. I loved the story, I loved the setting, but you made me somehow come out of it frustrated and confused. This game had a ton of wasted potential.   It would be wrong of me to harp on the negative solely so I'll briefly touch on the positive.   This game had several awesome, beautifully designed and intricate settings. The slaughterhouse parts, the machine cores, the streets, the house, were all very very well done. I am impressed with the design capabilities of this developer and I appreciate their hard work in creating a town built above the pits of hell.   The story, in and of itself, was very compelling. I loved reading about the slaughter process, the machine's past and birth lurred me in like a siren's song, Mandus's sickness and later insanity was a welcome disturbance in what would normally be a boring rescue plot. I loved this story, I wish that it could have been told to me in a deeper way given its inherent depth.   The length of the game was perfect for what it was. It could be played in about 4-6 hours and that's exactly about as long as I was willing to put up with it. Well done cutting the cord before I hit the uninstall button out of infuriating frustration.   The nuances. Though the game did a poor job at getting them across to the player, the story's nuances are truly brilliant. Read the wiki or steam forums because the story itself is rather lovely and much of it gets lost in gameplay.",

It's very short on top of all of the other problems, so it feels more like an expanded DLC than an actual successor to the original. I'd only recommend this game if you're looking for something to go through quickly on the cheap around Halloween time. Other than that, you can skip A Machine for Pigs. Stick with the original.",

The result is a very pretty and dark experience with the odd 'pick this up and carry it over there' puzzles that were about as challenging as a visit to the refrigerator. It is much more visually vivid than Dark Descent - and yet far less happens on camera. There are implications of horrors, aftereffects - but you never seem to be involved in any of them. New textures - somewhat creepy sound, but there isn't any of the horror or real fear that positively seeped from the Dark Descent. You spend a lot of time being force-fed metaphors about workers and capitalism and transformation literal and figurative - but ultimately, it all comes to a disappointingly predictable conclusion.",

Frictional Games were the publisher and/or end-user testers, or something along those lines, and the whole development process was done by The Chinese Room, known of Dear Esther for example.  If compared to the original Amnesia title, this one experienced some sweeping changes. For example, whole inventory system is chucked, the game levels are rather straightforward, and the sanity system has been removed. I also took notice that the puzzles we are also somewhat simple compared to the original title.  The atmosphere is good. Great in some cases. I have to say that the game was scary. REALLY scary. But to a point. To the point when the monster arose. The monster moves clumsy, it can be outran and outsmarted easily. It was not as scary as the game implied to me during the few first levels. But in any case, the game was really scary at some points, and not because of the monster.  The story is quite brilliant. I'd say this game is more close to a visual novel than a game. The Chinese Room-people are ingenious at doing these story driven games. The maps and soundscape upholds the story in a great way, and I must tell these people know what they are doing.  Conclusion: If you are a follower (or might be) of story-driven horror games, then yes, try this. But if you want to be TRULY scared (and somewhat frustrated at some points), then try on the first title, in case you already haven't.",

Yes, there's some connection, but this game has no Insanity meter, and from what I saw, ONE type of enemy which can be easily outrun, even after being seen.   The puzzles aren't puzzling, they mainly rely on you going to point A, fixing/breaking point A and then doing the same to point B. The music is good, and builds a nice atmosphere, but it's ruined terribly by the fact that your Lantern never runs out. It only flickers when the enemy is near, which kills the surprise.

When in TDD the focus lay on surviving the ultimate Horror now in AMFP it's more like you are beeing told a story and don't really have to do something. The riddles are far from beeing difficult and the 'My thoughts' part of your journal explains everything in every situation (in my opinion to detailed). When in TDD I often had problems in getting to the next level and would have appreciated a hint in AMFP the total opposite is in place. There is no Room for interpretation or imagination. I like games where you habe to puzzle the background story together (e.g. Silent Hill or TDD) so this production is to bolt and solid for a deep Horror Game. Despite a few scarejumps and the first encounter with the evil creatures the game isn't really scaring. It seems like the creators of the game had a very good idea of an interessting story (More in the spoiler area) but were forced to bring Horror Game Elements into this game. The parallels to Dear Esther (a great game wich i love and revommend) can be clearly outlined. The Character of AMFP speaks to himself in a similar way like the Protagonist of Dear Esther and even the voice itself seems to be identical (althoug i dindn't researched this further). The miss of a psycholocical reaction of the protagonist (transfered to the player through a blurring vision and sound effects) is an other reason for beeing different from TDD. Also the Lamp in AMFP begins to flicker when ever you are near an evil creature so you have more than a fair warning to turn it off to not atract them. This seems familar to the ones who have played the Silent Hill Series (the static of your Radio) but under the circumstances of AMFP destroys every scaryness that was left.  So my Spoiler Free conclusion is that this game can be played but shouldn't be expected to be an Amnesia Game. I will now proceed to the parent of TDD -&gt;Penumbra of which i expect that it will be much more like TDD an not a crippled apendix like AMFP.  (Spoiler alert) Never the less I in some points enjoyed AMFP. Especially the first Chapter in wich we explore the House of the Protagonis named Madnus. The estate that he calles home is perforated by secret passages and you get to know he photographed his beloved bathing wife. At this point I will not explain the story furthermore, becaus there are many detailed plot resumés on the net. On thing that I thing was a really good Idea ist the snorting sound that the Lamp makes when you are turning it off. I don't know if this sound is there from the start on because i first realised it beeing in the depths of the machine. I nearly fell from my chair so terrefing was it.  I hope this review gives you the fair chance to deside if you want to buy A machine for Pigs or not.  747mike747",

I mean the Chinese Room is great, don't get me wrong, they did great on Dear Esther, which was a game designed for the interactive story novel they do. Amnesia... Is just not what was ment for that.  Now how about those monsters? They most certainly are strange here. You don't ever see them as often as you do in TDD, and you can have so many insites as to where they are to avoid them in your game (aka: having your sound up and your lantern). And from what I noticed while playing is that they don't necesarrily chase you like the monsters in TDD did.  This game is also just way more linear than it's predecessor. You can't vary off on new choices for new endings; it's just that one path that leads to the same thing over and over. That was certainly a major loss on the game.

I'd love to review this without having to revoke the nostalgia of the first game, but the fact remains that this is a sequel, and as such, I expect a progression from the elements in the first game. Sadly, Machine for Pigs opts to remove many elements that made The Dark Descent fun instead of improving upon them. For example, the sanity meter added uniqueness to the first game and made the prospect of even encountering a monster into a terrifying prospect. Now, however, you can just stroll right past the monsters or stare at them from safety without ever feeling threatened. And even if a monster catches you, all you need to do to restore health is wait in a corner for a little while as you automatically heal (like in a modern FPS). The lack of an inventory also means puzzles are much simpler, almost as if they intentionally dumbed it down for me.   The game has its merits, however. I enjoyed the story (though somewhat predictable) and the fantastic writing (though somewhat chatty), and the build-up of tension before the first monster is truly unnerving. However, the tension was easily broken by a pop-up telling me my game had crashed, a problem that persisted (and then reappearred at another point in the game) even as I took the settings down to embarassingly low qualities. My computer can play much bigger games at great quality with no hassle, so I don't understand why this six-hour, single-mode game was causing so much of a problem. It was the frustration I experienced resolving this issue that finally convinced me that my anticpation for a sequel worthy of the Amnesia name had been a mistake.",

Developpers The Chinese Room (Dear Esther) removes much of the player agency and challenges present in Amnesia : A Dark Descent, made by Frictional Games, leaving it closer to a bare directed linear narrative. The overhanging sense of dread from the former title is lessened and the actual frights are few, as you are seldom challenged or actually in any danger. The weaknesses of A Machine for Pigs as a game are glaring, but its strengths often manage to outshine them.   The game is not so much scary as it is truly eerie and suspenseful. The narrative is superbly anchored in its Historical period and draws from it a disturbing and impactful tale of poetic horror. The dread of A Machine for Pigs, rather than residing in the unknown of the dark and in the rush of blood of pursuit, lies in fleshing out the darkest sins of humanity. The ending of the game is both beautiful and haunting. Over hundreds of game played, it is undoubtedly one of if not my favourite ending of all time. There is something so poetic, grandiose and terrifying about it that stays simmering in your head long after you've finished it.  This game is worth experiencing, but be wary as it explores completely different grounds than its excellent cult classic predecessor. The gameplay aspects may be franctly underwhelming, but the narrative absolutely surpasses that of A Dark Descent and of all other horror games I did play through.

Only rarely do I venture into the genre myself, mainly due to the abundance of games reliant on jumpscares to create the 'horror'. As one who greatly prefers psychological horror games as opposed to the rather cheap jumpscare variety, this was the main appeal of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and so this review is written by a player who had expected an atmospheric, psychological horror game in its sequel, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.  Game: Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs Traditional Rating: 5/10 Recommended: Yes  Firstly, it is important to note that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is pretty much only an 'Amnesia' title in name alone. While the controls remain perfectly similar to that of The Dark Descent, this serves as one of the few reminders of its predecessor throughout the whole game, save for the occasional reference to the original title in the story/lore. If you found the controls in The Dark Descent to be good and practical, it is the same in this title. If this is your first delve into Amnesia, you will find the controls easy to learn and manage.  In terms of gameplay, however, A Machine for Pigs is quite limited. It essentially consists of the barebones of The Dark Descent - exploring your surroundings to find out how to progress, while hiding/running from any monsters that you encounter. You are defenceless - much like in the original Amnesia - and this serves as a source of the horror found within the game - if you're spotted by an enemy, there is nothing that you can do but run. While the essence of an Amnesia title exists in this respect, A Machine for Pigs feels quite lacking. There is no 'sanity meter' in this game, which served as either an excellent mechanic in the original, or a mild pain, depending on your preference. There is therefore no need to try and avert your character's view from disturbing events, or even any need to stay in the light to preserve your sanity. The lantern which you obtain very early on in the game serves as an unlimited light source, removing any need to scavenge for tinderboxes or oil containers to illuminate your surroundings. It feels like part of the horror is therefore removed - entering a new area with limited light sources would be much scarier than having an unlimited, portable light source. If you found it difficult to progress in The Dark Descent, or if you aren't great with puzzles, then you can find solace in the fact that the 'puzzles' in A Machine for Pigs are incredibly simple, easing your progression through the game.  The atmosphere of A Machine for Pigs is sometimes unsettling, but not overwhelmingly so. It uses many tried-and-tested tactics of previous horror titles to create this atmosphere, so those who frequently play horror games will not find many surprises in the tactics used by the developers to unsettle the player. Indeed, considering my inexperience with the horror genre and the fact that I am quite easily scared, A Machine for Pigs did not really seem particularly scary to me. It is significantly less scary than its predecessor, so if you were expecting an escalation of the atmospheric horror found in the original, you will not find this in A Machine for Pigs. However, there were some rather creepy ambient sounds and pieces of music used throughout the game that could make you a little nervous, though these aren't particularly distressing. The music, too, fit the mood of the game quite nicely.  The story in A Machine for Pigs definitely picks up towards the end - as you might expect, you begin with little-to-no memory of previous events and put the pieces together throughout the game. The majority of the story is told naturally throughout the game, while additional writings and pieces of information can be found scattered around the game's various locations, never far from the intended path. While the story was quite good, it was also quite predictable. Initial hunches (which I won't divulge) about a couple of aspects of the game's narrative were proved to be correct, which unfortunately removed any real chance of surprise from a narrative point of view. The game's ending was more satisfactory than the rather lacklustre ending to A Dark Descent, I found. However, it is a very short game, clocking in at around 4-5 hours at a fairly slow pace, including hunting down the additional notes throughout the game.  To conclude: although the game is a step-down from its predecessor, I would recommend A Machine for Pigs if you wish to experience the story of the game and explore an additional sample of the Amnesia universe. As a horror experience, however, you could do a lot better. There is little horror to be found in A Machine for Pigs, even when the monsters are present. It is perhaps akin to dipping your toes in the water of the Amnesia universe - if you want to take the plunge, look no further than The Dark Descent.",

It's atmosphere was amazing, slamming doors, creaks, sounds of death, and the latter.  But for this game, it's different. When Frictional Games let The Chinese Room take hold of this, one of the few good things that came out were a very nice artistic appeal. Amazing graphics, and a slightly intriguing story(and I emphasise on slightly heavily). The thing is, the wandered away from the atmosphere, which is the heart and soul of the Horror Genre. They primarily focused on the complexity of the story, the contraptions, hiding places, I could go on. As soon as I was dropped into the game, I felt that I was being held along the game all the way. No helpful hints in-game to help me, but it was as if there were huge arrows pointing towards the 'complex' puzzles. This can be a nitpick depending on the gamer, for me, it is annoying to see this. But, this is just versatile to the gamers.  Overall, this game isn't as good if you played the previous, but is quite nice graphics-wise. I say that Frictional Games should have worked on atmosphere and story, while The Chinese Room worked on graphics. It may have been able to be one of the few best Horror games of 2013.

However, there is no denying that 'A Machine for Pigs' is not as strong as its predecessor. The puzzles are far too simple, necessary only for maintaining an added level of interaction with the world. And, there aren't as many 'risky' moment.  In addition to this, a lot of gameplay elements from 'The Dark Descent' have been removed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. The removal of many of these elements augments the game's focus on exploration. However, those elements are part of what made the puzzles in 'The Dark Descent' so strong, and the dangerous moments all the more frightening. And there are no new elements to bring everything together.  That being said, there are many moments where 'A Machine for Pigs' shines. The atmosphere, created through the carefully crafted environment, nearly stands on its own. Surprisingly, the lack of enemies sharply increases the anxiety; Imagination is potent.  The story is the strongest part of the game, arguably stronger than the original. 'The Dark Descent', while truly a masterpiece, told a story that was very cold and distant. In 'A Machine for Pigs', the story is uncomfortably, very human. Love and compassion are at the core of this story, at the heart of an impending madness. Painted sharply is a potent picture, not just about society, but also about people.  As good as the story is, the use of complex words and language often makes it difficult to follow at times (I must admit that the use of this type of language is a perfect match for Mandus). However, the story shines during the moments that simple language is used in a precise and clever way, leading to some horrific revelations.  'The Dark Descent' is a game where all elements came together perfectly, something that happens rarely, something that 'A Machine for Pigs' does not achieve. Despite this, I enjoyed it tremendously. For me, it is a worthy successor to Amnesia.",

The new developer's slant on the series takes everything that made Amnesia:The Dark Descent what it was and pushes it in a more narrative direction.  This is still clearly an Amnesia game - all the physical representations of the character's increasing fear are still present: the blurred screen, the panicked breathing, the random hallucinations. It just has slightly different priorities. There is a story to tell and anything that would get in the way of that has been dealt with. Death results in a respawn to the closest safe space and possibly even the removal of the threat that killed you. Puzzles are made obvious by journal entries and the solutions are never far away. The levels are designed to offer only a few directions at a time, so as easy as it is to get turned around in the dark, it's never hard to get back on track. The old oil lantern has been converted to a more modern electric model and has a near infinite charge. It only needs to be put away to rest every once in a while; there's no fuel or power to watch slowly drain out. The character is in less jeopardy than in the first game, so A Machine For Pigs ends up being less frightening most of the time. The horror now comes from the slow revelation of how appalling the state of affairs has become. This is not a game that wants to scare its players with threats or challenges; its sole focus is on the macabre tale at hand. It's a good thing then that the tale is so compelling.",

Amnesia: A machine for pigs also has an atmosphere I like and some scares. I understand why some people gave this game a negetive review. It's because they are still used to the dark decent, but I am greatful that we have a second amnesia game.  Amnesia: The dark decent--9/10  Amnesia: A machine for pigs-- 7/10  ",

This was done in the hope that removing things like inventory management (combining items etc) and consumables like lamp oil and tinder boxes would cause less distraction from the incredible atmosphere in this game.  It's much shorter than the first and due to the lack of an inventory etc it's much simpler in terms of puzzles. However, its just as terrifying.  The level design is great and if you enjoyed the first one you'll enjoy this. In fact, the stories don't appear to be linked in any way so you could play this before the first.. whatever.  Again a great horror game and highly recommended.",

However the horror is completly different and the story, although a little confusing in the start, is amazing! The way I felt about half way through was nothing less than a fearless, angry and combat-ready mix of pure awesomeness... (dont know what i just wrote).",

The gameplay is quite the same though there is no inventory. I totally recommend it. We need more games like this.",

            "review_text": "This is an alright scary game, but certainly nothing like the original Amnesia. The original Amnesia triumphs this game in almost every subject. Amnesia: The Dark Decent (TDD), was unique, original. Intriguing, and all around rollercoaster. The sound effects in TDD were so vivid, so lively, and the flashbacks had such rich audio; Chains dragging along the stone floor, footsteps scuffing along with them, men pleading so mercy as Daniel tortured them. You could hear every detail in the flashbacks, and its what makes Amnesia: The Dark Decent so great. But Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs (MFP) tries to emulate the same expiriences. But 10 minutes into the game, I personally can feel the difference between the two. MFP is sluggish, and while kinda scary, not anywhere near TDD. Frictional Games developed The Dark Decent. The Chinese Room developed Machine For Pigs. I can definitely feel the difference between the developers. The Chinese Room tries to emulate Amnesia, and. Quite frankly. Failed. It is a good game in its own right, but it definitely is not Amnesia. One thing worth mentioning though, in MFP, the voice actors are on, point. The audio for the voices are 100% perfect. So clear, and every time the main character spoke, made me feel better about the pig thats trying to ♥♥♥♥ me.",
