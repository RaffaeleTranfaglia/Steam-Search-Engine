            "review_text": "If the 'lightgun' section was more finely tuned (like the recent mobile port of Mad Bullets), then the rest isn't so bad, it would still be an odd mix of genres; but could work. However, dear lord please fix these things:  - have the exploding barrels actually do something to the approaching zombies or get rid of them, they just obscure the nonsense swarming in this game. - have firing the weapon give you better visual feedback. - stop having so many layers of enemies flying at you at different speeds when they pass through one another. - Also in the later waves it needs way better click recognition, either that or the head hitboxes are rubbish when body shots are worthless. Stuck at the 'kill 75 zombies' level because of a combination of these things.  This has the potential to not be one of the worst games on Steam. I truly believe that playing this for nearly an hour is the least productive thing that I have ever done in video games.",
