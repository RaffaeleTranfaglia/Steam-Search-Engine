            "review_text": "Although more easy to navigate than the murder mystery game by EnsenaSoft, I still find it hard to completely emerge myself in this one. Solving the puzzles is kind of tricky because there are no hints as to what to do, so you end up looking at them like wtf until you accidently get it right without knowing what you did...Reading through some of the reviews I see that you can complete the game without completing all the puzzles. I don't think that is a very good game mechanic and it ruins the whole thing for people.",
