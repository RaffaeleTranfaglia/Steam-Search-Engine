Papers, Please has no right to be possibly the best PC game of 2013 I've played. Papers, Please is all of these things.  The gameplay of Papers, Please is more or less a tedium simulator. It's Paperwork: The Game. And yet, you know that you need to process as many of these poor people as you can so that your family won't starve. You know that the old lady who you just denied will probably never see her son again; you know the young man you just let through has less than glorious ambitions in your city. Will you support the rebels? Will you toe the party line? Will you let the young lady through, even though her passport is clearly fake, because her fiance was just before her and bribed you to do so? The choice in this game is staggering, and the simplicity of the game itself allows for complete assimilation of your mind into the mind of your character. You feel bad when your child gets sick, but you know that food is sometimes more important than heat.  Papers, Please is a work of video game brilliance - a work of art. I give it seven out of seven stars.",

            "review_text": "Two years ago I was detained on my way into America. I was taken away from the line, seperated from my passport and dumped in a bleak empty room filled with lines of chairs and people in various states of distress. Nobody told me what was happening. Occasionally an agent would appear at the back of the room and give passports to some of the people waiting, who left quickly and quietly. At one point an elderly man went up to the desk and begged to be let through, to be met with ice-cold condescension.  After about half an hour I was called through into the back room. There I was told to sit down in front of a man called Keane, on a desk filled with papers. Keane never looked at me. He asked where I was going and why I was going there. When I said I was visiting my girlfriend he leered and asked me if it was 'true love'. When I asked him whether I'd been pulled out of the line for a reason or if it was a random check, he told me it 'wasn't random'. When I asked him if I would make my flight in 20 minutes, he told me that it depended how fast I could run.  Eventually Keane gave me my passport back and told me to 'lift my heels up'. I missed my flight by minutes. I waited for an hour for the next flight and then another hour on the plane for it to take off.  This game made me feel sorry for Keane.  10/10, would feel empathy against my will again",

I know it sounds dull, but let me tell you that it is absolutely not. It's challenging and interesting, even if the game lasts just a few hours.   With every level you play new challenges are unlocked and near the end of the game you have to take into consideration the many aspects of an inspection.  There are many moral choices to be made and in total there are 20 endings so there's also more than enough replayabily. An endless mode is also included so this game is neverending. You could play this game your whole life and not get bored. Ok, maybe after a few years you'd get bored, but theoretically you could just go on and on.  The graphics have a retro Russian vibe that really impressed me. And the soundtrack isn't very long, but what's there is very good. The song that was played during the credits was actually great.  In the end Papers Please was a delight to play. If only more games had gameplay this fun and an idea this original. Get this as soon as you have some money.  Glory to Arstotzka !  [Rating: 90/100]",

            "review_text": "Papers, Please is one of those games where you go in expecting to not like it. The graphics are retro (terrible compared to most other games available today), the controls overly simplistic, the music very repetitive. There are no voice actors; every conversation is shown by moving text bubbles. Finally, there is only one setting and you are completely stationary.   Put all of the above together and you would think that this is one of the most terrible games of the decade. But you would be wrong. Despite its simplicity, despite its repetitiveness, this is one of the most in depth, thought provoking games I've played in years. And with 20 different endings, there is plenty of replayability.  If you haven't played this game, you're missing out.",

That man is line behind him. The note implores you to let this killer into the country, so that the man can find him and take revenge for his son. Or, you can detain the killer and have him taken by the police.  However, on top of all this, you have a sick family at home. Your own son is very ill and you need money for food and medicine. You could be seriously penalized for letting EITHER of these men through if they don't have proper paperwork. Hell, do you even know if the man will be able to CATCH this killer? What if he fails? You'll have let a murderer walk freely into the country.  You have to make a decision quickly because any time you waste means less money for your family.  This is the kind of scenario you deal with in this game. At first it feels like just the bleak observational game where you just look at paperwork and allow/deny access. But as the game goes on, you'll be presented with these moral quandries that really test you. Any decision you make, be it morally good or bad, saintly or selfish, could have a range of consequences. Which winds up making the game incredibly curious and makes you want to keep going to see what happens.",

So deceitful it is then, because few things are more addicting. While playing, I kept finding myself thinking 'Just one more day, one more then off to bed'. Five hours later, it's 5AM and I'm due at work in three hours. No regrets here, either. The gameplay is simple but deep, and the story branches like a visual novel. Plus it's the only game I've ever played to truly make me actually feel -BAD- for doing what the game tells me to. Video game history teaches us that morality is black and white. Papers reveals how evoke it with more gray area than I ever thought a game could, and it's crazy how easily it does so.  There's a reason this game was voted GoTY by so many publications, and touted as simply amazing by gamers far and wide. Quirky, fun, addictive - you owe it to yourself to play this gem.

This is where speed and attention comes to play, if you lack speed then you won't attend to many 'costumers', making you earn less money and if you lack attention and don't detect the discrepancies then you will get penalized for the people that either enters without being allowed or deny the ones that are clear to pass, easy, right?

You have to manage money and juggle with it if you can't be fast at going through the people in line.  I really like how there are different outcomes, coming from your choices and everything you did. There is not really a story behind the game on its own. It's not about the inspector, not about the paperwork, not about the people in line. It's about it as a whole. As I've seen somewhere, very well pointed out, it can be compared to the Wall of Berlin.  Anyway. If you come here expecting a lot of action, I will be pretty straight forward with you. There is not much action and the gameplay is slow-paced. I still recommend this, though, it is a nice game and really gets your concentration on point.",

Yes, this game is unlike many other video games because it is poignant and is attempting to make some very serious social commentary.  Briefly, you are a customs agent for a country vaguely reminiscent of Cold War era Russia. Your job is to check the paperwork of all people attempting to enter your country. Those who check out are permitted to enter and the rest are either rejected or detained.  Your job is only part of the story. After work every day you struggle to provide food, heat, and medicine for your family. You can make more money if you process paperwork faster but this often results in mistakes and fines threatening to send you into debt or worse.  This game is not like a restaurant worker simulator because it has a clear message. Well, even the restaurant simulators are maybe suggesting you have some empathy for overworked servers.  This game makes a more serious point: Border crossings are dehumanizing for both those attempting to cross as well as for the employees. Those travelling are subject to invasive searches, embarassing questions, endless lines, and the potential for political violence against their persons. The employees in turn begin to treat the travellers not as humans but as cattle or a meal ticket. These workers must carry out the often arbitrary regulations of their country in a way that often divides famliers and destroys lives.  This is not a game that one can play forever. It is good for a couple play throughs and maybe a little exploration of the bonus modes. It does not take very long to get to the heart of this game. After a short time of playing you will start to feel hollow inside. And that is the point.  I cannot think of a game that has engaged the hearts and minds of players to contemplate very real political problems in this way. In closing, the game is not fun. The game is terrible. And this is the point.",

The trailer literally nails what the game is about and does a good job of it. I found myself playing for an hour easily the first time I played. It literally delivers what it is designed to and isn't meant for a person who cannot sit still and analyze the finer details required to meet the games challenge demands. I like it as it forces me to pay attention. There are surprises in the game and nothing works exactly as it's supposed to. You may be offered a bribe half way through the game, and if you take it, you may get away with it. However, you may get caught down the line and then thrown in prison. Subsequently, you must try your best to keep your family alive. Money pays for heat and health needs of the family. Upgrades are also available for the booth, as well as your dwelling. You will run into an assortment of characters (to say the least) that will keep you on your toes.   Graphics are basic. Is this bad? Not at all as the person who did the designs was extremely careful in what they were trying to achieve. Sounds do not have much of a variation, but I guarantee you'll be repeating what the guy on the loud speaker says every time you click it.

Especially if you like to try your hand at beurocratic tasks in a video game in an exciting way. It's monotonous, but enjoyable. I know it's less than 20 hours to get 100%, but I logged in (at the time of this writing) at least 43 hours of gameplay. It's that good.  You play as an unknown inspector who was elected through a lottery to work   as a security guard running a graveyard shift at Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria for 5 nights  as a border inspector between the cursed Kolechia and the wonderous motherland Arstotzka for one month. But you have a time limit in which you can work, which adds pressure to your performance. Inspect more and provide the correct responses quickly to get paid more. Make mistakes and it'll come out of your paycheck after 2 free warnings a day. By the end of the day, you'll need to pay for rent, food (optional), heat (optional), medical bills (optional if heat or food is neglected), and various other opportunities. You play as a father providing for your family. If your family dies (or other conditions occur), the game is over. It's also a plus that it throws in ethical dillemas to keep you on your toes.  People say this game is communistic and I'd say I agree with their statements. You are playing in a job you did not choose and are dissuaded from trying to make more than you actually do...which makes it understandable why people would take bribes in communistic or socialist countries.  There are various paths you can take to different endings. You can choose to complete your tasks in a purely beaurocratic manner for the motherland Arstotzka, you can help aid in a revolution for the Order of the EZIC Star, or you can escape Arstotzka by moving away with forged passports. The fate of the people, the nation, and your family are in your hands.   PROS: Addicting gameplay Great (yet simple) story Great challenges Nice Puzzles (if you choose to work for EZIC) Implementation of ethical dillemas No bugs Randomized portraits and stats based on a database (great programming) Arstotzka (Joke pro. XD)  CONS: Limited music choices No planned sequel at this point Can be infuriating if you make mistakes Not all moral/ethical choices are judged/rewarded May be too bland/boring/monotonous to some (Not for me, but there are times where it can feel dull) Kolechia (Okay, that's a joke con. Just making sure you're reading these. lol)   This game is a great experience that seems simplistic, yet is so much more. You can lose yourself for hours at a time playing this game. I cannot say whether or not it's worth full price, but if it is on sale, you would have to be crazy to not grab it. This game truly competes with 'Triple A' First Party companies and proves that indies can be great things.   9/10 Glory to Arstotzka!",

Another thing that really clicks with Papers, Please and I is the genuine question towards morals and work. Do you let a senile, old woman through the checkpoint after pleading and begging for your mercy? At the cost of your entire career?

Upon interrorgation, you can detain them (like if they have weapons or forged papers) or let them through. There are some moralistic choices along the way. For instance, one husband has all the correct paperwork, but his wife is next in line with missing paperwork. Do you let her through and risk a citation or deny her because of the rules?   As the game progresses, there are more and more information you have to keep an eye on. Even the tiniest error can glaze over your eyes like mismatched gender and weight on the paperwork.

            "review_text": "In a world where many people don't realize a 'visa' isn't always a credit card, Papers Please seems like a pretty odd concept. A game where you stamp passports, being careful to abide by the ever-increasing rules and regulations of your dystopian public employers that are subject to the hopeless political climate of your war-torn and espionage-filled region, tends to stand out amongst the current plethora of green-lit retro platformers.   Despite my own life-long love for a good sidescroller, I have to say Papers Please is the most engrossed I've been in a game in quite a while. When you're not lost in the bureaucratic fever dream of scanning each and every entrant's documentation - of which more and more will be required as time goes on and governments play dirtier - you're juggling funds for your family's food, heat, medicine, and possibility of moving up from the 'Class-8' dwellings that sound only a notch better than homelessness.   What's more, it comes as no surprise that those around you are looking to do the same; almost each day of the game has someone with missing or faulty documentation and an excuse to go along with it. Reuniting two long-lost loves, aiding an underground resistance group, allowing a woman on death-row in her home country with no documentation to enter with her allowed husband, allowing a child serial killer in (rather than detaining him) so a vengeful father of a little girl can exercise his own justice, and the repeated attempts of a happy-go-lucky drug dealer who tries entering with a crayon passport are all decisions left up to you, keeping in mind the 2-citation limit you get per day before being docked much-needed pay.  And honestly, when you see a citation pop up that wasn't on purpose, that ♥♥♥♥ing fax-machine sound and a pink slip popping up? Your heart ♥♥♥♥ing sinks. You feel like an idiot. And worst of all, who knows what sort of scumbag you just let into the country scot-free after a long day of rejecting numerous people whose intentions and needs were possibly far more innocent than their lack of documents would suggest.   Still, the game has its faults. 'Booth upgrades' are simple hotkeys to make your job a smidge faster that many seem to not want to use anyway. The sound leaves a lot to be desired - there's basically 3 gibberish-y voice lines that are reused throughout each line of dialog ('baebaz', 'hiyakku', 'oushtod'), the game has a nearly overwhelming amount of endings (many of which feel more like a depressing Game-Over than an ending), and some things like the benefits of upgrading your apartment are poorly explained.  But play this game, and be mindful about it. Don't fall into the the ♥♥♥♥ing 'Glory to Arstotzka!' memespouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, don't treat it like Dystopian Despot Simulator XDDD 2013 and then toss it away without trying the other playstyles, and think about how immigration, customs, and bureaucracy affect you and all those in the world for better or worse, right down to the individual working at the desk.",

This is about as indie as indie games get, and also as brilliant as they get. It takes such a simple thing, and wraps it up in politics, real-world parallels, and perhaps even some genuine feels to make you feel more invested in the fate of a fictional immigration officer than you ever would about a generic grimacing action hero.   But drama and intelligence aside, it's also surprisingly fun, with a very smooth difficulty curve that makes you feel your own skills improving just enough to meet the game's increasing demands. It even comes with some bonus high score modes that you could conceivably see yourself playing. It tells an interesting, branching story through simple means while also somehow managing to make boring real life work into entertainment I want more of.

This time in the form of a disturbingly farmiliar dystopian society known as Arstotzka.

In the world of Papers, Please, you play as an unnamed protagonist, a mid level beaurocrat, working in a border checkpoint that seems like a parallel to East and West Berlin in the 80s. We can only assume these countries are roughly based on the Soviet Union or other Soviet influenced republics. The graphic style has an appropriately grey and muddled appearance that fits the situation very well. The gameplay is deliberately dull, which may be difficult for some to appreciate. As you go down the line, you begin to work in a rhythm. As you gain this rhythm you have satisfaction for catching frauds and it becomes fun in a droning, dull way. Later into the game you may look up, horrified, and realized that you have become a cog in the machine. You have begun processing people and are shocked with how you can dehumanize them in such a way. Sometimes you want to help others, but your family is still barely hovering above the poverty line. How can you keep them alive without accepting bribes or perhaps sending a poor traveller back to their home country where they will die because they do not have the correct papers?

All of this is important because you won't see innovation from some big company; you will find it from some indie developer called Lucas Pope. A man who used to work for Naughty Dog Studios working on the beaten to death series Uncharted broke free and decided to do his own thing.   This game just surprised me from every aspect and I just wanted more and more. The gameplay consist of reading things carefully and making sure everything matches to what it is supposed to be. If things don't match or seem fishy you will deny or detain a person. Sounds easy at first but you must do all this under a strict clock. You get money for every person you deny or pass, but you do thing wrong and you get fined for it. And you need this money to pay rent, feed your family, keep them warm, and healthy. You can barely get enough money to do all of these things for your family. You need to manage your money very carefully.    This game is maybe one of the best games I played in my life.

In the beginning, all you have to do is check for one or two things. By the end, there's a massive list of potential things that could be wrong with some of the paperwork.   I didn't believe the person who told me this game would be super fun. I picked it up for 75% off during a Steam sale anyway, because they raved about how good of a game it was. When I tried it, I understood. It's extraordinarily fun. I can't recommend it enough.

Everything works as you'd expect, display, input, audio... no major problems. There's just a rare issue with certain lines of text having a whole row of pixels chopped off, but it doesn't affect readability (if it happens on Windows too, then it's all ok).

This game forces you into a situation where you have to do your job near-perfectly to get enough money for your family to survive and be happy, but that involves screwing over a lot of helpless people in situations similar to yours! Will you work hard, not questioning the authorities and provide for your family; or do you make a sacrifice to help the common folk? That's up to you! A lot of other things go on, but I'll leave you to discover that because it's pretty mind blowing on your first play through! (As the game says, it's a Thriller)  The gameplay is also surprisingly fun for a game about checking over paperwork, it involves a lot of thought and skill! It is extremely unique and it constantly throws new rules onto your job based on the events that happen in the game world, changing up the gameplay and making it more interesting day by day!   The game also has a lot of replay value, with many different endings you can achieve and lots of different ways the story can drive forward based on your choices each day. You can replay any day or start a completely new game at any time without losing the progress of later days, so they give you full freedom to experiment and retry when things don't go how you wanted them to!   You see all these people saying that video games can't be an art form, and this game can't be further from the truth. After playing this, no one could deny that video games are an art form. Just buy it now because you'll love it and you need to support true innovative and artistic games. BUY IT! I'm waiting...  Bought it yet? No? Why the f*** not!?",

            "review_text": "While the first glimpse says to a store-wanderer ''boring, boring, boring'', this idea is completely false. Papers, Please is the complete opposite of boring.  Taking place in a fictional   semi-corrupt semi-just-want-MIA-members-kept-in-place   country named Arstotzka, you play as a border control agent, accepting or denying job-seekers, immigrants and criminals. While this game's first few hours/minutes (depending on how quick your fingers are and how long it takes to strain them dragging documents around your messy desk) are quite dull, the people I saw in just that little amount of gameplay made me rage, laugh and stare. This is a brilliant attribute as it jolts the brain and your emotions to a flying start. Time to time the game gets harder and more time-consuming, but still follows the same laugh-rage experience. It also displays attributes of a shooter - you will sometimes see a terrorist attack and have the power to stop one at your protagonist's twiddling fingers.   It also gives you opinions and puzzles   (including the bomb some idiot thought would kill off an inspector and all the guards surrounding him)  , like managing your expenses and doing whatever it takes to not be arrested for giving a single document to the police. While this isn't too frequent it still makes you happy there's a change in the game and you have some freedom.   Graphics-wise the game is pixellated, but looks lovely at the same time. This style fits the time the game was set, as I just thought, considering it is set in the 80s, a time when 8-bits were first introduced. It also displays musical talent, and the theme makes me want to go on a march in synchronization with it.   So, overall, I'd say Papers, Please, from such a simple idea, turns out to be one of my favourite games of all time, and I congratulate Dukope for making such a brilliant game.  10/10. Glory to Arstotzka.",

A cold war based theme set in 1982 where you decide on the entrance of people into your country, the 'Glorious' Arstotzka. The game difficulty starts slowly as you check the validity of people's documents at the border. This continues to build as more complex events occur adding more and more information to verify and new methods to test the stories of the masses. At the end of the work day, you are paid by how many people you processed and penalized for mistakes made. Your money is used to support your family, providing as good a living as you can for the necessities of life: Rent, food, heat, medicine. It is a serious challege to process as many as you can while not letting criminals, terrorists, and other 'undesirables' into your country.  A word about the graphics: they are intentionally low end to give the feel for what games were back in the 80's. Nevertheless, what gamers often times fail to remember, it is the imagination that is the most important piece of play. Many of you will recall how the BEST and most fun you had as a kid was when you had a tree branch sword, a pine cone grenade, or a fort made of boxes. This frame of mind is nearly lost on the current generation as graphics have all but stunted their ability to dream and pretend. This game deserves a look for the price, currently $5. Those of you who remember the cold war era will laugh at the feel of the game, while those who do not may find that they actually have a great time with it as they strengthen 'the muscle of their imagination' that has been dormant for perhaps their whole lives.

The concept itself is let alone just brilliant but when laced with a great storytelling in which player can impact and with a gameplay that enhances the back-to-the-childhood feeling you get, Papers, Please is one to remeber. Just the ancient-sounding theme music brings an amused grin to your face - a reminder of the good old times. This is not easy game by any means, requires some brains and sharp eye but not in an annoying way. I found the difficulty very fitting and enjoyable.   Papers, Please may not offer something to play for a very long time right away (depends on person), that said it will surely exceed its value by far anyway in the hands of an average gamer. On the other hand I can see myself returning to this game in future, similarly as with e.g. Max Payne, DOOM, etc. I do not want to give spoilers - one's has to experience this game like it happens in it's story - out of the blue.

While working for the patrol you have to accept or deny people into the country based on their criminal record, ID, and etc. Some people try to forge documents and illegaly get into the country. You can choose to help the country with its corrupt government, or you can gain the trust of the country and try to destroy it from the inside.

Players take on the role of an immigration worker, checking passports and other paperwork at the border of a fictional country called Arstotzka. Your job is to make sure their paperwork is in order, and either let them pass into Arstotzka or turn them away. While this may sound like a simple, boring concept, it quickly becomes quite difficult, and the story kept me intrigued enough to keep playing long after it should have gotten boring. Players must balance duty with morality, while trying to bring in enough money to take care of the worker's starving, sick and cold family. Terrorists strike, family members die, and all along the way you must perform your job or risk being terminated. The simplistic 8-bit style graphics are not distracting: actually, they seem to add to the dreary, mundane atmosphere, allowing you to more fully immerse yourself in the dystopian world. There is a bit of comic relief (GLORY TO COBRASTAN!!!) but even with the minor comic relief, this game is dark and depressing in the most perfect way. It really makes the player think about society and political problems in a communist state, bringing up deep questions about humanity under the guise of a simple game. Definitely a must-play.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?  Click here to do that thing! ",

Maybe have the year of the game be in the 2000 year and have more different ppl trying to get though or possibly have a co-op mode one plays as inspector and the other plays as the security guard of the checkpoint?  either way if they were to make a second one I'd be more than willing to invest in the game if that what it takes for them to make a new one. If you have any doubts then just simply look it up on youtube, it is worth a try and is fairly cheap.   The bad thing I can think of this game is that the gameplay screen is a little too small for my liking BUT it hasn't ruined my experience of the game, it is a defo game to add to your library.

We learn to jump at the right time, hit the mark, ask the right question in the dialogue tree, navigate the maze, push the block, kill the enemy.   On the surface, Papers, Please is a game with novel mechanics about document examination. You play the role of a border control agent who must ensure that everyone's papers are up to date, authentic, and match the immigrant. You are given a rule book and are asked to highlight problems with the papers by matching up a rule to an offending line or image. In a couple of clicks, you tease out contradictions, stamp the passport Denied, and call for the next and the next.  As the game rolls along, new wrinkles and rules appear and the documents become more complex. The faster you work, the more salary you take home to care for your family, so it behooves you to master the mechanics and become an expert agent who doesn't make mistakes and processes the line impartially.  Over time, you come to realize that the game is asking more of you. It puts you in situations where it could be wrong to follow the rules you have invested so much time to learn. To deny the passport of someone's loved one. To take a bribe. To look the other way for a local official. To detain people for money.  In other words, the game asks you, in a way I found very emotionally honest, to stop playing so well.  The first time through, I did my best to follow all the rules in the book, for good or bad. I played the role of a faceless functionary. It was mechanical in every sense of the word. But the second time through, I let my conscience be my guide. To my surprise, things played out very differently.  This is the best trick of Papers, Please. It makes you uncomfortable to play. It asks you to stop and think about the no-win situation it hands you. It rewards you for changing your mind.  One of the best games of 2013.",

Then they require proof of vaccines as polio hits the country... then there are faces of the country's most wanted you must watch out for as well as doing your job.  The game becomes a test of your scrutiny and vigilance towards the documentation and dialogue as you approve or decline individuals and hope as you call 'next' that a little print out doesn't appear on your desk telling you why the last person's checks were incorrect.  You are monitored!  To add further problems, you encounter various characters coming through your booth. There is the chap who seems nice enough with his hand drawn passport but no you cannot just let through anyone! Then there is the guy who dumps a bomb at your window! Then there is the ever elusive order. It is up to you how you deal with this vigilante group. Do you support them with their promises to keep you safe or do you maintain your honesty and deny them their requests. At the same time there is corruption and you are ordered by your superiors to let certain individuals through against the rules.  At the end of every day you go home with whatever scrapings you made from bribes, rewards and efficiency at your work. You can save money by denying your family heat and food but they will get sick and you must pay for medicine.  This game for whatever reason is addictive!

Not to mention, reading all of the NPC talk with flimsy Russian accents amps the fun up by, like, ten fold. I'd definitely reccomend it.",

If you're looking for the perfect break from all the grindy MMOs and shoot-em-ups, this may be just the title you're looking for.  In Papers, Please, you play out the role of a border inspector working in a dystopian country. Each potential immigrant presents you with a set of papers that may or may not fit the rule of the law, and it's up to you to find discrepancies in the paperwork - and to occasionally let humanity win out and break the law to help others. It's a truly memorable game that you shouldn't miss if you have any interest in releases that help define gaming as an art form.",

It's very much an indie game and it really is a 'job simulator' or a 'paperwork simulator' so you would think that it would be pretty boring. Well, as my teenage daughter said when watching my wife play, 'it's sort of boring, but sort of interesting.'  I think what makes the game interesting is the story of a working class man in a fictional communist country trying to make ends meet at his bureaucratic job that pays him peanuts. He's got his own problems to deal with keeping his family fed, warm, and healthy. BUt as he goes through the motions everyday of stamping passports, allowing or denying people at his checkpoint, he is confronted sometimes with other people's problems. What does he do? Does he just follow the rules of his employer/government and cover his own butt? Or does he sometimes break the rules when seemingly honest people might be in trouble and might need help from him? I think it's this tension that makes the game interesting. It's not always clear what is the right thing to do.   You have to have a quick eye and pay attention to details in this game since you can make a little more money the more people you proces each day. But if you make too many mistakes and break the rules, then your bosses penalize you. So you have a lot of incentive to be merciless to those who sometimes approach you for help. So the game sort of encourages you to be a cold-hearted bureacratic machine and makes it hard to do what you think is the right thing to help someone in need. I think that is part of the tension that makes the game good. You can let someone through who doesn't have the right paperwork and your bosses will give you a warning about that, and that puts pressure on you to not make any other followup mistakes or you'll lose some of the little money you make.  The pixelated, retro graphics that are in this game seem to be all the rage these days with indie games these days, and I honestly am getting tired of the trend, but in this case the visuals really work well because they enhance the bleakness of the setting of the game.  This is definitely a game to try out if you are looking for a different gaming experience, especially if you can get it on sale.",

If you think you would make a good borders patrol, then test your knowledge and skill with this game. It starts easy, but you have to remember more as you progress through the game. You not only have to watch for face versus photo and expiration date, but you also have to remember which cities are valid places to get papers as well as checking to make sure all fields are filled in. How well you work determines how much money you make to help your family. This is not so different from real life. Work well and do your job correctly, your family will be well taken care of.

Attacking the dark subject of oppressive, totalitarian/dictatorship governments isn't quite as depressing when done with broken English, cookie-cutter pixel-people, and hilarious immigrants. The impersonality of the character you play - a nameless border inspector - and his job - turning countless people away from the border - allows the player to make the character his/her own through imagination and the decisions made during the work-day. One playthrough you may be a mindless drone, dedicated to country and government, following every rule to the t. The next you could be a rebel, aligning with guerilla groups to thwart your evil government. Maybe you're an altruist, taking every opportunity you can to help the unfortunate people seeking to cross your border, even when it means your family may have to go without heat for a night. This is where the seeming impersonality of the game gives it another advantage; while you must remove yourself from many a situation when denying one entry to your country, while most of the game is based upon reducing people down to ID supplements and passports, accepting and denying as names and faces bleed together, you still have a family to take care of, and still make the occasional friend on the job, have an authentic connection with a person. And when most interaction is cold and impersonal, that occasional friendship means all the more. Deciding how to respond when a rebel group asks you to assassinate someone seems all the more important when the entire day was spent in a mindless tedium of passports and ID cards. Yet while you may not have expected it out of yourself, deciding to aid a drug smuggler when it will allow your wife and son to eat dinner that night suddenly becomes a very easy decision.  This is a casual game to slip into, but once you’re playing, it requires intense concentration, as you try to process as many people as possible in a given day while scrutinizing numerous pieces of paper for the tiniest discrepancy. It is a simple, mindless game on the surface, yet at its core challenges the player to consider human rights and the consequences of his/her decisions from personal to international scales.  I highly recommend this game. Among the multitude of indie titles available on steam, Papers Please provides a unique, rewarding experience sure to leave the player thinking.

Oh? What's that! Papers,Please!  This game was a very, very interesing addition to my everygrowing list of games I should shake the hands of the developers of (Needs a catchier title)  It is a game where you play as an Immigration officer who is the only one in charge of the ENTIRE border control. Which means you have a workload, You have simply a Rule book, The news and a transcript and must make the important decision to accept or deny entry in to Arstotzka, You must carefully assess each bit of their passport, Entry tickets, Work permits, the rules change daily and to keep on top of them all is a difficult task indeed! For example on Day 1 You simply look for the passport and if all the details on that are up to scratch they are allowed in! If you get it wrong 3 times money begins to be deducted from your pay.  That last sentence influenced a lot in me, you have a family to care for who only living in a Class 8 dwelling will not survive long , you must get through enough people in a day to pay rent, Food and heat and sometimes your idiot Son goes and gets ill and you have to buy Medicine... That idiot! It toys with your emotions, you want to let this person in to see their Husband after they were separated after the war, but if you do you will directly be at blame and lose pay and possibly a Family member... See why I like this game alot!  Also the tension is insane! You have so much to think about in such little time it is hard not to become overhelmed and hide behind a convenient pringles can!   I highly recommend this game, the Tension it creates in currently unmatched and the fun you get out of it is addicting, It is also fairly cheap for what you get out of it! With exellence in its Music, Design and plot it is a massive contender for Game of 2013! Enjoy a Class 8 Dwelling folks!",

The year is 1982, and you work as an inspector at a border security checkpoint. Dozens of people flow past each day, and you must carefully examine each person's passport and then either approve or deny their application. As days go, the game also gets progressively harder. Immigrants will be required to have more and more documents, and the payroll stays the same, yet you must also provide food and warmth for your family. Political backstabbing and tension between countries may also come into play, due to the 6-year-war between Arstotzka and Kolechia.

This game is frustrating, obnoxious, confusing and not at all interesting. You are expected to (literally about 5 minutes in) memorize several gibberish names of cities for each of a bunch of countries. Then it tests that by changing only one letter in the name (a 'c' to a 'k' for example), so you need to memorize the spelling as well. You COULD check the map in the rule book but this takes forever and your family dies due to you not making enough money per day. At the same time, you are to check a myriad of other things for validity, many of which are never made clear to the player. It never told me I had to check ID number for validity and I still don't know what makes an ID number valid or not. I had to google how to tell a man that he needed a passport as this wasn't adequately explained either and the game refused to progress until I dealt with it.  On top of this, you need to make sure the passport photo matches, which is a complete crapshoot considering the character portraits lack any detail. Usually at least once a (in-game) day the game tells me I was wrong just because I don't know what constitutes a good enough match.  And this is all just a few levels in. Supposedly it gets considerably more tedious and confusing. Becuase that's somehow an enjoyable game mechanic? You actually have to UNLOCK hotkeys from the storyline. What.  On the plus side the music is pretty great.   I'd never recommend it, but apparently I'm the wrong one and everybody simply loves processing paperwork according to confusing, obnoxious, unexplained beaurocratic rules. I simply did not enjoy it.

Once you get to the stage where forgeries are possible, there are all kinds of stuff you have to watch out for; incorrect copies of a variety of symbols, incorrect cities f4rom various countries, and so on. It's not so bad at first, but having to do this faster and faster to save your starving family, it gets very annoying to have to flick through several pages to check symbols and city names.  This is a good game, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't my style. I found it too repetitive, and very hard to come to grips with in the first few rounds - my family died in three days because I couldn't process fast enough, didn't know what to look for. And later on, the fines get a lot harsher for the slightest mistake, you have to take bribes to survive and risk the fines, but simply missing one detail and getting a huge fine gets rather annoying.",

The bleak tone of a red state is presented well and should appeal to a child of the 80s who remembers the closing decade of the Cold War.  However most gamers in general may not enjoy the relentless bureaucracy; let me explain. Each in-game 'day' normally lasts 12 hours (about 10 real minutes) and your income depends on how many entrants you process (too many mistakes penalizes your income). In theory this is a good risk/reward balance and keeps things moving. In practice it gets pretty grueling.   If you don't have an eye and attention span for detail this game won't be very appealing. If you've ever worked a desk job it will feel very much like real-life work. On my second playthrough (achievement hunting) I actually found myself checking the in-game clock to see if my shift was almost over. That's when I realized I couldn't give this game a thumbs up to the general public in good conscious.  Lastly I do recommend this game to achievement hunters. It's not difficult, extremely inexpensive on sale and easy enough to get to 100% in &lt;10 hours.  Glory to Arstotzka, glory to relentless bureaucracy!",

The first days of the game introduce new concepts at a fast but manageable pace, steadily adding to the complexity of your task. Though the concept may sound boring, it's actually quite entertaining due to the colourful characters that appear at your booth (some are humorous, some address real-life issues like human trafficking), the puzzle work involved, the cheesy coldwar era communist state setting and the 'reward' overview at the end of every day.  I've only played a couple of hours yet, but am really enjoying the game. Only drawback I have identified is that sometimes people with ok documents and motives blow themselves up after I've granted them access to the country. I've 'retried' these people several times and can find nothing wrong. Maybe these are scripted events to increase difficulty?

I don't know what is with this game but it is magical.  Basically the game is about you being a border guard checking papers at a border between two fictional nations. It all gives the impression being in some sort of eastern-European state during behind the iron curtain during the Soviet era. Your task is to either admit och reject those who seek to enter based on the papers provided and the requirements set by your superiors. You simply scan these papers for faults. You have to do this fast enough to feed your poor family as the time is limited and you are paid per person reviewed. All errors lead to a salary reduction. Sometimes you stand between wrong admitting a person who just wish to be with its beloved, sometimes to accept bribes and sometimes you choose between aiding a terrorist organisation or fact the consequenses of not doing so.  I suppose it is all the context of the game that makes the magic. You strangely enough get sucked into it.",

Papers Please does just that, and the effortless and in-game language translation toggle is superb. I actually feel like this game was meant to be played in Russian given the bleak Soviet themes. I cannot speak for the other 6 or 7 languages offered, but I found that a replay of Papers Please (Докумктеы Пожалуйста) in Russian was as completely different and rewarding experience, one that I can actually apply in a real world setting.

I like the idea of really flipping through the pages of a book (in-game) looking for the references you need and comparing them to the documents presented to you. Feels really great. The addition of feeling the pressure of processing as many people's papers as you can possibly manage in one shift to earn as much money as you can so you can support your family is also great. You don't have vast expanes of time to sift through every possible thing there could be wrong about the documents or you simply won't earn enough money. That plus the fact that when you make too many mistakes your paycheck gets cut back makes this a nice challenge.

Add to that random events like terrorist bombings, people you have/can detain for human trafficking and it's quite a cool spin on the simulation genre.

The game starts you off tame and picks up momentum, forcing you to remember initial tasks and methods while learning new ones each day that passes. I had great fun in these mini-games (if that is what you would call them) such as denying a citizen or finding that tiny discrepency that allowed me to use an X-ray and find that contraband or weapon only to have the poor person hauled away (most likely for execution).   However, for whatever reason I stopped playing and although I have thought about picking back up where I left off several times over the past few months, I haven't been able to get myself to do so. This is where I ultimately land with this game, that is, its fun if you play it and stick with it (and if you have an interest in this sort of puzzle-ish, organizational memory-game). However, if you allow any amount of time in between playthroughs that is too great, I think you'll find it somewhat tedious and difficult to get back into the swing of things. If I were to go back now, I'd have to basically re-learn everything from the beginning just to keep up with where I was when I left off - and this is not the most appealing thought, at least to me.   Papers, Please is unique and definitely well crafted. The gameplay is tight, the visuals have a pleasing, retro feel, and the challenge is definitely there for those that love to one-up themselves on a second or third playthrough. It just, for several reasons mentioned and not (as I'm sure I missed a few), doesn't hold my interest enought to want to actually play it - and this is why I'd give P,P a 7.5/10.

It becomes almost impossibly to not assume the life and world presented to you within this game. After playing a few runs, I've still only been able to come out with one of twenty possible endings. I'm still going back to find the rest and, though I have to replay some basic gameplay, I'm not overwhelmed or upset with the idea of redoing previous actions. Of course, if you'd rather not start from scratch, you may pick up any game from any point. It's really a very well constructed title, and definitely worth the pricetag (even at full price).

I liked the fact that there are multiple endings, depending on the decisions you make in-game. Many of those choices reflect the tension of compassion vs duty but the tension was never really pointed or pronounced enough for me.   I liked how the game was designed in such a way as to allow you to go back and replay a day differently. That gives this game tremendous replay value.

The game took place in a foreign country boarder checkpoint and you as the man who was chosen from a random draw to check passport information. After you would complete said storyline you would unlock 'endless mode' which would enable you to play for as long as you desired.

The game has a good, detailed story mode plot and can end with any one of 20 different possible endings. This game (and its plot) appears to be heavily influenced by George Orwell but is also influenced heavily (as George Orwell was also heavily influenced) by Soviet Russia and its various border states. This game (which starts simple but becomes increasingly complex) is also often funny but in a very dry and tragic manner. For added replayability it also has two difficulty modes (one mode causes your character to be paid adequately while the other difficulty mode gives you inadequate pay). The amount of money you make affects your family who must be kept warm and be fed and if they are not, will suffer and die (in a sort of oregon trail style menu which says how poorly they are doing).   Ultimately, this is a desktop game which can be quickly opened and closed like a round of solitaire which tests your gameplay ethics in a situation which is, to say the least, full of ethical uncertainty and injustice. The biggest downside to this game is that it can get boring pretty fast (the ugly colors, the ugly graphics the 1 piece of music the game has, the paper-shuffling gameplay all contribute to this) requiring a break from it now and then. This is still a good game if played for short durations and a nice reminder of how bad it can be (even (if not especially) if you really try hard to be upstanding citizen) in a soviet-fascist styled nation-state. And it has dry humor. Don't forget the dry humor because that's a whole lot of what makes this game as good as it is. That and the really cheap price. No bugs.",

            "review_text": "A 'document simulator.' You review documents of an endless, dreary parade of people trying to enter your crappy country from one of its crappy neighbors, granting or denying entry as you see fit. Some sort of omnipotent oversight system penalizes you for technical mistakes. Or technical *cough*'mistakes,' since that last guy slipped you a $20, causing your finger to slip and hit the wrong button, of course.  An excellent diversion from the usual videogame moral dichotomy of 'to be or not be an (donkey is censored?),' where there's actual difficulty in making a decision. As you're usually some variant of The Chosen One, games have to find a way to let you keep playing even if you prove to be a total (censored, evidently) who no one would ever trust to do anything. As such, you're usually free to be as much of a (censored again) as you'd like, and some characters might scowl at you differently, but otherwise with little or no consequence. Or to chase the carrot-on-a-stick they included to try and get you to  not  do so. In Papers, Please, however, I feel they've done a much better job giving your choices positive  and  negative consequences. Do you help the rebels, knowing it could lead to your imprisonment or death? How about if it can lead to your  family's  imprisonment? Do you let a probably-not-terrorist trying to escape an even worse country in, if it means you can pay rent? Or that it could result in a demerit? Do you let your boss violate the rules he continually berates you with? Do you turn in the guy with forged documents, knowing he's probably harmless? Or just turn him away? How about if the guard promises to pay you for each person you arrest, regardless of guilt?  Most of these are not necessarily  that  questionable, I suppose - it's still just a game, basically restricted to what the designers intended, but it is quite a refreshing change from choosing to kill or save the Little Sisters, or selecting the Paragon or Renegade responses (and usually receiving an obvious tangible benefit, regardless of what Peter Molyneux promised you this time around). It's just pleasant to have a game give you pause for thought, rather than pause to calculate reward. Or figure out which of the things is going to actually make Commander Shepard say what you want him to. But in Papers, Please: Does your family go cold tonight?   Or do they go hungry, instead?",

Until you are sixteen hours in and realise that being a virtual border guard has become a way of life, and you know all Arstotzkan immigration laws off the top of your head. It's fun and simple until you realise that you cross-reference passports with ID supplements with work permits without a second glance. It's fun and simple until you realise you know all issuing cities and can tell a genuine dimplomat stamp from a forgery with the corner of your eye. It's all fun and simple until    they find you helped the rebellion and then kill you.    Glory to Arstotzka!  The Actual Review:  The game is fun and is very easy to become serious about as it progresses. It starts off easily enough, making sure passports aren't expired and they are Arstotzkan citizen, but it becomes much deeper very quickly. I haven't gotten around to playing endless mode, because story is intriguing enough. When you begin, you want to let the poor immigrants in and help the people who need it, but you will not last long playing like this. To keep you and your family alive you need to be logical and uncaring, even to your family. Money is tight as well. My tip is alternate nights with food and heat, and those without. Only buy medicine when they are very sick. However, this game is a commitment, best saved for when you have time and effort to direct towards checking virtual passports.",

            "review_text": "Papers, Please is a surreal indie game in which you play as a border inspector working for the communist country, Arstotzka. The game is full of gray areas that force the player to make difficult decisions. The 'puzzles' get increasingly difficult as the game progresses, with more and more rules being put in place for you to follow. This game is not perfect by any means, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons.   The game starts with you finding out you had been chosen in the 'lottery,' and that you are now forced to become Arstotzka's border inspector. They had recently opened the border, so crowds of people who want to get in are large and unruly, with instances such as terrorism becoming a somewhat common occurance. Everybody who comes up to you for entrance to Arstotzka has a reason for going there, whether it be work or family. It is up to you to decide if they are fit to enter by checking their passports and other documents to make sure they are not counterfeit or missing completely. If you let someone in who doesn't have the proper documents, you will be penalized. This is where the concept of choice appears, as it is up to you to decide if you want to let the desperate people in even if they are not qualified. No matter your decision, the game makes you feel terrible for what you have done. If you let them go, you lose money that you need to spend on rent and medicine for your sick family, which results in a fail-state if it happens to often. If you deny them, you will have to see their hopes and dreams crushed as they discover they may not see their family again.    The game plays fine, but the repetitive gameplay gets old rather fast, so you will often have to take a break to avoid getting too sick of the game. The puzzles start off easy, but get harder as the game progresses. It is a gentle slope, so you will never feel overwhelmed by the amount of things you have to do. It is worth noting that you will likely have to do a lot of reading in order to fully understand how to play the game, and a perfect run is pretty much impossible. The more people you get through the more money you make, but if you go too fast you may make more mistakes which result in more penalties.   The art style of this game is interesting to say the least. People look deformed and sad, which fits in with the bleak setting of the game. There is nothing noteworthy about the graphics, but the gray and brown color scale of the game portray a perfect atmoshere.   Overall, this is a great game that really makes you wonder about the choices you make. The gameplay is quite repetitive, but the tone and setting of the game seem to always bring you back for more. This is a must buy for fans of surreal, atmospheric games.",

It's hard to stare someone in the face and tell them they are wrong, despite their best efforts. Papers, Please gives you the task of being a border checkpoint agent.  With that comes tasks such as checking passport information and following the rules set out by your company. Should you disregard those rules, you will be penalized and may end up losing your job, family or life. It's a very serious game of give and take with people who are honestly trying their best and others that want to game the system.  Most people will never experience such a scenario in their own lives, but this game truly hits home for those that work in public services. Being a doctor, nurse, clinician, phychologist or any kind of care giver can put an incredible strain on your mind. Maybe you gave the wrong advice, or your administration of medicine was done too early; hell, maybe you just looked at someone wrong.  It's never easy to hear a sob story and then deny someone a basic human right that you take for granted. Denying passports and reading that the person is upset can be stomach turning. You feel desperately bad, even if they should have just followed the rules.  Mixed in with all these moral quandaries is a plot about a corrupt government and a rebel group attempting a coup. You can safely ignore them and still have a satisfying experience, but delving into the complexities of the plot in Papers, Please reveals something interesting; maybe you don't agree with everything.  It's easy to be a dutiful citizen and get nothing in return, accepting that life is ♥♥♥♥ and clocking out for the day. It's difficult to stand up to oppression and change the face of the world. Papers, Please gives you an opportunity to see what that change can do and how you can be the catalyst for a revolution.  Or you can simply do your 9 - 5 job and get a decent paycheck and a nice apartment. The choice is yours, but no choice is easy. Thankfully, your save file can be split into branching paths, allowing you to experience every possible scenario.  The graphical style and music bring home the entire package. It feels oppressive and familiar. It looks like an SNES game, but it feels unique. It sounds like the USA lost the Cold War, but it also shows a country in disarray. It's bleak, but beautiful.  The only flaw would be that the game is a bit short. Also, that branching path system doesn't make all of your choices concrete. Having a system by which one mistake ruins your game would be more in line with the self-reflection the game is pushing on you, but I can understand that it would make the game feel incredibly daunting.  Regardless, Papers, Please is worth a play by anyone interested in a more realistic look at humanity. A job that most people never thought of and will probably never see first-hand. It's truly a modern masterpiece and well worth the $10 asking price.  9/10",

Do you call to your humanity, let them through, and risk your family's welfare and imprisonment? Or do you stamp denied on their passport to their curses and possible future retributions?  To say more of this very clever game would spoil it but it is a steal at the price for modern gaming ingenuity at its finest.",

Nobody would ever think that making a game about something a dull as checking passports could ever be made into a truly great game like this one manages to be. The story line has many branching points were you are given the choice to support the current weakened communist government or aid the well-meaning but somewhat foolish rebels, all the while deciding what to do with hordes of people seeking a better life in your “glorious” country.   How it handles the actual meat of the game is very well done, starting you off checking passports and adding to that slowly until you are armed with a sniper rifle, forcing people to do strip searches to make sure they aren’t bringing weapons or drugs, checking fingerprints and criminal records, all the while making sure that their passports, work permits, diplomatic papers, immigration pass, vaccination certificates and identity cards are all correct and not forged in any way.  This game will test your eye for detail and refine it down to a laser point. If you ever wanted to play a game that makes you feel as smart as Sherlock Homes without actually playing a Sherlock Homes point and click adventure game this is it. ",

And of course, just when you think you've got a handle on checking d.o.b, gender, home country, work visas, etc, etc, you have to start cross checking more documents.  One particular mechanic that I'm thrilled by is how the timeline is handled. You can jump back to any previous day and branch a new story-line to see different consequences instead of having to start all over again. I don't know how many times you can do this, but even just once is nice, as opposed to starting back from day 1 to see how different day 29 could have been.

I mean, you let them in didnt you? Then there are more terrorist attacks. Then people start trying to get you to join a revolution, and you think hey! Thats something to do if i get bored. You start feeling split between your country and the other people.  Then people start giving you stripper cards. Then Drug money.  Serial Killers. People looking for lost loved ones.

It's a very hard game to put down.  The graphics may seem basic but they serve the dual purposes of paring back extraneous detail to help you concentrate while simultaneously reinforcing the dreary Cold-War era atmosphere. The moral quandaries you frequently find yourself in (you can barely go a day without being offered multiple bribes for a start) don't usually have clear right or wrong answers. Indeed, whenever I lost (often) I didn't get the impression it was because of any moral failings on my part, just making choices (or mistakes) with harsh consequences.  On the subject of losing, this game has one of the best save systems I've seen. It saves at the end of each day so that you can go back and restart from any day of any playthrough you like. You can go back and fix a mistake you realised from two days ago, or try something different or whatever you like and it displays it all in a way that is easy to navigate.  I'll finish by saying that this game might not be for everyone but I have personally loved it. If the idea of a game that's a bit different, that will make you think, that can actually draw you into the life of a poor worker stuck between a rock and a hard place, this is definitely worth a try.

Explaining the premise of this game really doesn't make you want to buy it: Who would really think that playing a game where you work at a Soviet nation's border station would be challenging, addictive as well as humorous and immersive? Add the fact that this game has the graphics of an early 90's game and it's surprising that anyone has even bought this game. It really is something I've never seen before, even the genre is somewhat hard to describe: It's a 'real time puzzle' game combined with roleplaying elements.  The core gameplay consists of checking people's passports and ID's and other various documents before you make the decision of giving entry or turning people away. It is really challenging and fun. And by challenging I mean 'makes you want to rip your hair out if you haven't lost it from the stress already', at least with the 'no loading allowed' playstyle that I employ.   You have to process people as fast as you can, but making mistakes will also cost you, so you have to balance the speed and the precision. After every day of work, you get to spend your earned money by feeding your family, paying the rent and heating bill, and if things are going well, you can buy upgrades for your toll booth. But there's never enough money for everything after the beginning, unless you're some kind of border guard savant.  It starts off easy: Check if the customer has a passport, if it has expired, if it has been granted in an authorized town and if the person is identifiable from the picture. Foreigners you must turn back. Next day, foreigners are allowed. The next day foreigners and natives both have to have a different kind of extra document to pass and you have to cross-check the information with the passport as well as if the information checks out on it's own. Before you know it, your desk is cluttered with all sorts of papers and you have to remember three faces of criminals that you can't let pass and a couple of names who you have to pass, while shooting people who try to do terrorist bombings at the border.  You find yourself screaming at the screen: 'What?! No way was that entry pass a forgery, you've got to be kidding me! Where the hell is that document? Who was I supposed to let pass and why?!' Things will get desperate soon enough, and maybe you'll let a missing document slide if the customer has some 'incentive' to let him/her pass. Oh, stop being so high and mighty, my son was very sick and I needed the money!  The roleplaying is intriguing as well. There are some really desperate people at the border trying to get you to bend the rules and you will be faced with the decision of either doing your job, or the right thing. Dereliction of your duties will first result in notices from your supervisors and then you will get fined, but you find yourself thinking: 'She'll get murdered if I decline her Visa, and it's only a 5$ fine if I don't, so maybe I'll do it just this once.' You can also team up with different political factions, which have real consequences. There are 20 different endings so the choices matter.  Papers, Please is proof that an excellent game doesn't need a marketable premise or top-notch graphics. On the contrary, it might allow the freedom of focusing on the gameplay aspects that truly make a game great. I know I haven't played this much yet, so this praise is to be taken with a grain of salt, but this might be one of the best games of 2013.",

Gameplay is just looking at people's papers and giving them the red stamp or the green stamp. But so many little stories and side plots come up and keep the game interesting. There are also more and more rules added on every in-game day so it gets harder to pick the right stamp. There's like 20 different endings too, so replay value is pretty good. Moral choice aspects are here and they are organic. The game makes it really hard to be a good person. Yeah you might be easy on a person and let them through because they'll die in their country otherwise, but then you'll get cited and oops now you can't afford food for your family that day. Great game for such a simple concept.",

This makes the game have quite the replay value as you would find yourself to be more inquisitive in different actions to pull off in the story and try to obtain all 20.",

It's times like this I wish there was the option for a neutral rating on Steam because whilst there are a few positives to the game there are a lot of negatives that I personally disliked about the game.  Starting with positives the nitty, gritty pixelled style of the game is a throwback to the 1980s where this game takes place and adds to the charm of it. It's really great but the downfall of this is that sometimes it can be hard to see if there really is a discrepency that you're expected to pick up on. The music in the game is fantastic (when it plays) and adds to the atmosphere of a society controlled by a strict regime. I literally cannot fault the music; it's perfect for this kind of game to be honest. The save system works on a timeline basis meaning you can go back and replay days and basically create a split timeline which is something that I appreciated as it meant I didn't have to go back and play through parts of the story I'd already seen. It's innovative and something I would urge other game devs to follow this format for other story intensive games with multiple endings. There's very little humour to the game but one of the characters, Jorji, is a light in an otherwise bleak world and it made me smile whenever he popped up into the booth. Cobrastan is best country.  Unfortunately what does let the game down is that after the 2 hour mark it begins to feel more like a job than an actual game and the fun factor completely dies off. Perhaps this was the intention of the game but if you're like me it ends up killing whatever motivation I had for the game. If reflecting the boring job of border control was the game's intention it did a great job at that. The moral choices that you're expected to make sometimes feel cheap and I felt no sympathy for the people I turned away (in fact I took great delight in detaining anyone I could much to the horror of my boyfriend who claims I'd ruin many people's days if I this was my real life job). I'm a sucker for stories that pull at my heart strings and leave me feeling depressed but Papers, Please failed to illicit any of those emotions from me. There are two main stories that you can follow and one is dull and boring whilst the other has a little more action orientated. The former just drags an already dull game downwards. Even whilst playing through both storylines there's very little difference between the two other than choosing to take someone's passport or not, etc. Some variation and more consequences would have been fantastic.  If I look at this game as a game I genuinely cannot recommend this unless you delight in sorting through mounds of paperwork. As a statement this game reflects life in a country being torn apart by conflict and the strict regimes of an oppressive society great (although it's still not fun to play). I'd recommend buying this on sale because you're either going to love it or turn around and absolutely dislike it to the point where playing feels like a chore.",

I get twinkly-eyed when talking about this game, and I talk about it to anyone who will listen. Such an aware and astute political comment. The game some how manages in that little cube checkpoint to be all about human relationships, and how compassion and revolution relate, and a million other themes. Even if you don't play compassionately, I think it's still true that it's about compassion. So there's a lot of heavy material, a lot that I still think about after months. But also it's funny and light? I think it goes back to the charm of relationships and interactions. There are so many potential stories in this game, you see so many people come by the checkout, and you are also confronted with whole states, but somehow the story stays small and personal too, in a way that replicates real politics. I could go on. Just play the game, you'll think a lot about states and morals and rebellion and empathy and power in the process.   That music too! wow!",

Every approval or denial leaves you with gritted teeth for the 5 seconds it takes the entree to walk away. As soon as you hear the mechanical whirr of the fax machine printing your mistakes, you kick yourself for missing a detail and keep going.  Really engrossing. Fun to get all the endings, and the way the game saves files makes it incredibly easy to correct previous mistakes allowing you to skip over the need to completely start a new file.

Possibly the most appealing aspect are the choices you make.

I have just gotten the perfect ending, which you will not be getting right away when you play for the first time. I usually don't write reviews, but I felt like I had to now. Because the reason this doesn't get a full 10, which it very much deserves, is what happens after you get the perfect ending.  You unlock 'Endless Mode'. I thought that it was a free-roam with customizeable conditions and such. But what it really was was an online challenge mode, with four different game-modes, not customizeable in any way. Heavily leaning towards online-competition.  So for the people that enjoyed the game and would like to keep playing normally after the story finishes, are screwed. There is no way than to redo the story again. Which will get just annoying in the end.  As I said, 7 out of 10.",

You can play through this game several times and not get the same ending as long as you make slightly difference choices of course. You don't have to sit there and play the whole day, you can play just a little and come back whenever you want.

I found myself creating a routine to checking informaiton, weighting the pros and cons of letting a single person through, and worrying about my dying son (he died) all in one day. All of this can sound like an overwhelming experience, but it felt perfectly balanced throughout the days in-game by working towards more and more to check everyday. You truly feel like you are deciding the fate of Arstotzka with every person you let through and every decision you make. With there being 20 different endingd you are bound to at least get 3 or so of them through a single play through, and the game offeres you a chance to go back to a certian day to change the outcome.   TL:DR If you would like to have an impact on the fate of a single country in the form of an under paid and over worked border checkpoint inspector, then this is the game for you. Lots of fun.
