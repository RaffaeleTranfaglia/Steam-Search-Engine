            "review_text": "This game is terrible.  It's horrifically buggy. You can glitch through most 'solid' objects in the game which sometimes breaks the game. The character models all look like they came out of 1998. A stealth system is entirely falsely advertised, as there are no stealth mechanics whatsoever. Much of the voice acting is horrifically bad. Please, don't get this game.   Here's a video on it :D ",

            "review_text": "Well, this game makes it easy to point out its flaws so to make this more challenging I decided to find good things to say about the game!  1. It's short. Only have 2 hours to kill? Here you go! I was called away from the keyboard for about half an hour and still managed to get a time of 2.8 Hours on Steam when getting the 'Bad Ending' achievement 2. The falling snow effect looked alright in the courtyard 3. Isabella has large breasts 4. Gives a good life lesson 'It helps to have a map.' 5. It does not overburden you with options 6. It gives the illusion of having Steam Trading Cards (at time of posting while the store page says it does, It does not) 7. If you are not into puzzles this is no problem, It only has 3 and one of those 3 is repeated about 10 times! 8. You do not have to waste time waiting for NPC's to move, they tend to not move at all or teleport  And that's all I got for you... Not recommended unless you're a masochist like myself. ",

            "review_text": "If you can get past the bugs and horrid voice acting, the story is quite interesting, if you're into midevil/alchemy.   In Guise of the Wolf, you play a character who is cursed with lycanthropy, which turns you into a werewolf without your free will. Your main goal is to cure yourself and stop the werewolf who gave you the bite in the first place. Along the way, you learn to control the transformation, to the point only direct moonlight can make you turn.   I'll rate the game overall in 5 categories:   Replayability: 4/10  If you want to get all of the achivements you need a minimum of 2 playthroughs to get all of them (because there's 2 endings).  Graphics: 6/10  Standard graphics, seems like a cartoon set in 2005, but it doesn't impede the experience.  Story: 7/10 Again, if you're into midevil/alchemy, you'll find this interesting to say the least.   Voice acting: 3/10 It helps to have a map.  Overall experience: 6/10 Read total below.   Overall: 5/10  It's not at all a bad game, nearly all of the negative reviews were due to the fact it didn't release trading cards along with it's innitial release which is sad that's all people care about rather than enjoying the game. If you have a couple of hours to kill (if you don't follow a guide and just play the game normally) you'll find a good experience to say the least.",

            "review_text": "Guise of the Wolf delivers where many AAA titles have faltered. Truly, this is a remarkable breakthrough in the gaming industry. The studio behind this masterpiece have made their entrance into the gaming world and it looks like they'll be sticking around. My sense of smell actually feels heightened and I can feel the tingling hairs on my nipples as they grow tenfold. Can you smell what the ROCK is cookin? I smell a sequel, do you? But I digress, reviewing time baby.   The game throws away unconventional and worthless things like clipping. You, the player of masterpieces, will have nearly infinite freedom. No longer will we be limited to roads and paths, this is the FUTURE. The first rock you encounter will have something special cookin' inside of it, so make sure you go in there and look! You won't want to leave-and can't!   Next, we do away with voice acting. These NPC's do not know what acting is! They are alive! Each one of them feels like a dear friend and every person you encounter shares a special memory with you. When they are harmed you can truly feel their anguish and pain. Don't even get me started on the wolf. It's just like Jakob from Twilight. Hell, I even named him Jakob. He is unmatched in his CGI cutscenes, nearly ruining every other game character with the sheer awesomeness of an ability called existence. The dialogue is very open and you even have the option to say things in different orders. Sometimes, I forget it's a game and howl into the night. Say farewell to your life because this game truly absorbs you into its dark atmosphere. I won't spoil the plot. I can't even fully comprehend it. Its complexity cannot be adequately appreciated until I complete a novel version for all to read. I've already written 9,001 pages and I've barely touched 12% of the whole plot.  You see my friends, you MAKE the plot. The creators took a gamble and allowed YOU, the player of masterpieces, to create your own story. It leaves many plotholes on purpose for your imagination to fill in, making the replay value infinity.   Beware, once you start this game you may contract a disease known as 'Large Dong'. I'll let the details be a surprise, but know that you won't want it to be cured. Keep napkins closeby as the female lead is a true Goddess. Her beautiful voice echoes forever in your mind and you'll spend the vast majority of the game not actually playing but searching for this divine Amazonian. She watches over the player giving advice and health/love potions from time to time. You'll fall in love with her soothing voice quickly, so be sure to listen to her.   Make sure you check the map often. It really helps, the guards told me so and they've seen everything. Everything! Good luck sneaking by them. Additionally, they're incredibly handsome. If you find that your cannot contain your primitive lust I must warn you to be extremely careful when patting them down. The one named Jesom specifically likes his left ear stroked gently. Try it, you'll get a extra 15 gold.   Play on, friends. This game is the greatest buy of my life, and I bought twelve ladyboys for a night.    AWRHOOOOOO!         AWHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!",
