            "review_text": "Agent Awesome is a strategy game with real-time movement and turn-based combat based on the Unity engine. You take control of Agent Awesome who gets drunk and is dared to show his awesomeness by taking down his former employer.  The gameplay is similar to other tower attack style games in which the player has to fight his way through different levels on a pre-defined path. With each completed level you earn money that you can use to buy/upgrade one of the 12 available weapons to be even more awesome the next time.  After playing this game for a while I can say that  this game is still lacking important features like a detailed options menu (for graphics and controls) and has quite a few minor issues that need to be addressed like: - pixelated graphics (button graphics) on higher resolutions - camera movement speed needs some adjustment (too fast in game world, too slow in tactical screen) - switching to fullscreen is only possible by editing the windows registry  Apart from these issues the game has funny dialogues, a good art style and the cameos in the first cutscene are a nice touch. The sound is not the best but it not the worst either. It has a nice soundtrack that fits the humorous style of the game.  Overall the bugs in the game are annoying sometimes,  but the gameplay can also be very challenging when trying to beat the level in different ways. The game has potential to be a great game, it just needs to be polished a little bit more.",
