            "review_text": "So you get back from vacation to find everyone in town turned to stone including your mother. Your father has been taken by the evil King Ixal and it’s your job to save everyone. Hey why not, everyone wants to be a hero right.  Driftmoon is an action RPG somewhat like the old school classic Zelda. You return to your home to find the whole village turned to stone except for one of your friends. He tells you all what happened and that your father was taken hostage by the evil King Ixal. Your father has one of the crystals needed to raise the dead and become immortal.  Collect weapons and armor, craft items, and complete missions to help level up. Each level you get one stat point and one skill point to build your character stronger. It was pretty fun to play for a while but I grew tired over time with the mass amount of reading in the game. Enemies also became tedious in fighting since it was mostly a small variety of different types. This is understandable though as it’s not a big budget game.   Overall the game is worth checking out. The story was pretty good and had some laughs and can give you plenty of play time with the main game. There is also editing tools to make your own mods. There were a few mods out for it when I played but nothing that peeked my interest and I also did spend any time creating any because I’m just not skilled enough for that.  Baer Rating: 7/10",

You must play this game if you are one of the people who played old school RPG's games!",

It really needs an autosave-feature tough because I had to play one hour to get my progress back when I forgot to save..  I liked: -The story -Lot of stuff to scavenge -Deep dialog-system -NPC's have their own unique personalities -Graphics -Supports modding  I did not like: -The combat system was too simple and I've seen it in dozens of other games. -Fewness of side quests. (Although the side quests were more interesting than in other games) -No autosave",

While it is overall a good game experience and not too short for the price ... well I completed it in about 6 - 10 hours (though steam says 30 ... but I started it and forgot it for roughly a day ... I basically never turn my computer off) . ...  It has some awkward moments.   Some are based on the fact that the game teaches you early on to move everything you can move in order to find everything. So you are often move heavy things around .... which move awkwardly slowly... taking almost forever.    Some are based on the wired life death mythology in the story and background story ... and the often all too present ingame god which is looming over ones head all the time. IMHO I have figured out the reason for these two more below.    Some are based plot holes ... and that character come and go seemingly for not good reason at all and spurting all the stuff you gave them all over the floor ... all the time.    And some are based on the interface ... it is the first time that not only the hotbar seems kinda useless ... since 1st you can pause the game any time and 2nd the game is also paused when in inventory mode, but also dangerous since you actually drop things (on the floor) that you pull out of your hotbar. No other game does this. It took me some time to figure out why I was missing (important) stuff ... and which was the save game I had to go back to.... (lost at least half an hour of playing)   In general there is also too much text ... and I couldn't figure out why I didn't feel to read any of it... in other games I often read ahead of the (here missing*) voice acting and skip it one I am done (and the actor is at most in the middle) ... since childhood I also have read many books and even read some in English (which is ... since it is not my native language ... sometimes more tiresome).  Also the game for some reason didn't recognized any achievement I made... I am sure I almost have all of them (not sure if I found all goldfishes***, and I surly didn't create a mod****)  And there is at least one NOGO in this game ... a hidden book ... a (whole) Bible ... and the author of the game blabbering directly about his faith. Aside from that people of faith tend to have be a tremendous stupid side since they literally literally believe in fairy tales ... which they outright call stupid if they would be appear anywhere else than  THEIR  holy book, it also does nothing to do with creating a game.   KEEP YOUR FAITH TO YOU , WILL YA?  I can't see this as nothing other than a very ♥♥♥♥ty attempt to spread 'the good news'.   ... actually no ... I was about to ranting on about this ... but I am stopped myself doing it ... since it also has nothing to do with a video game review ...",
