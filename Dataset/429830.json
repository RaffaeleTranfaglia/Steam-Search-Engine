            "review_text": "Although short you will find that you move more in this game than most of the other games for the vive and room scale. The use of your playspace as the actual movement through the game instead of teleporting etc is great. If you have a decent sized playspace then this game is a whole lot of fun.  You can have timed runs to compete against your friends so great for a vive party game. Just watch the controllers on the floor as a lot of crawling involved. The computer end part takes some getting used to but it's just reading and following the commands.   I highly recommend this game and wish the Devs would add to this title.",

            "review_text": "This is a neat little game that shows off decently well what you can do with roomscale. The game really isn't that difficult and can be beaten pretty quick, but it is a great one-off game and an even better demo game. I love that the rooms are randomly generated so it is not the same pathway every time as well. In 11 minutes I beat it twice, however this is coming from someone who plays VR games daily. $3 is a decent price and I will be using this game now as one of my standar demos.",

            "review_text": "Despite the game is just around 2Â£ it is rather disappointing anyway. The idea is great but kinda unsufficient. The game will generate random rooms that are incredibly easy to solve. So, yes, it's kinda cool as it's the first game in VR to bring that concept but the replayability is not great as the number of different rooms is pretty limited and anyway the difficulty is so low that once you had a first run through, there is no real challenge at replaying the game.  Major flaw too is that the game will not work properly below a space of 4mX4m and that is really a shame as there are lots of ways to adapt to the size of your room.  Good idea though !",
