            "review_text": "Highly recommended (but don't let your kids play it, lots of adult content)  I'm wary of all these episodic adventures popping up now. I worry about whether the studio will actually be able to deliver the rest of the episodes. Also, the episodic adventures that I have tried were too short for me to really engage with the story. Act One of this game is about 1-2 hours long, but everything is really well done and I'm really intrigued with the story. The writing in this game is excellent and probably the best part. The protagonist is a great character, a very complicated person. Not your typical adventure game hero. The music in this game is really good too, even though I didn't like one track.   The drawback of the game is that it's very easy. Now, I don't like it when puzzles are frustatingly hard, but I just flew through this game. Not only are solutions pretty clear in general, NPCs also drop some big hints (&amp; this is a little hypocritical, but I *do* like how Sydney will drop a hint about an item's usage if you examine it in your inventory. I kinda wish other adventure games would do that too). The puzzles do get a bit more complex towards the end, but I kinda get the feeling that's just coincidence. I think the UI could be improved. OH! And the mini-game, ugh. It just slows everything down, takes forever, and is too hard. Luckily it's the only mini-game.   I really hope this story continues to the end! In fact, I think releasing a full adventure game like Wadjet Eye does would have been the best way to go. The Slaughter is like playing a Lucasarts adventure because it is funny, but it's also really dark at the same time.",

            "review_text": "Need a screwdriver.   Go to pub. Special is cocktails. Order screwdriver. Get drink + actual screwdriver. Screwdriver is too flimsy. The fix? Put it in varnish! OF COURSE! Also, play 'hidden object' in the general store. Ah, here we go - a hat that is also an umbrella that just happens to be necessary to occupy a mortician. What's this? A mini-game? Well at least we can press the 'skip' button.   It's the wacky/sloppy 'Anything goes' of adventure game writing. This is why the genre gets a bad rap.  I hate to give this a thumbs down as I am sure a lot of work went into this game, but it all came down to 'does this bring anything interesting to the genre?' Many reviews mention the writing as a positive - you may find it enthralling. I found that I'd much rather read a period novel.",

It seems more about a slightly interactive story than an adventure game. But that's OK, because it delivers the story very well, and it does have just enough P&amp;C to make it still feel like a game.",
