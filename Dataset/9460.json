So sad this entire company collapsed.  I recently managed to locate the dedicated server files and was thinking about putting up a server and hopefully finding maybe 10 or more people who would want a weekly game night for FFOW. I dont even see any dedicated servers available for rent anymore so I doubt anyone plays much.   Any interest? Hit me up on steam.  BEWARE if you are buying this game: I remember single player was fun but there is NO multiplayer. You can start a LAN game but there are NO BOTS to play against. So you better have friends pleb.",

Competent, non-arcade-type gun play without the complexity of some of today's modern offerings.   I've owned this game for _years_ and until looking to see if the publisher had done any further Frontlines games, I really never noticed that there was a multiplayer; yes, the option was there, but I guess I never really noticed it. I guess that this game never seemed like it would be a good MP, so maybe that was it; at least it didn't devolve in to some POS CoD or BF cheatfest gaming that only kids play these days, so maybe it's a good thing! Apparently you can still play on LAN though. So, can't ding it for lack of MP when I never noticed MP was really there.  If you want a great FPS and will accept kind of a short story, check out Fuel of War, and its prequel or sequel Homefront from the same publisher.",

I like the idea with the mini helicopters with rocket launchers, and drones, ect. :) But the SP looks a little short, and the biggest potential would be in the MP. But the servers are offline. :( If it is on a huge sale, i can hardly recommend the game. But for the full price, you can buy games with much more potential playtime :)",

This one went under the radar, and I would confidently say that its SP campaign blows away anything that Activision (CoD) or DICE (BF) has produced in the last 10 years.   FFOW has an interesting storyline, good gameplay concepts, and an overall good feeling. Very surprising, considering CHAOS Studios' 'Homeland' had a terrible campaign.   There are a good variety of missions and players are able to use an assortment of vehicles and aircraft throughout the SP campaign. What I enjoy most is the 'hands off', non-linear approach of the SP campaign. Certain missions will give you tanks, planes, drones, etc, but wont force you down a specific route. It's like the developers said 'Here are your objectives, here are your tools, you figure it out'. The maps are large enough so that players can actually develop a strategy and execute their own plan, this allows great re-playability on missions.   My only gripe is that there is no COOP. A COOP campaign mode would be fantastic.",

I was skeptical when I first got this game, thinking that it was going to be some cheesy rehash of the old school delta force series and graphics to match. What I found was a visually impressive game with some really fun mechanics and a storyline that was actually engaging. Frontline doesn't market itself well but in the age when everyone who owns a computer starts making crappy 'Free-To-Play' games, I'm actually very pleased with it. I know it's a few years old but it was refreshing to see a non mainstream game/name (ie Halo) actually exceed my expectations. Parts of the game that are a bit wonky but all in all it kept me engaged for the duration of the Solo Campaign. And after all, isn't that all you can ask for in a video game? Maybe I was impressed because of my low expectations, or maybe, just maybe; might I dare to venture that Kaos Studios has actually made a decent one.",

I started on the hardest difficulty to begin with and later had to lower it because of getting frustrated. some of the problems I was experiencing were glitching enemies and mission checkpoints not activating and having to restart the level.  What I found to be the most aggrivating though was the accurracy of the weapons. The most common weapon you have access to is the Assault Rifle and the accurracy on that gun is amazingly bad, even when you pulse fire it you'd be fortunate enough to hit your target at 5 feet away.  The weapons that were most accurrate were the sniper rifle, your pistol, and of all things the SMG. I found myself using the SMG class as often as possible and managing to kill all my enemies from long range with it. If I was ever forced to use the Assault Rifle class then I would use the Noobtube on it and the pistol.  Frontlines: Fuel of War had some features I enjoyed such as disposing of whatever ammunition was left in a magazine when you reloaded. Example, you have 5/10 bullets in a magazine and reload, you THROW AWAY those 5 bullets. This makes you not continually spam reload after every short burst. I also enjoy the whole conquest format that is essentially the entire base of the game.  I do feel that it all came up a little too short and this is not a game I would recommend.",

The AI was close to abysmal - both friendly and enemy AI - and the levels were basically multiplayer levels with some story attached to it... much like the single player part of Battlefield 1942 (except that game had no story at all).  In short, it was not a really good game.",

What we have is a poor man's dystopian FPS that feels like it tried to cash in on COD, with a plot so thin you can see through it, and gameplay I'd attribute to a game 10 years in the past during the PS2 and 1 era. It is very obvious out the gate the devs wanted you to do multi player and the 'Story' mode was just a 4 hour time wasintg tutorial with lackluster characters you can never identify with let alone like.  The final straw for me however, was the lousy bugs as well as the AEGIS physics engine bug that requires you to roll back your drivers if using anything beyond and 8600.   Overall, i'd not wish this game on anyone, if you truly need the FPS, war is hell feel, wait for Call fo Duty to go on sale or some such.",
