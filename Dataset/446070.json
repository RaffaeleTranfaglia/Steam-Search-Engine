            "review_text": "It is a very interesting platformer, in which every level brings something new, some fresh mechanics, gimmick, etc. Without it, it would probably go boring very soon, but because every next level brings slightly different type of challenge, it keeps being non repetive and fun. This changing of circumstances makes it a quite hard game - almost every new section needs some time to get used to.  Above that, it has atmospheric, disturbing graphics and music, which gives this game orignal appeal. For sure it is worthy of attention.",
