Welcome to tedious city! You're helping out at a musuem at first, which means a lot of boring tasks you have to do before the case even starts. And even once things pick up you STILL have to finish all your meaningless tasks to progress through the game. Solving the mystery in this game always feels like a second thought since Nancy is stuck having to do everything else. And even when you DO solve it the story isn't very memoriable.  Wasn't bad, had it's fun moments but not the best ND title.",
