Cons: - The matchmaking as of the time of typing this seems to be full of A.I. due to the lack of actual people playing the game, which makes this game lose a lot of it's luster and that ' competitive' feel. - The in-app purchases are both fair and unfair, more unfair than anything else. You have to pay for a ton of sparks to get a VIP account just to have 3 people in your squad ( otherwise you can only have one other person.) Then to unlock nicer paints you have to pay damn near $100, and you have to shell tons of sparks ( the monetary unit used in-game) to increase your inventory size.  BUT..  Pros:  -I, myself have created a guild and am fortunate enough to have met and collected some great and active players to fight along side with and chat between matches. - I don't understand what people mean by the game has ' unfair combat and ranking system.' I have never had my share of win and lose streaks and this game has a pretty fair match making system.  -Making your robot is fun! there are definitely three styles of bots that you can succeed with. ( heavy, high hitpoint bots/ light, lightning-fast, fast damaging bots, etc)  Conclusion: -This game is definitely more fun in a guild or with friends! if you are a solo player, this game probably will lose your attention in a matter of hours. give it a chance, if you dont like it, you're not out any money.",

Also save your Sparks, you get flooded with them at the start and you really should use them to upgrade your inventory slots,bigger inventory = more robots= more veriety = all around more experienced player = finding what your best with fastest = getting picked up by a good guild = a great time",

I do wish they would elaborate more during the tutorial rather than just showing you how to use and build a bot, but instead it would be nice to have the game explain how to use and implement devices, buffs, etc. The micro-transactions are not that bad, and its not in a pay to win style.

So far there is a good few hours of discovering the game, but past that it's just general arena combat like so many others. The game isn't revolutionizing any systems. They are all basically how you would expect them from other games, just catered to cartoony robots.   The game currently has balancing issues with the weapons, there are a few hackers here and there, and the learning curve can be steeper simply because you can end up fighting players who've played hours of the game right from the get go with GaR's robot ranking system. All of this can be considered a challenge, but might not be worth it to some.  For a free to play game, I'd say it's worth a look, though the game still needs more work done on it.",

There are very few elements of pay2win (from what I've seen). It merely just adds convenience and allows you get to better things faster. If you don't pay anything, it will only take longer.

            "review_text": "There are many things wrong with this game.   1. This game has tiers, like in Robocraft, so you aren't supposed to be put with people who will annihilate you in one shot. However, I was put in a match with one of the top 10 players on the enemy team. They one-shotted me, and later, two others, on my team. To put this into context, destroying an enemy robot in this game can take over 10 seconds of non-stop fire.   2. As I mentioned before, this game has tiers. But you can only 'tier-up' when you upgrade your robot's parts. However, the only thing upgrading parts does is give them more health, except weapons, which get more damage as well as more health. This means, in higher tiers, your robot will have more health and do more damage. This also means every other robot will have more health and do more damage. What's the point? Am I missing something?  3. There is no progression in this game. Yes, you can upgrade your robot, but as I said, the whole 'upgrading' system is linear and useless.   4. There are very few people playing it. Getting into a match doesn't usually take any more than about 30 seconds, but being put into matches with, quite often, the same people, who are quite often, using the same robot each time, can get repetitive, especially when they use over-powered weapons.   5. You will occasionally get a box as a reward after completing a match. You can open these boxes with credits, the in-game currency, with a success rate as low as 0.25%, upto 5%. Failed attempts will not destroy the box, only the tools. You can alternatively pay real money in exchange for 'sparks', which you can use to open the box first time. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that these crates can give unique robot parts. That's right, people who pay real money get an advantage over those who don't.   Personally, I have enjoyed this game so far, but I simply cannot recommend it to anyone.",

In this game, you control a custom robot, and fight in team fights (1 life per match) which feature objectives like capture the flag, plant the bomb etc...but they are mostly negated because you can finish the match by simply killing the enemy.  Pros: - good robot customization, you can build your own robot from scratch, make your own custom weapons and other robot parts, it most fun part of the game, using and testing different loadouts - ladder and ranking system, your robot reaches higher rank by upgrading its gear - not great, but good graphics (they are cartooney like borderlands, there are black edges around models)  - nice looking themed maps - there is also some cosmetic customization like hats, profile pictures and masks which you can earn by doing achievements; you can also change robots' colors - you can earn everything for FREE, it just takes time, you can earn exclusive currency (the currency you usualy need to pay with real money in other games, you can earn it in this game), by completing achievements and doing daily missions - nice achievements to earn - there is tutorial - even though population is small, you still can find the match if you search for minute or two - it seems that some of the players are acctualy bots, although game doesnt state them as such, this of course, boost number of matches played - friend and guild system in game¸ - you can play minigame while you are searching for match  Neutral (things i like but other people might not) : - you get only 1 life per match and matches are really short, thing about this is that this system allows more players to play, since matches will be done in couple of minutes, maybe 5-10 minutes at most, and players will search for another match so new players wouldnt have to wait long to play; if matches were longer,2-3 groups of 10 people would play matches for more 30 minutes which will mean other players probably wouldnt find anyone to play with and would just quit - there are consumables and more powerful ammo you can buy before the match, even though you can buy it for free, i dont like this system  Cons: - devs are trying to resurrect this game (they havent updated it for more than 1 year) using indiegogo site so players can fund the game... however it seems that project is failing ( they have raised 180$/50000$ only) - i dont think there is that much skill included in this game, basicaly only thing you need to do is make a good robot, and you will kill anyone with weaker one, no matter how hard they try - robots could use more functions, like jumping - only three game modes : capture the flag, plant the bomb, and basic elimination; however most of people ignore them because you can consider each mode as elimination mode, when one team gets eliminated they lose - this game could use casual servers where you can pick which one to join, also you cant pick mode you want to play either - playerbase is small, under 50 players at the time - it seems that most players are children, i dont blame them however, it is game for them, but still, adults can enjoy it aswell - robot making can be confusing for new players at start - there are inventory slots, which are very annoying even despite the fact that you can unlock them for free  I recommend you to try this game as soon as possible, because it will probably get closed very soon.  Why did i vote no? Well simply because there was nothing that lured me to play the game again, after i quit it.",

Such a good F2P was turned to ♥♥♥♥ because of the need for money.   When I played it, it was a nice cartoony game that was pretty decently skill based. Not you need to spend money to slightly enjoy the game.",

You can boost 'sparks' into upgrades.  Also matchmaking is pain. Tired to be placed in newbs teams - they rolling around without any basic sense of teamwork.   Overall - it was fun.
