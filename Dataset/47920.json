Second i had a few bugs with this game that i had to fix manually, besides those problems it is a really good game. it does take some time to get used to aswell im using the the Logitech Driving Force Gt Wheel &amp; it works great without having to do any setup with this game unless you want to swap from automatic to manual. if you want a even more realistic game i would highly recommend Assetto Corsa and even no thats in early access i still think that is a better all round racing experience and is very polished even now in its early stages. all in all i would recommend this game its a good, fun driving game with a nice amount of tuning and as a nice selection of cars &amp; tracks Nürburgring is my favorite which Assetto corsa does not have....yet.",

            "review_text": "I have poured hours of this game into the origin version, and had it rebought on steam because of an apparent patch that was released only to this version without EA's notice - basically improves graphics at the cost of a massive green screen :P So whatever.  This game in comparison to other racing games, particularly Forza and Gran Turismo on the consoles, is rather low on car variety and has less tracks as well. So what does this game have that they don't?  This game provides that ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece that is Need for Speed racing enviroments, soundtrack, and being able to do exactly what they want to do in each game - shooting for realism this time around, it came out in a FANTASTIC way, allowing you to adjust every setting to go from basically being an arcade racer to being a full on simulation with full support for external wheel/shifter/pedal controllers of every sort (Logitech G27 in my case). The graphical style is outstanding, and I say that because without the use of extreme filters and such like Need for Speed Rivals for example, it still pulls of a rather impressive appearance if a bit dated (It did come out in 2011, after all).  Your car lineup covers a number of cars across almost every popular brand out there save ferrari and a few others, but I will admit the variety of cars from each manufacturer is rather low in comparison to its main competitors on the console market out there. However, each car feels unbelievably well detailed and simulated, and while it is possible to get this game on console as well you are going to want it on PC due to the fact that this game feels like it was DESIGNED for PC, not console.  The enviroment is really what gets you though. Other racing games are effectivelly nothing short of boring menus until you start a race. This one gets that soundtrack, enviroment, gets the sounds down perfectly on each car and area, the camera angles right, helps you to feel motivated to get out there and kick ♥♥♥.  This is a game I highly recommend to racing fans out there. Even today, it stands up very well. Just be careful of the premature patch issued to this steam version if you don't know what you're doing - you actually might want to get it on disc or origin in this case, believe it or not.",

            "review_text": "The sequel of the masterpiece NFS Shift done right but not perfect  Overal (8/10) First of all, this game is racing simulator (you don't say!) so the real time action is needed like handling, brake and throttle to enjoy driving experience as real as possible, Shift 2 is fail to realize that aspect, lag input, a little unaccurate handling like its successor NFS Shift. For what i experience, NFS Shift handling is more good than this one from this aspect. But it doesn't mean it's not fun at all! Really good environment and cars detail, good racing experience and AI, amazing soundtrack make NFS Shift 2 enjoyable.   Graphics (8/10) A bit annoying particles and dust on the screen, like no realistic at all, particles is not real time, the cars is like hovering in the dark place with no light source. If you look closely the reflection on the car is not reflected real time on some objects, on certain tracks and conditions. But still this game has a really good environment and cars detail. The graphics overal is top notch!  Gameplay (7/10) Like others and its successor, what do you expect from racing simulator games? my personal opinion, Shift 2 Unleashed deliver a good racing experience and AI, not too easy to beat, although theres bad handling and lag input, it is still fun and enjoyable.   Music (9/10) Hell yeah!!! one of the best soundtrack i ever heard!!! No one would complaint about this.",

Sometimes i restart a race a dozen times because unfortunatley unlike some other racing sims/ arcade racing games NFSS2 does NOT offer any kind of rewind or going back in a race, this adds a great amout of difficulty having to nail every turn perfectly or risk getting passed by the whole herd. However this also makes the game more realistic and less arcade like. Over all I am very happy with the car selection and tracks that are offered. I've only been playing for 11 hours and amd not evern 20% through the career mode. but can definitley say this is one of my all time favorite Need for Speed games.",

My reasons for not giving it a higher score is that it has a very lacking soundtrack (only one menu track on infinate loop), the career mode is really bad in terms of layout for example seasons/circuits don't have a points/position system, as long as you place 3rd your good, so there is no overall winner in a class/series, and certain handling elements that bog you down when it shoudn't. Like some others on here this is to fill the void left from Forza games, which I would love to see on PC, but this should give other Forza fans something to do until they get a 360 or Xbox One!",

The game is better using the xbox controller, you could be more accurate, you have more control over the car. But still it's one of the worst racing games out there. Better play some other game instead. The game is pretty old but the performance is bad. You can't skip the damn intro and those annoying cut scenes.

Thank you for your time.  **UPDATED: I originally did not recommend this game for the following reasons: -Music -Driving Feel -It Force Quit  However, after becoming really bored, i decided to give it another go. The first thing I did was disable music. I then played with difficulty settings and virtually turned everything off (ABS, Traction Control, Assisted Braking, ect.) The game feels different, but it is fun in a way. The level of customization is actually pretty cool if you are into cars. However, the menus had me confused for a while: when upgrading the your car, you select engine, and it takes you to air filters. At first I didn't realise there were more parts available, such as exhaust, camshaft, and other stuff in other tabs.  Recap: I recommend this game. It is not perfect, but it is fun. Menus are a bit weird IMO, but after i figured them out, it was no big deal. :)  Another Update: This Game Blows. I have never been so on the fence. You know what, buy the game or don't.",

When you try to get help or support steam points to ea and ea points back to steam. Ive been contacting ea for 2 weeks and still getting the run around with drivers and uninstall and reainstall then they made me download thier client and said that would fix the problem. Still doesnt work been doing countless steps to fix from them its doing the exact same thing. I believe that a game should work on a pc expecially nowadays. I tried to get refund from steam they said no because i went 20 min over my 2 hour time limit while trying to fix and because i bought this game a while back but never installed it. I say no to this and ea's support system and steams supports system need work big time. So yeah ea you are proving me wrong everyday.",

            "review_text": "Let me just start by saying that I am in no means one of those sheep that praise EA in all they do and will pay them hundreds maybe even thousands of $s, £s or €s on on-disc DLC and pointless crap for Origin, thankfully the pointless DLC for this game comes with the game, so no need to worry about it there. Though I can guarantee that you most likely won't give a ♥♥♥♥ about a DLC that gives you a load of crappy, boring-looking cars that aren't half as good as the ones you can create yourself. Honestly, this is a game that CAN be enjoyable, even though the bads outweigh the goods, for example:  BADS:  1. The main menu isn't even compatible with a controller  2. The custom livery mechanic is so poorly done, there's only 300 decals with 250 of them being sponsors, you can't even put numbers on your car. You can't line up your stickers, the resolution of said stickers is poor, and when you edit a sticker, your cursor wont move until you come out of the customization and back in.  3. If you don't want to use a controller, the default keys are horrible e.g. Insert and Delete being your gear shifting...  4. If you ever get bored and just want to ♥♥♥♥ around with an AI, it's difficult to get them off the track unless you literally butt♥♥♥♥ them at 250mph while they're coming to a stop due to EA's amazing magnetizing to the racing line.  5. The AI will just about avoid you if you come to a complete stop, they won't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about you going at a high speed, it's okay for them to bump into you because they're magnetic to the road.  6. Unskippable intros to different style races, and don't forget that you MUST see the big 'EA we're the best at taking your money' logo at the beginning.  7. Most of the cars you can spend over 300k on to turn into a 'works' car, some will actually be so bad that they stall between each gear, you cannot fix this and won't see it happen until you enter a test or track...which doing so will reduce the value of the car so you won't even get your full amount of money back.  8. The main menu car lot won't show all the cars you can buy in the game, you have to go into the career mode and look into the specific style events, like for muscle and classic cars.  9. If your PC is like mine, then the game will simply refuse to run if you're running in maxed out, it'll just crash when you enter a race, by no means is this a fault with my PC, I've ran much more demanding things than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (now last gen) console port.   GOODS:  1. Decent selection of cars  2. Tuning actually does stuff in this game, HALLELUJAH  3. It looks pretty nice for a console port  4. The soundtrack is pretty decent (despite the fact the songs don't change until after you do a race).  5. It had night time races...   So if you managed or could be bothered to get this far: So overall, if you're thinking 'Why the ♥♥♥♥ did you buy the game if you think it's so damn bad?!' it's because I actually enjoyed the first NFS Shift game, it was pretty nice and kinda cool to ♥♥♥♥ around on, and I suppose it's my fault for not looking into it before buying it. However, despite how ♥♥♥♥ I think it is, it has something about it that keeps me playing it, but only with friends. It's by far not the best racing sim out there, but it's not quite arcade. Do I think it's worth the full price? ♥♥♥♥ NO. Yet, if you manage to see it on discount and it's a game you want, I say go for it if you like racing games that don't give you the feeling of driving a real car, or if you just like a decent challenge because of EA's infamous false-difficulty AI.  I'm kinda 50/50 on this game...Damn console ports.  Above all else; If you DO get this game, just don't turn the Comaro into a works car...unless you feel like brainwashing yourself with stalling gear change sounds and torturing yourself with a slippy as ♥♥♥♥ car.",

I've applied every tweak, every fix I can but every FR and MR car cannot be driven on the limit (at least not with my 360 pad) because as soon as you try and counter oversteer the car veers off. If you catch that, it switches in the other direction. Just trying to keep the car on the tarmac alone is difficult let alone maintaining the perfect line through corners. Races are best won by upgrading your car to the point that it doesn't slide and you can coast it around on 3/4 throttle.  It could have been so great with some further testing and refining, but as the developer openly acknowledges they had to release it in it's current state.",

Whilst the graphics are nicer, everything else about this game seems so far to be inferior to the XBox version.  First of all the game refused to run via Steam, and I had to create a shortcut for the desktop and run it as administrator. OK, fair enough, that's just PC gaming.  But the real problems started once I began racing, where I found the controls (using the same 360 controller I had used on the console) to be sluggish and unresponsive, almost as if there was a delay. I've been playing the Next Car Game recently, and there the controls were snappy enough.  Where the cars in the 360 version felt like they were a part of you, in the PC version they feel remote and unconnected. Even worse, in the chase view the car appears to vibrate at times, almost like it's doing a belly dance! WTF? I needed to use the chase view because in the first person views the delay or stodginess of the controls meant that I didn't have any real idea of how the car was responding. At least in chase view the car bears some relation to the road.  I tried setting up the responsiveness in the options menu, but even with the sensitivity at 100% there wasn't enough response until the stick was fully extended, and then there was often too much. This made it almost impossible to hold the racing line, and the car veered crazily all over the place.  I'm not a newbie to racing games, but this game made me feel like a novice!  This was a real disappointment to me, and I could not in all honesty recommend the game.",
