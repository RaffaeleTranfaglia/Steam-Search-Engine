            "review_text": "A first look, especially just from the screenshot, this game might look like an old school dungeon crawler with some 8bit flair but Soulcaster presents and interesting gameplay in combat and progression through each level progression making it a quite modern and innovative game that deserves some attention to any fans of dungeon crawling games and tower defense games.  With its RPG and tower defense background, Soulcaster could look like a copy of Defender's Quest. However, Soulcaster suprisingly innovates in the way the tower defense system is implemented. Unlike Defender's Quest that uses a basic ressource management to handle defenses, Soulcaster system is based on selecting the right defense (from the 3 Soulstone you collected) and moving them along with you as you progress in a level. Each defenses have its pros and cons, so you need work out the best strategy from level to level. This make the game much easier to play than usual tower defense games where you need to worry constantly about your ressources for placing the right defense at the right time. But although it is easier to play, it does not make it un-interesting at all...   Good game from a developper most likely worth to follow.    ",
