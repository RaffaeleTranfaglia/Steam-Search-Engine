            "review_text": "You've seen the video, and you're going 'This is a Flash game. This belongs on Newgrounds. Wait, this IS on Newgrounds. Why would I pay for this? Why would anyone even greenlight this??' I'll tell you why: because this is the RPG your oldschool heart's been waiting for.  You've got your turn-based RPG elements, your enemies rating from the silly to the spooky to the right-out terrifying, your countless tongue-in-cheek Final Fantasy/Pokemon/Zelda/Mana/etc. homages. But then there's the feeling of being a part of this world: rather than 'exploring' a 'vast' world of triumphs and tribulations, you just sort of twiddle around and run into packs of monsters just sitting there on the worldmap. There's the never-ending bickering and bantering among your teammates as you progress. There's the range of hints both silly and satisfying that play out as you spar with your foes and try new techniques.  The challenge is there too--boy, is it ever. For a game optimized to be played 30 minutes at a go, you can spend a lot of effort fine-tuning your characters' skills and loadouts for tough fights (and it will *really* pay off if you are playing Epic and going for the achievements). You'll be able to come back to it over time, too--have the satisfaction of clearing the game, take some time off from it, and come back to it anew in New Game+ (or ++) playing however you feel, without having to collect all those non-key items again but with all the damage numbers exponentially increased for more cheesy epicness.  And of course, the content you won't find on Newgrounds here--the Battle Mountain--escalates the challenge further (though you could still get through it pretty easily in Easy mode if you went that route). It's a chance to step off the beaten plot-ridden path and just smash up tons of monsters--plus all-new bosses both uncompromising and unsettling.  If you are a child of the 90s or late 80s and don't have time to play RPGs anymore but still admire them from afar, this is your chance to see firsthand what happens when nostalgic thrills meet the present day. This East-meets-West cultural take just might give you one more fantasy to embrace after all.",

            "review_text": "There's an achievement for clicking Natalie's breasts and making them jiggle, stealing underwear, and leaving a character dead at the end of the battle.   So, basically, you are rewarded for teasing a busty girl, running away with her intimate clothing and leaving her dead in the end. Just like real life. 10/10      But here's the real review.  Originating from a browser game, the fourth installment of Epic Battle Fantasy is on Steam, and for a very good reason. I haven't seen a lot of turn-based fighting RPGs like this one, but it really hits the spot.  It has excellent humor, and I often find myself laughing uncontrollably as I press space to advance through the chatting/cutscenes, seeing hilarious lines being announced by the characters, either in the arguing present everywhere in the game (because Natalie's boobs/Matt being a disgrace/Anna living in a tree/Lance having microcameras stored in his armor to 'look' at Natalie's boobs), or in the battling of hundreds of enemies (because they are too weak/strong/disgusting/cool/tasty/scary, or because they resemble Pok*mon too much).  The characters are beautifully designed, and their personalities are constantly clashing with each other due to their differences, creating a constantly interesting atmosphere to get your mind off the battling and strategy if you're playing on Epic. There's things to like in all of them (and if you look at my profile you MIGHT find out which one is my favourite), and the soundtrack is amazing as well.  All in all, it sounds like I'm reviewing a GOTY title. And I can't say I don't love Epic Battle Fantasy the Fourth. Thank you Matt Roszak for making this game.",

Amazing soundtrack? ~ Then this game is for you! ♡  With more gameplay than many AAA 'factory made' games released by big companies (who dare to charge $40 for 15 hours worth) and much replayability with the new arena/boss modes - this little gem of a game will not disappoint.   Still unsure?  Then check out the free basic/lite/demo version available on the web - if you like that, you will love the  LARGE  amount of extra content Matt (the one and only developer) has added for this version.",

            "review_text": "Alright, to begin with let's get the tricky stuff out of the way.   First of all, this game is cheeky and doesn't shy away from cracking jokes at everything, itself included. If you're easily offended, you might want to keep that in mind when making your decision, but ultimately it's all light-hearted and carefree. So don't make it a political thing, it's not.   Secondly, while it's true you can play this for free on Kongregate, the Steam version (like Kong premium version) adds extra features (including new game plus), an entire new zone with bosses on illegal stimulants, supports more resolutions and you get the entire soundtrack, which is, might I say, really, really good.  Now with the disclaimers done and over with, let's get to the actual game.  It looks old school and cartoony, with turn based combat in which you slash, hack, blast and nuke your way through loads upon loads of critters, ranging from cute bushes (never thought I'd use that phrase seriously) to intimidating elementals. Elemental strength/weaknes system is in play, and there's plenty of elements and status effects to play around with. There's a lot of room for experimentation with gear and skills, and even bosses can be beaten through different approaches.  The soundtrack, as I said already, is AWESOME. No really. Just listen to it and appreciate it. It does a lot to round up the game experience. HFX has done an awesome job yet again (the only kind of job she ever does it seems).  It's not a hardcore RPG, even if it offers its challenges, but that makes it no less fun. Just a word of warning: If you decide to play this, better wear a helmet, because those shards of the fourth wall are going to be a-flyin' all over the place.",

            "review_text": "So, you're wondering if this game is worth your time? YES. Worth your money? Yes. definately!  In this game, you control Anna, a ranger whom ends up tracking down the team of Epic Battle fantasy 3 on the accusation of them having stolen the gem of her village. You end up going on an epic adventure with them, going through adorable settings all over. The game is beautful with hand drawn settings that have tons of love in them, making every single area feel likable, even if it's not your favorite!  You'll be playing with a total of 4 characters, having 1 of them on backup in case your main team falls, and for me that meant that the person on back-up often ended up being forgotten in regards to stat boosting items and equipment upgrades, but that's how i like to play the game. The person in back-up gets XP just like everyone else in battle, as long as they are alive at the end of the battle. Switching someone out with the back-up is smooth and seamless at the single press of the button, and if you regret it you can always switch right back. The battles move at your own pace, as the enemies cannot take their turn until you are done with yours, making the game move however you want it, wether you wanna go fast and spam your strongest move or if you carefully want to plan out the next upcoming turns.  The game thrives on it's exploration, the humor and hidden references (which unfortunately had to be partially censored at least by name in order to avoid legal issues as far as i'm aware), but most importantly the music. Oh man, the music is great! It's often high tempo, but it calms down when it needs to, and it does a fantastic job att setting the mood for the current situation, which is really the only thing you'd truly want out of music for an RPG game. The game also features a bit of puzzle solving and NPC quests (most of which are fetching quests where you give them crafting items of different kinds) but if that's not your slice of cake, it's not a problem because the quests are entirely optional as far as i know, and the puzzle solving, while mandatory in some parts, is never so difficult that you feel like you want to take a break because the puzzle is just difficult.  Now, there is a free to play version available on the web, both on Matt's own website aswell as several different gaming websites, but there are a couple of differences. Mainly, on the premium versions on the gaming websites as well as the steam edition, you can access an area called Battle mountain, which features tons of bonus equipment, items, skills, summons and more. But most importantly, it features some very heavy challenges, ones that will have even the best of players on the edge of their seats as they lose over and over, slowly making progress towards that sweet goal, giving you a dark souls feeling of success when you finally complete the ordeal! That takes me to the difficulty of this game!  Overall, this game isn't particularily hard in many ways. The puzzles aren't extremely complex for the most part, the battles shouldn't give you that much trouble, and there's plenty of oppurtunity to heal yourself in between battles (one of which is just to stand around, as you do have natural regeneration on both MP and HP), but here's the fun part. On the options menu, you can instantly switch between the 4 different difficulties at any point on the world map, and since the battles are all actively triggered along with fleeing being 100% reliable, you can customize the experience according to how you like to play your games! If you want to play through the game having a chill time, you could just cruise through on easy. If you want to play through the game having a TOUGH time, you should play on Epic, which is when the game itself becomes so incredibly difficult at some parts that you might have to end up fleeing a battle, changing your entire equipment loadout and then trying again. However, if you feel that a battle is at any point TOO difficult for you, it's always possible to simply flee and turn the difficulty down.  As for equipment, there is a ton of variation in everything from weapons to armor and accessories. Every character has their own type of weapons, and every type of weapon comes in a varied and unique form, ranging from a gun made of marble in the shape of a fist that will smite undead foes and steal health based on how much damage you do to a bow that will inflict random status ailments on each hit to a staff that is a literal incarnation of deaths' scythe, you'll find your favorite to use pretty quickly. However, even if you find the number one weapon you prefer, almost never will weapons feel obselete as enemies come in a ton of different elements and forms, and weapons almost always carry with them a special element, so ultimately, it comes down to deciding wether you want a weapon for its stats or if you want it because of the special effects it triggers. A lot of different equipment trigger special events before your turn starts, such as a random attack triggering before you get to act, or maybe a random positive buff on your character. The armor is divided into two groups, one with male armor and one with female armor, since there's 2 of each in the game. This is nice as upgrading one set of armor could potentially benefit both of the specified users, however i feel this is also a slight drawback as if one armor set is used by one character, the other one has to use a different once, which can lead to trouble sometimes if you are for example looking for specific elemental resistances and you only own 1 armor piece which protects against it, as you'd then have to choose which one would be allowed to equip it.  Furthermore, accessories are shared across all your characters, and they come in the form of small badges, and while the effect more often than not isn't extremely impactful, it's nice to get small additional bonuses from time to time.  Overall, this game is alot of fun, any fans of RPG games or JRPGs will most likely instantly love this game, and for people that aren't into RPG's yet but are looking for somewhere to start, this would make a great candidate!  Rating for this game: Visuals: 9/10 Audio: 10/10 Gameplay: 8/10 (my only problem is that i wish there was some other way to control the battle menu besides the mouse :C)  Final grade: 9/10  If this game is on sale, do consider buying it, as it will 100% garanteed (by me) be worth it. Also, you gotta give him some credit, it's a single (not relationship wise) guy doing so much work, by both drawing everything, programming everything and man, you KNOW there's been put some blood, sweat and tears into this game!  I love it!",

            "review_text": "So,here I am,writing a review on this amazing game. I'm 9 hours off to have 100 hours in total put into this game,almost beating the game a second time and now,at Temple of Godcat. Let's do this. So let's get straight to the point,to me,and probably to the whole community the selling point was the humor and the artstyle. I also really like the voice in the trailer. Since i was younger,I was playing this game,even tough I was just clicking random stuff. But now that I actually UNDERSTAND how this game works,it's super fun! The vast choices of your spells,to figuring out wich one does the most damage. To scanning new foes,great bosses and so on. But the DLC actually gives you WAAAAY more playtime! (About 15 hours plus). And I love it! Now let's take a look at the Pros and Cons:  Pros: -Humor -Artstyle (Who dosen't love anime?) -The battle system and all the spells you can hit your foes with -The way encountering foes works,you don't have to get that chest or battle that random foe,just pass 'em like they aren't there! -You don't have to grind,you can but the foes level with you so it dosen't really matter. -The bosses are great,but the remakes on Battle Mountain are amazing! -The way Kupo interacts and let's their fans make some foes,and sometimes even bosses! -The creativity and time Kupo puts into this. -The songs! They're so great! And the soundtrack is free,how generous of him! -His games are still going strong,especially this one! -A fifth game is coming out! How exciting!  And now,let's take a look at the Cons.  Cons: -He deserves just a little bit more attention. -The bosses take a little bit longer then they should. -The walking system is kinda bad. But there are Slime Cats to teleport you around,so it's not that much of a problem.   I hope this review helped you choose if you should buy this game,and the community says hell yeah! I mean,you don't see alot of 'Overwhelmingly Positive' games now,do you?  Well,I don't really know how to end a conversation/review so I'm just gonna say a bye with a heart at the end.   Bye! &lt;3  (I've awarded this game for the The 'Villain Most in Need of Hug' Award).",

If you have a good computer, though, max it up. So, here's what you need to know about the game before you buy:  1. It's a turn-based JRPG. Think Final Fantasy up to FFX and you'll get a good idea about what you're getting into. 2. There is a story, though it's usually behind a lot of humor, including a bit of meta humor. If you want a game where there is a story, but with a lighthearted tone (for the most part), this should be good. 3. Depending on how you play the game can be preeetty lengthy. It depends on whether you want to grind just enough to beat the bosses or grind A LOT and look around for any treasure. 4. Lots of skills to learn and equipment to find, and all of them can change your appearance. It's a good way to mix and match the characters you get in terms of the roles you want them to have in combat.  12 dollars is an alright price for what you get here (though it'd probably be smart to wait for a sale). If you're really stringy about if you want this game, though, you can play the first three EBF games (as well as a slightly stripped version of this one) for free on most flash game websites.",

The combats are things you initiate, but the monsters are varied enough that equipment selection isn't as simple as 'take ice weapons in fire place.'   A further point in its favor is that you don't have to waste any time with extended tutorial nonsense- straight to the gameplay with all the systems available pronto! The plot is a genre-aware 'save the world' background, but the dialogue pokes enough fun at it that never became obnoxious.

Just pay attention to skill and item leveling (in my case, focusing on a few general purpose spells at least so far to ensure always doing at least *some* damage).

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game since it came out on Armor Games and Kongregate. EBF4 is the latest entry in the Epic Battle Fantasy Franchise, an RPG series inspired by franchises like Final Fantasy and Pokémon.  It has an unique and recognisable artstyle and a quirky sense of humor. There is some story to be enjoyed here, but unlike some other RPGs, you will be playing this for the gameplay. You will be surprised by the lenght and depth of this game. One thing to note though, is that this is in fact a flash game, which means the game does require a mid-grade computer despite the games' simplicity and the steam overlay/keeping multiple tabs open doesn't work as well as usual.  Even so, grabbing it for either a sale or the full price is a steal in my opinion.    Pros: -Quirky cast with the same tone of humor -Decent Story -Unique and colorful artstyle -Good Game Lenght -No random encounters -The ability to save anywhere outside of battle -Surprisingly deep and fun gameplay, while still being very a accessible RPG -A small party of well balanced characters -Tons of videogame and other references -Decent game config options -A good amount of saves and a autosave feature -4 difficulties to choose from, providing a good challenge for everyone -Side quests and Challenging extra content to get even more stuff and replayability -Good character progression/equipment system (you should find this out for yourself, discovering what I'm talking about here is part of the fun!)  Cons: -Only on pc (although there are ways to get around this, including the web version) -Somewhat low frame cap (although it really doesn't matter for an RPG like this. Trust me, you won't even be bothered by this unless the game lags for you.) -No Shift + Tab Steam Overlay or F12 Steam Screenshots -Responds somewhat slowly when switching tabs  Other things to note: -Good pieces of music, although there isn't that much music in comparison to the size of the game, which means it might get a bit repetitive at times when you've played the game this much. -There is some puzzle solving involved, although I personally think the puzzles add to the game rather than taking away from it. These won't change according to difficulty, but you don't need to be Einstein for this stuff. -The humor can get a bit weird sometimes (boobjokes, for example), which you will either love or hate about this game. -Because of the relatively large game size, you might lose interest before finishing everything. The percentage of people who finished the main story actually isn't that high. Whether this is good or bad depends mostly on the type of gamer you are. -Completing the game 100% requires a lot of time and mastery of the game. A lot. This might be annoying to some, but does provide a good challenge.   I recommend this game to anyone who is open to games with semi-serious story. You don't need to be a hardcore RPG fan to enjoy this game at all, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. It happens pretty often that the ones playing these games become dedicated fans of the series.   Epic Battle Fantasy 5 is currently in development and is shaping up to become even better. Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is also available for free on Steam if you want to get a good taste of the series first. Be sure to check those out if you're interested.  I can't praise this game enough for what it is. Just give it a go and see if it floats your boat.",

From a replayability standpoint the humor and plot obviously doesn't hold up well, but the combat is still engrossing, and what more can you ask of something titled 'Epic Battle Fantasy'? The soundtrack is shockingly good in a nostalgic synthisizer sort of way, and though the tracks loop fairly heavily after 11 hours and counting I haven't muted it yet. The most impressive part for me is the level design. From start to finish you are never asked to backtrack without being rewarded for it. Exploration is heavily encouraged, and plot based roadblocks flow exceptionally nicely and naturally. Like Morrowind each 'tile' of the map is filled with side-quests and secrets to discover.",

Did I mention that there are tons of hidden chests, quests for npcs (that aren't necessary for progression, just a bonus), an extra difficult bonus location for those of us that bought the game, and an amazing sound track?  I personally really got a kick out of some of the commentary between the characters. The story is obviously very light-hearted and the gimmicky chats between the heroes is usually comical - not to mention you can click on Natalie for a chuckle now and then.   Epic Battle Fantasy 4 for me was a breath of fresh air in a market that no longer caters to those of us who liked the traditional jrpg such as the early FF games/nes/snes rpgs of the past. I like Skyrim and all of the clones of that new genre of rpg that are out, but I REALLY like the old style.

It feels like a new game. But, at the same time, I suppose instead of innovating, it's simply... more content. Coupled with a map that's of a decent size, yet feels surprisingly small. That, and of all the swords that we've got still in the game even from EBF1, no Soul Eater. My absolute favourite sword is not here. That makes me a very sad cookie. Soul Eater, featured in every game up until but excepting this one. Very fun because of the drastic reduction in survivability stats, but a huge increase in damage.  I'm only 17 hours in, at the final boss, and I expect to be here for a while longer, simply because I'm gonna need to grind up a whole bunch more XP off... something, and a whole bunch more money, off... something, since I expect I am going to need a pile of it to upgrade every piece of equipment I need so I can finally beat the boss.  Now let's get something straight. I don't mind grinding. I play Disgaea 1. Yeah, play. Not played. I'm still going.  But in EBF4... for some reason, I'm not really enjoying the grinding. I'm not really certain why. I spent hours upon hours finishing up EBF3, and it was incredibly satisfying to finally tick every box, but with EBF4, I'm struggling to work up the effort to beat the final boss.  Why do I recommend this game?  I recommend it because it's a good game. It really is. It's a $12 JRPG-type game, it's great fun, and it's terribly, wonderfully simple in scope. It's exactly what it looks like, a turn-based JRPG. If you like turn-based JRPGs, you will like this one.  If your finger is hovering over that 'Add To Cart' button, and you're just not sure, then give Epic Battle Fantasy 3 a go. It's free, and a good representation of what you're going to find if you purchase EBF4.",

The combat mechanics are competent, but there's nothing that distinguishes it from any other turn based RPG. Furthermore, the game isn't particularly difficult, so it never feels like your choice of skills or equipment really matters, since you'll be able to beat any enemy without much hassle anyway.  The puzzles are pretty standard 'find key/item to unlock area,' or 'flip X switches,' or 'push this boulder out of the way' affairs that are quite easy to solve.  The humor and plot are comically childish and shallow, to the point where I was questioning if the story was written to be intentionally terrible. But perhaps I'm not part of the intended audience; I just can't imagine anyone over the age of 12 finding the humor or story compelling.",

There are attacks and spells, buffs and debuffs, resistances and weaknesses. Enemies have attack patterns which can be predictable at times.  There are numerous pots. Equipment wise, you can equip a weapon, a headgear (hat), an armor, and 3 flairs (badges for small bonuses). While you can not craft any items, you can upgrade them to improve their existing stats and sometimes add new ones.  Story is cheeky and predictable. Humor is the same as previous games.

There's a solution for that: There IS a free version of this game, but it lacks a certain replayability that the premium (this one) version does. So you could go try that and decide for yourself if you want to buy this game and support the maker at the same time.  Heck, or even try the prequel you can find for free online as well! Or even the rest of the series! All the way from Epic Battle Fantasy (the first one). Though the game plays more like an exploratory RPG from the third game forth.  So why would you buy this game if you can play the free version online? Well, in my personal opinion, it just doesn't feel complete unless if you have the entire thing. Like the Battle Mountain, where you can test your abilities, skills, and equipment against some of the most difficult enemies in the game despite your level or difficulty. I also followed the creator's games ever since Epic Battle Fantasy 2 came out on Newgrounds and just want to support him and his works.

For being a flash game, it really does a lot of things very well. It has a bunch of content and the feel of the game and combat offers more replay value than most other games. I'm positive there's some kind of overpowered gear/party setup to be found somewhere/sometime but as far as I have seen there is the complexity where switching equipment to counteract the zones you're currently in will benefit you considerably which is great. It should not be mistaken for an easy game other than being an RPG where you can farm/outlevel zones, because the highest difficulty setting does offer quite a challenge.  There's a whole lot of fun to be had with just the humorous dialogues and references to popular video games and anime culture. If that's not your thing, then you may want to seek elsewhere. The game may run a little bit slower during intense scenes where there's a lot happening on the screen (depending on your graphic settings) but other than that, the only downside I can possibly imagine is feeling a bit disconnected with the story if you haven't played the previous games.. though in my opinion, even that can be nullified because the story is quite bonkers to begin with.  The game can be played for free, but the Steam version does offer a lot more extra content. Whether that's worth the price is subject to personal opinion, but I think the sheer awesomeness of the included soundtrack by the great music artist (and another personal favorite) HalcyonicFalconX definitely makes up for it.",

Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.  I've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.  While my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly.
