Has ingame achievements, but not integrated into Steam. With some improvements, the annoyances could be reduced efficiently.  - No resolution options. No full HD. No antialiasing. - Slow menus, briefly blocking when loading.  While I would not recommend this to anyone I know, but it’s not entirely bad. Sadly, the technical issues make it out worse than the gameplay and levels are. ",
