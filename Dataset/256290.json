            "review_text": "Dear child,  Tuck yourself in and listen to what I have to say. It is for those too, who have doubts with Uplay.  When I first heard that a third party program needs to be installed, I thought 'It's too much a bother to be buying this at all'. But I was in love with the game as I was with Odin Sphere, so I researched and researched until all doubts were clear.  It seems that Uplay has improved over the years, as told by a friend whom I very love so dear. After registering I instantly unravelled that once I ticked 'auto login' it is never a hassle. Switch Uplay to offline mode so it won’t meddle.  As confused as I was along the way, thorough research finally made me pay and playing this game now makes my day.  Child of Light is like a delightful bedtime story. You play as a little girl, very cute and dandy, though her arms are a little bit wobbly to be carrying a sword both sharp and pointy.  What I really appreciate is the effort that they took to make each and every sentence look so good. The beautiful world of Lemuria will captivate your eyes, with beautifully matched music as you zip through the sky.  Bottom line be told, This game is made of gold. I did not regret buying it a single bit, and I’m writing this so that your path may be lit.  Godspeed.",

            "review_text": "Child of Light is an RPG reminiscent of the JRPG genre, but with beautiful 2D visuals. A tender and linear game with simple controls but deep systems.  (Visuals) One of the selling points of CoL is certainly its artsy visuals, masterfully implemented on the UbiArt framework, the same from Rayman Origins and Legends. The landscapes vary from dark sceneries to rivers of lava, but one thing that remains constant is the extremely high quality of the artwork invested onto all moments of normal gameplay and battle.  (Systems) The battle system is a very strong point of this game. Typical strategies from JRPGs are present, with strength or defense buffs and elemental weaknesses, but there is a huge focus on timing here. In a system similar to the ATB from classic Final Fantasies, allies and enemies need to wait until their icon reaches the casting bar to choose an action. The interesting part is that while the character is casting, its action can be cancelled by hitting it with an attack. Making the system even more deep, you can slow one or the other enemy by keeping your mouse pressed on it, to adjust things to your favor. This battle system demands a lot of focus and strategy to optimize your performance, and that is why I liked it so much.  (Story) The story is told in a very poetic way, and I consider it very soothing. The narrative is made in form of poems: every single dialog in the game rhymes. It seems that bothered some people, but that didn't happen to me.  (Conclusion) Its best points are the very well executed art style and the battle system, but the rest has close to no flaws too. If I had to name a flaw, I would say that CoL lacks the learning of new skills to expand the explorability of the overworld, like in a metroidvania game.",

            "review_text": "Child of Light is so staggeringly beautiful that it’s not uncommon to find its presentation entirely overpowering that game underneath.  Pastel colors swirl lushly through the environments, soft details illuminating a world lost in darkness, as wondrously animated heroines fly onward curiously taking in places as foreign to them as the player. Elegant piano melodies accompany you in the background, often joined by your own flute before coming to crashing crescendos when a fight inevitably breaks out. It’s the sort of all encompassing grace and artistry that it’s easy to become so swept up in it that when the game itself comes into focus it almost feels unnecessary, maybe even somewhat annoying as it pulls you out of your marvelling as you're asked to take part in tasks rather a lot less captivating.  That game revealed itself to be a turn-based RPG, rather surprisingly large in scope yet scaled down so as to encompass a game far shorter than those it borrows elements from. There are quests to clear, huge skill trees to unlock, an ever growing party to manage, items to craft, and limitless enemies to take on. It’s ambitions are at once impressive, and a tad overwhelming, giving you so much to manage and consider that I was rather quickly lost in a sea of items and unlocks.  Child of Light is constantly giving you more stuff, but it doesn’t take long to see that much of it is superfluous, bogging the player down with perceived options while burying the ones you actually want. The intimidating skill tree quickly becomes much less so as the levels and skill points begin to roll in at a generous pace, but the reward you’re met with always feels intangible and minor. Points add upon points to stats that never feel important, informing you you’re apparently getting stronger but never feeling like you’ve actually grown.  The initially obscure crafting system spirals into inventory chaos, as you’re loaded down with materials that are more tedious to use than beneficial. Outfitting my party so as to broaden my elemental effect was only as useful as I was able to remember who was using what, in the continual swapping of materials as I attempted to build more useful items but inevitably ended up weakening someone in the process. The lack of any sort of guide as to the uses of different objects you can craft left me switching awkwardly between menus, testing loadouts before heading back in to actually make them. It’s convoluted and by the end I’d given up trying to make anything more from the system than I already had, hoping it was enough to get me through battles.  Combat is one of the few areas that’s more often than not actively engaging, utilizing an interesting turn system that’s more reliant on timing than just beating enemies down as hard as you can. The idea is if you position enemies on the timeline so as to attack them when they enter the last portion and are preparing to attack, you can beat them back and effectively skip their turn, which if done properly can see you continually attacking without the enemy ever getting a word in. It’s the sort of turn system that requires you always be engaging and anticipating the enemy, and when paired with the various moves of your different party members and differing enemy weaknesses can give you a lot to think about and be really satisfying to succeed with.  But as with all of Child of Light, you’re given far more than its systems can sustain, with enemies constantly pouncing you at every moment. After a point I began to run mostly on autopilot, so accustomed to an enemies patterns that they were no longer threats, but obstacles standing between me and what I hoped would be new things to fight if only I could get through to the next chapter. Even boss fights which are easily the most imaginative and interesting fights in the game, become agonizingly slow sets of attacks as you whittle away at an enormous invisible healthbar even as the boss becomes entirely helpless.  The only place Ubisoft shows an amount of restraint is in Child of Light’s simple, endearing narrative which blends its fairy tale bedtime story with that of a young girl’s coming of age and learning how to deal with the responsibilities newly put upon her. It’s intentionally cliche at times, though in a way that’s comfortingly familiar, while still subtly subverting its tropes to allow a refreshing portrayal of a story you already know before it’s even begun. The choice to writing it entirely in verse isn’t as consistently successful, changing stanzas so often that trying to follow its rhyming is a small challenge, and the necessity of rhyming causes lines to sometimes read sillily or feel forced.  Child of Light is an imperfect, exquisite creation, sometimes hard to love but yet difficult to pull yourself out of. I loved my time with it, even as I was becoming confused and annoyed at systems that often felt underdeveloped, finding trouble dismissing something so stunning and unexpectedly ambitious. It’s flaws are obvious and needing to be acknowledged, but I wanted so much not to, as my initial impression of unbelievably beauty continued to guide me through a game easily obscured by the creativity draped around it.

The trailer said it was a jrpg, but apart from the combats, which reminds me of Final Fantasy game is just a simplified version of a rpg; still, the game strength lies in its beautiful graphic and in the rhymed dialogues.

It does, however, have a major flaw: While the art design and turn-based combat system never disappoint, the story leaves much to be desired. Not in the journey, but in the ending.  I do not want to get too into-detail so as not to spoil those who want to buy the game, but I will leave this warning:  If you get attached to storylines and value proper closure and complete endings, this might be a game to  avoid.   The story flows incredibly well until the final stretch of the game, in which the developers sloppily attempted to wrap everything together. It honestly feels like they ran out of budget or time and had to quickly slap an ending on the game.  If you value the journey more than the ending, have at it. It will not disappoint.",

I found it so painful that i dont even want to retry the game with a new difficulty or keep playing it after i finished the game. The story was good BUT it really lacks of explanation of what really happened on the game, in most of situation they just point out the problem and then the problem were resolved, and almost all of the dialogue is filled with boring poetry that u dont even bother to read it, the art is so so so so wonderful, stunning, eye catchy or (anything that describes amazing), but as i said the mechanism is too painful. I would still love to recommend this game bcs the art is really really really worth the pain and it is something that RPG player should experience. For me it's 8.5/10.",

            "review_text": "Child of Light is a 2d Metroidvania turn-based RPG in which a young Princess, named Aurora, wakes up in a mythical land known as Lemuria. In order to return home she needs to find the powers of the Sun and Moon but a sinister plot gets in her way. She finds creatures from all walks of life to help her in her journey, each with their own special power.  The artwork is really really good especially if you have an affinity for oil based and watercolor style paintings. The game worked perfectly with my Xbox360 controller and a 2nd player can control Igniculus the firefly with a mouse or 2nd controller too. The combat is a mildly complex paper-rock-scissors system (almost exactly like South Park: Stick of Truth) which has a timeline that shows which order the characters/monsters will attack (much like the Grandia games). It can be difficult to use in the beginning but by the end of the game nothing stood a chance against me even on expert. There is a skill tree that has 3 branching paths/playstyles for each character. There is also a crafting system for gems (Oculi) that you can equip on the character's weapon, armor or accessory to give it different effects and bonuses. There isn't much complexity in terms of platforming seeing as how you get the ability to fly early on and from there it's about not getting hurt by environmental hazards. It's a well made and beautiful game with a fitting classical-hybrid soundtrack. One thing that might be off-putting for people is the dialog, written in poetry form with rhyming. I got used to it though and found it less annoying the more I played.   I played it for about 8 hours my first time through and got sidetracked with other stuff and stopped. I came back to it 2 years later and finished the game with ~16 hours logged in on my save file. Was it worth the $15 I paid for it? Yes. I'd say this is a pretty solid game well worth the asking price but even better if you can get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "Child Of Light is a beautiful piece of art. It is an amazing combination of beautiful visual, music, gameplay, and fairytale style story. Playing this game is like playing an interactive fairytale story that's been told by our parents before our sleep. But instead stay in the bed just hearing them. We jumped in right into the world and feel the emotion in the first hand  You are Aurora, a little girld who's a daughter of a duke in austria at late 19th century. In one day you fall sick and died. But instead of go to afterlife you woke up in the world of Lemuria. You find out to go back to your father you need to help Lemuria regain it's sun, moon, and stars that been stolen by the Queen of Night. This is the quest of a pure hearted Child Of Light to help Lemuria and come back to her father.  The world of Lemuria is so beautiful, really well made and you can feel ubisoft were put their best effort to realizing this world. It's an eyecandy for me, at first I was caught in awesomeness with the artstyle in this game. And later on I found this world has many place to explore. Hidden crates, hidden places with some puzzle solving that aren't so hard nor too easy to solve really make every exploration is worthwhile in this game. The music? SO AWESOME. Coeur De Pirate has really done amazing job to living up the world of Lemuria. Her piano playing suites well with the atmosphere of the game. And the boss battle music can pump your adrenaline, make you talked to yourself, 'Oh god oh god, this is must be the boss battle, this is gonna be awesome!!'  It's really amazing to see the development of Aurora. She's pure hearted, unadorned like how a little girl should be, really honest to other people and especially to herself. But at the same time she also very brave and don't hesitate to take a drastic measue (Read: Violent measure). At first she's so scared for being far away with her father in such strange and dark place. But later on with help from her friends, she began developing her own bravery. My favourite line in this game is when Aurora facing a giant that get in her way.  Aurora, 'Step away, or I will turn you into clay.'  She, and all the characters in game were not voiced, only a dialogue balloon like how the comic does. But because of that, I imagine my own version of her voice. I imagine a little girl voice but full with confidence, has no doubt nor fear. It made me chilled my spine because of the excitement.  The language that been used in this game is quite a mixed bag. They used somekind of language style that been used by old literature. At one side it can enhance the feel of a folklore, it feels like you just found an exciting old books, covered by dust in the box that been keeped by your grandfather. But in other side, sometimes it feels like it was forced. Like you want to told them, 'Just speak normally.'  The gameplay involve 2D platforming adventure when engaging the enemiesis turn based with action timed battle. Once you engaged by an enemy you will moved into a battlescreen like how the old JRPG has done. The battle is so engaging, the boss can be quite challenging in the hard difficulty but failure is not very punishing. Every party member has their own speciality. As example Aurora is the physical damage dealer and the only one who can inflict Light Element magic. There are only 2 party active member at one time. I said active because basically every member can be involved in a battle. And you can always switch the party member at any turn. Switching party member depend on the situation is critical. Fortunately you are not have to keep Aurora in the active party at all time. The main character can be putted on the bench so other party member can take her place.  Character skills customization are quite typical. In each level up you gain one skill point to spend. The skill tree in each character has 3 branch and that 3 branches is the only option of skill customization. In the late game one character can max one to two main branches. The equpment customization is more unique than the skills. Each characters can use occuli to increase modify their attribute. There are many combination in this game that maybe can make you sit in the occuli system for hours just to make sure every party members has the most effective occuli combination.  But unfortunately, there are very annoying bug that ruin the beauty of this game. In this game, only Aurora and several other human character that been modelled by 3D. Other characters simply use 2D sprite. But when Aurora meets a characters that been modeled by 3D, the model overlap with each other. As example, in Aurora place, there were Norah, other character that modeled by 3D, stacked in her place. And in Norah's place, there was an Aurora stacked at her place. It always been like that and not a single time when Aurora meets other character with 3D model this bug didn't appear.  My verdict is 9 out of 10. It is a very beautiful interactive folklore that make you wonder why there are no books of it so we can tell the children about Aurora Story before they asleep? With full of moral lesson that not too being smart ♥♥♥ or too being rightful one. This game is amazing for every ages. Oh have I said this game is very cheap? Only $15 dollar for about 17++ hour of excitement is totally worth it.",

I just bought the game and UPLAY refuses to work for my ability to authenticate the game on their system. I wonder how long it is going to take for them to fix this issue... I always heard about the issues people had with this client..but now i had to unfortunately experience it first hand. If you want to take a chance on a great game, dont buy it here. Buy it for ps3. Atleast it will work properly. Overall, i love this game..but UPLAY can suck it.  Update: I had to go to a site named File Horse and download an older version of Uplay in order for both to work. I was soo happy to finally be able to play this game on my computer. I hope this comment helps others as it did me.",

The dialogues are often cute and funny, I also didn't think the riming got tiresome, but maybe that's because I'm not a native speaker. The soundtrack is great and wonderfully adds to the atmosphere. The story is a bit in between. It's very nicely presented with the dialogues and all, but there is little meat on the bone if you look at it more closely. Still, the game is not very long, so no big drawback. At some point the battles will become a bit drawn out and you'll find yourself battling just for the XP and maybe some oculi loot. That's a shame, considering you'll spend so much time battling. Personally, considering the style of the game, I would have preferred spending more time exploring the world.",

The soundtrack was excellent and I recommend listening to it even if you haven't played the game. The gameplay was a standard turn based rpg, but the number of party member in combat was only two, so you needed to optimize frequently. The inventory/crafting system was basic and intuitive.   The world's uniqueness makes up for a standard story, and the characters have good personality. There are also hidden little messages that help out the worldbuilding without monologuing. There are sidequests, but they're not necessary to complete, they just provide rewards and can easily be looked up online to see if they're worth your time.

We were both consistently blown away by how beautiful landscapes and characters were. Same goes for the soundtrack - as a pianist with a love of piano music, it resonated with me. Powerful yet serene, sorrowful and joyous.  Gameplay was a nice mix between exploration / environment absorption and challenging combat. We played on Casual and felt it was suitable.  The characters were each well-developed enough, memorable and provided enough variety combat-wise to make me care! This is often difficult.  I absolutely loved the Oculi system - it provided both meaningful upgrades and creativity in crafting. Loads of room to experiment, too! I spent a lot of time wondering about gem combinations, which tier was the highest, can you combine diamond + onyx (yes = spinel!), etc.  The co-op play was outstanding, too! GF does not like complicated systems and Igniculus let her help in both exploration and combat. Really reminds me of Wind Waker's Tingle Tuner asymmetric co-op gameplay. I'd love to see more of this approach to co-op.  In short, Child of Light was an outstandingly strong game - cohesive, enticing and thoroughly enjoyable. 10/10, would recommend to everyone!",

A few times you are asked to make a decision by starting or ignoring a quest, though the only way this will affect your game is the number of allies you have at your disposal.  The ending came quite out of the blue and with no real build-up. To be honest I was quite disappointed with that, as I had expected for more to happen and the final boss to at least be a bit of a challenge, which was really not the case.  Once you've beat it for the first time you have the option to start a 'New Game +'. This means that while you have to collect your allies from the start, you still get to keep your items, skill tree, level and confessions. The enemies are a bit harder too, but that's pretty much it, so there's no real re-play value in my opinion.  I would also have loved for the dialogue to have a voice over option, but all in all it was still a very fun and captivating game.  I did not and will not bother buying any of the DLCs as aside from a new character they bring nothing new to the table in regards to game play or story.   =====================",

If you not getting CD key , delet Uplay and install latest version (it should let you in without cd key)  Please note that this game will not run well on integrated graphics unless you have at least low end card build into your computer . Requirments for this game are very low but not low enough to run it on Labtops that are build for internet browsing .   The Story in this game is very generic as some people pointed out in negative reviews . All the plot twists are predictable but my eyes were tearing more than once. It is a same story about princess and stepmother you herd a million times but it does a good job of conveying emotions and setting the atmosphere . Granted you have to like kid stories to fully enjoy this game .  Gameplay is a turn-based combat . It is like old over the top RPG games only in 2D side scroller. You have to run into enemies to start combat so its not in real time . If you played many RPGs I would recommend starting the game on expert mode or it might be too easy . Few boss fights kicked my booty so I had to grind few levels which reminds good old times .  I spotted 2 big flawed design mistakes with gameplay . You will notice that enemies do not have any information regarding their resitances (some are color coded and the other are not ) I made a guide for that if you run into that problem .Also if you use AOE buffs they will only apply to 2 party members that are in the combat ( which is wird because after using a Buffing character you would want to switch to damage character so it defeats the purpose of AOE buff)  There are 7 to 8 characters ( 9 with DLC ) that will be in your party . They all have their own skill trees with passive and active skills . You will need to strategically use each one to beat the game .  Beside gameplay this game is very pretty . You don't see many big companies do these kind of games and I have to say that Ubi deservs some praise on this one . I mean it looks like you playing inside the painting entire time .  You can play this game with 2 players in a HotSeat . One will control Aurora and the other will control a little flying thing that can pick items , slow down enemies and heal party members . I don't have kids but if you have 7-10 year olds maybe it will be a fun activity . This game is pretty much kid friendly .  Overall I would give this game 9/10 for what it is .

On normal it didn't require a great deal of strategy to get through most fights (a couple were scary for sure even so), I imagine it's a bit brutal on the harder difficulty.   It may seem short for a story-telling RPG but it really is just about a perfect length for itself.

Characters also level easily and there's absolutely no need to grind! (Unless you tend to skip battles actively!)

            "review_text": "Child of Light is a 10-15 hour game that incorporates elements of turn-based rpgs and platforming in order to weave a tale of fantasy and lost kingdoms. Immediately striking is the use of water-color inspired backdrops and lighting effects. Each new area and set piece within the game was designed with the same level of care and detail that one would expect from traditional art. The soundtrack, as well as the tone of the storyline, invokes a strange sense of nostalgia for fairy tales and children’s books. Without divulging any spoilers, there are elements of the storyline that mirror tales by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. And much like these authors tales there lays a certain air of darkness and sadness to the story narrative of Child of Light. Despite this, I consider the game to be suitable for kids.   The gameplay element was both familiar and simplistic, however the use of the right analog stick to assist in puzzle solving added a bit of flavor and variety to the platforming. Battles were fought using a turn-based system, with the ability to slow or speed up a character or enemy along in the timeline. This allowed for interesting 'on-the-fly' decisions that made the combat fun and allowed for a bit of strategy to be incorporated. XP is awarded after winning battles which can be used to develop a skill tree. Each character the player encounters in the game will have various 'specialty' skills, and each may be switched out during combat. There is also a crafting feature in the game that will result in various gems that will 'buff' certain skills in battle.  Overall, the game was not very difficult. I found the puzzle solving to be a somewhat shallow, and even the combat, albeit seemingly deep within the first few hours, became mechanical and grinding towards the end. However, the overarching experience of Child of Light was satisfying and charming. The amount of work put into creating the fantastical and whimsical atmosphere of Child of Light is what will remain long after the game's conclusion. I would recommend this game. 8/10",

Long version   I saw this game when it first came out , and i said oh well lets fly the jolly roger. Then after i finished it , i just went and bought it . My experience was so good and felt those weird thingies called emotions that actually i shed a tear (meaning i had to literally wipe my eyes.. those onion-cutting ninjas). The selling points of this game are the atmosphere and the plot. But i will explain all of it below  Child of Light is tagged as a RPG , but offers you no choices in the plot element. But (and it is a big but) offers character customization (talents and occuli) and the most important thing character development . For me RPGs should be like that. You see as the time passes that Aurora and her companions grow up emotionally and stand up to the task .    Atmosphere",

            "review_text": "Gamplay:   Standard RPG combat with an addition of an interrupt and slow system that is easy to use but would take some time to master. Outside of combat is standard 2D rpg format that works well with the flight mechanics. Animations, espcially Aurora's, are very nice and well done. Each characters has there own skill tree that has some customization, but not very complicated.   Controls:  I used a keyboard &amp; Mouse. Controls were simple and easy to use. In battle they are simplified to an active battle system which is easy to navigate. Outside of combat is a very simplistic platformer that does not require much precision. To Control your firefly you use your mouse, this is designed for a mouse, it works very well. With all that said, I believe the standard controls would also work very well with a control &amp; the firefly mechanic would work well with the second joystick on all controllers. Overall- Very Good.   Sound:   Beautiful music that fits the mood all the time, and sound effects fit extremly well with all the Spell effects   Graphics:  Atmospheres are beautifully designed, some of them are downright stunning, from dark &amp; scary forests to Lava filled Trees to underwater caves from beginning to end. Not hard to see what ubisoft focused on while creating this game.  Wothey Notes:   The writing is pretty atrocious, the rhymes seemed very forced and weren't thought to hard about, character deveolpment is lack luster as well but you get the basic points . Only really complaint about this 12 hour RPG. Well worth the money, 8.0 out of 10.   ",

One, I should add, that really does require you to take full advantage of elemental strengths, resistances, and elemental boosting items. It's got a unique battle timer, which should keep you thinking about your next move.  The story drags on, which was surprising for a game that really seemed to rely on it.

In terms of difficulty, if you want somewhat of a reasonable challenge go on Hard, but even Normal keeps you on your toes.   The level design is absolutely gorgeous and the scenarios are even more breath-taking, so much that you can download wallpaper versions on Uplay via Rewards. The only downside on this game is the linear story, don't get me wrong it's very good but lacks of epic twists that keeps a story fresh and engaging. In other words, if you truly seek a gorgeous adventure, full with epic hand-drawn scenarios and original and well-developed characters, and games like Final Fantasy, don't hesitate to buy this masterpiece and fall into the world of Lemuria, you will not regret it, or if you prefer playing a role against the Russians in a half-♥♥♥♥♥ campaign, be my guest.  9/10",

I'd wait until it's on sale for around 5 dollars.  It's fine. It's alright. It's a fairly standard RPG so there really isn't a lot of gameplay going on. There isn't a lot of variety in the music. The artwork is good but the animations are creepy at times.  On the plus side the combat/outside of combat has a really cool thing going on with the support character, who can freeze enemies outside of combat, slow them down inside of combat and heal you in either situation. His operations are independent of the other characters/time line that combat follows so that part is neat. CoL also has a sort of Mario RPG esque feel to it's combat since it's centered around timing your attacks effectively to interrupt the enemy's.  There's a story and it's not the worst but it's sort of dull. Very fairy tale inspired, and that part of it is cool, but it's definitely not the sort of story meant to last the 6-8 hours of gameplay. It's not bad by any means but I think it could have been utilized better in another game type.  One of the bigger draws is the writing, which is clever in a lot of parts but I think that it ultimately loses out by the game not having voice work for the characters. Oh, the narrator bits between major segments are fantastic and the writing really comes alive then, but everywhere else it's just kind of meh. There are great points to it, and I did enjoy the interactions between characters, but well, it felt lacking in some regard. It felt like the writing was trying to elevate itself in some way but the author's skill wasn't there. At times the rhyming style seemed to detract from the actual writing. Pity, that.  Oh, watch out by the way. The difficulty curve in Child of Light is crazy. You'll go from no challenge to extremely difficult bosses near the mid/end, which will then peter out into pretty easy fights by the very end.  I've read that the game itself is short or feels rushed but despite my claims that the story feels stretched, the game itself seemed to pace itself pretty well. I thought it was about the right length.  I recommend Child of Light but this is a case of a game that I don't think should have been a game. The non-game parts are still good, if pretentious. Ehh.  Oh, Child of Light also has the absolute worst DLC I've ever seen in a game. Sure, one is a new character, but two more are main character reskins and the rest are item packs. These item packs are of items that exist in the game already and are acquired pretty frequently so I'm not really sure why the DLC exists. Oh, wait. Money.",

Everything looks, sounds, and feels fantastical and artistic, from the oil painting-esque graphics to the poetic dialogue, this game is definitely worth more than the $14.99 price tag.   There's several classic RPG elements here: characters level up, you get allies that fill up all sorts of roles, a skill tree, collectibles, crafting system, and turn based combat. In terms of the last one though, Child of Light gives a new spin on the old turn based combat formula: instead of having a set order, you have a waiting period and a cast period. During the waiting period, all characters involved in the battle move slowly to the cast period, and once they reach that point, you'll be able to select your moves. During this period, though, if either character hits another character that's also in the cast period, you can 'interrupt' their move, sending them a little bit farther back into the waiting period. It's a system that takes getting used to at first, but it doesn't take long to strategize around it.   Overall, the hype behind this game was right on target; this game is one of the best RPGs that have come out for a long time. Although there's sadly no class system, there are plenty of skills to learn through the skill tree, and the amount of grinding that you end up doing doesn't feel too monotonous, as you'll quickly level up and earn extra rewards. Also, characters in your party level up at about the same time, so for those who just like to stick to a few characters, there's no need to worry that any other characters are falling behind.",

Something unique and personal like a bedtime-tale told to you as a youngling.  Dark and melancholic atmosphere feels like kids-friendly Dark Souls with some similarities story-wise -lol.  Maps looks light-metroidvania but I'm not too far in to judge. Some riddles though easy so far. Reached the first boss - cool design. Difficulty on hard setting is decent, very easy on normal setting. Dual-stick-controller highly recommended.  Pretty graphics look hand-painted and fit the mood, some won't like it but the majority probably will. The same with the soundtrack, very memorable. Deep story so far, I'm really anxious for the ending.  Battles play out as cross between Final Fantasy-ATB and Grandia. When the time bar is full you can act with some delay. If you're hit within the action-delay the action gets cancelled. And if the enemy is about to attack you should probably block which also fills your next gauge faster.   Definitely buy if you like j-RPGs, pretty stuff and melancholy.  I really don't agree with the day 1-DLCs, Uplay or the Ubi-staff posting like us gamers on the forum anon but will not go in detail here as the discussion is already been held elsewhere. Just saying: if it gets games like this gettjng made for 15 bucks it excuses a lot of things and if you don't like Ubi, just get this game then boycott the next 50$/€ AC next time to ease your consciousness. :) Also the DLCs don't seem essential to enjoy the game, it's just to extract some more coins from the rich kiddies.",

The art and music is great and the combat system reaches back to the old turn-based RPGs that I loved as a kid.

It has limited skill paths to progress and a simplistic crafting system to augment your characters attack/defense.   It's not terribly difficult, although I haven't seen it on hard difficulty. But you can't just make random choices and expect to survive. There is a lot of timing involved in interrupting monsters or slowing them down, so it does require a tiny bit of strategy.  The story is endearing and I've already said the art is beautiful--but it's worth saying twice. The whole game is drawn out in rhyme...which sounds forced at points, but that is forgiven.

I have a small rant here about the writing: the game is billed as poetry; it's not. The lines rhyme (poorly), but that doesn't make it poetry. The writer has no sense of rhythm nor measure, and a great many of the 'rhymes' reach so far they dislocate their shoulders. If you call the writing poetry, it's complete crap. But as a story told nursery-rhyme style, it's not bad. It's a coming of age story, and I like those.  I highly recommend the game. I've missed having real RPGs in the current age of FPS/RPG/MMO/Puzzle/anything-else-we-can-shoe-horn-in-to-maybe-get-another-market games. This definitely qualifies.",

The characters are unique and interesting, with their own personality.  The music, always an important part of a game for me, is sad and heroic at the same time; I enjoyed it so much I actually bought the soundtrack.  Aurora, the heroine, is an endearing character, a child who grows as you guide her through the story. I loved just watching her hair flow around in the wind as you fly around looking for hidden chests or monsters. She's kind, courageous, and grows as the story progresses.  I love stories and games with female protagonists, and this does not disappoint, an excellent example that games featuring strong women in leading roles can be great. Aurora is a very good role-model for young gamers.  The gameplay was a bit easy and rather simple, but then I'm a veteran of this kind of game for 30 years. Still I found the combat system enjoyable overall. The real gems in this game are the exploration, the dialogue and the story.",

The backgrounds look hand-painted, but have a level of interactibility I didn't expect, and the game has a charming 2D kind of look to it that still manages to have so much depth. I could look at the backgrounds all day.   The battles are turn based, but unike anything I've experienced before. At the bottom of the battle screen a 'timeline' appears, segmented in two (waiting and casting) and your placement on the timeline, as well as your enemy's place determines who attacks first, but if you manage to attack them before they attack you and while they're in the casting section, you can actualy knock them back on the timeline, delaying their attack, It makes you have to think ahead, so that when you finally beat the bad guys, you feel like a tactical genius.  The Skill trees are pretty simple, as there aren't a whole lot of flashy moves, but a lot of opportunity to strengthen the ones you do have, which I actually find more satisfying than having a bunch of different, yet low-power options.  Throughout the game you can collect gemstones of various types called Oculi, which you can then combine to make bigger ones, or different ones, or bigger different ones, with each type of gemstone offering a certain perk or strength that, when equipped to one of 3 slots that your character and anyone in her party has, can give you that advantage in battle, or extra XP gain that can sometimes mean life or death.  The dialogue is exclusively in rhyme (I want to say iambic pentameter but I haven't been keeping track) and although at times it seems like they're really scambling to make it rhyme, it doesn't diminish the story.   Some reviewers have said that this game takes 12 hours to get through, but I've been playing it for more than that, and not only am I nowhere near finished, I haven't been bored for even a minute, despite taking my sweet time.   I can't reccomend this game enough. I really can't. Chances are if I know you, I wil make you play it.  P.S. Explore! Look everywhere. You might be surprised at what you find.",

My biggest gripe is that the final boss battle is given very little presentation/setup compared to the game's other boss battles.  Regardless, there were more quests to be completed and items to be found so those looking to 100% the game could probably get around 15 hours out of this $15 game.

And I haven't even played the full first hour of it, I only just reached Chapter 2 and it's already, without a doubt, one of my favourite games on my laptop.  The combat system is amazingly fun. Of course, I'm only in the very early parts of the game, so it's very easy to use Firefly to screw with the enemies and get a guaranteed Surprise Strike, or guarantee that the enemy won't hit me by slowing them down with Firefly's light. But it's still a fun mechanic that not many games would use. It makes grinding experience easier, in my opinion, because you don't have to worry about losing too much health.  I also love the platforming elements. Mixing a sidescrolling platformer with a turn-based RPG system is exactly my kind of game. Especially since, although linear, there is still incentive to explore and search for secret chests. Or, if cou can, go back to earlier portions where you previously couldn't do something, and see if you can explore further using Firefly. My only issue is with my laptop, which gets hot very easily, but that's a problem with my laptop and not with the game. I can easilly buy a laptop fan and be able to play this game for hours.  I don't understand why so many people give this game negative reviews just because it requires UPlay. Who cares if it has a separate launcher? Just link the UPlay account to your Steam account THROUGH UPLAY and the launcher doesn't pop up anymore. It is entirely a non-issue.   Overall, I very very highly reccomend this game, especially if you like beautiful sound, beautiful asthetics, and fun mechanics.",

The slot mechanic of the special runes acquired by crafting and fighting is a welcome addition, but can require some grinding to really obtain the good stuff - this can be the most tedious and unenjoyable portion of the game, but is still better than not having the option.  The entire game is written in 'nursery rhyme' and you will encounter some strange scenarios and characters throughout the story. If you can't stand poetry, watercolor, or flying - don't bother.

Every detail has been refined to its best, and what few issues I had with it are so simplistic, it doesn't take away one speck of the value the game has!   The Story: It is incredibly well done; even if you don't like rhymes, it's worth it to go through and follow along. It seems very predictable and a little cliche, but feels and plays as the exact opposite. They did a wonderful job in keeping the player's interest peaked for the entirety of the play-through, and it concludes rather nicely. The game usually revolves around the story, so it's hard to step away from it without feeling the need to go forward.   The World and Characters: Also both well done. The world is enriched by the splendid art style and captivating music, and the characters each have their own personality and differ from each other, so nothing congeals together. Each party member is unique in his or her own way as well, allowing you to play the game as you wish. Despite the overall fantasy-feel of it, it remains unique, straying from what has been overused in order to carve its own path.   The Gameplay: I usually am not one for turn-based combat, yet I found myself enjoying it in this game! They turned away the inevitable-moments-of-doom usually found in turn-based if you make a wrong decision, by allowing you to turn the tables in the time it takes for the enemy to attack. It makes combat much more bearable, even desired!  The animations are smooth, and the transfer from exploring to an event or a battle is not interruptive at all, so afterward you can easily resume your previous task. I haven't encountered any odd clipping errors or hesitance in the controls, and the maps are linear enough that if you don't want to explore, you can just go with the plotline. Everything is smooth, simple, and easy to get into, and if you do decide to invest more time into the game by exploring, you are well-rewarded! The simple dialog sequences also bring you closer to the characters, and is a clever way to avoid odd animations the player would have to watch from a distance. Overall, the gameplay allows you to enjoy the game more, instead of hindering it in any way.   The Art and Sound: The artwork and the soundtracks of games are like icing for a cake, and this is some delicious frosting! The artwork is colorful and unique, and has that fantasy-rpg feel to it to really suck you in. Despite some of the characters having models, instead of being animated images, they are almost impossible to tell apart, allowing the more complex works to fit well inside the world, instead of being an obvious difference that makes you wonder why the developers didn't just go one way or the other. The soundtracks are spectacular, immersing you into Lemuria with the rich symphony it conducts. I have yet to meet someone who didn't like orchestral music, and this music is so well done, it's art within itself! If you like this game, I recommend buying the soundtrack as well!   UPlay and being a Port: I had doubts with UPlay, but other reviews made me reconsider. I, for one, do not like installing other programs, just to interface with another program so I can play one game. Child of Light will most likely be the only game in my UPlay account for a long time. But it's well worth it, even if it seems tedious! (Which it kind of is... But that might have something to do with the fact that Child of Light is also on PS4). After playing the game, the only thing that would ever turn me away is UPlay. And I don't care about it that much to let it hinder me.  Though since Child of Light is on PS4, I'm guessing the PC version is a port, which would explain the only other issue I've had in the game. Sometimes at intersections it's hard to go down the path you want to go, instead of the other one which the game thinks you want to go. I imagine it's easier to avoid on console, but on PC it can get frustrating. Luckily, there is a key that allows Aurora to jump down from something if possible, so most of those instances are simply fixed.   Child of Light kept me entertained for hours, and even though it doesn't have much replay on one profile, it tempts you to start up a new game and play all over again! The DLC spice it up even more-It's well worth any game investment, and should be in any rpg-lover's library!",

Along the way Aurora meets strange friends who help her fight through the monsters of Lemuria in order to save her father from death. The game takes on many aspects of well known fairy tales such as Sleeping Beauty and is written entirely in iambic pentameter.  The Pros:  Combat - Combat is done in a jrpg style. It is indepth as well as entertaining. How combat centered the game will be is determined by your difficulty level. If you're the type of person who only wants a casual experiance and a story, great, you can breeze through the combat on easy. For those of you who enjoy a challenge, bump up the difficulty.  Art - If you take one look at the beautiful watercolors of Lemuria, you will see why so many people are drawn to this game. From dark forests to high cliffs and to under water palaces, the artsits behind Child of Light never fail to deliver a stunning, graceful, and beautiful scene.  The Cons:  Characters - All though it's obvious that Ubisoft Montreal wanted to make the game feel like a classic fairy tale, they may have succeeded all too well. The characters, though unique in their own way, vary little from their classic archetypes. Overall this has damaged the game for many people.  Overall, I would say buy the game. If you're overly concerned about the flat characters, buy the game when it's on sale. The experiance was enjoyable enough to play through it at least once, although I suspect that eventually I will play through the game again.",

It's a game you keep coming back to because of the art most of all, but there is something gently addictive about the progression systems too.

I loved the start of this game. It had me entranced so fully and I was sucked into it at once. The music is lovely and the art is something special. The drawn world with the 3d girl. It's beyond lovely. It's beautiful. The fairy tale like beginning of a little girl who is in this magical world. I was truly in love.  The game play is clean with its little faults here and there and the combat is simple. There is room for thought and cleverness when you fight or you can just push your way through every battle.  About half way through I feel the game starts to lose a lot of it's charm. A little after you meet Aurua's sister is where I feel the magic starts to fade away. The story teller speaks to you for the last time till the end of the game and it's where you lose your sister as a party member that the magic just seems to fade away. And by the end it's just gone.   It's a rushed ending with a final boss just thrown at you with no build up. It just happens. And it ends about as fast as that. Your little child of light spends half the game not being a child and certainly doesn't end being a child. The issue with her father feels empty and forgotten. And Umbra, your big bad, feels uneventfull and not really that much of an issue.   Understandably this is not a big game and there is only room for what there is room for. But I feel, despite that, the ending shouldn't have been what it was. The story, to me, is just as important as everything else and when you fall so terribly short it's disappointing though I do not regret any money or time spent on the game. It was pretty and good for what it was, even with the lack luster ending.   It's said this game is boring, though I can see how one might feel that way, I do not find it so. It's a typical rpg with talking. You walk some your characters stop and talk. You fight a couple battles your characters stop and talk. That's just familiar ground to me. The story itself is simple, perhaps boring? I found it enchanting. I suppose if you like whimsical and fanciful fairy tale like stories this would be a game for you, otherwise, perhaps not. For all it's faults and troublesome little issues it's a pretty game with a strong story start and a faltering end. Worth a single playthrough and the few dollars it costs when it is on sale.   ",

            "review_text": "Ubisoft hasn't had a good 2014, Watch Dogs didn't live up to it's hype even though I still enjoyed it for what it was, Assassin's Creed Unity became a buggy mess at launch and was considered dissapointing compared to previous games, Assassin's Creed Rogue is just DLC packaged into a full-game and The Crew also isn't looking too good, don't know about Far Cry 4 though. I hope that in time those two games (Unity and The Crew) get better through patching and updating.  However, Ubisoft Montreal did manage to create one of the best RPG's this year, which is Child of Light and I enjoyed every moment of it.  Child of LIght takes place in 1895 Austria where the Duke's daughter Aurora, wakes up in an unfamiliar land called Lemuria. On a ardous quest to return home, she starts encountering monster's who serve Umbra, who is responsible for the land's turmoil and for stealing the moon, the sun and the stars which are the embodiements of light, Umbra is the opposite of Light (Good) which is Dark (Evil). To aid Aurora in her journey, she meets several unique companions and begin's jolly cooperation with them, killing monsters for loot and recieving xp together, and completing side-quests for personal gain and to help Lemuria's townsfolk.  Gameplay: The game starts out as a 2d platformer which is pretty solid in terms of movement and animations. In combat mode, it's reminescent to JRPG games with it's action turn based system. one of the game's mechanics is that down the bottom center of the screen you have a meter which sways to the right till it reaches the casting phase, at this point enemies can actually stop you by reaching the end of the meter but you can as well by using Igniculus, your firefly companion to slow them down.   before the end of that meter, you get time to make your decision whether you want to initiate an attack, use a potion, retreat from battle or switch party members, your standard options basically. Combat in this game is fun and I usually prefer action-based combat like Dark Souls. The bosses are pretty epic as well.  Story: It's like a story with two sides of the coin, one side is different from one another but they are at conflict. They cannot co-exist with one another and the main character Aurora, is dragged into all of this. Light and Dark and their place in the world start to unfold throughout Aurora's adventure. she is compassionate and friendly towards the people she helps, towards her fellow companions, her friends and her family. But she is also struggling to understand her situation and why this had happened to her. The other characters are also great and stand out, they have their personalities and indifferences, my favourites were Rubella and Finn. In terms of dialogue it's different to other game's I've played. Every piece of dialogue given by the characters in Child of Light including the Narrator, is told in a poetic manner and it's great and it works and It wasn't what I was expecting.  Music: When exploring the world of Lemuria it's peaceful, and harmonic and the memorable piece played with the flute that Aurora uses has a powerful, cheerful effect to the nearby people, especially in their times of strife and despair. When combat ensues it changes it's musical style and becomes epic, and empowering. It's one of my favourite aspects of Boss battles and the game's composer Couer de pirate does a fantastic job at capturing those feelings.  Graphics: It looks visually appealing, mainly through it's artstyle, the artstyle itself carries the game's atmosphere and tone. Lemuria is somewhat of a ruined land, corrupted by the evil queen Umbra, whatever beauty remains in the land, gradually becomes more and more barren and bleak. as Umbra continues to spread her seeds. The locations are varied too, Deep Forests, Coastal wastelands, Volcanic Tunnels, Abandoned Castles, A city on top of a giant humanoid mountain, A dark sunless fortress and Crystal lairs.  Overall: Child of Light is a special treat, it's one of Ubisoft's best titles to date and also one of the best RPG's in recent memory. a memorable experience with great characters, fun combat, great soundtrack and beautiful artwork. Don't let the name Ubisoft fool you into thinking it's a buggy, half-♥♥♥♥♥ game because I'm telling you right now, it isn't.",

This is the first game in a long long long time where i felt compelled to finish, sure the story might not have strayed too far away from a typical fairy tale, but the journey was an incredible one. If you were ever read a fairy tale, or were told a story about a magical land somewhere when you were just a kid, this will bring some of those memory back, It almost felt cheezy, but then agian, what fairy tale story ended in an unexpected way to us adults. For a fleeting moment, I went back to being a kid, accepting that the road to victory over evil, while all but assured, does have a few bumps on it. Not many games out there can do that for me.    That's enough on the story front, I did not read a single guide, just used all the ingame tutorial to help me along the way, got lost and became really confused serveral times before eventually finding my way. all the while loving the combat system, although not without a few curses thrown in there when things did not go my way.  It is worth noting I played the game on Expert diffcultly, I am by no means a 'good' player, but I did enjoy the challange it presented, some of the boss battles took serveral tries, some of the roaming mobs kicked my ♥♥♥ when I tried to play greedy. but with a few tweaks in the Occuli(essentially 'gear') and party combination, i was able to take down everything without having to back track and farm levels.   The combat system definatly took some getting used to, being turn based but not really turn based, while it was very well done and very enjoyable, making a traditionallly turn based game very very smooth in combat, it also made some skills very confusing, ( X skill lasts Y turns.) It was hard to tell exactly when a 'turn' starts and ends, but visual ques are there to help you, and they are very well presented, you will have no problem telling what buff/debuff you have at any given time, but how long do they have left? well, I couldnt really tell until they fall-off along with the visual ques.  according to the Uplay unlocks, I have completed all but 2 side quests in the game, the side quests are usually fairly straight forward, you will end up picking them up along the main story and doesnt take muccch time to do, I mostly stumbled onto them while trying to reaching the next zone. or got lost in a maze and ended up in the side quest objective.  overall 9/10 game.

Plus, there is something awesome about a tiny fairy princess defeating evil monsters with a sword that she can barely hold up. And you can FLY. I love getting to fly in video games, and Child of Light makes the most of the mechanic.  I sat at work and thought about going home and getting to play this game.

Something about the way it moves is hypnotizing.  The music is dark and mysterious, but after a while, you notice it's pretty much all a variation of the same tune.   The dialogue is a little off-putting; everything is written in poor verse. To me, this detracted from any sort of important character development.   The fact that your cursor is actually a character that helps with puzzles and battles is pretty entertaining.  Fighting is very remnicint of early/middle final fantasy games. Turns are active time, but pause as you select your action. The main difference is that you can see single enemies (that represent the potential group you'll have to battle) stalking the map, and in most cases, you have the option of avoiding them.  Puzzles were a lot of fun at first, but seem really easy once you got the hang of them.  Overall, this isn't a game you play for plot or character development; it's more of a fun little romp in a fantasy world with VERY pretty art.

There are countless secrets littered all over the map.  The battles are turn-based and use an interruption mechanic. Being attacked while casting your attack/item/spell delays your turn. You can utilize this to disadvantage enemies, sometimes forcing them to take numerous hits in a row. Very satisfying.  The biggest flaws are the low difficulty, and writing. Expert mode feels like Normal mode in other games. You'll solve the few puzzles in seconds. Challenging enough to be fun, but a higher difficulty mode would have been great.

She loved the game dearly, including the artwork, music, and characters. I ended up liking it myself, as well. She was a little nervous about the battles, so I would help her with that aspect of the game. Otherwise she was the one who controlled Aurora, and it was easy enough for her using a controller. I enjoyed reading the story to her, and she enjoyed all the different voices I made up for each character.  Now we are on our second play through, and she is now 7. Since she only remembers bits and pieces from playing last year, it's like playing the game all over again. Like visiting an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. Now she can actually read what the characters are saying, while I voice them. She even offers to voice Aurora herself. She even plays through most of the battles now, herself. I didn't expect this game to have any replay value when I purchased it last year, but here we are playing it again.    I'm often looking for things to share and do with my daughter, and games like this and Ori and the Blind Forest, are rare gems. I highly recomend this game for parents looking for a little something extra to share with their children. It is an excellent and endearing game, and well worth the price.",

The stunning 2D graphics and the atmosphere created by poetric dialogue make this such fantastic experience as you play as an innocent girl fighting the dark unkown, only wishing to be able to return to back home.  The whole 'Active-Time Battle System alongside the firefly Igniculus and other members of Aurora’s party' work super smoothly and make the combat itself properly challenging and tactical.  Oh, and the soundtrack. Somehow sad background music fits perfectly to adventuring in the mystical world of Lemuria, and the epic battle music really makes the fights very, very intense.

That, along with the instantly distinctive hand-drawn art style and beautiful instrumental music combine to form one of the most stylish RPG's to be released in recent memory. The presentation is nothing short of masterful, and if you enjoy the artistic expression inherent in games, you'll need no further reason to go play this right now.  This is a turn-based RPG, with an excellent and well-balanced combat system reminiscent of the Grandia series, with all attacks requiring charge time and being interruptable. That, mixed with the ability to hot-swap party members and influence the timing of actions with your firefly familiar leads to a system that's surprisingly deep. It's easy to miss just how well-designed the combat is, but notice how: 1) you can't always just spam your best attack -- you have to watch what can interrupt you, 2) you don't always just focus fire on one enemy, since you might want to prioritize interrupting their attacks, 3) the defend command is critically useful, and 4) you actually need to use your party swap mechanism for the tougher fights. It's really rare for a system to pull that off!  I played on Hard mode and found the challenge level to be perfect (so I imagine RPG veterans would find 'Normal' far too easy); I struggled to survive and used copious amounts of potions in several battles, but victory was always attainable with decent strategy. Unless you're revisiting an old area that you now overlevel, you can't just spam the basic attack and expect to win!   When not playing a combat or enjoying the poetry-filled story, you'll be exploring the world in 2D platformer mode. At first, it feels like it might be a full-on metroidvania, but you get the ability to fly and open all the locked paths very early in the game, so it's really more of a straightforward 2d action segment. There's some very light puzzle solving, a handfull of side quests, and plenty of hidden things to collect -- but it's generally more of a relaxing walk through the scenery.   As for drawbacks? There really aren't any, aside from Uplay and Ubisoft's utterly perplexing day-0 DLC (why would you buy in-game items? They're not even particularly *good* items and you can get them easily by playing.) I could ask for more -- more levels, more skill variety, perhaps better level design with harder puzzles ... but there could always be more stuff in a game. What's here constitutes a solid experience that I can heartily recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based RPG's and the fairytale aesthetic.   Overall: 5/5 -- My favorite game so far this year. ",

You'll know what I mean once you play it. AND YES THERE IS A NEW GAME PLUS FEATURE which the game would be a huge let down without.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Overall I think the biggest reason why you should play this game is because of all the artistic elements the combat system that comes with it. definately worth replaying because of those two.

I bet I played 90% with two or three heroes. I started with killing every enemy on the map, but after 5 hours of gameplay I started to avoid fights as they are quite similar. I have 1 last chapter and final bosses to play and I'm already annoyed with battles - that's probably a bad sign.  2) Skills descriptions are not available during fights. You have to remember dmg and effects. Almost everything is hidden: you can't check enemy's HP, skills, resistances etc.  I saw a lot of complains about upay, but it worked fine for me (tho I had to refund my FC4 as it just didn't start). Nontheless I would still recommend this game.  7/10",

This is the first game in a long time where I did not have periods where it felt like I was slogging through content for the sake of slogging through. The auxillary characters are interesting and have their own stories, and there is even a small crafting system in the form of Oculi, which are gems that give special abilities or stats, as might be familiar from other games. There are DLC that give extra Oculi, but fear not, they are by no means needed and this is by no means a microtransaction game. For those who love attention to story, enjoyable combat, and light puzzles that are intuitive and not obstructive, Child of Light is a game that will provide hours of entertainment.",

It's a beautiful game and it was nice to play something with a JRPG-like gameplay format, but with a more reasonable length.  That said, the battle system never really gelled with me. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, just a lot of little nitpicks that add up. Primarily, you can only have 2 characters in battle at a time, I wish you could have 3, simply for variety and convenience sake. Needing to swap out a character just to cast a few buffs and then swap back in your damage dealer frequently became annoying. Beyond that the game places such an emphasis on elemental weakness that for 90% of the game I just used the same two characters who together could cast all spells needed to hit the weakness of most enemies. Half of the other party members are support characters that aren't useful except outside of boss battles. So this too, leads to a lack of variety in the battles. Lastly, the game has a mechanism by which you can interrupt enemy attacks and set them back on the turn timeline, but later game enemies and bosses punish you for doing this in different ways, rendering something that can generally only ever be used against you instead of for you.  As said, I still enjoyed the game in spite of my gripes with the battle system. It's still better than many actual JRPGs where 99% of the battles are mind-numbingly boring, but I felt with a few tweaks it could have been even better.",

Balance exists; a common problem in some tactical RPGs is becoming too powerful where you can kill anything pretty quickly.

The important word here is 'Child', but in the best way imaginable. Whether it's the fairytale styling, sidescrolling platforming adventure (reminiscent of hours whittled away at a NES/SNES with Mario), or the innovative yet Final Fantasy style combat dynamics, everything about this game is warmingly charming and harks back to elements of different stages of your childhood.   Beautifully animated, impeccable soundtrack, satisfying but simple XP skills tree and gems (bonus skills buff) crafting, I couldn't put this game down for the admittedly short (&lt;10hrs) storyline, but immediately upon finishing I just started again! Only slight negative comment is the speech/narration is all done in rhyming verse, which occasionally gets a bit forced/hackneyed, but not enough to break this game's wonderous spell.   I, personally, would have been happy to pay the £12 rrp in retrospect, but some might not, given the short story arc. But if you spot this on sale, I cannot recommend it enough, everyone should snap it up immediately!!",

I can't praise the watercolour elements of the art enough.   The main gripes I have with the game is (as others have said) that it seems really rushed.   The last dungeon area goes by super quickly, and then suddenly you are fighting a big boss. Next, it literally takes you from the end cutscene of that fight to the last boss... and then the end cutscene. Which is a voice over talking about action things that WOULD have made an interesting third act to the game, but as it is, there really doesn't feel like there is a third act. Which leaves you feeling a little miffed.   The few 3D models that are in place can be glitchy. (once or twice I went in battle, and Aurora's hair didn't load, so she had this pink buzz cut) I was frustrated by Aurora's movement until she got wings. It was very slow and almost felt like my computer was lagging. Once she gets her wings (pretty early on), the movement improves. It seems to me like they based her movement on her flying, because it looks pretty good. Kind of an underwater fluid movement. That just doesn't work for her walking, running, jumping on land.  Like I said, there doesn't seem to be a third act. The second act starts when you are in the dark tower and defeat the first sister. Then somehow the moon makes you age up instantly?? This is never really explained. You have to draw your own conclusions.   Other things that are not explained: the confessions (notes) you find in the last part of the game are not written in rhyme, and talk of things like the internet, etc... which adds a level of mystery, a kind of alice in wonderland feel of a person being thrown into a fantasy world; but it is never explained further. At all. So it's just kind of jarring. You never find out who this person is. I was pretty positive that I explored every nook and cranny, yet still some confessions and chests eluded me. A little frustrating.   I didn't mind the rhyming too much... it's unique. I do wish it could have been better written. As others have said, a lot of times it comes across extremely clunky. The confessions especially were almost impossible to read. And I like poetry. They were just... a lot of fantasy jargon in rhyming form. There was nothing to them. There were some lines of dialogue though that made me grin. Mostly with Tristus, the sad jester, and Finn.  Overall though, the design (apart from those rock dudes, they were straight up geodudes from pokemon) of the monsters and characters was great. The design of the battle sequences was very inventive and enjoyable too. I liked how you didn't have to have party members involved in the battle for them to gain experience. That was a huge plus. Also, how if you wanted to switch out a party member, it didn't take up a turn, they got to act right away.  So there are definitely a lot of positives about this unique little game! It's all rather a mixed bag. If you have some spare cash, and like easy to play, calming games, then go for it. I'm glad I played it. I just wish the ending's pacing hadn't been so terrible. ",

The story leaves nothing to desire. The dialogs fit perfectly with the universe, just like the small little sound effects. I'll have to admit too, Ubisoft Montréal did a great job at the art works. Just like Rayman Origins/Legends, the artsyle is amazing and leaves for some very beautiful sights. The handpainted-look perfectly fits in with the fairytale setting. The gameplay may not seem like a lot at first sight. In some way it's your average turn-based RPG. In another way, it's not. You can control a companion which not only helps you with puzzles, but also during battles. It perfectly adds in the amount of complexity it needed. Easy to learn, hard to master kind of thing. If you want to use it optimally, it would require some experience. During boss battles, decent control of this little companion is necessary if you want to survive.  tldr: Nice little turn-based RPG, beautiful in story and graphics.",

            "review_text": "Child of Light is a turn-based roleplaying game with a very distinctive pseudo-storybook graphical style, written entirely in rhyme. Many of its mechanics are reminiscent of Final Fantasy X – including some painful dialogue.  Gameplay   The game consists of two portions: environmental navigation and battle.  Environmental navigation is actually a bit tiresome; at the start of the game, the player can only walk and jump, but very soon they gain the ability to fly around the 2D environment, eliminating all of the platforming elements in the game very early. This has a somewhat negative influence on gameplay speed, the player must explore an environment from top to bottom to find all the items and secrets, greatly increasing the amount of space which needs to be explored. In parts, it works decently well, but frequently it is tiresome, and only a few environments full of puzzles and traps are even remotely interesting to navigate.  There are no random encounters in the game; rather, monsters appear and wander around on the screen, and will attempt to pursue the player if they see them. The player will be “ambushed” if the monster runs into them while their back is turned, and will ambush the monster in turn if they manage to run into the monster’s back. This means that most of the time, the player will ambush the monsters, as not only is navigation simple, but the player controls a small ball of light which can be used to temporarily stun the monsters, in addition to healing the player between combats and activating some switches and puzzles  The game’s combat is actually reasonably sophisticated. The player controls two characters in combat, and faces off with up to three enemies at a time. It is somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy X in many respects; the player can switch out their characters at any time during combat, including replacing KOed characters with another character, and different attacks have different speeds. However, unlike Final Fantasy X, there are two different speeds which matter: the base speed of the character, and the speed at which the character acts.  There are two portions of a gauge at the bottom of the screen; the first portion represents the time spent between turns, while the second, smaller section represents the time spent charging up to attack or perform some other action. Each action has its own speed through the second portion of this, and if someone is attacked while they are charging an action, their action is interrupted and their turn is reset into some random (or semi-random) portion of the between-turns section of the gauge. As such, the player can interrupt enemy attacks, or the enemies can interrupt player attacks. There are some means of protecting yourself from such things, and some monsters will automatically counterattack against certain types of attacks (physical or magical) or against attacks made while they’re charging their actions.  The characters are actually quite varied, with each character having their own skill-set which is unlocked via a character-specific skill tree. Each character has their own set of abilities, and there are two characters who are primarily magic users, a warrior who can force enemies to attack him, a character who focuses entirely on speeding up or slowing down allies and enemies, a couple of physical attack characters, and some support characters. Gauge manipulation, interrupting enemy attacks, exploiting enemy elemental vulnerabilities, and applying the right status ailments while keeping your own party healthy are all important. The ball of light you control while navigating the levels also appears here, and can be used to slow down enemies or heal your allies – it is almost always better to slow enemies, though, as that prevents them from doing damage (and makes it easier to interrupt them) much more than healing yourself does.  Unfortunately, after a while, the battles become a bit routine; while the first set of enemies in an area are new and fresh, after a while they become very routine and can be defeated via a very samey set of actions in the same way that Final Fantasy X fights often went. This makes many of the fights in the game fairly dull, and while they’re skippable, the bosses, which are much more difficult, basically require you to beat every other enemy in the game so that you’re the proper level to face them.  The boss encounters tend to be the highlight of the game; they’re the most enjoyable bits of it, and tend to be a bit different from other encounters, mostly in that the bosses and their companions tend to be more dangerous, quicker, and more prone to retaliation and inflicting annoying status ailments that require you to actually think on your feet. Even still, I got through the game without getting a single game over, and I suspect that most players will do so as well; indeed, I was left with an overabundance of items at the end of the game and used them with wild abandon against the final boss, as I had hardly used any prior to that point.  There is also an equipment system, in which craftable, equippable gems which are acquired over the course of the game are put into slots and have various static effects on a character and their statistics; these can be used to add elemental damage types to physical attacks, grant bonus damage, make a character tougher or more resilient, or even increase the rate of xp gain. While this system seems neat in theory, I had the xp-gain gems equipped to my characters’ body slots for the entire game, and never needed to remove them to mitigate damage. Moreover, I pretty much figured out exactly how I was supposed to equip all of my characters quite early and from there on out it was just a matter of marginally improving my equipment over time – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it gave some sense of progression.   Presentation   The game is reasonably well-presented; the game tries to go for a sort of storybook style, with the characters appearing almost like paper cut-outs or things from a storybook, and the monsters having a similar stylized character. The music and sound are both reasonable enough, but a lot of the dialogue – delivered entirely in rhyme – is pretty awful. Sometimes it works well, but other times it falls down and is kind of painful to read.  Final Summary   Child of Light is not a bad game, but it isn’t exactly thrilling either. Everything about it is a decent enough idea, but in practice, it only shines on rare occasion. The game takes on the order of 20 hours to complete, and has no replay value; while there is a new game + mode, there is little reason to play it.",

My complaint is with the interruption system in combat. If a character is attacked while preparing an action, they get knocked back on the timeline. The problem is that this is a feast or famine system; you're either obliterating the enemy or caught in an unwinnable situation. In the second half of the game, there are enemy combinations who will caste haste on their entire team and slow on your team. Add to that, that there can be 3 enemies, but only 2 of you. This leads to battles where you're consistently getting knocked back or put into a situation where all you can do is block or try to heal (basically never being able to damage the enemies to give yourself a chance). Then, you try the fight again and get a bit luckier (or are better equiped) and win easily in 2-3 turns. It really feels unbalanced, and I didn't enjoy it.",

The princess, Aurora, has died and her papa has lost hope, but with the help of unusual friends there is no time to mope. Aurora battles darkness with friends anew, hoping to see this spiritual adventure through. Magicians, jesters and warriors unite to give the princess one last chance. With each battle won, Aurora makes her advance.  The attractive world of Lemura is rendered with Ubi-Art Framework, but the lack of noteworthy gameplay starts to hurt. Aurora walks or flies across colorful landscapes, stumbling upon treasures and wishes. Wishes ignite your friendly orb of light and treasures prevent you sleeping with the fishes. The orb stuns foes left and right, but minimal exploration makes the adventure slight.   As you collide with foes, you are thrust into a contrived battle pose. Battles have your friends taking turns to eliminate foes counting three. But the nature of the combat propels enjoyment far out to sea. You jostle to deal elemental damage to susceptible foes, yet constant interrupts keep you on your toes. Once you become a master tactician, bosses turn interrupts into a war of attrition. Some bosses succumb after half an hour, making boss battles repetitive and sour. Combat is tolerable at best - how much you can endure is the true test.   Just as the world lacks excitement, the un-voiced dialogue becomes an indictment. Exactly as this review is written before you, the authors were smitten with rhyming too. Some might think it funny or clever, but it becomes like persistent bad weather. If instead you find this readable, then you’ll likely find the narrative tolerable. Know that there is little that proves enlightening, even as you battle forces most frightening.   If Lemuria is the land we are sent to after death, try to avoid the reaper long after your last breath.
