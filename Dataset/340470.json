    "description": "You Are Not A Banana is set in everyday life and has a sprinkle of imagination and humor. The audiovisuals (free OST included) seek to evoke nostalgia for the 80s and 90s. This short form experimental game unfolds as a sequence of thought provoking events and surprises.",

            "review_text": "While I overall Can't reccomend this game, I will say I was a bit split. The game excels at being a weird, WTF prompting, mind bending adventure. The game sucks at being a fun to play game though which is why I can't actually reccomend it.   As far as the story goes, the game is absurd, hilarious, and will have you questioning what is going on the entire time (mostly in a good way!) If you enjoy game that just wants to mess with you maybe you should check it out.  However the actual gameplay is clunky, confusing, and can be breaken down to a series of unrelated mini games. The game progresses through mechanics seemingly at random. At first it's a game about exploration, then it's a dodging mini game, bike racer, then puzzle solver. None of these are done well, and you're fighting the mechanics every step of the way.  Basically I could only reccomend this game if you're into the YouTube scene. It makes a great wierd game to play for your fans, and that's about it's only strong quality.",

            "review_text": "Got Milk?  Anyhow... a very weird game that you are not a Banana so don't play as one!  Simple, repetitive, weird little puzzles with sound/music hints. Story that don't make sense. Pixelated art. Overall it's just a really weird little game. I didn't even know how did I solve the last puzzle but somehow I did after about 1 hour of play and finish this game. I feel empty inside and I feel like a banana.  Overall a reasonably enjoyable game that just drive you insane and leave you empty inside.  For it's simplicity and interesting concept I really want to give it a thump up but lack of hints and weird short game play make me want to use thumb down. IT's another one of those really small indie game that I can choose neither thumb up or thumb down.  so.. 5/10. I flipped a coin and choosed thumb up but if I flip a coin again I would most likly not recommend this weird thing...",

Nonetheless, it's something you can easily defeat under 20 minutes without procrastination - the start was rather fun, and I'd say $2 was alright.   One major issue would be the inability to save and it takes you back to the very start. Also a game which requires much intuition and patience before wishing to tear those little pixels apart.",
