It's a MUST BUY for any Ace Combat fans, although I advise you get an X360 controller for PC, 'cause for some reason you can't rebind the pitch and roll keys, which are bound to the arrow keys (To the developer: PLEASE FIX THIS! I would like to rebind them to WASD, so that I can enjoy this game without a controller!). You just need to rebind a few keys and it would play just like the PS2 Ace Combat titles.  The graphics may not be all that pretty, but it definitely nails the whole 'retro arcade' vibe. And I love it.",
