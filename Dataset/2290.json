            "review_text": "Even though is old, it is so much fun!  The game was released year 1996 (According to Steam) which is a great reason to the pixelated, Psyche-3D graphics. However, because the game is old also comes with positive sides. For example: - Lossless gameplay - Nostalgia - (Pretty) Simple game controls.  Lossless gameplay: Means that the game has nothing that breaks the gameplay at any point. You press 'New Game', then you're already in the game. Nothing in the middle at all. And that's how the game is all the way until the end (Because then you've finished it).  Nostalgia: It speaks for itself. If you're familiar with the 90's FPS games, this will have effect. As the game was released in 1996 (As I said before), the way the game looks like and is played is like all the other game from the 90's. Note that the game has a lot of secrets and tricks. These will help when you need it, but you need to find them first (The best way is to just mash space at all the walls in the room).  (Pretty) Simple game controls: The buttons used aren't many. Arrow keys, W, A, S, D, Control (Ctrl), Shift, Alternative (Alt), Space. If you want (Highly recommended), you can activate the mouse by pressing the scroll wheel. Then you can look around with the mouse and shoot with Left Click. You'll find this really useful, as it's easier to aim at the enemy with this setup.  Also, the game is really hard. But here's some helpful hints you can have use of: - Move. Like an idiot. The most lethal shots are not instant, and sends a projectile that can be avoided. - Use multiple save slots. Using only one can get you in trouble. - Scavenge. If you're low on health, go back and try to pick up stimpacks and first aid kits left behind. Try also to find secrets. - Pay attention to sounds. If you do, you can sometimes foresee if there's an enemy behind a door or not. - Save frequetly. Every time you've cleaned a room, save. If you're low on health, save in a different save slot.  This is not necessary, but I recommend using ZDoom instead of the original game. Why is because it runs much smoother and looks much better. ZDoom is also free, but requires you to buy the original game first (Otherwise it doesn't have the files required to run the game).",

Two full mega-wads of content, it has two games worth of content with all the Doom 2 trappings, with more level experimentation and upped difficulty from the initial release of Doom 2. That said, something tells me that if you bought Doom 2, and you're looking at buying this, nothing I can say is necessarily going to KEEP you from wanting this game. Either way, rip and tear!",

The maps are pretty difficult in nature, and it's not reccomended for new players to Doom.  TNT is probably the hardest, with maps as early as 11 ranking up there as some of the hardest official levels I've ever played. Plutonia is rather normal in difficulty, but gets harder towards the middle.  Both iwads are created with love and attention, just like the folks at id made theirs, so this doesn't really need to be excluded from your Doom collection if you are a fan.",

This which I suppose is the original PC version is still good, but keep in mind that its absolute crap if you play it 'as is'. The only way to really experience any of the original doom games is to extract the WAD file and use one of the official doom emulators which allow better resolution/graphics, and game options.   Buy this for the WAD file.",

I mention this because it doesn't work in any other version of DOOM on steam.  This is slightly better than other DOOM games on steam emulation-wise, but it's still the dos version running in an emulator. To make matters worse, this is the weakest of the original DOOM engine games.  I recommend Final DOOM, but not the version Steam is selling. Buy this on GOG or track down the DOOM classics CD-Rom and get a source port.",
