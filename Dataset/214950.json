            "review_text": "Ignoring that this game was an absolute joke on release day (yes, I'm still bitter about getting duped into pre-ordering so I could use one of the factions included in the game without having to pay for it), it's still a huge disappointment. The Emperor Edition is a massive improvement, but still falls way short of what was promised. Even with all the patches, the game is a big step back from Shogun 2.  Firstly, the game is lifeless and boring. I've yet to even get close to year 0 in a save and I've probably started about 20 of them. Just look at the hours I've spent playing this game. I've tried so hard since the day it was released to get into a save in this game, and it's never happened. All of the screenshots and promotional media for this game looked amazing and captivating, but that feeling never materalizes in the actual game. I never have the urge to expand my empire, or make my enemies pay for crossing me. It just feels like I'm engaging in a strategy (if you want to call it that) exercise against AI, nothing more. CA have sucked the life out of this series by dumbing down things like politics and diplomacy, and removing things like family trees for no aparent reason. The best feeling I got from this game was when I finally accepted that I wasted my money on it and uninstalled it from my system.   The AI is still horrendously bad. It's a million times better than it was at release, but it's still terrible. It's so easy to learn AI tendencies, and it takes a huge amount of restraint to stop myself from exploiting them. Battle AI is really bad, but luckily there are a lot of mods that can fix this and actually make it enjoyable. At the same time, there's only so much modders can do to cover up CA's mistakes, and it's really sad that CA needs other people to fix their game for them to make it playable.   Campaign AI is atrocious and not even challenging. There's hardly any logic in the strategy of AI factions. They don't seem to care about defending their cities and they never create any type of organized, strategic attack. The only way to make the game challenging is to put the difficulty on very hard, so the AI can just churn out full stacks at will and send them at you one by one. Even then, it just turns into a game of fending off the armies, one or two at a time, until the AI does something inexplicably stupid to give you the advantage. It's extremely frustrating to have a back and forth war with an AI faction over one of its settlements, only to have that faction just randomly move all of its armies away from that settlement, basically allowing you to walk right in and take it. This type of thing happens ALL OF THE TIME and takes all of the intensity and excitment out of wars.   Some parts of the game are still broken, even in the Emperor Edition. Sieges are somehow even worse than Shogun 2. City gates are broken. Any unit can just burn down a gate by throwing flaming sticks at it, but then they are unable to walk through it. I'm not even sure if battering rams work at all. Ladders and siege towers kind of work though (at least with the overhaul mod that I've used), so there's that.   Obviously the game is still addicting in some way, as it's managed to get me to pour 200+ hours into it, but it feels more like I've wasted a massive part of my life trying to get this game to entertain me than anything else. People who have never played a Total War game before may find this game neat because of the setting and the battles (which are absolutely a standout feature for this series when compared to other strategy games), but those of us who have played TW games before know how much of a disappointment this was. For those who disagree with me: go back and look at the promotional videos that CA released prior to the game's launch and compare that to what we paid for. I've not experienced anything close to what was advertised, and I've yet to see anyone who has been able to make this game look anywhere near the way it did in the videos of the ♥♥♥♥in alpha (that CA said was still going to be further optimized). It still looks cool at times--some of the cities having unique features on the battle map is a really cool feature, and the campaign map looks by far the best it has in any game of the series.  Overall, Rome 2 was a huge failure and a waste of time for everyone involved. It actually compares really unfavorably to Rome 1 and Medeival 2 from 10 years ago. CA has already rushed into making another game, Atilla, which is really just a remake of one of Rome 1's expansions released as a full game. I will not even be touching that game unless it gets great reviews and goes on sale for &lt;$20. You'd have to be a fool to preorder that game after the trainwreck that was Rome 2's launch. CA has used up all the good faith it built from its early games and deserves to be under heavy scrutiny going forward.  As for anyone thinking about buying this game, I would strongly recommend not to. Even if its heavily discounted, it's really not worth the time that you will pour into it before finally accepting that it's just not a good game. I would suggest waiting for Atilla's release and seeing what the community consensus is (let's not forget how many gaming websites gave Rome 2 highly favorable reviews at launch). Hopefully CA will get its act together and release what Rome 2 should have been.  TLDR:  Pros +Campaign map looks really good compared to other games in the series +Modding community is amazing and did CA a huge favor by saving this game before CA could make it playable on its own  Cons -The AI is so bad that it's really hard to actually use strategy in a meaningful way -No immersion due to features from previous games being streamlined or removed -Game was released with numerous broken features and many of these features still remain broken despite all the patches -Really disappoints graphically in a lot of areas (poorly optimized)",

            "review_text": "I bought retail version of the game for 20 bucks. I had some good fun with it. Rome 1 was and still is a masterpiece, but has Rome 2 reached that level of awesomenest?  Nope, but it's still damn fun.  So, why can't I recommend this game to you guys?    PROS:    I'm just 20 hours into the game, and the Grand Campiang has been really good so far, custom battles are fun, so are ambushes. Graphics are good, collision is not the best, but the battles are always great to watch. (and there is Steam workshop for Rome2 woohoo)    CONS:    It's not worth the money. Retail version for 20 bucks is definitely worth buying, but that's the price in my country (Serbia). Full price of 55 US dollars on Steam would be a fair deal if the game contained all the DLCs.  There are 3 Cultural Pack DLCs which are the stupidest thing ever made. You can't play as Sparta or Athens if you don't spend extra 7 bucks.  Besides that, there are 3 DLC campaings. With Emperor edition you do get an extra campaing, but if you want to experience all of the DLC campaings you need to spend extra 45 dollars.  There are a few unit pack DLCs, and there is Blood and Gore DLC ( that ♥♥♥♥ should be free, shouldn't even be considered as DLC ).     CONCLUSION:    Total War: Rome 2 is one of my favourite games in the series but IT IS NOT WORTH all the money.  If you want to buy this game wait for a sale (-75%) or check ♥♥♥. DLCs are NOT WORTH your money, buy them if you find them cheap (on ♥♥♥ you can find Greek States Culture Pack for 2$).  SEGA really has to change DLC policy. Nobody wants to pay full price for 50% of the game. I just hope they are not going to ♥♥♥♥ up next Total War game like they did Rome 2 and Attila.    EDIT     I understand charging extra money for the campaings because they add hours of new content, and if made good, they can be worth getting. But 'cultural packs' should be free.",

Howeever, now it is a fairly solid game that is DEFINATELY worth buying.   I must say that the DLCs really make the game due to the fact that they add whole new flavours of units, cultures and technologies. I highly reccomend Caesar In Gaul, Hannibal At The Gates and the Greek States Culture Pack. Two super-awesome campaigns and a pack of 3 grand Hellenic States.  If you're new to Total War, this game should be one of the best for you - that or Empire, another bad-starting Total War game. Rome II is a watered down version of Total War with an easy enough campaign and helpful advisoor. So, if you want to try out Total War for the first time; this game is for you. Command the legions of Rome, bring glory to the Republic!  Thanks for reading, I give the game a 9/10 (w/ DLCs)",

            "review_text": "While Rome 2's now imfamous launch was attrocious, in its current state, the game is one of the best of the Total War series, and a shining example of a RTS.   1. Campaign: As always, Rome 2's campaign is a mix of turn based strategical management on the campaign map, and real time battles. For the most part, the AI does a good job managing their cities and armies. They don't make foolish mistakes, they defend their cities, and they attack any vulnerabilities left by the player. The UI is fine, but the lack of branching skill trees for generals can be annoying. The removal of family trees is another annoyance as you feel no attachment to your faction's characters. One place where Rome 2 shines, however, is its variety. There are dozens of faction to chose from, exact numbers based on DLC, all of which have interesting units, traits, and challenge levels.   2. Battles: Once again, we see the return of CA's battle AI. While it is not totally imcopetent, it consistently makes moronic mistakes. It will engage your pikemen head on, charge cavalry into the front of heavy infantry, and often attack with no real tact. However, the battles are still fun. Troops are easy to control and the battle UI is slick and customizable. Sure, when a cav unit inexplicably gets stuck on one lonely spearman it can ♥♥♥♥ you the hell off, but it never detracts from the overall expirience.   3. Multiplayer: Due to the variety of factions, Rome 2's multiplayer shines. Each faction is fun to play as and offers different stregnths and weaknesses. The added bonus of phasing out the battle AI is just the icing on the cake. However, technical issues still at times hinder the multiplayer, as you will often expirience severe lag and will occasionally be dropped from the game.   4. Graphics: As one of the best optimized PC games out there in its current state, Rome 2 has no issue delivering both stellar graphics (in-battles and on the campaign map) and smooth framerates.   5. DLC offerings: While the 'Wrath of Sparta' DLC fell short, and I still have yet to see the point of 'Blood and Gore,' Rome 2 still has some fine offerings for DLC. Some packs will add fun new factions, and others will offer new, full legnth historical camapign scenarios to be played out on customized maps. Without a doubt, 'Hannibal at the Gates' and Caesar in Gaul' stand out from the pack as superd additions to the game and engrosing windows into some of the most fascinating wars in antique history.   Without a doubt, Rome 2 stands out as one of the most extensive and deep offerings in the RTS genre. It is a stellar game and in its current condition, and it is the best Total War game to date.",

For my credentials as a critic, I currently have over 100 hours in game, have beaten a campaign, and im pretty good at it.. Rome 2 feels entirely dumbed down when compared to the previous title, Shogun 2.  The terrible campaign&amp;battle AI, the lack of unit customization, the lack of general customization, banners, etc and so on.. I would have been more than happy to volunteer my time and test this game for free so that the game could be passable on release, but CA and SEGA didn't feel like quality took a priority to advertising. Lastly, the moderating on their online forums are terrible. They cherrypick what threads do or do not stay, they keep horrendous and troll praisers yet they delete and ban valid criticisms.  The sporadic moments of greatness, when you’re storming enemy walls or have finally brokered a peace agreement, are swallowed by tedium. With patience, your inner imperialist is satisfied as you skillfully cultivate a sprawling empire. It’s too bad you have to put up with so much to get there. but If you’re a hardcore strategy fan specially TW it’s definitely worth a look, and if you’re new to the genre and have the patience to learn, it’s not a bad place to start, Rome II is a testament to all that is great about PC gaming and should be a must buy for all its followers.  Maybe its not better than first one but definitely its worth to play.. ofcourse worth to play cuz its one of the TW series game.. many people said ROME wasn't built in a day so be patience and give another chance to CA to build it again with it new updates. at last i should say Total War: Rome 2 is pure enjoyment. The strengths of the first installments are still there, mostly in the form of the diversity between different factions and armies. The limited amount of armies, freedom in missions and handy execution of 'auto resolve' only add on to this.  It might not look as great as the images might have you suspect, but it's still an easy recommendation. so prepare yourself for a long and endless road cuz all roads lead to ROME.....

            "review_text": "I really really wanted to like this game, had it since release, have checked it out every now and then.   But it's simply garbage.... Been streamlined to hell to cater to a larger audiance, which destroyed the essence on which the title thrived in it's previous games.   Next too that, the game only becomes decent IF next to having spent 60 bucks on basically a broken game on release, you pay an other 100 bucks to gain all DLC.   I somewhat like the improvements on the campaign map, but hate it at the same time. You can't even build wooden walls for your smaller settlements. On the other hand, your forced to specialize towns, which gives them all their own stratigic value, something that was missing in previous Total War games.   AI is horrible, and I mean a step backwards from Shogun's AI, as in, will walk into 3 units of phalanx head on never attempt to flank bad....   O did I mention Phalanxes where broke on release and could be slaughtered by peasants ? Yes heavily armored troops, some of the heaviest in the world and amongst the most discplined, could be slaughtered by peasants....   Battles feel rushed and because units break like crazy, grand tactics are out of the window, it's all about bring heavier units then your enemy.  In fact, it's become more of a economy simulator (and before they patched the building tree's a horrible on at that).   And after 2 years, all they done is stream line the game some more and add back functions we had in every total war game, like fire at will and hold ground (yes you are reading this right, that was NOT added in release).   I've only gotten around to write my review now because i'm so utterly sickend by the game for which I was waiting forever.   If they updated the orginal Romes graphics and released that for 60 bucks I would have been more satisfied.   Even the basic path finding on the campaign map is broke. If you move a army that would be faster embarking into ships and then sailing over and landing, prepare for the path finding to screw up and take your army 4 additional turns over land.   And then there is unit collision, which wasn't there in Release, which basically lead to major mosh pits, when battle where at the time won by formations and discpline. It was just a laugh. Now they have fixed it by forcing units to stay in formation and everything, but it's obvious it's not something the actual engine itself does. So basically the game is running on a engine that is not suited for the game at all. Yet ever since Empire they stubornly hold onto this engine, and with Shogun they got away with it because they polished it so well you didn't notice it. But F me Creative, get the hint already! Either update your engine to support it or pick a better suited engine!   We want our realistic like combat, Total War is picked because of that, if we want Arcade combat, we have a 100 games that do a better job then Total War will, stop trying to cater to people who shouldn't be touching this game to begin with, all you do is drive away the people who do love these types of games.   3/10 I do not recommand you buy this unless it's on a sale and you have to pay less then 10 bucks. It's not worth more and you better get some free DLC's with it.   Also, don't try and criticize them on their own official forums, all honest criticism is basically disregarded and removed within a heartbeat.",

            "review_text": "I recommend you buy this game at half price at the very most. I do recommned the game, it's fun, has a very large and extensive campaign with many factions to play as. However, the game has been stripped of some features previous in older Total War games such as the family tree. The game in general moves far too fast to get attached to your commanders, like in previous games, and they die a lot without any real notice.   The buildings and campaign planning is now at an absolute minimum, with a new provincial system that works well when you are a large nation, but suffers from a lack of depth when you are a small nation. The politcs screen does nothing, and can be ignored completely, providing nothing in terms of gameplay to the world.   Seasons have been re-introduced because the community cried out for it, however the game moves at one turn per year, so seasons don't fit the timescale and don't play much effect.  The graphics are top notch. Both on campaign and on battles, however my PC is very capable at running on Ultra, but only around an average of 30fps. Optimization is extremly poor for entry level PCs and the graphical fidelity falls extremely quick when you lower the settings.  Battles are fun to play, they look impressive and work well in general. It's taken 12 major updates to get to the stage where I am comfortable at recommending this to someone, but as with most TotalWar games, the AI is terrible. On the campaign it's fairly smart, however diplomacy is almost non existant. You can't trade money effectivley, you can't gift regions or demand them you cannot bribe armies or settlements, you cannot co-ordinate with any certainty your nation and another to attack a particualr spot or nation.   On land, battles work pretty well. The AI behaves appropriately and in some cases smartly. This is where the game is best. Open terrain battles with large armies clashing in the fields. In large towns, it's more cumbersome as the enemy try to navigate streets quite poorly. In full on walled cities, the game falls flat on it's face. The AI pathfinding is terrible and they will pretty much throw armies at one spot until they break through, which they never will.  The multiplayer scene is dead. For a game that's sold over 1m copies, you'd be lucky to find 20 active games.  Co-op campaigns are brilliant. This is because AI isn't an issue and you can play against someone for the entire game. You just need someone willing to play with you for a full campaign.  That's all. Like I said, half price at best. The game's DLC packs offer nothing great, more factions and more of the same. this is probably the worst Total War game to date. But it's still a Total War game, if you need to play battles where 1000's of troops clash together, this is your game. If you need good strategy, in depth campaigns or history, I'd look to Civilization V, Crusader Kings II, Total War: Shogun II or Europa Universalis IV  If you're a hardcore Total War fan who wants to boycott the series, no point, they've sold 1m+ games. It's by far their most successful game to date. Just don't pre-order the next one.",

The game in principle should be good - an apparent forty percent increase in budget from previous total wars and a brilliant precedence led me to pre purchase the game, and at first I was pleased. However after about only ten hours I began to realise there were several problems that I was experiecing (I wont go into detail), but they included a dodgy public order system, that seemed to make it counter productive to get high tier buildings, an extremely useless politics part, Generals that came and went without any real family or attatchment, Im sure you can find a long list of its problems online.  This is not why I hate Rome 2. The campaign I enjoyed (despite the problems) and I liked the battles (despite the worst Ai i have ever seen in a total war). I hate Rome 2 because of the continued corner cutting and obvious fan based exploitation. The most obvious of this ROME 2 Emperor edition - which (and correct me if Im wrong) promised to contain all the content and DLCs so far and (again correct me if Im wrong) but all Rome 2 owners were promised a free upgrade - which technically means that they owe us all the DLCs, but nevermind that.   I loved Rome 1 because they gave you so much content without paying too much extra. Emperor edition brings almost no content to the game (unlike rome 1 barbarian invasion), has no extra units, and even though I played my first campaign as Eygpt it gave me the pregame cinematic for the Rome faction (there is only currently one type of pregame cinematic in the game). Rome 2 augustus campaign is extremely half-arsed, bringing no more units to the game (unlike barbarian invasion in rome 1 where there were tons of different units. Although Rome 2 was already money - grabbing (SEE THE £44 worth of Dlc!?!?!)

The AI is just a pure cheat machine, while he can't do any intresting combat manouver, but defeat the roman army in 1 vs 2.  Foreg.: Fight against the barbarians, and order a platoon/squad of your Spearman against the barbarian's spearman. 1 group vs 1 group and your loose it surely. If you send in two group vs one enemy, you might win the fight. In TW Arena the swordsman vs spearman, allways the swords wins. But not here. Swordsman is a bad choice.  Sea battle is a complete mess. You give orders to your fleet and they 'try' to do it. Order a boarding action, and hope the best they will do it. Sometimes, I don't know, they are just watching the waves, and the falling arrows/stones. Or maybe they are seasick?  In melee your sword wielding mercenaries mostly loose against ranged infantary, at a boarding action!  My flagship just sails away when its ordered to attack an enemy ship. If I give him order. If he just have to stay and get arrowshower, he is doing his job nicly. Buy a couple of siege warship, and hope that, you will stop the enemy before they reach you. Or you will loose. On the bright side: if you were try to use normal units, they will lose.  City management is a joke now. It have some nice aspect, but its just difficult to understand (first), plan, and get any intresting benefit out of it. Money, maybe a few new unit. Done. Dull.  There is a political system in the game, but I havn't found any intresting interaction.  There is no depth in diplomatic interactions. In easy mode (couse the battle is unbearble in Normal or Hard level) 'Trade with me!', 'Nope'. 'Fight with me against...', 'Nope'.   Great graphic demostration for an okay game design, and cheaply programed game.",

            "review_text": "Firstly, I will establish that i have been a long term customer and fan of the Total War branch since the beginning of time and really wanted to love this game.   Con: It's really incredible that not only did this company push away alot of its mainstream consumers but also angered much of its Die Hard fans. I mean, it took so long just to make this game playable POST RELEASE. For its premium pricing it is obviously a unacceptable display. (bugs, glitches, freezes etc)   Pro: That being said at least they bothered to manage to save the game and bring back some consumers.   Con: Secondly, i was told Rome 2 would have a 40 percent budget increase on top of the Financial backing of a huge company yet they spent way too much money on graphics and half the kingdoms look like they are are going to a pyjamas party. They should of focused on cultural diversity so everything looks alien and rich in culture from lusitani to iceni to Parthia. Or how about inhancing the trade system, internal polticial system and diplomacy system? It's amazing that indie companies can absolutely whipe this franchise clean from quantity to quality of content. Yet Total War can not? how about taking the time to bring that into play via your expansions? no? well clearly they have not!  Pro: I really enjoyed how building/ improving the city effects the expansion of the city on the map mode and also how that is interconnected to the difference's in cultures. That was something really great that CA did.   Con: When Rome 1 Came out they had a option to actually visit your city and go into it, i clearly expected them to bring this into fruition and capitalise on the city builder Sims/ Cities kind of feel to target a grandure target market but not only did they not do this they removed the city visitor option all together so that we can no longer are rewarded with beautiful visual displays enjoying our incredible city from within.   Pro: Without a doubt the Battle system is Great adding more variaty with army legacy names give us a personal sence of belonging and meaning to the armies we use. The in depth battle system is what saves this franchise.   Con: I have to say that Sega has been suffering as a company for good reason it's apparent that profit has become the main goal and mentality/values of its company instead of having a pro fan, and pro accurate History loving values/ employees within CA, they are making the same mistake as Rome and will fall just as Rome.    I know it might be a tough review but your consumers only mean well and want to see this game and company become the best it can be so that we can throw more money at you guys! Hopefully Sega will learn from its mistake.",

            "review_text": "When writing this i have over 530+ hours of Rome II, i have tried it since the horrible launch (horrible in every meaning of the word) and up until now where it is far better but still not perfect.  The things i like about this game is the Battles themselves and the diversity in combat, not to mention the numbers of player made mods that the community have made.  if you are looking for something similar to Shogun, then you will find this game is more of a straightforward battle-sim than the predecessor. The whole aspect of politics in Rome II has either been dumbed down or removed completely, i usually ignored it until i got the expansion packs which actually changed a lot of the random events and made them far better (even for the grand campaign) but did not give it anything else than that. with 3 campaigns currently there is a lot to Conquer with the original grand campaign as the biggest time sink by far.  Battles : Normal battles on the campaign maps are very enjoyable. the AI will take different approaches depending on your unit composition, if you have the fast siege equipment (rock lobbers) they will try to rush you before their reinforcements arrive instead of getting shelled, while if you have slow ones or even the stationary ones then i have noticed the AI will pull back, wait for all the reinforcements and then attack you in force.  Ambushes: they work pretty much the same way as they always did, they are fun to play and an easy way to eliminate big armies quickly. especially the mechanics when you are being ambushed are very enjoyable (you riding in semi first person view inside the army scouting for the enemies in a semi cut scene that will end when you get attacked). the only problem with ambushes is that the AI NEVER WILL USE THEM, in shogun the AI used Ambush when they found it to be a good tactic while in Rome the only times i have been ambushed is when i am moving my army at 2x speed (automatic ambush by attacking army).  Fortification : one of the stances in the game is that you essentially build a small fort (with arrow towers) making it easier to defend key area`s with a smaller force. although i rarely use this myself the AI loves to use this mechanic.  Pillage: AI loves this one, will sneak a small army (more often than not a single General) into your area`s and pillage them. will lower your income to 0 and remove quite a lot of happiness per round. if you dont pay attention to this or the Raiding equivalent (boats) you will get a rebellion.  now to the 'Elephant in the room' siege battles : the AI is HORRIBLE for the most part. until the second to last patch the AI would dance around rather than attack your castles in force and defend properly, then they fixed it and i had several VERY enjoyable battles where the AI would siege for several turns and bring quite a lot of siege equipment (rams, towers, Turtles and ladders). but the last patch ruined the AI again and now they rarely build anything (and if they do they will abandon it at the start of the battles), the only thing they will attack with is the standard ladders you automatically get from besieging a capital.  The patch in question also destroyed the AI of your own troops meaning that they will not follow your orders as you give them and they will not always take the 'smart' route but run out of your fortifications to enter them again further down the line. more often than not when i tell them to move somewhere with the Right-Click-Hold command they will decide to do something totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and move somewhere else.  if they refix your AI and the enemy AI then the game will be improved greatly.  Coop: This is my favorite part of the game. i have probably played more co op than single player because i enjoy splitting armies in two and playing battles with a friend. only thing that annoys me mechanically about they way the Coop is built is the lack of possibility of the other player controlling the AI which was possible in shogun. (please bring this back and don't limit it to non allies SEGA !).  you will desync, you will curse and it is very annoying and time consuming swapping save games to fix something that should be working correctly, the funniest moment i had with this was when i got attacked in a capital and my buddy loaded a different city(which also got attacked that turn but in a later order). essentially he was watching the AI defending one of my towns and i was defending a totally DIFFERENT battle. because we loaded two different battles without problem is weird to me and should have been fixed.  Naval battles : Hate it - Auto resolve 90% of the time.   Factions: Tons of different ones, i found this to be the easiest way to determine game difficulty (Rome - Easy Barbarians, Medium, Nomads hard, a little rough comparison).   try one of the Horse Kingdoms on legendary for a challenge :)  All in all i both love and hate this game, it is definitely worth it, especially if you have someone to play Coop with (random players for campaign in my experience never works out). have some patience with the AI and laugh at their mistakes.  Grab a drink, Grab a friend and conquer the World !",

            "review_text": "As I approach the 1000 hour mark, I feel I can finally make a review about Rome 2. Let me start by saying I completely disagree with the 'do not recommend' reviews, especially if Rome 2 is on sale. This game is NOT rome 1, and it is NOT medieval 2, and it offers a different playing experience.   One thing I didn't like about rome 2, that they limited the amount of army's one faction an field at one time. This can be easily worked around with mods. The modding community can fix almost any problem you have, outside of AI (TW AI has never been the best, am I right?). Give it go, then check out the workshop to see what mods you may like!  I did like, In Rome 2, that they added army stances. You can set your army into a 'Fortified' mode, where they build a fort for defences, used if your're going to stay put and guard an area. A 'Forced March' mode, which will allow great distances to be traveled, but at the cost of morale and being vulnerable to an ambush. Or 'Raid' mode which allows you to plunder an enemies territory, angering the populace and possibly drawing out an attack from any enemy army's.  I'd not recomment purchasing Rome 2, unless you have at least the 'Recommended' system requirments listed above, otherwise It will likely look pretty ugly, and lag in larger battles. Though, I can't say with certainty it will not run well on a '2 GHz Intel Dual Core processor / 2.6 GHz Intel Single Core processor' I can't imagine it running very well.   Everyone has reacted differently to this game and since release it's been under much scrutiny, and while I agree, Rome 2 had it's fair share of post-release issues, It's still a very worthwile experience. Don't let all the negative reviews sway you from this great game, because it's definitely become my most played Total War title, and I had played a LOT of TW prior to Rome 2.  All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this game to any Total war fan, or even as a good place to start for someone new to Total War because of the way they simplified the user interface. It does seem to require less micro managing than shogun 2, or Empire. It does feel more limited, though, as you cannot build ANY given bulding type in ANY given city.   You will just have to decied for youself if this newest installment to the Total War series, will be YOUR new favorite. ",

The AI is much better both on the campaign map and during battles and capture points have been removed from open field battles which makes them much more tactical and longer lasting. At launch, most battles would resolve in five minutes or so, now they usually last ten or fifteen minutes. While it still isn't as slick as Shogun 2, Rome 2's massive scale and varied factions make for a entertaining and addicting strategy experience that is closer to what fans expected before the game released.   There are still some lingering problems with AI in battles, particularly in sieges when the AI is attacking. The game also doesn't look as good as the latest builds of Shogun 2, they still need to implement a better anti-aliasing system to smooth the visuals out. However considering the state that Rome 2 launched in, its nice to see that Creative Assembly didn't abandon the project and instead patched it to the point where it is well worth playing.   Get it on sale if you have been on the fence about this one, it is finally a worthy entry into the Total War franchise.",

            "review_text": "Total War: Rome 2 suffered from a rough start, releasing with many questionable design choices and numerous severe bugs and optimization issues. This led to poor fan reception and a Metacritic score lower than that of any Total War title to date. At launch, and for quite some time after, I would not have recommended Rome 2. Thanks to Creative Assembly's continued support of the game, it has now reached a stage where it is extremely enjoyable with the recent release of the Emperor Edition. The game has metamorphosed drastically since the game received is initial reviews.  The Emperor Edition, released on September 16, 2014, drastically overhauled the game. The building system was redesigned for the better, factions all underwent extensive rebalancing and recieved new, more natural factional colors, unit abilities were overhauled, and last but not least, a new free campaign, Imperator Augustus, was released. All of this was added to the game free of charge! With the changes introduced in Emperor Edition, I definitely recommend Rome 2 to anyone interested in a grand strategy game with RTS and TBS elements set in the ancient world.  All of the DLC is recommendable, though depending on your personal preference, you may wish to skip the unit packs. The two DLC campaigns, Caesar in Gaul and Hannibal at the Gates, offer an experience different from that of the Grand Campaign and Imperator Augustus. They are more focused experiences, zooming in on the world map to flesh out Gaul and the Mediterranean, respectively, in greater detail than what is found in the Grand Campaign. Caesar in Gaul, Hannibal at the Gates, and Imperator Augustus all also operate at a slower yearly rate, with one turn per season, as opposed to the Grand Campaign's one turn per year. This greatly increases the number of turns you will have generals and agents at your disposal before they die of old age, allowing them to accrue more experience than they would be able to in the Grand Campaign. All of the DLC content is reasonably priced for its value, especially during sales.  My biggest gripe with the Rome 2 is how visually disappointing it is. The lack of true AA makes the game so much uglier, and the art direction really is vastly inferior to that of Shogun 2, in the UI, graphics, and soundtrack.  The UI itself is my second biggest problem with Rome 2. Coming straight from Shogun 2, I don't understand how they managed to make the UI so much worse. In Shogun 2, the UI beautifully blended with the style of the game, and functioned perfectly for gameplay purposes. In Rome 2, they somehow decided it was a good idea to make the UI take up more space on the screen, while at the same time making it more difficult to navigate and use. Between the advisor constantly popping on the screen for no reason, the unit stat card being permanently there and GIANT unless you want to manually hide it completely (instead of fading away like in Shogun 2), and the unit bar section taking up a way larger than necessary portion of your screen, right in the center, they really succeeded in consuming as much screen space as they could with their devolved UI. I just don't understand how they could have made the UI so much worse coming straight from Shogun 2, which had a magnificent UI.  My two gripes aside, I do recommend the game.",

As a huge total war fan, it's a shame to see the sequel to one of the best strategy games ever (Rome: Total War) be released in such a poor state, and still not be fixed. The graphics are good, and a lot of the idéas put into the game are brilliant on paper, but the poor execution makes for a lot of frustration.  the game is also overly convoluted at times, making it unnecessarily hard to find information might be crutial in a grand-strategy game. But all of this, and the games poor AI, are problems that we have seen in other total war games as well. Some have gotten bigger in this installment, some have been improoved, and some have stayed the same. So the real issue I have with this game, is not in the gameplay itself, because I actually enjoy it more than many of the other games in the series. My big issue with this game, is the poor performance.  I have pretty decent rig, and so does a lot of my friends, but the trend i keep seeing, is that whether or not you get a good performance seems to be a total coin toss... And, a fatal bug, causes the game to stutter like crazy (without the actual framrate dropping) whenever the units have pathfinding issues. This is especially prominent in sige battles (mostly in barbarian settlements, but also occurs in any large scale battle) this occurs even on te lowest settings, and I'm running this on a 680M and with an i7 processor, so I should be able to run the game at OK settings at least. CA have stated on their website that they are aware of the issue, and even said in one of the patch notes that the issue should be resolved, but as the patches grow fewer, and the problem percists, my hope for the game to ever be truly playable for me are diminishing.  This came as a big shock to me, especially since Shogun 2 (and every other total war game for that matter) runs silky smooth, even on the highes settings. I realise that Rome 2 is more demanding than Shogun 2, but when I can't even run it on the lowest settings there is clearly a problem.  As of the time I'm writing this, CA still havent fixed the problem, but I'm still hoping for a fix. If they would resolve this issue, Rome 2 could easily become one of my favourite strategy games, but when the performance is so poor, it just makes all the other little anoyances so hard to deal with, and therefore I canno't recommend this. But as I said, I hope CA resolves this issu, so I, and anyone else with this issue, can once again be proud to call oureselves total war fans.   (Sorry for poor grammar)",

This makes it fun to play. To be honest, I also have Warhammer Total War and this is much better on multiplayer for me at least.   The multiplayer community is quite large and I never have to wait long for battles. I also notice that most mp battles are stable and there are not so many crashes compared to older Total War games.

Some DLC give you more to play with, but the base game itself gives you a LOT to work with already.

            "review_text": "Review for Emperor Edition:   All the updates leading up to and including the free Emperor Edition update have turned Rome II into a great game. They have added upgrades to the culture system, seasons and seasonal effects (both visual and in applying bonuses or penalties), campaign and battle balancing, more playable factions and units, building chain revamps (more variety of buildings and chains), and various performance improvements.   The latest update, which upgrades the game to Emperor Edition for free, has modified politics and civil war in ways that are very impactful to your campaign. You have reason to constantly track your family or partys influence, having to assasinate your own generals for fear of sparking a civil war or engage in political actions to improve your influence. Failure to do so results in harsh public order and tax penalties that will really cause you problems if you dont handle your politics correctly.   The update also adds improvements to the user interface (color coding various things and reworking the politics screen), although overall the ui is not as visually appealing as in previous games. It also adds the Imperator Augustus campaign, which adds the playable Armenia faction to the Grand Campaign as well. It uses the Grand Campaigns map while adding various roman factions and changes to other factions to fit the setting.  Overall the game is as it should have been when it launched last september. However, the user interface still a downgrade from the beautiful Shogun 2 scrolls. You also dont get as attached to your generals as in previous games (partly due to the lack of a family tree and the minimal importance given to aquired character traits). I would have also liked to have seen the return of the system where some settlement buildings were spread out across their territories (e.g. the farms or gold mines of Shogun 2 being represented on the campaign map as potential targets). It got removed in favor of the province system and of armies using the raiding stance in enemy territory, even though both systems could have worked in tandem to greater effect. It would have also made strategic raids of provinces more interesting since you had an additional, strategic target to attack or defend besides settlements, ports or other armies.  In short, the game has substantially improved since launch and the Emperor Edition is a testament to that. I give the game in its current form a solid 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Take a quick scroll through the negative reviews and note the 'hrs on record' for each player:  309 hrs clocked? Negative review.  166.6 hrs clocked? Negative review. 202 hrs clocked? Negative review. 272.9 hrs clocked? Negative review. 257.8 hrs clocked? Negative review.  Do you notice a slight pattern here? Everyone giving this game the thumbs down has spent well more than their money's worth, playing the thing. If the game really is as bad as everyone says it is, then why do they spend hundreds of hours of their lives on it? If the game was as bad as everyone attempts to make out then surely they'd play it for several hours, regret that they purchased it, give it a bad review then leave it to be nothing more than a statistical +1 on # of games they own. They don't however, they spend weeks and months playing the thing every evening/weekend and why do they do this?  The answer is simple, it's not a bad game. Far from it, the game is actually very good. Rome II has had A LOT of criticism from die-hard TW fans and I can understand why. There were many bugs on release, the AI should simply be called A as it's certainly not very intelligent and I sometimes find my saved games corrupt after each update. I dislike the city building (as cool as the sharing of structures within a region is) and think they should have kept it moreso like Shogun's. I hate how the game tends to be split entirely with the Tribes (Northern Eu) and the Greeks/Romans (South Eu) as if they are only 2 different playable factions within the game. What I mean is that all of the tribes feel the same, as do all of the Greek nations. So I wish there was more diversity between nations' units and structures. Also, would it be so hard as to create just a few more character models? Seeing an army of 10,000 tribesmen all with the same face and 1 of 2 haircuts is annoying as hell.  All of these things frustrate me and this game could have been a lot better but, it's certainly not a bad game that we should all be trying to discourage others from buying, such as Infestation:Survivor stories. The original TW Rome was for many TW fans, the best in the franchise so Rome II had some pretty big boots to fill and unfortunately, many people feel that because it didn't give them that nostalgia they were seeking, 'the game sucked 0/10'. I don't think that is at all fair.  Now, is Rome 2 my favourite TW? No, it isn't. I'm not going to lie but, it's certainly worth getting if you are a TW fan, or generally someone who enjoys RTS games. The graphics are definitely the best of all the TW games to date (I don't understand why so many people seem to think Shogun 2 had better graphics, maybe their computers are too sh*te to play Rome II on a high graphical setting) and the DLC is pretty much the same old generic content that you'd expect to find (extra factions and units etc), priced at the amount you'd expect it to be.  Rome II is certainly a lot easier to mod than Shogun 2 was, so if you enjoy modding then you also have that going for you, which is nice. You're actually able to hide units now as hills and trees obscure line of sight. You no longer have to be in the forest to be hidden, simply the other side of them is enough. Many units now have multiple abilities, some even passively activate themselves, such as front line melee infantry letting loose a volley of javelins before charging in to battle without your intervention. Even though the AI isn't so intelligent, I still find it much less predictable than it was in Shogun 2 and diplomacy is key to surviving on higher difficulties so, choose your allies wisely or you can find the game to be quite brutal.  I've personally enjoyed all those hours that I've clocked on Rome II and will enjoy many more in the future to come. If you're unsure about it, wait until a steam sale but you should certainly get it either way, so that you too can waste hundreds of hours of your own life building an empire to span the entirety of Europe! Killing and conquering all, like a boss.",

The game suffers from AI problems and other misc bugs, and I feel it's not nearly as polished as Shogun 2 (one of the most polished TW games after expansions/patching imo), but it has a way better campaign, factions, unit rosters, building/culture rosters, and other features that make it a lot more fun than Shogun 2.  I wrote a positive review about Shogun 2 before, claiming it to be the best TW game released ever, and while that's true for the most polished and bug-free total war ever, I feel that Rome 2 will become the better game if it continue to be patched positively.

The patches made it more then playabe now. But, it's still very rough around the edges. You'll find yourself sighing in dissapointment when all your units do is just clump up and a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ in battles, and fail horribly to keep a steady-formation in battle.   The archers in Rome 2 are just horrible. You'll find that flaming shot arrows are completley pointless. Despite the looks. It's just disgusting. They literaly go through troops and do nothing. The standard/heavy shot seems to devistate. Also, a huge problem is in battles, they never seem to want to shoot. I've lost battles cause of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The cavalry is very awesome in Rome 2. I love the diffrent kinds of types/formations. Never gets old when you hear the thundering hooves of pure devistation. Though, it seems that the light cavalry is really underpowered when it comes to actual melee. Imo, don't rely on medium/light cavalry in battles. They will dissapoint you to the fullest.  The amount of factions/settlements available to play as / fight is AMAZING. Compared to just a few years ago, (Napoleon, Empire, etc..) It's a huge improvement. But, the lack of diplomacy options kind-of ruins it. Like, example. I was playing as Rome, and I conqoured All of Germania, Carthage, Egypt, and most of the major factions. The Selucid empire was being dominated by Parthia, and we were Very Friendly, and they DECLARED WAR ON ME. The desicions are horrible by the AI diplomacy. It infurates me that a mod for Napoleon: Total War has better AI desicions then the latest installment of Total War.  AI-Wise in battles are alright. Way better then launch. Nothing much I can say. I am satisfied with it.  Now. The thing that floors me, and makes me highly resent Total War: Rome 2, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T and LIES In the SS's. The actual graphics in the game are alright, but NOTHING Like in the screen shots. I've managed to get a 45-50-60 ratio FPS With medium-high graphics, and I am floored to say that they are nothing like in the SS's. My friend irl has a very nice PC. And can run the game on extreme to 55-60 FPS And it still can't compare to the SS's. Pretty cheap that you guys have to lie to impress.  Also, the lack of multiplayer options is dissapointing. I cannot say how dissapointed I am that I can't do the awesome customization, as in Shogun 2 in Rome 2. I'm not a huge fan of Japanese history/culture. But the idea in acient roman times is AWESOME. And the fact they didn't add that is ♥♥♥♥-taking.  Well. I guess my final verdict is a 6/10.  Huge dissapointment. Thanks for ruining a great oppertunity.        So, I did a review on this a few weeks ago, almost a month. And I had to say. It was 100% Honest. Luckily, I have some new things to say about the game, and it's future according to my opinion.    So, a few weeks ago, they released two major updates, on fixing the game and it's problems. And now, I have to say. The game is excelent. The faction-ballance has been improved, so one unit of pikemen in a phalanx can't hold off 5-6 other units. The units look ALOT better. I am very impressed and suprised on how this is.  Now, the things they did not fix. And really dissapointed me.   - The barbarian tribes starting-units are still AWFUL. I mean, 20 seconds of engagement, and they already are broken.  - Some factions still seem un-playable (Such as, Epirus, Boii, and some others.)   Now. This is what tons of people want to know, 'How is Caeser in Gaul', 'Does it suck?', 'Is it worth the $15?'  In my opinion, no, it's not. The actual CiG campaign is really weird. It's near-impossible to recruit more units, and if you dare lose Caesers 'Legio I Galacia' You're screwed.   BUT. It is really cool that they add more barbarian tribes to play as in the normal campaign. It's really fun fighting the Germanic tribes as the Gallic tribe, 'Boii', and seize control of Beligum as 'Galacia' (Something like that.)    All in all, I do recommend this to any TW Fan. And I hope they are still to improve it.  Final Verdict: 8/10. Way improved.",

I'll start the slow clap to CA for the fantastic marketing of this game. I've played since Medieval I, and was blown away with Rome I when it first came out. I think CA knew that a majority of their players felt the same way, and made Rome II to be something much more grander than the original with their siege of Carthage video and the new Rally Point teasers. I pre-ordered...and CA played me well I'll give them that.  I played through all the patches, but I think it's safe for all of the players to assume that nothing CA can do will bring back the immersion and strategy that the prior TW games brought to the table. I swear to you, I've never even bothered to look at the general's traits because they don't matter. They die before they become significant. All that matters is grinding them to commander, general, infantry commander II, and great leader and bringing them to your 'training' Providences to pump out level III gold units for the rest of your armies so that you can steam roll the AI. Rinse and repeat. I've played many factions, and every time Rome is annihilated very early before I can even fight them...in a game called Rome II. Seige AI? Ha...just send out your useless plebs to attack their ladder units, and then slaughter the rest of the army at your gates when they abandon their ladders. Battles? Just use your infantry line to hold the enemy (after you take their skirmishers out with your calvary) while your javelin units get at least 200+ kills and eventually lead to the route of the enemy unit. No real strategy at all. You can use a different faction, but the same strategy always works. You can't lose unless you purposely try to. The series has been dumbed down beyond belief.   This is probably the only time I felt like I was scammed into buying a game based on past reputation and hype. CA, for me, has lost all credibility. I'm not saying I won't play again (because there is nothing else out there like the TW games), but I'll be sure to buy a game after it's 'Gold Package' with all the additions is on sale for $25 (being generous), and the reviews for the game are above 8.0 out of 10 on the average.

I had to change the collision on mine because I hated this clustering going on, but it was not unbearable, it was just slightly irritating.  The good points are: Few crashes, they only happen with lots of mods (55) Best current AI on any total war to date. (It actually is) Great campaign in most playthroughs, but can get too easy.  A few minor critisisms are the removed family tree (happy to see it making an appearence in Attila) You have to have someone leading an army and you can't just select a few units, send them out to kill a few rebels and come home or have 3-4 units of light cav wandering around your borders to scout for enemy armies.  Lots of the units looks very similar their faces) and none really look majorly different. Voice acting is minimal, it could keep the game very fresh if people had different accents. Cities never tend to look very different, barbarian cities are all the same, same with greeks and romans, same with eastern factions.  Characters feel expendable because they have no real meaning in your family, in Med 2 I would be both sad and scared when my King died, they usually had great influence in the world and my faction could easily fall apart after their death.    I think what makes this so good is the superb modding community. Champloo, Wolfman and many more who made me play this game. Overally it gets 60% good, though if I had not seen the majesty of Med 2 and Rome 1, it would probably get a higher mark. I just hope Attila can do better.",

This still galls to this day and I would not pre-order a Total War game again.  After many patches and post-polishing, I can cautiously recommend this as a decent addition to the Total War franchise. Its overall mechanics aren't super, such as the nerf to culture change, where you now have default culture that cannot be converted, leaving permanent unhappiness in conquered territories of a foreign culture.  The battle mechanics are solid, although there are some clear carry-overs from Shogun 2. They never did families or the in-depth politics as promised. Despite that, the game is still fun, although it can get a bit stale when you get to a big empire stage against other similarly big empires. The AI does not always function as intended still, although the related game-breaking bugs have at least been eliminated.  A lot more time was spent with attention to history this time around, no ancient Egyptians, you now get proper diadochi. Some factions rosters are a bit sparse, and non-playable powers aren't worked into the system of buffs/tradeoffs you get choosing a faction or family for the playable ones.  Many of the faults and gripes can be fixed with mods, but it shouldn't be on the shoulder of the modwright to carry a game.  Ultimately, get this on sale in a bundle, there's many hours of game to explore, but it's not worth full price, in my opinion. And the DLCs are some of the better and more fun content.",

            "review_text": "So, let me toss my hat into this ring.   Rome II released a fair bit buggy. AI was too aggressive against the player, but not each other. There was a weird glitch in Gameplay everyone complained about I never saw (And was fixed within the second week patch). When I first played it, it was funnish still, but all these new diplomacies out of reach due to overly bizarre AI was the main issue. Not so much anymore.   AI follows a state based on their relationship status to you, which is based on if you're war with their enemies (+) or with their friends (-) and follows a fairly sensible pattern, where someone at 150+ relations won't declare war on you unless you attack someone in that is their defensive alliance (But if they are afraid/good enough friends, they'll peace out fairly quickly.) Someone at -200 is undoubtly going to declare war on you, even if they have to launch a naval invasion to make it happen. The AI does get afraid though, The selecuids at war with everyone suddenly found Galatian Barbarians running rampant over their stuff, and they peaced out with a massive gold gift to avoid further destruction.   Combat AI is mostly good, especially in field battles. If your line is too short, they will flank you with their infantry. Sometimes they go with a lopsided strategy against your weak flanks to try to break them and sweep into the side. Cav will chase your archers round and round unless you counter them. They use scout cavalary to try to find your people if you hide in the forest rather than marching around aimlessly. Combat AI gets a little weird in city sieges. THey kind of understand how to defend, in that they'll move to fill gaps you break in the wall, defend the right areas, put archers to counter movements. Without siege weapons, you'll get punished trying to climb the walls. Attacking though it's a bit weird. First it'll move up ladders, and if that fails, they'll attack your gate (AI has siege gear, but never allowed it to get to my walsl before). Most of the time this still goes straight forwards, but this does allow your archers to pepper them freely, despite ladders on the walls. Though since the ladders appear to be made out of adamintine, that's probably for the best. Once trhough, they tend to just stream their entire force through. Archers, cavalry, infantry, everything.   Combat stats are pretty nice. Morale is still a big deal like Shogun 2, though even the most untrained levy is not nearly as much of a pansy as the Rise of the Samurai Levy units which would take one casualty and panic like the world is ending. Some morale seems a bit ridiclous (Killing 119 Thorax Swordsman in a group and yet the last one still fights on) but most respond to shocks like hard shock cav charges pretty well. Generals are important to maintain morale and their abilities are really helpful. They also have other bonuses that vary heavily, like reducing unit cost or improving everyone's skill, or reducing enemy morale. Army Groups now are permenant things that build traditions as well that outlive their generals and can be reinstated if they are wiped out. These can represent a key doctrine certain groups employ. Combat can get a bit slow and sloggy though when you have spears in defensive position and all they have are is spears. BRING A SWORD. Will admit, combining Shield strength into armor and missile accuracy into missle damage on the stat screen is a bit weird.  Campaign isn't like Rome 1 where Population is the only important stat and money is infinite. Population is still important, population growth allowing areas to gain new buildings to make more money. Money really varies though where you start. If you start as Parthia and take over Iran, that's a free money from the trade goods and Eastern bonus to towns (Local COmmerce bonus+10% bonus from Being Eastern.) Whereas Rome is very tempting to go full military, and you'll wind up bankrupting yourself in your war against Carthage, unable to pay for reinforcements and navies.   Campaign other nice note: Nobody plays that similar. Geography and unit types are nicea nd diverse. Now, some, like Parthia, play totally different from most others. Parthia plays like a Steppe Horde that got some full plate knights. They also get bonus damage on all their ranged weapons. Even after a 15% bonus, Rome's slingers and javs still do way less damage than parthians, and that's not mentioning the archers. Slinger: Normal 18, Parthia: 21. Jav: 39, Parthia 45, Archer: 27 Parthia: 32. Cretan archers of some hellenic factions have the 32, but those are a tier 3-4 unit. Parthias get those archers from a tier 2 building... that also ride horses. Rome has Legionaires. Sparta has a diverse set of units based aroudn their social stratifications, Athens has a few nice cavalry, Macedon with their units, Egypt with their mixture of native Egyptians and greek things, Pontus and Selecuids with mixture of eastern and hellenic, Galatia as he invading gauls. Lots of fun.   86%, Would recommend.",

I have been playing the original Rome, and Medieval 2 for some time now, those were my first 2 total war games, and I love them, but I'm fastly getting close to equal the hours I have put to those games playing Rome 2, and that is because I find this game very different to them, yet, amazing.  First thing I noticed before buying this game, was the ammount of DLC it has, and a lot of them are just ridiculous to be sold as such, like the Greek culture pack and blood. Blood, as a DLC, and not as a graphical option, really? Nevermind, I payed for those 2 on sale, and I will get most of the rest when they are on sale again, NEVER on the normal price, because I don't support what SEGA is doing here.  Another thing I noticed that is different from the original Rome and Medieval 2, is the workshop integration. You can find some amazing mods made by the community, from small ones to improve your gameplay and experience, textures to improve graphics, and complex yet high quality overhauls like Divide et Impera.   Like I have been saying, this game is really different from the other 2 I mentioned, it took me a little while to get used to the new system of conquest and managing cities, and now I'm loving it, and the battles are improved as well, that nice feeling you get when using the cinematic camera while charging to your enemy is just priceless.   I recommend this game, I don't support what SEGA did here, again, but the game in itself is great. If you can, get it on sale, because the DLC is just not worth the whole price, I just whish this evil market strategy changes in the future.",

            "review_text": "Competitive turn-based strategy game incorporated with real-time strategy. Sets an entirely different setting than any other Total War game so far. The combat experience is great because it's fairly balanced out and requires a lot of concentration.  Pros: - Very realistically refined historical accuracy of units. - Great open field combat and mechanics. - Turn-based strategy can be quite difficult. - Amazing mod community. - O.K. co-op multiplayer.  Cons: - AI is stupid. Could of been made more tactical to increase difficulty instead of being so heads-on agressive. - Graphics are fairly demanding, and evenso when setting up high graphics doesn't meet marketing screenshot quality. - The Total War encyclopedia for this game is just horrid in comparison to Shogun 2's. - Political system could of been more like Shogun 2.  I've spent a lot of time playing this game right from the start. I pre-ordered it and really looked forward to it. People complained from the start, mentioning errors throughout gameplay and the game being very glitchy. I personally felt like they publisher literally released a beta. Honestly, many issues didn't start bugging me until later. The game remained very competitive but it could have had some improvements. Overall I always just turned a blind eye to the issues and the game remained very enjoyable, as I've experienced no different with CA in a positive way. All bugs and glitches were fixed very quickly.  Imagine playing Risk table-top but with enhanced 3D aesthetics, and when in combat instead of throwing dices you just get into real-time strategy which can possibly involve multiple armies and AIs depending on the conflict scenario. The game is very immersive and drags you right into the historical sphere mainly due to how all the units function and what abilities they bring to the field. The units for each faction are very refined in terms of what purpose they served in the days of old; what weapons and armour they carry onto the field.  The experience is very detailed from first-person camera tracing to follow units into a heads-on charge (as seen in trailers) to the morale boosts commanders provide to their battalion as they are near forfeit.  The game is very competitive and remains challenging and remains so throughout dozens of hours of play up into the hundreds, due to how every faction has its own types of units. You can literally just model your army's organizational structure after how they functioned in reality, or run experimental tests of your own, and this alone makes every battle a surprise. Fighting other factions will require you to adapt your armies.  On top of that there's the economical elements brought to the game, aswell as political intrigue, each different factors that can change the outcome of a war.  To end with the negative things; the AI could be better. Armies often just attack in small stacks, making it very easy to be victorious, sometimes not even posing a challenge. When you increase difficulty, armies just receive combat modifiers. They don't really become any harder to fight strategically. They don't grow 'smarter'. Even on high difficulty the AI is stupid, such as how siege battles are very boring. While provided with siege weaponary, you can basically just go stand in front of your gate with one unit and wait until they break through, only to see them try to push you aside instead of fight you or face you on multiple flanks. They just perform suicide missions and you can easily fight off an army of 3000 men with just two-hundred spears.  The graphics are great, although fairly demanding. You'll require a good processor and memory to render all the units in the field, although performance of the game has been significantly improved through later patches mainly in regards to units moving on the field, which in the past could happen through lag spikes. - High graphics don't par with the screenshots marketed.  The encyclopedia is very bad. It's hard to find certain elements of the game for more information, if you don't have the ability to right-click elements in a unit roster. The search function is just horrid because it doesn't let you find anything that would even bring you to using the encyclopedia in the first place.  I feel the political system could be better such as having the old family tree from Shogun 2. It gives your faction an individual touch, while having an avatar as your faction leader doesn't really mean anything. They are only displayed as portraits in the diplomacy window wherein they will have some generic dialogue. Their appearance is very generic, while for Shogun 2, each faction had unique daimyo's (clan leaders) that didn't look like your everyday general. You don't really grow a bond with the characters in your political system anymore, and wont care much for the political intrigue, because all the characters and armies are, are stats. At one point somebody may assassinate your Hannibal Barca, but two turns later another with the same name is added to your pool.",

This installment of series makes many changes, both positive and negative, but the ultimate sum of the equation results in one great game. It's true, there are many aspects of the game that have been changed, some for the better and some for worse, but I give this game no less love. There's nothing missing or added to this game that breaks the Total War formula, so unless you're hung up on the little things like no more family trees, or the fact that units can be transported across bodies of water without dedicated naval units, then this game is nothing short of amazing. I can understand the gripes of the Total War fans that cry foul for some of the changes but, at its core, it's still a fantastic game.  For people who aren't Total War players:  Any fans of turn-based strategy will enjoy the dynamics of the campaign map, while also getting a huge thrill out of the real-time battles that are inevitable.

            "review_text": "Total War: Rome II was a Pyhrric victory.  On one hand, Creative Assembly and SEGA made a lot of money. That's great for them, I'm sure it'll keep them warm at night.  On the other, it left the fans bitter toward the developers and the producers, having been tempted by virtue of its predecessors. Where Rome I - for its time- was a phenomenal game, Rome II has failed to live up to its hype. Perhaps we have just grown older.  Coming on to the Emperor Edition of Rome II, we have finally recieved a game worthy of the series' reputation and the money spent acquiring the thing.   Rome II set out to change the series, which is an admirable goal almost achieved- but not worth alienating its established audience.  Technical issues appeared, of course. One of the most off-putting was the change to the campaign's factions. Fans requested a more in-depth faction system, and CA divided the world according to numerous historical nations and tribes. It sounds good on paper; the sheer amount of factions, however, breaks the flow of the game by extending end turn times and slowing AI growth, so that the player's empire--once established--has no clear rivals, such as in Medieval II.  Some of my pet peeves include the Faction DLCs- the worst of which is the Greek States DLC that cost me more than reasonably- and the odd lack of historical battles, which I fear may also become paid DLC. My will to make this game work paid off when I picked up the nomadic Tribes free, but it will take more than a few new cultures to fix this game. I particularly dislike the campaign AI, which takes its quantity-over-quality armies and finds the most isolated lands nearby to carve a short-lived empire before my army can sweep in, and I am forced to manually fight an easy battle that, if autoresolved, would have had my legions scattered. The political system is difficult to comprehend, as little clear indication is given of how it actually affects the game; it's no better (and not much worse) than Rome I's system. Similarly, character levelling is difficult because they die off quickly, and there is no longer an ability tree- you are choosing abilities blind.  I found that many players complained about issues that simply required them to have had experience with past Total War games, or to have simply done a little exploring of the game to understand. The two that stood out for me were the battle AI and the new province system, and those issues and solutions are respective of each other. Let's face it: Total War's AI has never been top-quality stuff. I take it many of the complainers weren't around when it was making the same poor decisions in the previous games- that said, it is somewhat odd that CA hasn't yet developed a more advanced AI to give the seasoned commanders a proper challenge. As for the province system- it works. Move on.  Luckily, most of the issues stated above are able to be fixed, whether it is by the developers themselves or by the now supported modding community. Negativity aside, there have been many great additions to the game that I hope will remain. The province system brings a level of strategy to building your empire, as you must now choose your buildings carefully, rather than simply your build order (arguably, that was present in Shogun II but grouping the cities into provinces shares their effects which improves the system). In battles, the men talk to each other and give the feeling that a battle is really going down; the cinematic camera works very well with this. Unfortunately, the unit-vs-unit AI is hard in my PC, and I can't view the battles up close. You can also now choose to fight replay battles again (Note that they're called 'replays' and not 'recorded battles'- as such, don't expect to be able to relive your finest battles exactly as they went).   Just remember: almost everything that made Total War what it is is still here.  With everything said about the DLC, if you have the money I believe they're all worth it. The campaigns can give you access to neat mods on more detailed maps, and the paid DLC factions are certainly worth buying if you take a particular interest in those cultures.   It's still big, epic Total War. Buy this game on sale (like any game ;3 )",

            "review_text": "As a highly anticipated title and a successful franchise (and me being a huge total war fan) Rome II is quite the dissapointment. New players to the franchise may enjoy it more then old players who are used to the challenges in previous titles. Its also accompanied by a list of glitchs which they continue to fix, but lets face it its been out for a while now a lot is still broken and there seems to be some performance issues even on high end machines.   They continue to patch the game so hopefully they can balance out the game more to make it worth the 59$ asking price. Also they should consider making the game itself 100% playable rather then put out add-on content for a game that plays like something barely out of beta.  - Poor Campaign AI [I've beat the campaign twice on Legendary, it can be rough at first, but once you learn to stabilize your economy and keep provinces happy, Food/Money are no problem as you progress. I ended both campaigns with millions, the hardest part is the civil war, but its not as hard as it is annoying. Once the civil war ends factions fall easily one by one - Poor Battle AI [Again on legendary the battle AI is sloppy and lacks tactic. Peltasts are over powered, Ballistas are over powered. AI sends its cav at your flanks to early, which results in Melee vs Melee while you sweep your cav in and clean up the enemy missle units. Every faction fights the same as well so its all predictable. BloodPack addon - the charged addition of some gore is also a let down. Blood spray/splattering is awesome, but the blood detail on dead/hurt units is very sloppy also you have to look very close to see dismemberment if at all Ceaser in Gual - I havent yet purchased or played. No opinion other then it SHOULD BE FREE to all the people who preordered the game and delt with the sloppy unplayable first few weeks of Rome 2's release. SO i've yet to give in and contribute another 15$ toward this franchise. Graphics: 7 / 10 [Great detail in city's/towns but some units need to be better optimized] Audio: 7 / 10 [It works] Replay Value: Moderate/High [You wont put the time in as on previous titles] Multiplayer: Online Battles / Co-op campaign Controls: Same as other total war titles, very sloppy during lag, dragging units to redirect them results in sticking and units not deploying. Double clicking to make units toggle run on/off can be annoying Overall: 7 / 10 Things I feel could help balance and make the game better. - Rather then catapults &amp; Ballistas having 4 siege weapons per card. It should be 1 per card. So if you have 4 Giant Ballista's in your stacked force, rather then 16 Ballistas on the battlefield you will only have 4 (1 per card) - Peltasts accuracy/range/damage Nerfed. Peltasts are as effective as archers and more deadly then Auxillary. - Some variation in tactics for the AI factions. The tribes would have different tactics then lets say sparta. Maybe tribal factions should try more ambush's and rely on a more ground//melee strategy with minor ranged support. - Better battle strategy. In previous titles enemy forces would move in close and you'd have a ranged exchange while infantry supported the ranged units. I'd like to see more of that rather then infantry rushing in then being supported by their ranged units once the infantry clash begins - Fixed blood &amp; Gore (more like Shogun 2) Rome 2 gore looks like a sloppy mess.",

My one and only complaint is why didn't all previous Rome II owners before Emperor Edition get the DLC? Most of my friends have it but I can't afford it at the moment and they should make certain DLCs free like the Beasts of War because I would like to have those beastly Wolf Warriors!

I had patience when they were sorting out the bugs at launch, month after month after month. Now it is mostly playable, but is it fun? For the most part: no. There's no driving force behind the game, nothing that keeps me wanting to come back for more. Some other reviewers have already gone into detail, but some of the issues are of a graphical nature, but also that just that conquering new provinces on the campaign map becomes dull. I also tried out the multiplayer coop campaign with a friend, but just as with Shogun II it eventually becomes unplayable due to glitches and bugs mostly relating to desynching.  I don't know what has happened to Creative Assembly during the years, but they no longer seem to be the same. Now I also noticed the new Hannibal title has day one DLC, which makes my stomach turn even more.   My recommendation? If you want a grand strategy game, this isn't it. Go back to the older games, or look for a Paradox Interactive game. Creative Assembly has lost it's place as king of the hill and they are going to have to work hard to come back to it.",

You will never found a high rank army with the best units on an AI army that can be at least a match for you, but mostly levy pikemen and scouts and so on. It is very easy to win, the only thing is that it takes time to conquer all the provinces. It is truly amazing how stupid they are. It seems that major factions are always on the defensive strategy, as they are weak and stepped on by smaller factions. Jesus what a waste of 50 dollars.

            "review_text": "I have thoroughly enjoyed rome 2, but at the same time this could have been so much better. I never played rome 1 or medieval to death and maybe that explains why i'm not constantly feeling cheated at the game just blatantly not being as good as those. Everything is beautifully presented on the map, the icons and the buildings etc, but this games problems are not interface related.   For starters, the warface engine used in the battles destroys the experience in battle. Infact the only fun i have in these anymore is either A) Using my OP units or B) performing basic battle tactics....almost all of which are enough to outmanouevre the ♥♥♥♥ AI.  Combat is completely broken. The engine insists on having men perform 'kill moves' in completely scripted stab then withdraw scenes.....instead of just stabbing the ♥♥♥♥ing guy infront of you to death quickly and efficiently. The roman and barbarian, eastern and hellenic units all fight thus in the same basic way- the only way to break the deadlock in the later stages of the campaign on VH or legendary ( After you've butchered you're way through the customaryshockingly bad start faction surrounding your home province ) is to get more and more OP Units which eventually spoil all the fun of combat in the first place. With no family trees, you're practically invited to use a 4 turn per year mod in order to get better invested in their life and victories....but all this does is make them massively overpowered, twice i fought large scale battles outside alexandria against full stacks of egyptians and both their commanders were level 10. This from a faction that hadnt actually gained another full province in the first 90 turns....they just sat in their homeland accruing tarits and getting more and more unbalanced.  The building system is poorly explained at the start ( not helped by the terrible encyclopaedia system) and the whole system of commerce/politics not really explained. My seleucid campaign was eventually ruined/spoiled after i conquered an african tribes final city in about turn 10. this conatined one of their own factional military buildings.....yet somehow allowed me to recruit silver shield swordsmen and royal cataphracts - massively OP late game units.  Agents are totally overpowered. As a consequence i now find myself agent spamming on every save i do....simply because they are broken on this game. DO NOT USE 4 turns per and then use agents. The spies ability to 'poison provisions' in an enemy army- sometimes killing as many as 400-500 men, and the champions 'raid' ability ( inflicting damage to every building in a town or city) are just some of the highlights. By the end of the game they are more powerful than standing armies.  The online unfortunately loses the avatar conquest features from shogun 2, which i personally enjoyed. Yes the try - harding some people were willing to go to just to level up a smidge more was just unenjoyable, but i still felt the game benefitted. Online battles are still fun, but ( in a similar way to medieval 2 and particularly shogun 2) are often decided by whoevers overpowered units perform better in the long run. In the hands of a competent ( slightly evil ) player the syrian armoured elephant is capable of such destruction as to be utterly ridiculous. This made all the more galling ofcourse by the fact thet whenever the ai has control of them they seldom get 25 kills.....  Ultimately this game is not as good as rome 1 in alomst all comparable things. Shogun got a bit of a free ride because of its beautiful presentation-though the combat was still broken, though this game was robbed of that because of the state of the ai and presentation at launch.  I dont want to give it any kind of rating as i hate scores but at the end of the day if you are new to TW you should not be playing this first when rome 1 and medieval 2 exist, unless you're a graphical manic like me.   Ps. The expansions to this game , caesar in gaul and hannibal are very good, adding interesting new factions and different settings obviously...but would have benefitted from some napoleon esque scripting in their layout- rome for example are 9 times out 10 hammered in CIG by all the ten-a-penny barbarian factions, spoiling the expansion a tad.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game within a few days of its release. Yes it was very broken in most respects but it still functioned from day 1 in single player, multiplayer, Steam Workshop &amp; game replays/saves which is more than can be said about a lot of other games that had way more money spent upon them and still don't work to this day (Battlefield 4 prime example).  Since its release there have been 13 big patches which have fixed and rebalanced the game. The main problem I have is that a lot of the DLC is just faction packs or the 'Blood &amp; Gore pack' which were already built into the game and were clearly used to just get more money. I don't mind having the Ceasar in Gaul as DLC because it actually adds to the game with new campaign, units and abilites that were not there before.  The gameplay at the core is basically the same as most other Total War games with army formations, units that counter others, economy for the campaign map, city building etc. The differences being how they are all set up in this particular game. Cities are now grouped into provinces of 1-3 small towns and 1 walled city that acts as a sort of capital for the area, whoever came up with that did a great job as managing the economy is so much smoother and easier. Armies are built and maintained in the same way as before with agents being able to support them. Naval warfare can be a bit hit or miss but it can actually be played unlike when the game was first released.   The battles between your army and another have a clear distinction between single and multiplayer. This is to be expected but not to the degree it still is. The game AI is very predictable and usually ends up doing the same thing over and over with each battle, charging cavalry into pike/spear formations in a bad attempt to get at your ranged units for example. Plus I have noticed the AI will keep building armies of basic troops (1 general, 10 basic spears/swords, 2/3 light horse and the rest slingers is usually the template) so the only time you have a true challenge is when there are 2/3 of these armies attacking you at once or when a Civil War happens as the AI get high quality troops (only because they are pre made not recruited). The battles themselves though are very fun and using the cinematic camera during the heat of battle is one of my favourite things to do.   The community support helps out the game with peoples own designed units and maps. There are even a few total conversions which have made the game more historic, given bigger unit sizes or changed how the whole economy works. There are plenty of smaller things such as unit re-skins or stats changes.  Overall the game, now it has been patched, is highly recommended if you are a fan of the Total War games. If it is your first game of the series don't think it will be too much to handle as it set out in a very easy to understand way and the built in adviser does help out a lot.",

There were a few times where controlling the unit in ships was a little dicy and sometimes they were bugged out, either stuck against a wall and couldnt move or were still locked in a boarding battle with an enemy ship that had sunk but were unresponsive to orders.  It felt sort of half ♥♥♥♥♥ in a certain way. Everything was just a different colored texture of something else, except for rome. It really took away the sense I was fighting in a huge diverce and complicated world when everything looked almost exactly the same.  The campaign was confusing at first, and I couldnt quiet figure out why my population were so damn unhappy all the time despite putting nearly all my attention into increasing puplic order and taking no slaves  All in all the game was pretty solid and the multiplayer battles were really fun.

A very challenging campaign for new TW players,again hardcore fans will find it a bit easy     Some excellent quality campaign DLCs like ceasar in gaul and hannibal at the gates  Now that i have explained some of the pros i will explain the negative aspects of this game  cons: The hardcore fans find the AI a little easy to say the absolute least,really i have won 2 full stacks defending a small village with only the garriosn,the AI didnt think to flank me   Yeah its true most of the DLCs suck,having the greek city states as a dlc and sellling stupid cut off content like beasts of war isnt very nice    The game launch was ♥♥♥♥,the game crushed all the time,yet i am very pleased with the developers as they have fixed the game complelty with emperor edition.     Building system is stupid,i miss the good old days of medieval 2 where you could build all the buildings you like in a major settlement.having only 6 buildings in your capital isnt very nice.  Reaching a conclusion i reccomend the game to any grand strategy fan and total war fan,the current game is extremely good and you will have lots of fun playing it,a warning for old total war fans,this game even though very good,isnt what shogun 2 or medieval 2 was,the great total war games that are still played and loved,its more of a mediocre TW than a super major hit like medieval 2.

My sessions still often end in 'Rome II has unexpectedly crashed,' I have unmodded legendary saves that won't load, and I cannot play for nearly as long as on the original Rome without getting bored.  My main concern is that my current legendary campaign, although almost complete, is no fun at all. Diplomacy on legendary seems to be something that escapes me: factions half way across the map declare war for no reason when I have good integrity and it is near impossible to sue for peace with anybody but, if you do, they often declare war again a few turns later. The battles are not neccessary challenging but the constant spam of agents and armies from every side make it such a grind to make progress. CA said they were limiting armies to make battles more meaningful with bigger impact; however, with a restricted number of armies, it just turns into mine being holed up, fighting many meaningless battles that take a couple of turns to recover from, with enemy agents constantly limiting their movement!  The modding community is, for me, the only thing that rescues this game as most of the crappy features in the original (save politics, family trees, and awful unit collision/charging) can be altered. Admittedly, a lot has been fixed since release, but there are still many things that seem inherantly broken to many paople; I really think I only play because of my interest in the time period, and due to a huge amount or nostalgia for Rome I.

I'm somewhat glad to say that I've succeeded, but I'm still disappointed I had to resort to mass modding to make the game enjoyable. After the amazing experience that was Shogun 2, I expected so much more from CA. Playing Rome 2 after having played anything earlier in the series like Medieval 2, Rome 1 or Shogun 2 can be a bit of a let down. Thinking of the advantages Rome 2 has over those games I can only think of...better looking units/graphics? The province system? I guess the Campaign map size is more or less the same size?  Still, time has passed, the bugs have been mostly squashed, mechanics have changed, there still aren't any family trees or agent cutscenes, but there ARE tons of awesome mods by the community to change the ancient world in your own image.

Anyway, picked the Kingdom of Pontus in what is modern day turkey or so, and soon as i started playing I was hooked.  Diplomacy has improved slightly since Shogun 2, AI nations actively try to earn favour and security from their neighbours with a will to survive rather than conquer others, unless survival means to conquer (unless their barbarians, to which they will only listen if you're giving them a swirly).  On a strategic view battles now feel more important to me, due to the lack of armies; it makes victory more valuable and losing will have a relatively severe affect on the security of your nation, leaving gaps in your frontlines; and in that respect wars should be planned accordingly.  Knowing the crushing details about this games release, I feel that most of the ideas and details have been decently ironed out over the past year or so, thought it is missing a few things that would have been nice to include, such as trading territory.

            "review_text": "The worst thing about this game is that it had the potential to be the best Total War in the series. As it is, it falls short. Ignoring that, however, it is a pretty decent game. Although there are only around 10 or so factions that you can play as, there are a huge amount of minor factions on the campaign map which adds a lot to the atmosphere and diversity of the game (as well as the time it takes for a turn to finish lel). This was a welcome addition in Empire and it is good that they have kept it in successive games rather than reverting to the swathes of 'rebel' settlements that plagued Rome 1 and Medieval 2. Graphically, it is pretty ♥♥♥♥. I personally think Shogun 2 looked better. I don't quite know what it is but there is something 'off' in how it looks. Music is pretty decent, not as good as the first Rome's but it isn't bad. The campaign map does look delicous though.  Now for things I don't like. Ship combat is severly ♥♥♥♥ed. Ramming a ship head on does basically the same damage as ramming it from the side, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This basically nullifies manouvering as AI ships just come straight at you and there is nothing you can do to curb the damage. I intensely dislike how they removed buildings outside of the main province centre. I loved how in Shogun 2 and Empire you could raid farms, mines, lumberyards and ports. I also don't particularly like the 'streamlined' province management which has one big city and then several smaller villages. In theory it is great but it means cities like Syracuse, Rhodes, Sparta and Memphis are basically reduced to villages while large cities like Capua are completely ♥♥♥♥ing removed because they needed to put in some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little village that was on the coast. Too many rebellions. I have to dedicate far too much of my military resources to wiping out rebellions. There is also little reward for completely destroying a rebel army. You'd think that slaughtering an army to the last man would increase public order for a little while but no. It is also pretty inconsistent and nonsensical. My single worst province is Italia which has right from the start been a ♥♥♥♥ that is constantly having rebellions. Illyria on the other hand has been a model province and has been extremely happy with my rule. One might think that I was playing as a Barbarian faction but no, I am playing as Rome.   All in all, it is a decent game. Patches are still coming out fairly regularly although besides the public order issues (none of which the AI suffers from of course) and the ship damage few of the annoying issues can be fixed. 7/10.  &gt;Italians &gt;White",

            "review_text": "I dont understand all the hate for this game. I've been playing total war for abut 3 or four years now. I have Napoleon, Medieval 2, Medieval, and Rome 2 total war. This is second in my list (Behind Medieval total war). Im going to break this review into four parts: Battle, Campaign, Graphics, and Overview.  Overview: Rome 2 total war is an amazing game. It's loads of fun that will keep you glued to your screen for hours. If you get it though, get it on sale. Because $60 is too much for a two year old game. Plus, you NEED the greek states pack to fully enjoy this game. That add Athens, Sparta, And Lipidus* (*Really bad seplling, soz). And that eads me onto my next point, beware of the DLC. They nickle anddime you to death. Like, they have a tab on the main meu dedicated to dlc you havent bought yet. And on the campaign tab, they have all of there DlC Campigns listed with the grand campaign to remind you to buy ore DLC! (as if the game isn't already expensive) But get over that, its an amazing game.  Battle: Battles are a lot of fun. If you do a custom battle, you can select any map, by simply clicking somewhere on a map of the entire campign map (basically, there is hundreds of maps) There are bunchs of factions to choose from, adding to the customizaable aspect of custom battles. The unit cards are creative, they aren't scrrenshots of the unit, they are cards made to look like art from that time. The UI is easy to get used to, and very helpful. As usual, the battles are very stratigic, and fun to watch you legionares slay barbarians in droves. Dont let the odds fool you. Ive won battes Ive should have lost many a time, and im terrible at battles! Naval battle are the best. I actually enjoy them. They are short, lasting 2 - 5 minutes on average. I could go on and on, but in short, battles are amazing an work really well.  Campaign: The Campaign map looks great. It actually feels like you are looking over the world. The campign is fun, but takes some getting used to. the UI is very confusing, but once you figure it out, it flows well. Diplomacy is strange, like I'll be Rome, and a tiny facton wont want to do a non agressive pact. but once you bribe them with money, they comply. Wars work well, with new stances making it more stratigic then past total wars. Its hard to conquer other nations, but ROme wasn't built in a day!  Graphics: Very Very taxing. the reccomended specs are lies. i can hardly run this on high, much less very high, ultra, and extreme, and i have a very decent laptop. but, the game looks amazing. That's all i can say. It looks amazing.  Rome 2 has its flaws, but they are few and is a very good game and comes highly reccomended.",

Cons: Buggy siege AI(as is the case with most total war games). Occasional drops in frame rate. A mild and non-agressive AI(in most cases). Battle AI tends to get bland and repetitious. Mostly the same tactics. (by this I mean blobs) The DLCs have very little replay value and tend to be poorly made. Pike. Boxes.

Of course it has some flaws just as every one of the previous TWs had, like very repeating animation (a lot of units from different factions fights and moves exactly the same way, however some of them, like greek hoplites could use phalanx and fight like they really did IRL, but the real romans military tactics is not illustrated in Rome2 accurately enough, said but true..), also the variety of battle maps is pretty low, naval battles looks too awkward (well, at least for me, but I am not a fan of TW naval battles at all, I usually use to just skip them). Also it's very annoying that you have no option to move your units on a global map or just hire them without a general. I personally have some feeling of a lack of technology developement, economical action and buildings functionality deepness - it's so easy to imagine some additional features and functions for these aspects that could make the game more deep, interesting and historically accurate, however the developers decided to make it just more simple, that's why the game becomes a little boring on a global map. That is also pretty weird that you are not allowed to check the '4 turns for a year' option by default. It is available as a custom mod in a workshop, however your agents become overpowered with this modification.  Overall, Rome2 is really a very atmospheric and enjoyable game. Battles are so spectacular, graphics looks awesome. It has a large modding potential, just take a look on the workshop. UI is more logical and useful, comparing with the previous games of the series. There are a lot of units and factions, that makes Rome2 a very replayable game. Diplomacy works even better than I expected. A lot of multiplayer options..  If you bought the game just as soon as it was released and you was dissapointed by all these bugs, game balance and AI issues, let me give you a piece of advice not to do so and wait until a game is fully tested by the early-buyers and polished by the developers with the early-buyers's feedback help. It's just as simple as that - if you don't want to be disappointed with a game you are waiting, just dont buy it too early and wait for some patches to make it finished, developers nowadays usually don't release completely finished games.  Also I wanted to say that SEGA sells the 'blood and gore' DLC separately not just because of it's greed, but eventually mostly for avoiding the original game from getting the mature rating.",

Now I have finally started to play the game and I have really enjoyed it - but I should note that I am not playing the purely 'vanilla' version of Rome II. After much reading I decided to download Toons' 'All in One Mod' for Rome II and it is really good. So please note that my subsequent comments are coloured by having played the mod.  Rome II does some things really well compared to previous Total War games (of which I have played most of them). I really like how the Auto Resolve for battles has been addressed, whereby it shows you the likelihood of victory based on the battle stance you take (aggressive, balanced, defensive) and also the percentage of troops you will have left for each choice.   The enemy AI is also well balanced and fights well in the field battles as well as on the diplomatic side of things. I really liked the addition of the Pros and Cons listed by each faction for why they like or dislike your nation. This made it much simpler to determine why they might reject an offer as opposed to past TW games where it was infuriating to be rejected and not understand why.   Having naval support during battles is a nice touch also and builds upon the naval warfare introduced in Empire, even if it's still quite clunky at times.  The Spies and Heroes/Champions are also much better designed in this game than the previous Rome and Empire. Now you can assign perks to the individual agents and level them up as you desire. I remember thinking in Empire 'What is the point of the spy! His chances of assassinating someone is barely 20%!' Now I have used them to great effect in weakening cities, garrisons and travelling armies. A great improvement all round!  There is also much more opportunities to conduct war in the political arena with assassinations and securing promotions etc. This has been greatly expanded from Empire and the previous Rome and adds a broader dimension to the game.  One thing that I don't like so much is the way armies can be split and travel. It is impossible (as far as I can see) to transport troops from one army to another unless the General travels with them in tow. This may well be more thematic but I feel that it hinders the game play a bit.   I also completely disagree with CA's decision to make this such a DLC heavy title/franchise. Some additional campaigns and so on are fine as added DLC to me but adding a Blood and Gore mode and other minor aesthetic changes that were already in the game files and just required 'activation' is ridiculous. Companies need to stop selling us half-completed games!   But all in all I thoroughly recommend Rome II - especially if you seek out a mod like I did.   8/10",

It's not perfect by a long stretch; true to the series it can be too easy (especially as Rome) and upping the difficulty doesn't make the AI smarter, it just lets them cheat with more money and better stats, 1 year per turn means your generals drop dead from old age before you've even had a chance to properly level them up, the AI will sometimes not attack you during sieges or tire its units out by running them all over the map for no reason and the performance is pretty awful for a game of its age, although I did find upgrading my Radeon drivers to Crimson 16.9.2 boosted my framerate by nearly 20fps!

At this stage this is neither a pro or a con, simply an observation.  The game is great, with mechanics resembling those in the earlier games, i.e. Sieges with rams, catapults, etc.. However i feel like some mechanics are missing that could have been utilized, such as the momentum of charges causing troops to penetrate the opposing lines rather than just form a linear front, and individual soldiers having individual fights rather than seemingly mass attacks, both features which were present in Shogun 2, but not in Rome 2.   While some mechanics are missing, this game is still fun nonetheless. Recommended, though i would personally wait for sales to purchase the DLC (or even the base game itself). ",

They were significant bugs, mostly from the A.I. that would render the game almost unplayable in certain circumstances. Since then however, Creative Assembly has launched 9 patches and made significant changes to the game requiring another look at it to judge it in it's current state. In my humble opinion, it now has been fixed to the point where more than just the die hard Total War fans can enjoy.  Combat on the battle map is enjoyable to watch, and difficult enough the personal skill and managing your troops can over come the odds. With the graphics turned way up you can sometimes find yourself zooming in to watch the almost cinematic mass combat in detail, realizing you should have been giving orders because you lost some troops to a cavalry charge behind your lines. The battle itself feels like the old Total War, but where most of the changes take place is on the campaign map. There, you can find changes in the old Total War formula, like managing provenances comprised of multiple cities making late game management more bearable. Most of these are welcome changes, and it's good to get a new slightly new spin on old mechanics.   Rome II is one of the best looking Total War games out to date, but you'd be either lucky or rich to have a machine capable of running it smoothly with high settings. There are still some graphical errors here and there, even when you turn everything way down. You can see they are still trying to work out some issues both visual and with the poor pathing for the A.I. but at least things have gotten better since release. My final gripe about the game is the unintuitive way of showing the tech tree and traits that your hero characters can take and how insignificant that some of those traits are. There are some that you just wouldn't choose and don't even make sense.  In the end, if you haven’t picked up this title yet and you are either a history buff or like strategy games it's worth giving it a try (or a second try if you jumped ship on release), but I would wait for a steam sale.",

CA and nvidia both claim its in the others hands to move forward with the sli compatibility so both are doing bugger all as far is ive heard  paided unit dlc packs with 5 new units in them- just wow CA really. massive kick i nthe balls from what i concidered an oldschool, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t company. expecially annoying after i played 40 quid for the preorder anyway and then want 3-5 quid a pop for stuff thats avalible free from the workshop.     if you have played total war from empire onwards then would will love this this  if you are still hanging on from before that then things will annoy the crap out of you but you will still love it  ",

Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best games I have played hands down. I had heard a lot of issues with it when it first came out, but in the Emperor edition I have found nothing of issue. I am a huge history fan, with Rome being my favorite, so this game really hit all the sweet spots for me. Historically its pretty accurate, units, buildings etc. are all excellent.  Gameplay wise there is a bit of a learning curve. Tactically its very satisfying to command an army against odds the computer says you will not win and wipe the floor with the invading force. I particularly enjoyed taking command of artillery units and turning the tide in battle. I still haven't quite figured out the happiness/order formula in the game, so every now and then I had a wave of slave revolts to contend with. That always seemed to be when I was militarily reaching so perhaps its a byproduct of not tending to my conquered settlements as much as i should have. On a side note i liked the nod that gave to HBO's Rome series in the skill cards you can assign generals (XIIIth !!!!!!!!).  Overall I am really happy with the purchase I made. This is a game I'll be spending a lot of time with I can already tell. The DLC is fun if not game changing. Caesar in Gaul is a fun romp through the Gallic Wars. The only critique I can give on it is that its just a larger campaign map for the Gaul area. The Roman Civil War is fun to play (shots out to Octavian), and overall its worth the buy when on sale.  All in all I'd rate IX/X  ROMA INVICTA",

Each playthrough may present similar refelections of previous games, however, they will not/not be 100% the same, especially if you focus on a different strategy to achieve your goals. The end game is a bit, incomplete, since I last played, however, this seems to have been remedied (think: Civil War's occurring - updates to the game have addressed this issue with notifiers and measures tracking the progress of potential upheaval).   I will add, I have never beaten this game, despite my many hours logged (estimated 600 hours), playing. This is how I prefer it. It is a great game to pickup where you can become engrossed in the gameplay and just veg. Additionally, you can pause your game and come back to it (save/load etc.) if matters of life take precedent. Very immersive historical journeys based on numerous cultures of the time. There are certainly con's I can write about but, overall, the game is a testament to strategy gaming history and I would highly encourage anybody interested in world history / anthropology / strategy / political science et al. subject matters to pick up this game, if not to engage in some aspect therein and obtain a different perspective.",

Especially in siege battles they seem to be completely lost  as soon as u have gates and a wall around u. It has been gettin better with the latest patch  but it's still awful   -For people playin a TotalWar title for the first time, this game is overwhelming at first  and quite complex       I recommend Rome II cause I'm quite optimistic that patches will follow and if they manage to get the AI right and add some more Multiplayer options like in Sohgun 2, it'll be the awesome game it seems to be at first glance. Even if CA&amp;Sega won't manage to, there is a really nice modding community who, I believe will publish even alot more improvements and fixes than they already have, which makes this game worth buying.",

For some reason this game has one hundred different kind of issues about crashing, which is something that never happened to me before with a game in steam. Personally, when I first decided to play it, I could not pass the first loading screen until I fixed it doing research, now, my game FREEZES and stops working randomly in battles.  2. Seriously, we do really have to pay MORE money just to play a different faction and show blood in the screen? what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is that?  3. I find the game to be extremely EASY, even at maximun difficulty (at least the vanilla campaign).

I played the original Rome and Medeval after playing this for a few days and found that I just didn't like em as much, although Medeval is way better than Rome I and is actually pretty good in of itself in spite me likeing Rome II more. The only issues I have had are mostly blue screens that I believe are caused by F***ed up drivers in my system considering my rig well exceeds the recommended requirements. Though I will also agree that the A.I. is very 50/50 when it comes to intelligent decisions but it could be worse. The other big complaint is actually my favorite thing about the game, the politics aspect, I LOVE IT! Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this game and I give it a 8.5/10 using my fancy rating system :)  EDIT: After playing other Total War titles, namely Empire: Total War and Medieval II: Total War, I would say that I'd instead give this game a 6.5/10.",

Its hugely enjoyable to conquer and ally with adjacent factions. I would therefore recommend it. However, there are some issues. Playing on 'Normal' mode during an entire Sparta playthrough, the campaign ai very rarely besieged any of my cities, if at all. Also, beyond maybe the 50th turn or so, if you have managed your cities to a reasonable standard, you will start to steamroll the other factions. Its far from game ruining to easily destroy factions &amp; armies late game but if perhaps one or two other factions grew like I did, a hugely interesting war might have broken out.  Another grievance that I have is that defeated ai armies -which survive huge defeats with only a few men- return the very next turn with full stack mercenary armies. This often leads to the death of your previously victorious, but wounded, army in the city/lands that you just won. Especially during the early stages of a campaign. Again, not game ruining but these incidents put your faction and progress back considerably, as rebuilding takes time and money.  The game does look stunning though in my opinion. And the variety of units are generally well balanced. Cavalry beats swords, spears beats cavalry etc.   To conclude, Rome 2 is a good buy and a game that will keep you entertained for many hours. I would however reccomend that you purchase the game during a Steam Sale, like I did. This way, you can purchase the base game &amp; all of the (ludicrous) DLC for around £40.   I do have some things that I feel should be addressed. Namely:  * Most ***PAID*** factions could do with having their rosters expanded. I paid good money to use them. Why should I be limited to how I can use their tools?   * Bring in the option to manually enter in a amount of $$ that is offered during negotiations. What if I dont want to offer $2000? Especially when $200 would do the trick.  * Siege path finding can be an issue at times. Notably when units are on walls.",

The Ai, despite all there flaws, is actually smarter than in previous total war games. For example, they actually try to flank me now and don't just engage my army head on like a bunch of fools and they actually pursue democratic relations with me. There are also many different factions that really help diversify things in the campaign (though unfourtuantely you cannot be all these different factions as of yet...).  Now back to the problems of Rome II. The draw distance has problems, for example there could be a tree only a couple of meters away that wouldn't be visible to me unless i decided to move that direction,though I wouldn't really say this is a problem. My biggest problem with this game is how clunky the Ai can get, sometimes they can be really tough oppents other times they can just sit there while all my units just desrtoy their's, and it's really frusturatiing when I'm defending a city and the Ai doesn't move up and attck but just sits there for the whole game.  Overall I give Rome II an 8/10  Rome has a few issues, but isn't as bad as most people think it is and is actually quite enjoyable if your a fan of most strategy games.",

But now a few months later i have to say the whole game has gone from being a beta to a full working game.  Though they were wrong to release the game too early as i think it spoilt a great game for many of us. Me included. The game has only improved greatly with the addition of each patch.   The Good:  But now, thankfully its up and running how it should. With many varied armies, units, options and hours of gameplay. Its living up to its predecessors. Also the additon of steam workshop support has done wonders for the game and i would highly reccommend anyone who doesn't mod the game to take a look. As there are some brilliant mods that further enhance the game and make it even better.  The new army experience i feel is a great idea as it allows you to really turn an army into a specific fighting force allowing you to cater to any taste for any battlefield.  The new graphics really are amazing and allow you to view ancient battlefields like never before!   The Bad:  Magic powers and stupid capture points...   One huge disappointment with this game for me personally is the lack of a family tree as i feel this has massively reduced that immersive feeling that a more traditional total war gamer, like me, has come to expect. Seeing your family grow, have children, get married and have actually interesting traits. The new traits are awfully flawed and the fact you can only have a few further destroys immersion.  Generals now feel far too meaningless as they die after only a few turns and then can be replaced instantly. I remember having to work for hours to turn a general into a great leader and then when his death would inexorably arrive it would cause a blow to my army and me on a personal level after the time and effort i had invested in the individuel.   Overall i really like this game, i am a massive total war fan i have played since the original shogun demo was released many years ago! But i feel like there have been many great elements removed and many added that just take from what is a brilliant game.",

No matter how they are going to patch this game, it is still worthless to players.

This game and CA have lost the faith and love of thousand of fans which include me. As they also lost the faith of their previous lead of game project and writer as well.   Rome 2 is a boring game no matter how beautiful its graphic is. It has no soul and isn't worthwhile to play with my valuable times, which is more important than the money I spent on this game.

For the most part, all the AI factions do is make absurd demands of you, move their haphazard armies around aimlessly, and declare war on each other and not bother pursuing that war. They will NEVER declare war on you. You can have 8 full armies surrounding their capital and they still will not declare war.   - Battle AI is the absolute worst of any Total War game ever. You can find plenty of Youtube videos displaying the deranged idiocy of the game's battle AI, but the single worst offense I see and KEEP SEEING is the ♥♥♥♥ING FLAGS. In siege battles, there have always been flags you could capture to win the battle quickly, but the AI in this game is OBSESSED with the flags, to the point where they will rush PAST your army, NOT attacking, letting your troops kill them en masse without your side suffering any casualties, JUST SO THE AI will get at that ♥♥♥♥ing flag.  - Battles are a total waste of time. It takes a long while to load up huge battles, and due to the insane speed at which units move, kill, break and rout, huge battles consisting of 5,000 men or more almost always end in 10 minutes or less. For all the money that went into motion-capture for the units fighting, you almost never see any of it because the units don't ever bother holding formation, and end up cramming into one another in barely coherent blobs.   - Incredibly awful gameplay mechanics.  - 1 turn per year means your generals die of old age long before they even begin to become famous or notable. Every building adds tons of squalor, or takes tons of food. The only way to not have constant rebellions in your home province is to garrison every city with a full stack, or to NEVER upgrade your buildings past level 2, save for temples and farms.  - Worse, cities can only build 2-4 buildings in them, depending on their size. And since all cities are linked via the Province System in-game, an unhappy populace on the island of Crete can have your fabulously wealthy and well-provided for populace in Athens unhappy and on the brink of revolution. - No family trees, no families period. You no longer have any investment in named characters at all, much like Empire Total War. If your general dies, he's automatically replaced by a completely random nobody you've never seen before. You can't manage families or dynasties, and you may as well not even bother getting attached to any of them or boosting their skills since they'll die of old age.   I could go on but the list of its problems goes on so long. The state of the game now is literally one where there is nothing positive to be said beyond 'it looks pretty'",

Yes, the woefully inefficient pace of Rome II after every single turn is the biggest culprit. But there aren't enough fair battles to break up the normal pacing, and those that happen aren't compelling. Developing provinces and economics feels more like tossing a dart at a board than counting down the turns until your shiny new building. The enemy artificial intelligence is practically pacifist, which is extremely odd for a game called “Total War.” Perhaps what's most dismaying about Total War: Rome II is that it doesn't seem salvageable—its problems are as much conceptual as they are pragmatic. I can't imagine a patch or expansion with a smaller map, even though that would be the biggest possible help the game could get. In most grand strategy games, the motivation to play “just one more turn” is the most appealing part. In Total War: Rome II, “just one more turn” is a threat. The good:  its pretty The bad: Tactical battles are messy and buggy strategic mode devoid of instresting decisions Ai is horribly unagressive The ugly: Clicking the “end turn” button and waiting... and waiting.... and waiting... Verdict: ip it. Shogun II is better in every respect, as are several mods for the original Rome: Total War.",

Sending heavy infantry after my light cavalry, positioning troops without shields right before my walls manned with archers and slingers, not using siege weapons such as rams or positioning ladders at my walls just to retreat when they are in position or best of all, standing outside my walls doing nothing (for 60 minutes) are only some of the things I experienced. The campaign AI seems much smarter, the reputation system is understandable and the non-agression-pacts are quite helpful. The province system is quite a challenge when your empire grows because if someones unhappy they ♥♥♥♥ your whole province and everything in range. The diversity of the factions is quite good. Playing rome feels very different to playing the nomadic tribes and such. Downside is that the AI-turns take FOREVER! Which is annoying as hell. DLC packs seems extremly overprized in my opinion.

I loved TW:Medieval, TW:Rome, TW:Medieval2 and I wasn't even that ♥♥♥♥♥y about TW:Empire being a buggy disaster at first. TW:Shogun 2 on the other hand was a disaster that I couldn't stand. Pre-ordered and ended up putting in maybe 40 hours max, haven't installed it since, Total Waste of money IMHO.  Now if you take into account my position, what I say about Rome 2 might be a bit more clear. Is it better than TW:Rome1? At launch it wasn't even on the map. It was down in Shogun land, and prone to crashing as well. Now, with all the patches, and the *right mods* I'd say its fought its way back onto the good side of the TW series. Its still watered down, and its still more about shiney helmets than actual gameplay, but with the year or so of modding and patching its a game worth playing. I'd rank it about even with TW:Empire, depending on the mods and how stable it seems to be at any given time. My view of the series is esstentially this: Rome &gt; MTW2 &gt; Rome2 = Empire &gt; a kick in the nuts &gt; Shogun2.  tl;dr: Used to be utter trash, essentially Romanized version of Shogun, now (with mods) its decent, but about as buggy as Empire was in its later iterations. Without mods its still buggy, but also un-fun. Avoid the overpriced DLC.",

Rome 2 has found a place in my heart above any other total war game and indeed mabye any other game i currently own, and im not new to the total war franchise at all. mabye its partly due to my love of the time period its set in and the factions set around it, but i could only love the game this way if it amazed and engrossed me to a point where i think it did such a amazeing part of human history justice. historicly and in gameing standerds.  Rome total war 2 is a brilliant stratagy game full to the brim with action and realism. it allows you to comand the armys of a wide selection of cultures and factions, building them into a mighty empire building force on the gigantic european/asian/african map, or customise them and select there oposition and battlefield on custom game. this game has limitless opernunity for hours ans hours of addicting gameplay and realistic story telling from the perspectives of so many fations. you get so engrosed in the faction you have to lead through golden ages, times of hardship and dark ages (not brought on by the game, but by the endless amount of complex political, military and diplomatic situations you can find yourself in) that you actualy start to care for your people in the sence of sorrow at looseing a city and pride as you repel an invasion. No two campaigns or battles are the same and all exstreamly fun. You can go all out for global domination with little politicts like Rome, or you can take it slow and build yourself into prosperouse economy and tradeing hub like Carthage, but both require a bit of everything to survive. One of my favorate things about his game is the citys. you can literaly build your citys from the ground up balenceing your citys money, food prodution and happyness to keep your empire exspanding and spreading your superior culture as ocupied foreighn citys change over time to asimulate your cultures building style. every build you build and upgrade is shown in the city itself, thats why i like to make important citys into beacons of culture by dotting them with beutiful temples and fountains.   although i do admit this game was near unplayable at release, but was bugs me is that the comments from that time continue to effect the games success and reputation. i will tell you now that this is almost a completely different game that they reviewd and they would most likely change there mind if they gave it a go again. although the only complaint i would ever have is the pay walls for certain factions (the worst of all being the greek factions). because there are not enough bugs left to realy count as an issue in this game.  SO! overall i would give this highly recomended game a 9/10! and i dont give out points like spare change. it has earned every one.",

Pretend to be Julius Caesar, if he lived 400 years and conquered everything in Europe, North Africa, and the middle east (which he basically did). Be Carthage, and burn Rome to the ground. Play as some country noone has ever heard of and bring everyone else to their knees with your awesomeness.  No, it won't always be challenging. There will be times when you feel like it't too easy to win battles, because you crawled too far ahead of everyone else.

I also really really really miss the old style dynasty tree and the way that items and followers worked.

Simply put there is no challenge what so ever when playing the game. Even after all the patches that have come out which I wont deny have made a lot of good changes, but just nothing significant. When you play you will notice that you only need to capture roughly four settlements and then the game is a piece of cake from there. The enemy doesnt upgrade its units and it ususally focuses on only a few types of start of the game units. It is very rare that a faction will declare war on you and if by some act of god they do then they will never attack you. Also when in battle the computer still does the same charge head on into you and die strategy. We were promised a intelligent enemy AI in battle, but we didnt get that at all. The game is just not as in depth or challenging as the previous titles and it's a shame. Save your money and hopefully the company has learned a lesson and on their next game they bring out they will go back to their old roots.

This game is starting to bud, to the point where I can actually recommend it to others.",

Key ones are for battle dynamics, naval battles, and campaign AI. Otherwise it is a complete POS. I've played since old Medieval 1 and Rome 1 so I know what I'm talking about. I'm not some noob fan who jumped on the bandwagon a few months ago. CA and Sega killed much that was good with the franchise here, in what should have been their finest hour. Instead they rushed out an alpha product to make money from a greedy PR marketing campaign all the while holding back necessary 'updates' in favor of stupid DLC so they could get more $$$.  Edit: After sitting on this for awhile, things are better. I'm going to say I'm neutral now, but only because of the availability of mods and the work done with Emperor Edition. I still think a review should be based on a base game, and the base game is still lacking. You still need a lot of mods to make things right. Base play speed is still wayyyyy too fast and the squalor system is garbage and needs to be modded. Basically vanilla TW:RII sucks, but mods save the game to a point of enjoyableness.

In their well-intended but poorly executed attempt at updating the Total War experience, Creative Assembly took great leaps backward with questionable game design and poor user interface compared to the recent Shogun 2.   It's painfully obvious that Creative Assembly and their SEGA overlord rushed this release. What's more despicable is that they thought they could get away with winging it by hyping the game with PR full-court press, rather than focusing their resources and already limited time on testing and refining the game. It saddens me to report that their ploy worked: buoyed by the overwhelming hype and the original Rome Total War's reputation/nostalgia, Rome 2 sold like hotcakes despite not being remotely close to living up to its true potential and being a worthy successor to the original Rome. And the truly depressing part is that despite being so disappointed and frustrated by this half-♥♥♥♥♥ release, I'd still play the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game... because at the end of the game, this is still Rome 2. Think of the game as a magnificently built palace, but filled with atrocious interior design and cut-rate furnishing. Hey, it's still an impressive palace from the outside, and the stuff inside you can fix on your own or get someone else to do it for you. Would you pass up on this palace? I didn't.  EDIT: Multiplayer Co-Op desync issue is STILL not fixed. This same problem has been in the past TW games... CA still can't figure out how to fix this.",

Now, while reading other reviews, I've noticed a lot of complaints about the AI. AI has been a problem in almost every Total War game that I've played, from Rome on up. That said, the modding community has realised a number of mods to try and rectify this. Those with low end rigs should probably wait, but even if you have a midrange laptop that's fairly new, it will run. It won't be pretty, but it will run. In hindsight, would I have paid full price to get Rome 2 on launch day? Probably not. I probably would have waited for a sail and grabbed it cheap. That said, it is still a fun and solid game. UIf you have played a Total War game before, get it. If not, I would recomend jumping into the series in a different game first, before getting into this one. So I would say it is a solid 7.3/10.",

In Rome Total War you could look in pleasure as a Principes would cut down 10 peasants, in Shogun you could watch your katana samurais cut down enemy yashigaru and so on - in Rome the whole battle is a mess and it is a blob of units that retreat or the battle finishes in no time.

It can be very addicting, and provides users with some variation in victory conditions based on faction, families/dynasty, and victory conditions (3 types for each faction). The game implements a 'politics system' which is used to provide you with short-term goals in order to establish your empire. Completing the goals provides a substantial financial boost, but othwerwise serves very little purpose. I would have liked to see a stronger focus on the specific characters in the diplomacy / politics section of the game. Currently, in the primary campaign you will find renown characters and generals such as Hannibal Barca, but they do not have any distinquishing features from any other general/character that would inspire you to use them besides their name. However, this criticism has been addressed by CA in the Ceasar in Gaul campaign which makes faction leaders unkillable and provides them with special abilities unique to the character. I'm hoping to see this appear in the Grand Campaign as well, but who knows.  There are also a fair number of mods released for the game, so if there is any small issue you have with the game you can easily check the workshop for changes, fixes, or extra content.   Many users complain about bugs and errors in the game. Personally, I have experienced very few bugs besides a few AI problems and occasionally experiencing issues with my GUI. But for the most part these problems can be fixed by reloading the campaign or they were addressed by CA in recent patches.   For users that already own the game, CA has actually given most of the DLC to users at no cost. Having pre-purchased the game, the only DLC I paid for was the Blood&amp;Gore content. If you purchase the game now you will have to pay to purchase the latest DLC, but maybe wait to see how much you enjoy the game for yourself, before deciding to spend the extra eight dollars to play the extra factions.  Overall, my experience has been very positive. The game provides amazing visuals and exciting, addicting gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone, especially to those who are already fans of the Total War games. Rome II is by far the most exciting and dynamic Total War game created. If you can put up with a few bugs here and there, this game is definitely worth purchasing.",

Only other complaint is that you have to pay for so many parts of the game. I personally would of rather paid more for the game and unlock these features. But overall this game is great it combines The Civ games with classic RTS games wonderfully the campaign alone will keep you busy for days on days, while the multiplayer is also really great.",

The Caesar in Gaul campaign pack is good, and the upcomming Hannibal At The Gates hopefully will be too--given the subject matter and CA's handling of CiG, I doubt it will be a disappointment commensurate with the main game was at launch. The other DLC's are a bit more debatable, though, so I'd wait to get them until after you've had some time in the game and then make an informed decision on whether playing as Sparta or Syrian Elephants are worth the money. Ignore the hatedom--there are some valid points being made, but it's mostly just whining and showing off the hate boner. Most of the reasonable people who dislike the game just don't bother taking the time to hate it.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The game plays quite well and even isn't so bad on a lower-end pc, although it works significantly better on medium to high-end. It is fun to play and looks good, and despite there still being problems the support and communication from CA puts that of EA to complete shame. The game is relatively easy to mod and has a good modding community, also the new modding tools work well.   -This game could of done with a new engine but still works well. -It had a bad start but has been improved. -There are good updates and a good support team. -The modding is relatively easy and there is a good community. -Most importantly though, I find it fun to play.  -One big thing missing for me was the connection to the generals. I wanted a family tree, the ability to marry people properly, to let generals have children and get to name them. I wanted to make choices on how they grew up like in games like crusader kings 2, although not in as much depth. I then wanted events when they were older, more traits and a character I could make my own. Maybe I wanted too much, but instead I got boring pointless characters who seemed to make no difference and were basically expendable. If a modder could make this then the game could go up by a whole point for me. Of course not everyone wants this much so don't let it stop you buying this game. In fact this game can be fun so can be a good buy, but not everyone likes this kind of game so if your a previous total war player, this game may be somewhat disappointing but could still be fun. If your new to the series, watch some vids and see if you like the look of the game then make the decision.  Overall it has had a bad start but is constantly being improved (Unlike SimCity which is still bad). It is fun to play and I would definately recommend it.  So I give it a 7.5/10 since it could of been an 8 or even 9 for me, and may be given time, but isn't quite yet. It had potential but isn't there yet.  Also I want incendiary pigs. :D",

I think CA have done a great job fixing the game up.  Things to be noted -The AI is just as good, if not better than the other total war games, but nowhere near human. -The new province system is really is great, it adds much more strategy top the game. -The Roman era is the best :) -The modding community adds much more to the game allowing more hours of gameplay -As with all total war games, it is VERY replayable, due to everything being open to you. -The new abilities that can be used during battle are very good and add strategy to the game (also making it a little unrealistic) -The graphics, unit models and animations are much better than previous games so the battles look very cool to watch with the new cinematic camera which zooms the camera to the point of view of a unit (as if you are sitting on the shoulders of one of the men.

I certainly am biased towards this game due to my interest in Roman History but well...  The game by itself might not be the most historically accurate but with a litte help *cough* DEI *cough* this can be changed easily.  Gameplaywise it isn't very complex, and like the older games basically: Build stuff, earn money, build troops kill stuff althoug Civil War and improved food mechanics are making it a bit more complex than older installations of this series.  Some people like it simpler, but if you should want abit more complexity I can only point to the above mentioned mod again which (re-) introduces seasons, suppy and other stuff to the game.  In terms of graphic itts certainly solid. Games like TW: Warhammer or Attila do certainly outmatch it but it is in no way ugly.  So. While I wouldnt have recomended it in the beginning I would now certainly do that!",

Creative Assembly have been trying their 'best' to fix the issues this game had but they fail to adress the underlying issues that caused many to find Rome II below par. It had a lot of potential as a great new concept for the Total War series however Creative Assembly has proven to us that they no longer deserve as much respect as they once did with previous games such as Shogun 2 and Napoleon.  The constant flow of new DLC is not what the game needs, but for CA to revise the current UI and replace it with a better and easier to use one. They had it right with Shogun 2, they should not have changed this.  Good things about this game include things such as the voicing and unit detail, aswell as the new concept of provincial townships. However the negative outweighs the positive by a long shot.  The game lacks so much depth and challenge it is not at all fun for those who enjoy strategies in the first place - To take up the challenge and outsmart the opponent using their intellect. Sadly Rome II fails to live up to this challenge as it seems the AI resembles the mind of an 8 year old newly introduced to strategy.  The multiplayer option has also gone backwards, the maps are bland, and the UI is very poor. I would not recommend this game for those who enjoyed Shogun 2 or Napoleon Total War, as you will be sorely dissapointed shortly after trying the game for a few hours.  And yet they still charged us the full price for something that was not even close to finished.",

Many people will moan about this game as being 'broken' but I for one have never had any real issue with it. People like to complain about a game for the sake of complaining but don't believe it. This game is more than worth the £30 (ninc dlc) and has given me (and continues to) many hours of fun.   There are issues with mechanics, I agree. It's far too easy for smaller, minor factions to instantly become huge because of the massive economy boost they get at the start of the game. It is however important to remember that this is not a historical simulator! If it was, you'd lose every campaign unless you play as Rome. The idea is to create a sandbox in a historical setting. This is something people like to forget, it is just a game, it's not a documentary.   I have never had an issue with battle mechanics, I've been playing it on Hard (not legendary though) since release and have found that this provides the best balance, The AI is beatable so long as you don't make a mistake but is capable of pulling off some decent manouvres. Sometimes the AI flounders a little, one thing I have noticed is that in a seige battle if you put ranged units on the enemies walls they will group their army right next to them, allowing you free reign to whittle them down with arrows, rocks etc. But it says more about the player than the game if you exploit this.   While some people don't like the way a land army can become a naval army, I find this feature perfect. In what way does it not make sense? Why bother to train a unit of hastati, and then place them on a boat when you already have a perfectly good unit of hastati that can just be placed on a boat whenever you need them to be. It is still absolutely worth investing in actual naval units because a heavy onager boat will destroy a transport ship in moments, so long as it is protected. At the moment it is admittedly too easy, it should cost a small amount of money to transfer onto boats (to cover the cost of building/purchasing the ships) for transports and it should also take 1 full turn to either embark or disembark, regardless of how many movement points an army or fleet has at the moment.  Diplomacy is somewhat broken, it goes from absurdly unfair in the beginning to becoming a cake walk within about 10 turns but again, it can be abused but only if you choose to abuse it.  Overall, excellent game - people need to stop moaning about it and try playing with a little restraint. The ones who hate the game the most are the ones who got bored, exploited it and then cry because their game was too easy and/or broken.  Peace.",

The game is ok but there are tons of small problems that it actually builds up to be a deal breaker. I think if you are a fan of the series you should get it end of story; just not at full price. Let it go down to $20 to get your money's worth out of it. There are so many things that should have been added almost directly out of Rome Total War to this installment of the game but they were not. One of the major issues for me is the very unexplained single player system. I have a hard time grasping how to manage anything to be successful. Shogun 2 was easily understood at first glance and was even easier as time went on. Rome 2 found a way to turn the series positives in to major no-no's. One of the most annoying is the unit cards displayed on the UI (Which if you have more than around 15 cards the ♥♥♥♥ing UI takes up almost 50% of your screen). Also the actions of units which should be displayed on their cards have been all meshed together into a strobe light of 'what the ♥♥♥♥s' and un-identafiable symbols. Units also in physical combat are still bugged in what I believe to be a major issue. Remember back in Rome 1 when 5 hastati would rush a Cartheage swordsman and that single swordsman unit would warp around that mass of troops? Not in Rome 2 all your units glitch into each other making 5 units look like 1 huge pile of ♥♥♥♥. This also happens when two units of oppisite teams rush each other, the following units run through all the units before them and reach the 'line' that the battle is taking place. One of the issues that bothers me the most is the world map and how cities can span the entire country and be sieged from what looks like MILES on the world map. Along with the advisers which by the way never ♥♥♥♥ing go away when you set the too in options only expand further onto your screen like a virus eating away at the game. Somebody needs to shoot my advisers because really they don't give any helpful advice ever. With so many other things I will leave it at this. Pirate, Play, and Rate it don't buy this now its a gamble you most likely will lose.",

The positive points are in my eyes, there is much more detail in empire building, i hear people complain about it a lot but its not just build and fight but also a lot more manage. The campaign map feels much more alive and its also quite a bit larger than the original rome. The concept of provinces is also really nice cause it gives u something to work towards, uniting a province. The battles are cool to although can become a bit cheesy at times, once u know the right setup for your legions and the right way to engage there isnt really a big challenge, but then again, i play on easy or normal and i havent made it past turn 70 in any campaign yet, so dont hold me on this one. The factions are pretty cool and original, although i think they couldve unlocked more of them, they all seem quite playable, but i guess thats future dlc content... Ive allready pointed out some lesser points, but as in most of my reviews my main negative point is kinda my own fault still, but the requirements are quite insane. i play EVERYTHING on low and on 1378x1024 and still i rarely get over 15 fps, its still quite playable, but its far from smooth. i feel at least i should be able to play this game with 30+ fps on lowest settings with a 2 year old 700 euro laptop. but thats on me i guess, if u have the system for it and can enjoy the beautifull graphics this game, along with its replay value, could well be a 10/10, so for me its a 9/10.

I personally find its combat fun, but it's relatively simplistic. I find the city- and empire-building to be sub-par, even compared to its predecessors. The 'RPG' elements they tried to add are a joke. Its politics and economics are nearly non-existent. Its faction and unit variety, always my favorite part of games, including Total War, just aren't there. The AI, as always, is bad.  If you're still interested and can pick the game up for cheap, I wouldn't blame you. But the amount of bad decisions and killed expectations is too much for me.

Total War: Rome II was not necissarily a let-down, but it didn't feel like it was much better than the old RTW.   The Good: -For those who care, the graphics in this are superb. The individuals who make up your units each have a different set of equipment / face. Their armor reflects in the sun, and the battles are vicious and breathtaking. -I enjoy the music and sounds used. When two armies clash, it sounds like a crunch of bodies. When your army is marching on the enemy, the screen shakes and the foot-steps of your unit thump in your ears. -New campaign map was pleasant, though some spots were hard to navigate through (IE: Looked like a route was open, but turned out to be an impassable area)  The Bad: -I've found the diplomacy in this title of the Total War series is somewhat off-balance. Some Grand Campaigns I've ran, I'll be able to make friends and enemies pretty evenly, somewhat to be expected. But on more than most (it seems to me), I'll have a nation declare war on me every turn.  -City management is hard to understand and control for beginners.   The Ugly: -DLC: I don't understand why something such as the Blood and Gore DLC wasn't included with the $59.99 sticker price.   Overall, I'd recommend it to fans of the Total War series, and anyone who enjoys massive armies clashing in a hectic melee.",

The developers seem to have removed all the strategy elements from the series by 'streamilining' everything. Economics, diplomacy and religion are all gone now in favour of a more simple, arcade-style affair that treats the campaign map as little more than a visual representation of where the next battle will commence, never giving much thought as to why you have to fight that battle in the first place. And then, when you do get to the meat of game, the strategic battle mode, you will find sub-standard AI that struggles to come up with any strategy other than 'direct charge' or 'stand still and wait to get pummled' depending on whether the AI is attacking or defending. Sure, the game looks great but I don't buy a strategy game because I like nice graphics, I buy a strategy game because I like strategy, an element sadly lacking in this 'streamlined' point-and-click adventure. Rome 1 was a shining beacon of gaming excellence, a yard stick by which all other historical strategy games should be measured, and this game simply does not measure up.",

Whenever one of your armies or fleets enters combat, you take command in classical real-time strategy manner. And most important: Rome II offers you to do this in 2-players coop.  Imho the concept is great. In the strategy part you manage your provinces, build buildings, recruit your army and do diplomatic stuff with other nations. You need to make sure that your forces don’t have to fight at too many fronts at the same time, take care of your finances and decide where to reinforce your armed forces with which kind of unit. In tactical combat you command exactly the units that you brought to this battle. No wild reinforcement spamming or tower rushing like in other real-time strategy games. No artificial balancing. You have to fight out whatever situation your strategic decisions have lead to. Basic combat principle is rock-paper-scissors: cavalry beats melee infantry -&gt; melee infantry beats spear infantry -&gt; spear infantry beats cavalry. Of course there are different version of each unit type (light, medium, heavy), ranged units (javelin men, archers), artillery, siege weapons, ships and even special units like wardogs and elephants (really bad ♥♥♥...). And combat is influenced by a variety of other factors, e.g.: - attacks in the flank or rear of a unit are quite effective - units have a morale, and if it drops too low (e.g. due to effective enemy attacks, or other friendly units already fleeing) the unit might not follow your orders anymore and flee - units fight better in formation - weather (e.g. during rain you can’t use flammable arrows/javelins, during fog you can hardly see what’s going on at the battle field)  All in all the game is really fun.

Fight animations and movements are superb, as if watching a battle from a blockbuster movie. Blobbing is non-existent (except for difficult pathfinding areas as expected). The arcade feel of the battles have been toned down significantly, with battles also lasting to the 20 minute mark at least, typically longer, on large battles.   The campaign is however still too easy even on hardest difficulties for the moderate player. A few hours in and you will be knocking over empire after empire. City development is interesting and lets you tailor each city economically and militarily to what would benefit you the most in relation to its surroundings and bonuses.  Graphics are just amazing. Optimization is no worse than any AAA title, however you will need a beefy PC to run decent frames on the max settings. Lower settings will work fine but you will miss out on a lot of exclusive animations and graphical features. Trust me, the difference between low and high are staggering. You will think you are playing a different game on each setting.  Glitches are few and rare. Co-op/online is stable.  There is no reason to skip over this game if you love huge, stunning, dynamic battles with a large variety of units and factions. Any lover of Total War will feel this is a good step in the right direction (at least on most features).  Don't worry about buying any DLCs though. They are a waste of money,",

Not only is it over-priced but it does very little other than unlocking a faction and adding a unit or two to each faction, hardly something warranting 8.00$ US when a full expansion for RTW was 20$ and changed the whole game landscape, whats worse is that its a never-ending stream of worthless expansions.

This game is probably worth $30, or $40 if you really love these games. But charging 20% more for so much less is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And the community has lost it's best modder, Darth, so no more DarthMods to really sharpen things up. Radious has done a good job I think, but the units are still too small, the ships still travel too small a distance, the battle maps are still as bland as the've been since CA went to the 3D world with the first Rome game, and I still really miss the stuff that was in those older games, like titles you could award to whoever you wanted, a real family tree system, and more interesting battle maps.   As usual, there's a good foundation here, but the continual abscense of cool features that were in previous games is just getting less and less forgivable. I know CA/Sega have been doing a good job churning out update to this game since launch, and while I think that is necessary and a good act of contrition, it really shouldn't be happening with a series this well established. The game should have had all the current content and more, working properly, at launch. The fact that it didn't, and still doesn't, AND still has that 20% price hike, it just nuts.",

Being the total war fan I am, this game is good, and I do enjoy it. However, there are a lot of things that really turn me off about this game and would say it is not worth 60 dollars. At its current state post patch, its maybe worth 35-45 dollars at max in my opinion.  That out of the way, lets talk about the good things. The campaign map is phenominal, it is probably the best map they have ever done next to empires. There are a lot of tool tips and a lot of factions we all know and love. The graphics are slightly enhanced and the game loads up in a bout 45 seconds which is record time for any of who you know what I'm talking about. (total war games are notorious for booting up after 2-5 minutes) Over all the game play is pretty smooth and the campaign UI is improved.  Now for the bad things. Theres an enormous amount of reported bugs, grant it, it has just literally been released so CA will surly fix a lot of them. But that is no excuse for the carry over bugs such as campaign desyncing. That has occured since shogun 2, it was announced, they know about it, and yet it hasn't been fixed in shogun 2 and not even fixed in this one. So good luck playing campaign with your friends. The battle AI are even dumber then before, most of the time you can camp at your spawn and pelt them with artillery until they die or you run out of ammo. The multiplayer factions seem half done to me, they put so much stock and power into rome that a good roman player can pretty much take on anyone. Rome has almost 2 times if not more units then any other faction. After that it seems like they threw in some default models, varies the stats, then slapped the name of the faction on front of the model. Thats not true for every faction, but I'm just using that as an example. They could have put just as much time into the other factions unit options as they did with rome, everyone feels slighted. Most of the other bugs reported though I have yet to experience.  That is a lot of bad things that I have said about Rome II. Now don't get me wrong, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME. Further into the game and after some more patches I'll probably rewrite this review. There are a lot of good things about the game and not enough bad things to detur me from playing it everyday. The purpose of the current review is to give anyone who even reads this an idea of the current state of the game from my view.",

Last but not least i am now unable to get past the launcher (even after I reinstalled the game multiple times and tried multiple methods found on google).

Your populations wil starve despite your developing food resources. You populations will revolt. Your armies will rot. It's just too overly done...or perhaps I don't feel like investing ages developing enough genious to tackle all of the stuff like politics etc. But really some of the stuff going on in the background, such as politics, is too much.

The game is still very buggy, with a siege AI that is pretty much ♥♥♥♥. I have a high end system, and this game gives me bad FPS on the battlefield. However, they are working to patch it.

Instead of sending a diplomat (like in the first one) instead you can go to diplomacy panel. - The units are more historically accurate than Rome 1. - Every agent, general and unit has their own rank and XP. You get to choose a new Skill for them ex: peacekeeper ( increase public order), or other skills that decrease the cost of recruit units etc... - When you move an army to sea they automatically get a fleet, so dont have to build them ships :)  Cons: - Some minor bugs.

The real time battles are a lot of fun with thousands of units engaged at any given time.  My biggest complaint is with the Campaign AI. It gets very predicable past the early stages. It doesn't feel like you are one nation among many, but more like the world revolves around you. I also feel the game doesn't bring enough originality compared to previous Total War games. There are a lot of small features (prisoners, politics, and diplomatic reputation to name a few) that are not fully fleshed out and feel gamey. I think veterans of Total War will notice these flaws more than newcomers.  So if you have been considering giving the Total War series a try Rome 2 is a great place to start. If you are a veteran of the series I will say that the game has been in a good state since roughly Patch 8 (current version is Patch 13).",

The diplomacy was mediocre at best.  They have fixed many of these things but I felt I wasted many hours playing a broken game that should have been better. The last good TW game was Medievel II. The developers need to go back to the basics. I may one day when I get bored with other games go back and give it another try but not anytime soon. For the next TW game, I will wait for a Steam sale. Never will I buy one full price again.   Lastly, all DLC is ridiculous. Most of these things came with the original Rome. The company has really gotten money hungry.

Hundreds of factions which are a chore to do diplomacy with, not that you can make any meanigful relationship with any of them anyway. A bunch of characters who are meningless, with traits that have no discernible effect. Heroes that are more like a mini dice rolling game than a hero. Generals that are completely anonymous.

Any improvment seems to dump you further in the ****.  And now the battles. The maps are irritating cramped messes. Waiting for reinforcement? Great. They all appear on the edge of the map in a way you cant select them. You get stuck in a corner with no way to maneuvre.

The immersive and expansive feel to the game dwarfs most all of its successors. Only Empire had as large or larger of a game screen/map... and it's launch went poorly, too. That is, if I am remembering correcty...  Gameplay is fairly standard for a Total War series. Fortunately, they have added a little flair in giving the units more individuality. They aren't all marching lock-in-step. Some of them trip, fall, get trampled, others react to it. For what this game is... it does it well.  And, for as many hours as I have sunk into it... both in Single and Multiplayer... it must really have some replayability. (Is that even a word?)  For my money's worth... good game to have. A great iteration in the Total War series...  A cautionary note... This game is very, very, VERY DLC intensive. In other words, the base game is fairly robust. But, if you would like more of the bells and whistles... and continue to see Creative Assembly extend the life of the product - DLC is really the only way to go.

I like strategy games but im often dishartened by just building units as fast as you can before your oponet does and just having more numbers to beat them. In this game you can have fewer numbers and still come out on top amd feel like you really did something. Add to this an economic system thats good, al the different factions and policies and deals you can make with them. Plus managing you empire and this is all before online multiplayer.

While the bugs were legendary and have lead to a lot of bad reviews, even though most are sorted after an infinite number of updates, I still don't like the game. For me it has lost most of what made the whole TW series enjoyable and is a prime example of not following the maxim 'If it ain't broken don't fix it'. As with the other 'II' game versions I was expencting something that built on the origional game with better graphics, better AI, more depth, but CA seem to have thrown the bath as well as the baby out with the bath water.   The game seems more superficial, with the general's being far less interesting and their characteristics being mostly meaningless (I still don't know what they do). Only being able to have troops with a general is new and a major pain. Being able to sdend out small contingents to raid the opposition's territory or subdue restless natives is no longer possible and I like having Generals promoted from the ranks. The whole population unrest thing means your progress goes at a snail's pace as you have to sit your generals and their armies in towns for ages waiting for the locals to get happier.   The actual battles aren't great either, with the AI often being rather stupid. The opposition will quite often stand there while you destroy them with missile weapons or attack piecemeal and get chopped to bits. Also why the hell considering this covers the sclassical era as well can't they do a proper phalanx, because no matter how hard you try, once you attack, your Hopolites, who are supposed to fight shoulder to shoulder, start running around on their own. A ten foot spear is no good against a two foot sword in one to one combat!  Looking at the mainly negative reviews for the new Sparta DLC has made me realise that CA are now just out to rip off a very large and loyal fan base by releasing games far too early and then padding them out with DLCs that have increasingly less content. Except for the Blood &amp; Gore packs, the Sparta DLC will be the first one I haven't bought.  My advice is if you want to play realistic battles and conquer the world without all the rubbish of having peasants chopping down trees and stuff, then buy any of the Total War games except this one!

The graphics are very very good, the in-game effects are excellent, I like what they have done with the politics and intrigue, although it still needs some work I think. Also, there is near to no cultural tolerance. If I attack a city with Latin culture and me myself be nomadic for example, They will hate me for it.

After the release, I was very disappointed in what I had purchased, and wondered what the $60 content was, as the game was not functional, at least not to standards equivalent to this. I found the first game had more value in playability at first. After the numerous fixes, the game is definitely worth checking out, but definitely not at selling price. I would say maybe 20-30 dollars. Tops. Given the Free Downloadable Content, it is worth checking out. Although the new expansion is not worth buying in honesty, there aren't that many changes to the game in that regard. If you really don't want to buy any Downloadable Content that isn't free, check out a mod for it.  The graphics is rather cartoony- that might be a set back.  The AI is improved to a certain extent, but by no means ingenious. The map is huge, and takes forever to finish a campaign. I have only beat the game once. I get bored too fast to continue playing. The multiplayer isn't that interesting to me, with exception to playing with friends. Outside that, the match up system is unappealing. I probably would give the game a 5/10. Maybe a 6. I am leaning more towards 5. That is being fair. It's an average game. Nothing really stands out other than it's flaws. I'll let you be the judge, if you desire to chance it.",

            "review_text": "With it's new exciting mechanics and graphical improvement, Rome II was destined to be (one of) the greatest strategy games of this generation. While not really being a bad game, as some metacritic rants would like you to believe, it certaintly didn't live up to it's expectations, and there are good reasons not to buy this game (or at least wait untill it's priced &lt;$10 in the sales) - especially for TW veterans.  For NEWCOMERS to the series this game can actually be quite good at most times. The setting is (still) great, and the graphics are fantastic. One of the major downsides is the questionable AI, which sometimes does a fair job defending itself - certaintly at the harder difficulties - but more often than not just sends small armies to their death or makes just plain stupid decisions in battle.  Most of the new mechanics, like the provinces on the campaign map, are intresting and make Rome II a fresh experience compared to other entries in the series, but some of them just don't work. As an example I'll point out the 'flag capture machanic'. It's a great system to have for the siege battles, and makes a lot of sense, but in 'normal' field batlles, it doesn't make sense at all, and, more importantly, leads to bad gameplay. How are you supposed to set up for an attack if you're bound to a flag in the field which you can't move before the battle? That being said, battles are still the action packed eyecandy they used to be, though they tend to be much shorter than in most other TW games. If you're new and would like to give RTW2 a try, I DO RECOMMEND it, especially since most of the infamous bugs at launch are fixed due to patches.  For VETERANS of the series, who've been following the series at least from Medieval 2 or the original Rome, the game is much less attractive. Much of the problems outlined in the previous section (mediocre AI, random mechanics) are much harder to cope with for TW veterans than newcomers, so the chance may very well be you don't like it that much. Sure, there still are some nice and interesting touches made here and there, like the different victory conditions (campaign), the expanded campaign map, and the generally much better graphics, but for most longtime fans, the rest is only annoyance. The most noteworthy flaws are: AI still needs improvement, Battles are way to short, Campaigns are - even at higher levels - quite easy (a problem largely caused by the forementioned AI), some new mechanics don't work well at all, Campaign map is enlarged (it now bears much resemblance to some of the RTW1 mods) but somehow feels more empty, especially with the system of provinces. If you must you can still buy it, but chances are you will enjoy RTW1 even more than RTW2.  In summary:  -if you're not that much of a TW gamer and/or you're in for a fresh strategic experience you should buy this game -if you are a veteran of the series you might be better of skipping this entry in the series, or at least making sure you don't pay the full $50 for this mediocre sequel to rome 1. final verdict: 6,5/10 ",

I have a tendency to get bored with vanilla total war games really fast. But I have played and still from time to time play Total War Rome with the Europa Babarorum mod (wich is excelent and highly recommendid). And recently the Europa Babrorum 2 mod was released for Total War Medieval 2 and thou it still isn't totally finished it's still a really good mod and in my humble opinion a more historical accurate and enjoyable experience.  But that said, Rome 2 has one great force and that is its narrative campaign. I enjoyed it a lot.

The management of armies, provinces, trade, diplomacy, faction politics, spies (&amp; champions &amp; dignitaries), all combine to make the experience the closest imperial simulation I've yet played. If you think you would've made a better Caesar than Ceasar, this is the game to prove or refute your claim. There is no other contender.  The tactical experience is above par, and I found it entirely satisfying, when I've had the time and inclination to spend on tactical command of a battle. The nice thing about that is every battle can be resolved by the AI. You will almost inevitably do better if you choose to command your armies yourself, but when the odds are 3:1 in your favor, it's usually carrying coals to... well, to Nero's Rome, at that point. Granted, my most recent tactical command gaming experiences involve mostly games where the tactical experience is the equivalent of rock, paper, scissors on a pretty backdrop (ahem, looking at you Endless Space... so disappointing...) so YMMV.  The tactical (and strategic) user interface is simplistic (in a good way) and relatively easy to navigate for how complex this game becomes. tactical combat management is very similar to my remembered experiences playing Sid Meier's Gettysburg! It would help if the controls for fine-grained unit management were outlined more clearly in the tutorial, but a few moments searching the in-game encyclopedia's table of contents led me to the right section. I wish the tactical management system were a bit more refined, but the dizzying array of formations covers most out-in-the-open situations when battle does not occur in a settlement. It becomes more difficult to accurately place and orient units in closer spaces, but having served in the National Guard, I can assure you that real life isn't all that far from art in this case. All-in-all, having played the tutorial campaign and secured the entirety of the Italian peninsula as the Junii party in the Roman faction main campaign, I have no significant complaints regarding the tactical management.  If you like strategy gaming, love playing any CIV game (or Endless Space, Endless Legend, GalCiv, etc...) on a massive map, and like the ability to play a different game every time, this game is for you. The main campaign alone allows (even without DLC) you to play as widely ranged factions as the Iceni or the Seleucids and many more. The DLC nearly doubles the amount of playable factions, each having their own tailored victory conditions and inherent starting difficulty ratings. (Because of the complex nature of the game, it is difficult to estimate from one game to the next how the difficulty will vary, and I suspect my first game has become rather more difficult than it needed to be due to some early diplomatic blunders. Must remember to fire my foreign minister. Oh, wait, that's me...) In short, the designers of the game were clearly well aware of the Butterfly Effect, so don't make the mistake of assuming that the diplomatic game is as simple as bribing the people you like. Even that small action makes others change their views of you. This is no Civ diplomatic engine.  TL;DR - if you like grand strategy with decent but not overwhelming complexity, this is well worth your time.",

I am one of the players who bought the game from release and played it since, it has improved, I think alot of people are still rightly mad at the release condition so they review it negatively. Creative Assembly post regularly on the forums letting players know what they have been up to with the incoming patches, and try to take in the feedback they recieve. I can't remember the last developer to patch a game 7 times in 4 months.  On release this game was 6/10 at best, now I give it a 8/10 but still improving. Whilst playing it now, I am starting to get the old feelings of Rome1, which is good. Also, am I the only one who loves the music???",

            "review_text": "Brace yourselves, ladies and gents.  Now, finally, over a year after release, Total War: Rome 2 is ready for public consumption. It's an occasion so momentous that Creative Assembly have commemorated it with a whole new edition, the aptly-named Emperor Edition. Presumably it means Emperor of the Botched Releases but to be fair, I haven't checked into this.  Before we get into the review proper, it's time for a history lesson more violent and terrible than the period the game in question seeks to recreate. It's 365 days ago. The dusty wasteland of the historical RTS genre languished under the yoke of an ageing Shogun (not literally), countless (not literally) of pretenders and hundreds (literally) of Medieval 2 Total War's barstard children via the modding community. The time had come for a new power to rise and that power was Rome. 2.  But then it came out. Like a sort of half-formed Nero it emerged groaning from the loins of Creative Assembly with twisted, deformed twin heads of pay-locked factions and flawed execution (probably not too far from those Nero actually ordered). This unpleasant image is no exaggeration, for much like the real Nero, Rome 2 persecuted Christians (incidentally, I'm sure - there were probably other denominations who purchased the game) by being one of the most buggy, poorly-executed major releases in recent memory.  The co-op multiplayer wouldn't work past turn 10. The AI - both battle and campaign - was awful, resulting in many siege victories via the 'kite-by-pleb' strategy, and the game ran atrociously even on top-end graphics cards. And of course, the game seemed as if it had been balanced by a mentally disadvantaged ape. How so, you ask? Well, suffice it to say that if the 300 Spartans of legend came up against a legion of my sharpshooting, machine gun-toting bog-standard slingers then they'd have been sent home upon their perforated shields much sooner than expected.  Needless to say, the Total War empire was in danger of crashing down like the titular (not rude) Roman variety. Which wasn't what anyone wanted. When it worked well, the game looked beautiful, it played well and the historical accuracy (and yes, you should care about it, because if you don't you're a pleb) had come on leaps and bounds. We wanted nothing more than to hoist Nero up on his shoulders and carry him about the place cheering, but we just couldn't. Because he was broken and a bit rubbish.  So then, fast forward to now and we see Total War: Rome 2 as it's meant to be. It's tight, well-balanced, runs silky-smooth and feels like a finished product. Those familiar with Total War games know what to expect by now and I'm reasonably certain (can never be 100% with gamers) you'll enjoy it.  For those new to the series, it's a game about rushing through all the boring campaign map bits just to get to the sumptuous and epic battles, most of which contain thousands of units at a time. You have a healthy number of factions to choose from (more if you have extra money to unlock them) and the feel of each one is unique. A number of factors can be instrumental to victory in battle, including terrain, deployable defences and how skilled your general is.  Actually, I take back the part about the campaign map, because it's actually a lot more dynamic this time around. Agents can be hired to grief the opposition in many exciting and annoying ways, from poisoning their armies (thereby reducing their numbers) to assassinating enemy generals (thereby making the opponent click a few boxes to choose a new one). Some would argue the AI exploits these way too much but I would argue back (and be correct) that they are now simply a vital component of your strategy and need to be used just as much as your armies. Keep up with your agents and they'll win wars for you, or at least stop your opponent's from winning his (wars) for him (your opponent).  Improving towns and cities does seem a tad limited - gone are the days of turning the sleepy hamlet of Piddleton into a megalithic super-city - but gone also are the days of trawling through construction notifications every turn. It's simpler, it's easier, it's more restrictive but less frivolous. Is it a good thing? That's up to you to decide (it is).  Diplomacy is also vastly improved over previous entries. How essential it is depends on your faction - Rome is generally able to slaughter everyone in their path till the late-game (as is appropriate) while a small Eastern or barbarian kingdom will likely have to forge and maintain alliances, even whole confederations to survive long enough to become a superpower. It feels quite organic, works logically most of the time and feels central enough to the gameplay to warrant a mention.  There's also a politics system in there but my lunch break's nearly over, so I can't say too much.  As it stands, Total War: Rome 2 - Emperor Edition is well worth recommending. You've been saved the post-release horror and get to enjoy the game in its intended form. Even if you don't want to help the economy (and Sega's poor starving children) and buy all the extra factions and mini-campaigns, there's more than enough to keep you busy for a while. If you see it for 60% off or more, I would couch it as an essential purchase.  Just don't go on any of CA's post-release bug forums - not even NASA build computers to handle that.",

I have played Rome 2 since it first came out long ago, and it was virtually unplayable for months after initial release.

Seriously not looking good at this point, I kept playing (Against all logic) and learned the game was broken in more ways than bugs. The AI will kill itself in time, so no point doing anything. I hear the AI is better now and try again only to find the Ai needs cheat income, food, and sanitation becuase to fix its self destructive issues. I can confirm the AI is, and always was, utterly broken and never fixed properly.  Deplomacy is also terrible with less options within it than Shogun 2, or even Rome 1! (Keep that brief as everyone else has hit this point a thousand times)  Finally, the factions are just wrong. Everyone fights in formations which is not right, unit stats are crazy, and it feels all factions are built from the same base with no actual individuality. It seems balancing was more inportant than character and historic accuracy. An even bigger shame they didn't get that right either  All in all, this is a very lazy game and a shameful stain on Total War. A perfect example of the decay of game industry standards and the new game making philosophy of not caring for pubilc opinion, so long as certain sales targets are met and then abondoning the game and its comunity while promising better next time.

Whilst id hardly say outwitting, at least outmanouvering your opponent, AI or not, can turn the tides. Not in Rome 2. In Rome, i havent found a battle yet that hasnt consisted of simply smashing units together until one sides moral topples. Tactics seem uneccessary, almost. Of course, the good old hill's dominance is still unquestioned, but as compared to Shogun, where i would maintain formations and as far as im aware, fight as an old general would, applying different units in different situations, keeping a pliable mindset, My battle plan in Rome is still to group off 3 regiments, and plow them into one. This, breaking the morale of the targetted regiments, causing the others to cascade. Hardly a satisfying battle. Phalanxes seem of no use, and are unreliable at best, generals are at the most a shadow of the Daimyos of Shogun.  Whilst i appreciate some people merely play for the RTS side, i favour both aspects, and when one is so dissatisfying, i simply cannot enjoy the game as perhaps i ought to have.",

            "review_text": "TW: Rome II is probably my favorite Total War game. Out of all of the Total War games I have played, Rome II is one of the easiest and most simple games (campaign-wise) of the series. For many people its simplicity is one of the problems, but it should actually be something to be attracted to in this game since it makes the game easier to learn.  The game lacks family tree management and certain elements found in earlier games which takes away from some of the experience, but it creates something wonderful instead. Total War: ATTILA was released after this, has more of the features from earlier games (with some removed that are in this game), and is much more difficult while still using the same map and principles found in Rome II. Because of this, Rome II serves as a good way to learn the basics before tackling TW:Attila or another game in the series. In many ways, it is better than Napoleon and Empire because the tactics used in those are much different than the rest of the series.  As for the DLC, most of the DLC for Rome 2 is overpriced and some of it should have been included at release. If there is a sale, you should consider getting DLCs that interest you as they do add more depth to the game. Some people may say that the factions included are the same as others or have too few units, but this is only partially correct. The Greek States pack (Athens, Sparta, Epirus) can/will play almost exactly like the included Hellenic factions (Macedon, Massalia, Baktria, etc.) but will not be totally identical with the most obvious differences being in how campaigns progress. If diversity between factions (DLC or not) is not enough, there are plenty of good mods to expand unit rosters and tweak the game.  Overall:  PROS: +Fun battles +Good campaigns +Good entry point to Total War series (ROME II is like TW: ATTILA with training wheels) +Diversity between factions/cultures +Steam workshop with many mods  CONS: -Expensive -DLC is overpriced -Lacks more in-depth features of other games in the series -Thermopylae was nerfed   9/10",

The bodies filled the streets. I destroyed the seige epuipment of the enemy. We then thought that it would have been a good idea to enter the city, we thought wrong. Very, very wrong. I sent my cavalry into the outskirts of the city covered by 4 groups of archers. The enemy then sent his soldiers to block me out of the inner city. I sent my cavalry to attack while the archers would rain fire upon them. It was going well at this point, I felt like we were winning...Then it happened. My team mate sent his soldiers into an open battle where he was peppered by arrows, the arrows killed many soldiers, they were out manned. I tried to send help, but I was blocked out of the inner city. I sent a rather large group of swords men to try and gain some ground, but then I realised that my team mate's army was dwindling and he had around 200 soldiers left. It really wasn't going well at all. He sent as many as he could to back me up over at the battle at the outskirts, which then made us win. I sent all remaining forces into the city, but by this point my team's entire army was gone. My soldiers were killed in the melee and my general was the last remaning group. 160 men against over 1000. I sent him to the streets where he would have his last stand. A group of over 1000 men attacked him from the front. My General was losing this battle, there was no hope for him. He was then flanked by the enemies cavalry and knocked on his ♥♥♥♥, by then it was all over. My entire army littered the streets. The only men that survived were the ones who ran away for their lives.  10/10 would get general knocked on his ♥♥♥♥ and rekt again.",

Three units of ballistae can rout an entire fullstack, while the AI doesn't attempt to take them out with outflanking cavalry.

Strategy, economy, city building, diplomacy etc. But everything just seems so barbones with corners cut and what was added doesnt feel good at all.   All of the hallmarks are here, tactics like flanking, hammer and anvil, elevation, ambushing, etc. Units are varied, can be faction specific and have unique looks from the different regions in the game, though most will say they are reskins. Unit type is also varied as most types will also have sub types and so on. An example would be Cavalry, there are subtypes like Shock Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, and Light Cavalry that are used for a specific purpose, not using them for that purpose is somewhat wasteful. Naval combat is pretty good when it is working right, having the ability to embark land units on their own without naval specific units is a poor design decision however.  Now if you like quick tactics and have the attention span of a goldfish you will like the combat in this game. Battles end WAY to fast. Unit morale is the ♥♥♥♥ing worse I have seen in one of these games. I am one of those guys that like to zoom right in when the action starts but in Rome 2 by the time I zoom in one of the two units fighting rout. While I'm on the topic of zooming in why the ♥♥♥♥ does the camera level out if I zoom in/out? I want to stay at the angle my camera was facing thank you very much.   Anyways a usual fight will last you anywhere between 5-15 minutes, anything longer then that is due to either not engaging or waiting out the clock. To a newcomer this may still sound like a while but trust me 1/2 to 3/4 of the time is setting up your army properly and the remaining time is chasing down routing units. This part here is a big issue and ♥♥♥♥ing stupid design choice. So as in other Total War games your units can level up and the way to gain experience is by killing units, this means there is not a better time to gain experience then when the enemy is routing as they cannot attack back. Whoever decided to make it so that routing units arent shown on the map should be fired, you literally have to scour the map to find units to find the straglers.  You also cant field an army without having a general which leads to limited armies, no ability to garrison effectivly and frontlines that spread troops too thin. I hope this changes in future Total Wars.  On the topic of leveling up I think the system for leveling in Rome 2 is stupid, choosing what you want to level up is just a toss up as you dont know what you are working towards. In Shogun 2 the skill tree was set up so you could see what you could get and work towards how you wanted to build your general. Rome 2's Zeal, Cunning and Authority is a system that would be good if it was laid out properly akin to Shogun 2 but due to the fact that you dont know what the ♥♥♥♥ your skilling the general ends up being a jack of all trades and a master of none.  Competition in the early game is not too bad but it only gets easier, at around 5 villages you will probably be the biggest faction in the game and from then on is just a slaughter fest as you go for the 100% conquer. In Shogun 2 there would always be factions rivalling you in size and military strength the entire game. In Rome 2 once you get your first region everyone else just bends over and spreads their ♥♥♥ as you make them your ♥♥♥♥♥ by autoresolving and the once in a blue moon real-time battles.  UI is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I'm not smart enough to think of a way to fix it. I just feel like it could be more informative while showing less.  City building in this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing tragedy, there always this balance between unhappiness and happiness which has always been there but I dont understand why getting the best of a building would cause unhappiness, why are people upset when they get such a large amount of food, income, etc? I'm not sure if they have kept in the mechanic where you can just build one super happiness city in a region and just take a ♥♥♥♥ on the other villages and still be in the green but if they havent taken it out then this game is beyond help.   Money is never something you will have too little of, very easy to aquire and maintain upkeep if you are paying even the slightest bit of attention to the budget tabs.  Muliplayer works but that should'nt be praise worthy, it should be expected that things work. I also understand the reason they took out the avatar conquest in Rome 2 but I do wish that they could have kept the armor customization.  Game looks good but so does Ryse, gameplay is more important here. The action cam or whatever they call it is a nice addition and much better to look at than the first person they had in previous games. I wish we could move the camera around the unit though.  Diplomacy is paper thin usually only used to declare war or trade, alliances and what not are more for connon fodder and I do like the ability to walk over other factions territories without having to declare. Also seems like RNG to get a proposal accepted.  DLC is whatever, it's not going away. Thankfully some of them are more than a couple factions and units.  Lot of mods in workshop to cater to most of your needs and will add quite a while to the games life.  Not much else as I'm sure many other reviews have touched on thing more in depth then I have. The patches have brought the game to a pretty good state and if you wanted to ever try a Total War game then pick this one up and then buy the next one, that way it will look like such a huge step forward in the series to you.

I was initially skeptical of the mixed turn-based campaign and the real time battles, but it works well. Yes, there are some bugs in this game, more than any other Total War game out there right now, but this game introduces a great new depth while making the game simpler with the provincial governing system, along with being mostly historically accurate (at least at the start of the game, I have never seen Rome expand beyond Italy, but hey, they start with the right amount of territory). The only really negative thing I can say this game is that it is reeeeeally poorly suited for multiplayer. I mean, you thought Civ took a long time? This game is so much more in depth than civ, but that means that multiplayer games have the potential to last several days. The real time battles take up a ton of time, but in some ways, it is better than other games of this genre. Through this unique combat system, I've seen people lose battles they should have easily won, and others turn losing situations into ones where they emerge victorious. The game hinges on your abilities as a general, and that gives it an immensly personal feel. You get to say 'I just won that through my own skill,' instead of 'I had the better units so I won,' This is an amazing game, and although the $60 price tag is very high for a pc game, this game is one that is impossible to miss out on. Good luck conquering the ancient world!",

I personally don't feel disappointed in the slightest. Yes there were a few slight issues at launch but every TW game suffers this. That doesn't make release problems right of course but you expect it from these titles. I never suffered with the FPS issues or the crashes but I understand that some did but credit where credit is due, CA have spent a lot of time building RII and patching it non-stop since release. With a few mods you can really get a lot from this title.  The graphics are the best yet (GEM mod helps also) and the combat animations are fluid and good to watch ( the blood &amp; gore DLC is more realistic than the cartoon rubbish they added to Shogun II) and the campaign map looks great.  The political system needs some work though, I have not found any reason why its there at all and can play the game without using it which is sad. Since Rome and the Hellenic states were heavily political I feel, unless it's added later, was a missed oppertunity. The lack of family tree is superfluous as it did nothing anyway and has been missing since Empire (Shogun II had it but it may as well had not been) and I don't feel it's needed here. On the whole I really enjoy it. It has flaws yes but the game is still fun, looks good and has a lot of replayability.

Here is why I understand CA's position... they are working with newer and more cutting-edge concepts and technologies. The game is much more complex than Rome I, so I can understand them underestimating the amount of time and work it would take to make it a solid title.

There are downsides as i have heard some reviewers mention such as lack of atmosphere and character background, but in my opinion this game doesn't need that. Total War Rome 2 in my mind is a game where strategy, military power, and crushing the enemy are all that matter, so getting to know your general's family or history does not matter when it comes down to who is going to conquer the world.

Then, it came out. Bugs, glitches, idiotic AI, and more problems ruined this game. Luckily, however, I watched a review of this game before buying a while ago. Now, fortunately, I have heard that the bugs are gone, the AI is mostly fixed, and the game is now playable. When it went on sale, I knew I had to add this to my collection, and I have to say, it was worth it.   TL;DR: The bugs are gone and the game is now playable, fun, and worth it if on sale.  Now for some specifics.  Pros:  - Decent graphics - Fun and addicting grand campaign mode (like always) - Fairly easy to learn for newcomers - Challenging, but fun, even on lower difficulties (I might just suck) - New features added which I always wanted in the first Rome: Total War  Cons:  - I legitametly can not think of anything that takes away from the experience of this game, thus ruining the point of a pros/cons chart. Thanks Volvo.   Verdict: 9/10 Worth it if on sale, but not the full asking price.",

I personally love Carthage using a strong defensive line of hoplites to hold the enemy units in place, then using very strong cavalry and elephants to use the basic hammer and anvil strategy.

And if you love total strategy and have some patience, it'll work out well for you.  Yes, there's no family tree. Yes, you can only have 16 armies max. Yes, public order seemingly becomes impossible to control if your empire is large enough. But, in all, due to the variety of patches, it's a great game. At around the 200th hour I became a bit sick of it because I'm in a stalemate of sorts with Carthage. But there's always other factions to play as. Replay value is 11/10 with the patches and emperor edition and some mods...  I recommend the 4TPY mod, all factions mod (xcept those that are designated as DLC only - well, I bought Ceasar in Gaul and the Greek States pack at my satisfaction with playing this game) and the balanced diplomacy mod and the ranged camera mod (so I can see my empire from afar); and finally, the ROME 1 music (it can't be beat) mod.  Also, it looks a bit cartoonish.  Rome II grows on you if you're in to the Total War games. It has become, over more than a year, a stellar game. I think that if it were relaeased today the metacritic score would be more like 85-92.  Battles are great (but make sure you have a decent computer). Loading is kind of long but quotes make it interesting. And of course, decisions decisions decisions. Do you want to upgrade your industry or prepare for a full-on war? It gets very technical so be prepared to lose for 50-200 turns until you master the 'glitches' or ways that you can succeed.  Attilla looks more like Rome II should've been. That said, it's still very compelling.  I would give it a solid 9.2/10, and 9.5 if you're into the material surroudning Rome.  Try to get it on sale!

The enemy nation actually knows when to surrender, I never face this circumtances in Shogun 2 and Medieval 2 Total War, where most of the enemy nation fight to death not knowing their odds. Battle AI is good too, in siege the enemy tries to flank you from both side making it harder for you to defend, and I notice the campaign AI is much more agressives.  The odd things about this game is the unit card which is kinda confusing and make it hard to differentiate between unit, especially the Roman Cohort. The Sea battle also have a really small map, it's really hard to manuouver when you play a battle in the sea. I don't know if this is historically accurate or it just how they designed it.

The AI, I find, is quite agressive, which is fantastic, providing an actual challenge. I have found that it is more difficult to steamroller your way though the whole map (it is, however, not impossible). I enjoy this challenge, and relish the chance to carve out my empire in the face of a relentless foe.

Another irksome point is the encycopedia, it makes it more difficult to find the basic information that should more readily availiable.

Formations descend into unmanageable masses that crumble because of apparently being flanked all the time becaue (and get this) one random stragler gets offed by cavarly miles away so 159 men suddenly panic and flee because one guy had path finding issues, it's a regular occurance and can't be fixed because Rome II's engine is a piece of crap. I could list all the bugs that can't be fixed with this game but they're too many and I have a cap limit.  The battles are buggy, the campaign is dull and unnimersive and diplomacy is a joke. Diplomacy wasn't that great in Shogun II but it's somehow still worse after 2 years of patches and DLC's.  I have little faith in this community if they review this crap as ''Mostly Possitive''.  This game is basically a showcase of all of Shogun II's problems but with none of the shine and polish that made it fun to play or immersive.  The only reason I picked it up again is because I heard about Attila but the game is still awful and I have little to no faith that Attila will save this sinking atrocity of a ship.",

            "review_text": "Rome II is the remake of rome total war. It was released in an awfull and unfinished state back in september 2013 as happened with Empire Total War. But fortunately, the developers continued working on fixing the game, something that didn't happen with Empire. So, my review is based on the Emperor edition not the version of the game as it was on it's release day. It would be a totally negative review.  Pros: *Great graphics ,detailed models and variety of the soldiers characteristics. *It has some historical accuracy. (For history buffs like me it's not enough). *The system which combines small battle animations in order to make impressive choreographies. *The use of both naval and land units combined in battles. *The ambush battles are Improved, the units aren't visible until they attack. *There are already 14 playable factions in the base game. *Two campaigns (Grand campaign and Augustus) *New political system and civil war. *Multi core support at last. *Over 100 factions which act independently Instead of one rebel faction. *The soldiers look less like mindless and emotionless robots. Especially when you hear them talking in the battlefield. *The provinces system with the edicts that can be enabled in every controlled province.  Cons: *There are still bugs. *Most of the factions that belong to the same culture are more or less identical, they have just different colors instead of being unique in their own way. *Some factions have a lacking unit roster which may cause trouble if you want to expand your empire. *No family tree. It would be really awesome if the new political system coul be combined with the old family tree system. *The transport ships system makes fleets loose a big part of their reason of their existence. *The soundtrack is too generic and dull. I know, It's a minor problem for the majority. *The AI is not the best of the series, but it still offers chalenge and fun. *The agents are not really specialized on specific actions. They shoud be designed tso they would be useful in different situations. *The naval battles are not really enjoiable as they used to be in shogun2. *You can't build walls to protect your cities. *The grand campaign map needs more cities and towns, it feels empty. Pelloponese for exmple has only one city on the map, Sparta, which means that if you control sparta you control the whole Pelloponese. *The battles are too fast and there is no time for maneuvers.  More than a year has passed since Rome II's release and 16 patches have been released also, and the game now is in a great state but still it's not worth of paying 50 Euros, I believe it's price should be 35-40 Euros. I reccomend it to every total war fan. Also there are many mods that can satisfy every unsatisfied gamer.",

            "review_text": "This review i'm giving is for the modern version of this game, meaning no criticizing the HORRIBLE HORRIBLE release it came with.  Let's begin. ----------------------------   The game is set during the Roman Period, you are put into a faction that is scattered throughout the large and detailed campaign map. You as the player's job are to conquer, liberate, or starapay another faction to recieve bonuses such as money, XP, ect.  ----------------------------  -AI  The game's AI is I will rate it a 7/10. Depending on what difficulty you play on, the AI in this game can sometimes get twitchy but I recommend you just use mods to patch it up.  ----------------------------  -DLC  This game has given us loads of DLC's, some were utter crap and useles(COUGH COUGH BEASTS OF WAR, COUGH). And some were amazing(COUGH COUGH CAESAR IN GAUL, COUGH).  The DLC's in this game can feature new units, factions, and even MINI-Campaigns.  I was really hoping the campaign DLC's would just enlargen the Grand Campaign map making it even more zooming in, meaning instead of conquering let's say Scotland in this game, you would have to capture ALOT of cities to conquer it, not just one city.  I recommend the best DLC in this game is Hannibal at the Gates, I believe it is the most historic and hardest of them all, I disclude Caesar in Gaul because of it's technology, and we don't need to talk about that now do we.  ----------------------------  -Political Systems  The political systems in this game is I am rating a 4/10  Why is because this game fails to truly give the player a real experience as to running a Government. I played as the Roman Faction and all it says a person is, is a General or a Statesman. No no no, we do not want that, I wanted what Napoleon Total War had where you could host elections, fire and hire Consuls, Ministers, ect.  This game just doesn't mean my standards, because Rome I was amazing and I had HIGH HIGH HIGH expectations for a second version.  Now other than Hellenic or Latin. I consider Punic and the Southerns as Barbarian Governments, Councils, Chiefs, and Court Nobles I consider Barbaric.  The Barbaric Governments are just the same thing as the Latin and Hellenic, just with different titles.  ----------------------------  -Campaign(IN GENERAL)  The campaign itself is widely large, the entire map is just the Roman Empire, and your job is to re-conquer it as another faction.  The campaign holds cities and towns that you're allowed to Govern, you can wage taxes, put edicts to make it prosper, and build buildings of your choices.  The technology in this game allows you to unlock certain things in this game that given you benefits and advantages.  Each town and city holds public orders, I am COMPLETELY against the public order issues within this game because building a church can be a -20 on Public Order? That's almost hypocritical.  I rate the campaign itself a 7/10.  ----------------------------  -Battles  This game is what we came here for, the Total War it's made by. It's battles!  The battles in this game are fanominal in textures and graphics, it even features a cinematic camera allowing you to view a close up of soldiers fighting others in battle. Or when you play that Russian Hell March music and watch your soldiers marching in a city or field look like a boss.  The battle AI is not so fanominal, sometimes it can be utter idiotic, the AI itself still has not fixed itself from Rome II's horrible release date.  I rate the battles a 8/10.  ----------------------------  I believe I have covered the entire game on it's primaries, but this is just my opinion.  The final verdict for Creative Assembly's Total War Rome Two is a = 6-7/10  I know it's not reasonable to give it this verdict, but this game just didn't meet my standards, it has horrible AI, too long technologies, horrible public order system, horrible political system, and just bad DLC's that CA has coffed us up enough money from.  But in all honesty it's a 6/10 in my opinion, but to be reasonable it's a 7/10",

Instead, I will say that now, 14 months and 16 (18 really) patches later, Total War: Rome II is much, much improved. It isn't perfect, and I doubt it will ever be as good as long-term Total War fans like myself hoped it would be during the build-up to its release. But there are a lot of mods out there that fix a lot of the game's shortcomings. Here are just a few without which I would find this game a lot less enjoyable: -Radious Total War -Traits, Talents and Toadies -Four Turns Per Year There are other mods well worth looking at, but those three are the ones which I feel make the difference between Total War: Rome II being an adequate game and it being a great game.",

The developer had a tough task of beating a game that was based in the same period of time, a really well executed Rome Total War with it's add ons The Barbarian Invasion and Alexander. Total War: Rome II with it's new edition 'Emperor Edition' guarantees pretty graphics, realistic battlefields, realism in governing your Empire. The game is really fun, replicates really well the tension of those days, when Roman Empire just managed to beat Carthaginians, and their path towards becoming what they are famous for. Emperor Edition also adds a new campaign, based on Roman Civil War between Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus. You can choose whichever 3 of those factions (Octavian's Faction based in Italy and Gaul (France), Antony's Faction based in Greece, Turkey and Middle Easy and Lepidus' Faction based in Hispania (Spain) and Carthage (Tunisia). You can also choose various 'barbaric' factions such as Egypt, Armenia, Parthia (Iraq) etc.   However what hurts this game is the amount of DLC's. They should have included most of those DLC's (such as Hannibal, based in years before the start of the original campaign, or Caesar based just before events of Emperor Edition's campaign). Lack of the Historical Battles is also a problem. Rome Total War had many more Historical Battles to enjoy.   To conclude:   Strong Points:  + Good graphics  + Beautifully executed, replicates tension of Ancient Times  + Realism in battles (fighting animations are outstanding)  + Beautiful Campaign Map   Weak Points:  - DLC content that should be added as a patch for a bad release  - Release state was pethetic (it is fixed now but still it's not something to be proud of)  - Lack of content on Historical Battles  - Could do with more playable factions   Score: 7/10",

            "review_text": "Rome II has - in general recieved a lot of negative reviews. But I find it a refreshing game. It's a step away from the old style of gameplay, which was good as well, and a step in the direction I think Total War should be going towards in the future. It provides far greater immersion thanks to it's integrated battles, it allows larger armies to take to the field, and it gives you a real sense of the destruction and chaos that held sway in Roman times.  If there's one thing I would like to see make a come-back, it would be the generals' speeches. They set the tone for the coming battle, and gave you a vigour and purpose in fighting the battle, made you believe that the men could win, even if the odds were stacked against them. If I could suggest something to change to the general's speeches, it would be a greater integration depending on the General's personality. A high dread general would tend to deliver speeches that spoke more of what would happen to the soldiers' families if they failed, about how the enemy is weak and to show no mercy... that kind of stuff. Whilst a general tending towards the paragon side, would deliver speecher geared more on building up his soldiers' moral. He might talk about how he trusts them,how they are the best in the world, how their families are waiting for them back at home, stuff like that.  It is never a bad idea to improve the campaign AI, but I hardly found it as lacking as most described it, and the latest patches have cleared up most of the kinks still in there.  All-in-all I found Rome II to be a worthy edition to the Total War saga, a game that's immersive and comprehensive. It has enough detail to make you think, but isn't so complex that you feel overwhelmed, as one sometimes does with games like Civilization. It's blending of TBS campaign play, and RTS battles, is unique and still ground-breaking, even today. Total War is a franchise that I admire and the only one that I follow fervently. The designers, coders, artists etc. that worked on the franchise through the years have my greatest respect and my humblest support.  I can't wait to see where the franchise will go next, but what ever they decide to do, I know it'll be a game worth playing, and an even greater edition to the Total War series.  The Total War franchise is known for it's historical quotes, and so, pray forgive me for ending my review with one of my own favourite quotes.  'Leaders think and talk about the solutions.

They changed how fomations are handled, without actually improving on them, and formations are really only useful during deployment. Forget the idea of marching your Roman legions into war, once you start the battle, you're herding cats.   In a nutshell, you don't feel like you're commanding an army, you feel like you're babysitting it.   Also, nothing feels very Roman. It feels like generic TW with a bunch of Latinesque names, and some senate intrigue and politics and diplomacy thrown in. If it had some depth, it would be a welcome addition, but it's all so superficial and tedious and pointless that it's a just a distraction and a hassle.  And for ♥♥♥♥ sake, city building is about 1/100th as sophisticated as the Simpsons: Tapped Out phone app.  All-in-all, it's a weak game with well-rendered but dull graphics. ",

I used to try and kill an enemy general on the battle field if he had high stats and good traits sort of a 'noble death' if you will. Now I simply don't care, generals might as well be captains with no traits they add absolutely nothing to the game anymore. The naval battles are at best a joke when my ships aren't caught up on each other so much they can't move the enemy boards them even when I ram them in the side! More times then I can count AI armys glitch out and simply stand there with out moving even when they are attacking my towns, yes I win the battle but I have to wait an hour for it to time out and the fast forward button has never worked. They have taken away almost all the building options most turns I don't need to do anything to manage my settlements because I have no buildings I can build. You can build a barracks, temple, common area, aqueduct or siege works. It is a far cry from Shogun where building up economic power house cities would yield benefits to your war effort. In this game just build a barracks and a temple in every city and your good to go. Most nations have few and boring unit types and even tho they advertise many different nations there are only like 5 different cultures meaning they might as well have only made 5 nations. 12 patches in and the game is better but still can't hold a candle to its predecessors. The ONLY thing this game did right was limit the number of armies per faction, no longer will one unit of archers travel through your territory burning everything in sight. I bought this game the day it came out because I was excited for it, however when the next total war comes out I'll be waiting to see reviews because this one was done so poorly.",

            "review_text": "I was very much looking forward to the latest instalment in the series which is Total War Rome II. Sadly the game disappoints, this might be my own fault for not looking more closely to gameplay videos but mostly it is the developers. From the first game till Shogun Total War 2 the game just kept getting better, and that's because they kept just tweaking it a little. The graphics also kept increasing to further heights which made watchin the battles close-up immensly fun. Now to the harder part. I have to be honest and say I've only spent a few minutes in the game and even less in a battle, and the reason for this, is that the game infuriates me to such degrees that I couldnt keep playing. First off is the horrible, horrible UI, I've never been so annoyed in my life. The last games were easy to navigate and control. Everything from your armies to your cities. Suddenly instead of having an overview of the map the screen is just crammed with smaller windows with ugly pictures of your general and HUGE unit icons. Then theres the city management which they screwed up big time. Instead of having cities in provinces, you know have provinces with cities. This might sound like a good idea, but when your enemy or other AI, can have a few cities in the province, then you start becoming really confused. Furthermore the building options have been extremely limited of what I can see. Again, I have not played for very long, so it might get better later on, but still the UI is terrible, and in a game, where MANAGEMENT is a key gameplay element, you just can't have a ♥♥♥♥ UI like the one in this game. Why couldnt you just have kept the simple nice UI from Shogun 2? Instead you fill up half the screen with crappy windows so I can't see the bloody map properly, and you can't even zoom out that far - How the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to manage an empire like that?! Now that's out of the way, let's continue to the most disappointing feature in the game. The combat. Again it's the UI that lets the whole thing down. In Shogun 2 you had 3 simple features to look after. Minimap, Unit Management and Unit List. It was so nice and simple. In this Rome II abomination you have the same 3 features only they've scaled up the Unit List and and removed the unit management from the lefthand bottom corner to under the unit list. So you have this big mother ♥♥♥♥in box filling up the screen where the fighting is happening. Then theres a useless picture of the general or whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you got controlled in the lefthand bottom corner. In the olden games, you atleast had the nice army control button. I remember them fondly from Shogun 2, so when you had your whole army selected you could move them forward, whilst they stayed in formation. Where are these controls now?! I couldnt find the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things and tried moving the whole army forwards, which resulted in just a long line of crap. The minimap they also placed down in the bottom line, just in the righthand corner. WHY DID YOU DO THIS? Now there's a huge line of windows in the bottom of your screen, which is also where all the fighting and unit movement goes on. Why not move some of does ♥♥♥♥♥♥ windows up in the tophand corners in the sky. I'm interested in the ♥♥♥♥in battle with swords and death and blood, not a load of UI windows! Furthermore that bloody unitlist and the new unit icons is bloody awful. It's the most simple thing I have ever seen, I can't understand they wanted to do the whole Roman/Greek culture with tile/marble kind of style, but the units look so bloody similar I cant see the difference between a general and a standard unit. Worst of all the unit-icons are so large, and you can't minimise the entire window, without being handicapped during the battle. This review isnt totally fair to the game, seeing as I've been playing it for a few minutes. You might actually like some of the changes, but if you are like me, and loved the previous games, and the feel of them - You're gonna be disappointed",

After a mere turn or two, the all mighty Republic of Rome was destroyed by the minor Etruscan League. A Shameful display!!  I was so excited to hear the news that CA &amp; SEGA were releasing ROME II in the total war series. There was so much hype about the game and CA definitely pulled all the tricks to have a massive release. After having what I feel was a good success with Shogun 2 I couldn't wait to see what was installed.   Then the moment came. Pre installed, wetting myself, waiting for a f'ing update and then.... Train wreck.  - AI Bugs - Combat (land, naval and seige huge issues) - Diplomacy (Which still needs a lot of work) - The lack of connection to generals and family's  - Politics  - Traits ( Just because I am an ally does not mean I like Egyptians and have to have Hellenic influence when I am Punic)  - NAVIES ( why have one when you can build an army, much cheaper, and go from land to water without having to wait a turn. or a proper navy)  In the end it was a big FLOP.   But there was light at the end of the tunnel. CA was not going to let this game be ruined. I was to become the masterpeice they were planning from the start. PATCHESS!!!!!  14 patches down since the horrific moment in history we call the release and we are finally starting to see some improvements. I must take my hat off to CA as they have not giving up on this Frankenstein of a game and is finally turning it into something worth while. Big Improvements to; -Seige/ land Battles (AI doesn't wait to be destroyed by artillery and brings the fight to you) -AI Bugs ( They don't turn their whole army to face 3 units of cav, they start to counter flank you etc) - Balanced out some units. ( Not oathsworn, will still take on a full army, yet doesn't work the same for you.)  - Naval battles are a bit better but still need work - Allies now actually help - Diplomacy is still not great but somewhat better (waiting for a fix in Emperor)   All though there has been many updates there is still a lot of work that needs to be done like: - Not losing a whole unit when 1 general dies. -SQUALOR GET RID THE F*^&amp; OF IT. It's pointless. I want to build a Grand city centre which defends my people and looks good and for some reason it upsets them. Pickky S*%$s. Or it should work the otherway round.  - Ship ramming etc, the list will go on.  But to be honest if it wasn't for my friend and multiplayer I would have given up. I am glad that I have stuck by and can't wait for the new Emperor Edition and the announcement of the next Total war series. I have always enjoyed Total war and always will. If you enjoy strategy games then this is definitley for you. You'll just have to look passed some of it's negatives. But it will not disapoint.  ",

It is glitchy a little bit but nothing yet to make the game not enjoyable. Sounds good, graphics good and theme is good. But I wouldnt pay 60 $ for the game, even tough i am sure there is a lot of replay value to it, i think 40 $ would be a better deal, even tough it came out recently. I am not cheap but i do know that sega is over pricing most of there stuff... to my eyes.  This game would be a 7.5/10 it is a great bought for 40 bucks or lower but not 60 $",

I was even more shocked when I looked at the reviews for it by IGN and other big reviewers and saw a good score for a terrible game. I felt like Varus was at the battle of Teutoburg Forest, BETRAYED!  Well, 15 patches (and a few mods) later and the game is bearable. The game crashes less often, the AI is a bit more better and some other things have been improved. Some things though, like some of the AI's tactics, aren't good, like still only having one unit armies. Let's face it. Rome 2 will never be the perfect game. No Total War ever was. In fact, every game (Total War or other) has a few bugs or poor design choices. At least now I can play Rome 2 with few problems, and if I can run the game that's all that matters.",

            "review_text": "The bloody sequel to Creative Assembly's popular Rome: Total War, Rome II offers a few new ways to play with your units. Instead of just hovering over them like a helicopter mom, why not give a unit a morale boost by hovering over a unit with the Cinematic Camera? With the Blood and Gore expansion, you can now have decapitations and amputations! Doctoral Warfare has never been so much fun! Well, unless you were fighting actual doctors... It would be quite boring. I mean, they'll just throw vaccines and pills at you whilst you cut them down with gladiators or naked warriors.  Although the launch of Rome 2 was shaky if not downright terrible, after several patches it is playable. There are three major issues that I want to point out: 1: Paid DLC for Factions; Although the recent Imperator Augustus FLC came out around ten days ago, the fact of the matter is that some people (myself included) would rather unlock factions through beating them to a bloody pulp rather than having to pay for a number of factions (Shogun 2 suffered from this). However, the Blood and Gore pack and the Daughter's of Mars pack are $3.00, so not all is lost considering these packs were actually worth it. Plus the Imperator Augustus FLC gives you Armenia, so that's a plus. 2: No Family Trees; Although I personally don't care that there is no family tree, I'm still writing about it. Just like Empire: Total War, there is no family tree. However, UNLIKE Empire: Total War, it's hard to know who your replacement leader will be unless you know how ancient cultures worked. This is especially true of the Barbarian Factions, such as the Arverni, where a complex political structure meant that the heir to chieftom could be booted out (as was the case with Vercingetorix). 3: Lack of Voice Variance: Although there are several voices for commanders and soldiers alike, this is in terms of the accents. For example, I'm fine with the default Barbarian voice, but only for the Gauls. When it comes to the Brythonic (British) Tribes, one would expect to hear native accents (if you listen to Welsh, Irish or Scottish Gaelige, or Manx, there is the British/Irish/Scottish accent). When it comes to the Germanic Tribes, one would expect to hear a more gutteral accent. And then you have the Etruscan League.... Sometimes voices just do not fit.  But other than those issues, the game is excellent. If you can look past the paid DLC, lack of Family Trees, and lack of accents, this game is amazing.",

Factions are cool. I just miss the layout where you build a better blacksmith to get better armour etc. Also, if you auto batle, your forces will get owned more oft than not, even if your force is superior. I may have liked this game had I never played Medieval II. Maybe I will give it another shot when I have the time to work through all the complexities they've added.    I just got sucked in for about eight hours. haha I figured out the parts I was having issues with prior and now I love the game. Definitely ammending this review to be positive. So in hind sight; The learning curve is a bit steeper than the previous titles, but the differences add a depth to the game that is inexplainable. The AI feels more like real opponents and the diplomacy aspect is fun. Another great thing is the way your subjects live their lives dynamicaly. Little stoies and plot twists help to add an organic feel to your kingdom. I forsee a lot of hours being unaccounted for in my near future...  Great job, Sega.",

It is for this weak start that I label it as a let down, yet it has improved. The game now runs more smoothly and is less inclined to lag out or crash arbitrarily and the AI now puts up more resistance in a fight than a stack of soggy waffles like it did in the beginning.

Yes it had a bad run at first with monumental lag spikes ON THE CAMPAIGN MAP, bugs, passive AI, broken diplomancy and more, but most of these are fixed now and the game is pretty optimized. It doesn't require the best Graphics card or Intel Processor to run it either which is a plus.  For you newbies out there this is a Turn-Based Strategy game and a RTS battle game. You control a historical faction and try to conquer the world through military, cultural, economical and diplomactical means. It is fun and quite time consuming but it is something you can put a lot of time into and enjoy your progress.  For you players who have been around since Total War: Rome or even furthur back you will be dissapointed. Features are missing and some of the new ones may not please you but personally I like them, really helps you out. The AI can do really smart things and really stupid things but TW's AI has always been a behaved level of stupid, wouldn't be surprised if they used banana peels instead of rocks for slingers.    Overall I think that this game deserves, yes I repeat, deserves at 7.5/10. The CORE gameplay aspects itself are amazing and you won't find anything much like it in other franchises. The graphics are decent but even on Ultra it is nothing like they promised us. The DLC's are tolerable and only some are really needed to get the full experience, but eh, not really. The multiplayer aspect is decent but could be improved.   Thanks for reading and I hope I influenced your opinion! :D",

            "review_text": "The first Total War title I ever played was Total War Rome, and I loved it. So, of course when I decided to get Rome 2, I had extremely high expectations. It did not disappoint, although it was different. Luckily I avoided the myraid of glitches that were inherited with the game when it first came out, I bought it a year later for $20. And let me say, they have more than fixed the glitches.   THE GOOD This game looks beautiful on any decent machine, and is runnable and still looks good on underpowered computers (I have seen it run on lackluster laptops). The gameplay is immersive and very in depth. I find myself spending hours into this game at a time, trying to negotiate traties with factions I wish to destroy at some point, but for now provide a good border that I wish to use as the backbone of my empire. Yet at the time, I am building up my cities to provide better units, rake in money, and most importantly, keep my people happy.   Also, the battles are better than ever. For those who don't know, the overall game is a turn based strategy, and then when you fight battles you can choose to auto resolve (for quick results, but higher losses and lower chances of winning), or to fight the battle on the battle map. Here, you can control each unit (up to 20 per army) and choose different strategies yourself. This is very engaging and dynamic, although I do like to set a time limit of 40 minutes or else you may find yourself in a situation where there is one hidden unit that you cannot find and it takes 50 minutes to end the battle! Anyway, the battles are the best aspect of the game and are very engaging.  And I can't forget to mention online campaigns, they are just extremely fun. If you have friends with this game, you will love the online coop campaign or the head to head!  Last but not least, this game has a great replay value. I have loved playing every faction I have tried (except Parthia, they literally have no good infantry). Each faction offers its own great units, buildings, locations, and strategies. I do recommned buying DLC however, because some of the more fun factions (such as any Greek faction, which I adimit, is annoying) is a faction you must buy. Also when you replay, trying different difficulites is fun. Playing this game on easy is a good challenge for someone new to the game, but way too easy for someone experienced. I find that the way to have the most fun is to challenge yourself!  THE BAD  The cost of the dlc. Plain and simple, this game is not cheap and the dlc is no cheaper. I DEFINITELY reccommend waiting for a sale to buy this game and its dlc; every dlc I have bought (which is everyone except 4 smaller ones) has been on sale. And I can say, on sale the dlc is fairly priced. And although the game is probably worth 60 dollars, if you wait long enough you can probably get it cheaper.   There are still some glitches, although only two major ones I have seen. One is that the function to move around the map will suddenly stop, for the rest of your campaign. This is very annoying, because now you have to double click the map to move anywhere, and sometimes your viewing angle will change, which you also cant change back. So you're looking at the map upside down and can barely move the camera around. It sucks. In my experience this happens more in online campagins. The other glitch is that sometimes during coop campaigns one player will just be dropped. Although this is annoying, it is a normal bug for all games and will likely be there forever. Also, since the game saves at the end of every turn automatically, it is not a big deal with losing save data.  THE CONCLUSION  Buy the game! On sale! WIth friends! It is definitely worth it. I love this game and do not listen to the reviews about the game breaking glitches, they have been fixed!",

Thankfully however this isn't saying too much as it is a pretty decent strategy game. It's definitely still not worth 60 dollars. To cut the review short, I'll do the standard pro/con list most people do.  Pros:  + When the AI or other units don't bug out battles can be immensely fun. + Multiplayer campaign and multiplayer battles are very fun with friends, although public games are few and relatively boring. + Graphics are very good, but still not as good as Shogun 2. + Units are very diverse and different cultures have different tactics (Romans depend on raw discipline and heavy infantry, Carthaginians are flexible using different soldiers from different cultures, Celts and Germanics use the very shock and fear of a powerful charge, etc.) + New province/region system is better than what we had with Empire and Napoleon. + Modding community is very good.  Cons:  - AI is very stupid in battles and are very incompetent when managing an empire. - Looking at soldiers fight is very boring and poorly presented (They often flick off into the air and spin around when getting poked in the ♥♥♥♥, etc.) - DLC Campaigns are very uninteresting with the exception of the Greek DLC and the free one with Emperor Edition. - Many, Many Faction pack DLC's and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. - Despite what the major Review companies say the 'Super epic Rome 2 cavalry charges!' is nothing more than Celtic Riders running over the first line of soldiers and then slapping at the poor ♥♥♥♥ers below before getting shoved off their horse by a shield. - Too many factions that have little to no different besides faction bonuses. There are really only about 5 different unit rosters. - Most special units are just things like oathsworn (Celts with chainmail, a sword, and oval shield) and greek hoplites with pretty shields and shiny helmets. - Tech tree is pretty standard and boring. - Often times the major nations like Rome get taken over by Etruscans or some miniscule Celtic tribe. - Naval battles are pointless, boring, hard to command and this is where the AI bugs out the most. - I know this isn't really a negative spot on gameplay but the majority of the budget went to bribing IGN and making 'Super early pre-alpha footage' look nice. Just look at the Carthage siege 'pre-alpha' video and then watch release footage and you will see what I mean. - Hard to run without a high-end computer. - AI really bad at sieges and there are only about 1 walled city in every region or so, making most assaults boring.",

            "review_text": "The Good: I've been playing the Total War series since the original Shogun came out fifteen years ago, I've played every incarnation except Attila, and I have to say the series just keeps getting better and better. Rome II definitely has the feel of a massive campaign, with massive armies and massive empires battling against each other. I've only racked up 20 hours as of writing this review but I can see that this is one that's going to eat into a lot of my time.  Graphically, it's a very beautiful game. Unfortunately my system won't run it on anything approaching ultra settings, though even on a mix of High and Very High it still looks heaps better than (for example) Medieval 2 on its highest settings. I know I'm going to need a system upgrade at some point in the not too distant future, but for now it looks like CA have done a decent job of optimising this game for lower-end systems. (For those who need to know, I tried running the benchmark on Ultra settings across the board and got &lt;5 fps. o.O)  Having said all that, as with most games, there are bad points to this one as well as good.  The Bad: As a few other reviewers have said, this is one of those situations where you buy the base game, and can have a lot of fun with it, but to really get the most out of it you have to then buy a literal metiric f**k-ton of DLCs. The core game is thirty quid, and then all of the DLC is another sixty quid on top of that, and this is a good year or so after the game was released. Now, I appreciate that game developers have to make their money, and I don't have anything against DLC in particular, but I think three new campaigns (at a tenner each), four new culture packs (at six quid each), two new unit packs (at two quid each) and the blood and gore add-on (also two quid) is maybe going at bit far?  And The Rest: I love this series, and despite my whining over the cost of all the DLC I will probably end up buying it all at some point. I'll also end up getting Attila (plus all the DLC), as well as Warhammer (plus DLC) when that comes out. I'd like to hope that somewhere along the way CA and their publishers make a few changes to their business model as far as DLC is concerned, but I'm not going to hold my breath. I also hope that the series continues to push the envelope on what can be achieved graphically and technically with the games. As long as they keep doing that, I'll keep playing 'em. ",

Sad, but true.  -AI is a little... funky? Usually it's pretty intelligent, but it will do stupid stuff like walking to the middle of the other side of -the map and staying there if you've occupied a corner of a map and are unseen. Your army wins at the end of 20 minutes of staring at a timer, but there's no combat. -There's no 6x speed. Some of the maps you'll play with more infantry and war machines than others. 3x is nice, but it's insanely slow if the other guy is waiting on his reinforcing hoplites to walk the map. -Repetitive general traits and ancillaries and traditions. While I love the army traditions, there are some severe limitations in the type of bonuses that one can give to an army. (Hoplite centric traditions for factions like Massilia that have a large spread of Gallic troops as well as Greek. Makes it awkward when only one kid's getting the proverbial lollipop.) I fell in love with the Medieval II sprawling lists of hundreds of traits and bajillions of retainers. Your leaders had character. They also had families. But I digress. -DLC packs are often screw jobs. The Greek States culture pack should have been included in the original game, and I'm frankly rather disappointed in the 'new' campaigns that are attached to the game. All of them are essentially the same game on a smaller map with dynamics and mechanics that are relatively unchanged. The variety is... lacking from what one would hope.  The goods -Da Mods doh! The mods that are available for this game make things GREAT. More unit variety, more interesting looking units, total changes in how the mechanics play out, whatever. It's all there. -Huge maps. They're gorgeous and just too much fun.  -Naval battles are far better than any of the previous TW titles IMO. Just IMO.  -Lots of faction variety. 'Nuff said. -Mercenary system. This beats the crap out of M2's system. No question. -Diplomacy. Useful options! AI is sometimes quite funky on this as well, but it is actually helpful now. -Unit appearances. Most are pretty good looking straight out, and I play on relatively low visual settings. -Traditions for armies. This is just brilliant and tremendous fun. Armies have flavor that didn't exist previously. -Beating Romans and the Arverni as Massilia, beating the Thracians up as Sparta, shooting enough arrows to fuel the sun as Parthia.  I'd absolutely recommend it, especially if you're one who's open to using mods. (Look up Sir Eggmond, Cataph, Champloo, and Sebidee. They do some of the best unit mods)",

Read below for the one bug i found that ruined it for me. Besides this one bug i would still give it a thumbs up. It inspired me to type a mini paragraph. Which says something.   The mighty legions of Rome. Faced the full might of Carthage, Macedonia, Egypt, and the cursed Spartans. They fought like demons that had escaped from Hades. But they were no match for the strength of Rome. Now Rome was unopposed and conquered the north. Bringing civilization to those Barbarians. Now Rome has turned her attention south across the sea. Egypt was the first to stand against Rome. They sent their insignificant army against. Rome's most elite. Their finest soldiers could not even slow the Roman advance.. When their defeat was certain. Disaster struck. It was as if. The mighty Greek war god Aries himself personally intervened. NOT only was The Roman advance halted. But the full might of Rome. Was brought to its knees by the all might bug. Yes that is right. After the intervention by the 'Creators' a bug exist. The all mighty...... Nay the dreadful Campaign map bug. The greatest General Rome has ever known. Was unable to move the map around. What was left of Egypt's pathetic navy. Invaded Roman land. They were able to liberate the cursed Spartans, Athenians, and Macedonia. This would be an insignificant matter. But the mighty bug. Has prevented our great general. From sending aid to our endangered, Roman citizens. The accursed Spartans Now pillage the countryside stealing the very blood of the might Roman Empire...... gold. Gold that is needed to support. Now that the Roman treasury is empty. Roman soldiers threaten desertion. The enemies of our great general have now rise up in rebellion. Threatening the safety of Rome. Slaves escape their masters looting and burning down everything Rome has built. I fear when the dust settles Rome will be nothing more than a memory.

            "review_text": "Okay, so here is my review about this game and my background. My first game of the franchise was Mideival 2 Total War, which was and is amazing and always will be especially with the Americas campaign and the other side campaigns. That set the standard for Total War games with me. So I think the people who have played the OG total war games like Shogun, Mideieval and the GOAT Rome 1, will automatically be overly critical of the later games. I know I was and still am to a certain extent. Its like people who play pokemon Gen 1 Fire red and Leaf green and they play the new ones and say it is trash because of the nastalgic tendancies. So I think everyone is being a little critical. However I also paid for the game after it is has been patched a lot and for 11 bucks on sale, so I can understand if someone bought the DLC and the game at full price after seeing all the glitches the AI and gameplay on youtube from the past and even some now, that they would be frustrated because this was supposed to the be the biggest total war game. But for me it was worth 11 bucks actually more, so I would say wait for it to go on sale, its not worth 60 bucks, its good but not that good. Dont get me wrong Sega did a decent job, but I think they kind of swindled people who bought it at release. But the game is fun, the DLC just isnt worth it.   The gameplay is extremely different from the other games. For instance, the spies and champions are extremely powerful and can deal enough damage over time to basically annhialte a full stack. Also there are garison armies which can actually fend off a legit army if used properly. The biggest thing for me that is a downfall but cool as well is the fact that there are SOOO many factions, over 100, literally. Every turn for basically the first 100 turns you will discover a new faction, which is realistic I guess but its also very, well complicated. Declaring war on someone may result in an enemy tribal confederation or 4 factions declaring war on you. Oh the politcs thing is cool I dont have to send a politic to their gates to engage in politics. However, the politics system for you important characters such as inherators or faction leaders and their political rivals, makes NO sense. You can literally have a civil war which is a nightmare, out of NOWHERE. The civil war bar may not even be full at all and you will have a civil war or it could be up very high and it will never happen. It can happen at 90 percent of the gravitas or 40 percent, its confusing.   Finally the actual warfare. The warfare is waaaaay more involved. Flanking and using units special abilites affect the battle much more than in previous games. For instance a pike phalanx if its flanks are protected can literally take out an entire army no matter how strong(excluding missile units), whereas in M2TW it was practically useless. The battles actually arent simply determined by troop quality(never was completely but it is less so in this game, in my opinion, feel free to comment, no harsh words though, just trying to give insight), now you can destroy an army with lesser soldiers if used properly, that was harder to do in M2TW(Please keep in mind I have only played and seen Rome 1 and M2Tw). I would say it is more involved. The amount of units a card can have is more so instead of 60 being in a stack now 120 can be which is cool!   Concerning the map, units automatically heal themselve in your own territory so you dont have to retrain them. Also you can set your forces in 3 stances which is forced march which forces them to march farther on the map but get ambushed, the forticifaction which is for an army that builds a defensive mini fortress to make it difficult to kill them all of and some other stance which makes them ambus other armies, I actually dont understand that one haha. Also ship battles can be fought personally. The most ANNOYING but also cool addition to the map is the provinces, basically the map is split into many different provinces and if you share the province with a rival faction than it affects your settlments as well. This is EXTREMEMLY annoying if they have a seperate culture because the clashing cultures in the province will cause rebellion. If the whole province isnt under one culture one or both cultures suffer and it gives more incentive to conquer the whole province. Now this is realistic and causes you to have to manage the cities in more strategic way so it is more challenging. Instead of simply spreading out into a box or whatever way you want to, your empire will be shaped into the shape of the provinces.   Overall the game is more deep and I think TW players are to used to not getting this involved in the game, it is almost too involving. They are used to simply training high quality troops and sending them to clash and steam rolling. It requires more strategy. I do recommend this game, it is fun, maybe not at release but it is now.

For instance, the AI's more incompetent that ever, which surprises me considering CE boasted of having a larger budget and would feature improved AI for Rome 2. Family trees are also removed, the Roman Senate's nearly non-existent, you can't change your capital, and just a lot of details like that are missing. The mods in the Steam Workshop can be spectacular though, adding some much-needed substance.   The Augustus Campaign to Rome 2 is like what Barbarian Invasion was to Rome 1; it's a solid addition with some improvements here and there. Although it feels a bit emotionless and the AI's still a mixed bag, I had a blast playing as each Roman party. People may not find it as gripping if they haven't seen HBO's Rome (OR just aren't familiar with the politics of the time).  Can't comment on the other expansions or multiplayer though, as I haven't partaken in them. What I can briefly comment on is co-op campaigns. Aside from the occasional lag and crash, I can't really complain about it. The hard part is finding someone who's willing to invest a chunk of time into it with you. Haven't played Shogun 2 co-op in a while, but friends say that Rome's co-op feels a lot slower, as you can't manage anything on the campaign map once you have ended your turn.  All-in-all, I recommend the game, especially if your computer can handle it on high graphics settings.",

It´s massive but very hard to understand what to do coz documentation is awefull. People still not know how to effectively balance city´s to control unrest, i finally worked it out (no help in documentation or internet). The worst thing about this game is that you cannot split up armies like in previous total war games, they removed one of the best features :( When you finally starts to get an idea of what to do and how to play it´s deep enough to keep you interested for long game sessions.  This is probably not the best total war game out there but now i enjoy playing it.The prize tage is still 300% to high in my oppinion. it´s worth around 20 euro. But you get a game that you can say triple A to.  You have to live with saving all the time and even then saves go wrong from time to time, strangely loading with 1-2 even 3 turns missing ? Also every 1-2 hours you have to close game and load it again to remove bugs like ratings on generals missing and reports not getting filled in report list. Also rarely one of your armies will not support another army basicly standing so close they share the bonfire. Suddenly you do not know the strenght of what you attack and slums crashing towns into unrest without turning up in report list. Then saves are nice :)  This game clearly needs 1 or 2 bug patches. But it´s playable now.  And it´s MASSIVE in size, insane massive land masses to conquer, this is not a week per campaign game.  Ohh and one more thing, Ai on the big landmap is pretty good and hits you when you least exspect it. It will give a run for your money if you make mistakes.  Went from hate to liking it.",

Graphics poorly optimized for my high end rig with an AMD card. Running absolutely terribly when it should not be.  User interface is terrible.  Battlefield AI is a huge step back beyond Shogun 2, how is this possible? The battlefield AI developer should be politely be asked to take his coat and find another job.  Capture points on a battlefield?! Why should we care about an innocuous bit of dirt on the ground?  Removal of family tree. This was the BEST part of the RPG element of total war. Why would you remove this?!  Addition of far too many 'special' abilities. Come on. This is total war, not Skyrim.  Naval battles are completely broken. Buttons don't work, units don't do what they are told to do. Glitchy crap.  Cities and sieges are completely underwhelming; I understand the point for having less regularity with sieges, but why no great big city in the background, or a small settlement outside of the main city with a fantastic city in the background? Where is the scope and imagination?!  Unit control is now beyond awful. I never used to have to make hotkeys in order to control my army, now I feel I have to because the control element is terrible.  Skirmishing units still can't skirmish. How many years have we waited for this to be fixed?  Phalanxes, oh look they are not working again.  Ridiculous load times on the campaign map, I don't really want to have to make a sandwich and cup of tea after every turn thank you.  The loss of seasons and one year per turn. Less atmosphere, less RPG element with characters, no tactical planning around when the right time is to fight. The campaign map just looks the same ALL the time. Where is the variety?  Tech tree is broken in its current form. Technology should take a LONG time to acquire, to make it more interesting when you actually get it. Right now, getting legionnaires by 250 BC is frankly, ridiculous.  Battle speed, most battles are over within 2 or 3 minutes! Where is the strategy? Where is the tactics? Another point which proves CA are now targeting the casual gamer who are the completely wrong target audience for these types of games.  No zoom button on the campaign map?  The units are interchangeable pieces, with different skins. Some of which are pretty, some of which are distinctly uninspiring.  Less of the wardogs, flaming pigs, flying elephants, and scuba camels. Can we just get a game that works pretty please?  The lethality of units is so high everyone just dies within 30 seconds. Was this even tested?  The audio is boring and lacklustre. Where is Jeff Van Dyck?! The horrendous monotone voices make me want to disable my audio. I've never had this in any total war game.   The terrible thing is, I could go on! There are so many issues with this game.   I was going to give this a four of ten if the first patch actually fixed some of the issues above, HOWEVER..the first patch does nothing to fix anything I have raised. Therefore a buggy, unpolished, uninspiring, boring, beta game which should never have been released this early gets a two out of ten. Its just an unplayable ball of frustration and mess. What a disappointment and HUGE step back in the series after the fantastic Shogun 2, and I know what I'm talking about with Shogun 2, being one of my most played games to date.

Pro's: Looks great visually Revamped culture, trade, diplomacy, politics, technology Unit upgrades are more in depth, army traditions are cool Subertfuge and 'shadow' warfare Huge map Waay more factions than ever before, and they can join together in confederations and such it's a total war game!

The campaign map looks good and is well done. There are many different factions which all have their unique units, buildings and battle style. The battles are epic and diverse, the ambushes are particularly good. There is a diverse unit roster for all playable factions. The naval battles are very good. Good and balanced multiplayer    Now the rant begins.  The ai. Don't even get me started on the AI. AI logic: 'oh look a lot of pikemen in formation. CHARGE THEM WITH THE CAVALRY!!' Just dumb. How in its right mind does the AI think its smart to charge in to a giant wall of pikes?. The AI recruitment. Often i see armies full of crappy units you get at the start of the game OR an entire army of skirmishers. At the start of the game this seems normal because there are limited untis to choose from at the start of the game, but you know something is not right when you see an entire army of levy freemen at turn 100. Of course there are mods to improve the AI like radious or DeI, but CA should have made decent AI in the firstplace.Because of the fact that the AI is autistic, it makes the battles challengeless.Sure you could just up the diffuculty, but that doesn't improve the ai, no it just gives ridiculous buffs to their units. On legendary the ai is still autistic but their previously dog ♥♥♥♥ units can now annihalate your elite units.  At launch the game was buggier than a beehive. All jokes aside, but it was not acceptable that CA could release a game this buggy. You could see men in units phasing through eachother. And their faces....Oh god it still haunts me to this day. Their faces were more deformed than a dog that had been run over several times by a train.poor dog....  CA: ' Hey guysh you wanna play as sparta and athens?' Us ' YEAHHHHHH!!' CA ' Well you can buy it for only £5.99'  a handful of factions for £5.99? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Oh but that's not all, THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE GAME AND THEY WITHELD IT FROM US TO SELL IT AS DLC. They are despereate moneygrabbers. This is not just for the greek states culture pack. there are 7 dlc's you can buy excluding the campiagn packs. These 7 dlc include: Unit packs, a few 'new' playable factions' and a blood and gore dlc. All of which should have ALREADY BEEN IN THE GAME. If you dont mind paying 70 quintillion dollers for dlc, go right ahead and get the game.  The multiplayer is very good it is balanced and fun to play, also its nice for a change to battle an intelligent being on rome 2 instead of battling an AI with the intelligence of a caveman.   Summary: The gameplay is decent, the battles are epic and diverse, there are many playable factions with their own battle style, units and buildings, the campaigns are fun and the graphics are good.However the AI is the equivelent of a goldfish intelligence wise, the devs withold content to sell as dlc (which will empty your bank account) Go ahead and buy the game if you can afford it and the dlc on top, if you are discouraged by the terrible AI dont worry, there are mods to fix it such as Radious and DeI.  -Yours sincerely, Pitviper",

If you buy this game and ALL of its overpriced DLC that some companies would only dignify as a micrtransaction, you will spend more on the DLC over the game. Even games like Battlefield and CoD atleast price their DLC at around $50 if you buy a pass or bundle. If you are new to the franchise and own, say, only Attila, which I personally refuse to buy until it and its 600 DLC are bundles in a sale, than just buy the TW Master Collection, as you can get all of the great games before this one, with all of their DLC, for $5 than this game and its DLC. Then, you wait for a sale, and only buy the blood/gore DLC, the new campaigns, and the Greek culture pack.  Pros:  -Pretty good game, part of an amazing franchise.  -Decent graphics. -One of the best TW games for the budding tactician, as one of the only things they got right was the battlefield. -&lt;Insert a few more things&gt;  Cons: -The videogame cancer that is SEGA, the makers of the Dreamcast yep... lowblow. -CA slowly giving less f's each game. -$$$$DLC$$$$ -Anyone who didnt have a problem with the Greek preorder nonsense.

I'd say right between neutral and likely.   Overall, it's good. The RTS battles are just as good, if not a little better, than Shogun 2. And since most people pick up TW games for the RTS battles, it needs to be acknowledged that the land battles are pretty good. I just wish that the unit cards were better, I really don't like the art style as I have a hard time distinguishing among the different unit types. There are mods out there that change the unit card art, but I don't think a mod should have been needed for this.  The biggest drawback imo is the campaign map. And this is true of Attila as well.  I feel that there are a bunch of things in the campaign mode that are there stictly so that there's something new/different for you to manage. Now you have to manage population, population growth, and family/government influence. Unlike previous TW games where your population was really only something that reflected how much money you could get from taxes, in Rome 2 you need population numbers to actually build stuff. So you might need 4 population tokens to build that new building you want. It's almost like CA just started adding elements that you needed to manage just so they could say the campaign mode is different. Some people like these things; but as someone who's been playing these games for years I honestly just think it's a little annoying and makes the campaign map mode more clunky.  *1. Buy this game on sale. There's a lot of content that is just not included in the base game, and buying all of the additional content to complete the game is honestly just not worth it. Check steam and humble bundle frequently. This game is a few years old, so wait for it to go on sale. there will be a sale, just wait for it.  *2. Buy this game once you have played Shogun 2. I think the AI is more difficult, and the overall game is just more solid. I'm not saying Rome 2 isn't worth buying, but Shogun 2 exists and you should probably give it a go before jumping on this.",

I eventually acquired all the DLC's on sale, and I have to say they all the different campaigns complement each other beautifully. The grand campaign for me takes a bit of tweaking and modding to find the perfect mix but can lead to one hell of an adventure once you find it (thanks to all the brilliant modders for really keeping the enthusiam alive for this game after an underwhelming launch, which pushed CA to continue polishing on thier end). Also, I have become a huge fan of Historical video series that have been created using this game, it is a testament to how much this game can offer. I tried at one point and maybe will come back to it at some day. Once I build my new PC I plan on getting into multiplayer battles, which I never experienced, and put my tactical expertise to the test (or get wrecked). CA can never get enough credit for allowing someone like me who had watched Gladiator 10 times before I was even a teenager to experience these massive, hellacious battles from the ancient world in stunning detail. To another 20 years of Total War. END OF UPDATE   The previous Rome and Mediaval 2 have set the bar extremely high and I was very excited to see the latest installment to the series. I understand there have been other entries in Total War series since those two gems, but the smaller map of Shogun and the newer technology available in Empire put them in seperate categories in my opinion. The presentation is top notch as usual and really brings you into the time period. Rome 2 tries a number of different things and while some are great ideas that are definite improvements over the previous titles, others are a little dissapointing.   A list of the good changes/improvements from Rome and Medieval: *Settlements now have garrisons, and different buildings will generate specific troops that will defend the city. *Agents have more available actions and can enhace armies and settlements in different ways, and also hinder the enemy. *All characters (agents, generals, admirals) can be upgraded in whatever areas you choose. *Armies and navies carry traditions, and while the troops may be destroyed the traditions can be reinstated. (This is defenitly one of my favorite features of the game.) *Allies can be given war targets to conduct a joint attack. *Armies and Navies operate together and you can launch awesome naval invasions and deliver your troops right to the enemie's gate.  And now some of the new features that are not quite improvements but still have potential: *While it is more realistic that only generals can lead armies outside of settlements, it also prohibits you from combining forces and the limit on the amount of generals you can have slows the game down. (Admirals and navies work the same way.) *Holding slaves is a good idea but they don't seem to benefit you in any way and instead simply revolt against you again and again until you realize to stop enslaving your defeated foes. *The abilities that units have on the battlefield do provide an advantage but it also leads to micro-managing as your constantly activating them and then waiting for the cooldown. Once again good concept but not good execution. *Only capitals have wall defenses, the other villages cannot be fortified which doesn't make much sense. *The politics system seems useless and not nearly as engaging as it strives to be. Alot of work can be done in this area. *At some point Rome will become divided and a civil war will break out, but there should be more factors that lead up to it and affect it's outcome.  I admire CA for trying new things but the diplomacy and politics seems a bit stripped down from Rome 1 and Medieval, and it becomes a bit repetitive. Constantly fighting slave revolts and losing settlements because they can't be fortified becomes frustrating. The battles are thrilling, but the enemy A.I., espicially when you are under siege, is so predictable that you'll be able to win no matter the odds. Most of these issues are just minor annoyances, but its the performance issues that have turned away many Total War fans. Thankfully those of us who have been patient have seen a much improved game, either from updates or fan-made fixes. The fact is that for $60 you would expect more from the developers of such a great series, and I am still shocked at how CA expects us to pay even more just to play as factions that should have been in the game to begin with, like Sparta and Athens. I refuse to pay for the DLC campaigns unless they offer some major improvements to the base game.   All in all, this is a great game and even at full price I can recommend it to strategy and history enthusiasts, and as usual the large amount of mods can offer significant improvements to features you dislike, so try them out until you find the perfect match for you. 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "Horribly shallow. Many of the criticisms leveled at this game are to do with the technical bugs. My bigest bug-bear however is the lack of soul in this game. The original game drank a minimum of a hundred hours of my life with its depth in the game mechanics. This game will entertain you for an hour, maybe two..... but the mechanics are soo limmiting.  Allow me to extrapolate; 1) the new city and province system means less cities, less tactical positioning (due to the renforcement system), faster conquest meaning you can steam-roll your opponants in a very short time. 2) the new familliy and polictical features might as well be absent because they pretty much are, they have little if no depth and very little effect. You never get attached to characters so you cant even invest in the personal story and devlopment of a character and his familly. Also- no family tree. 3) In battle game mechanics are at best inconveniant and at worst downright breaking the game (admittedly they have apparently patched this since). 4) Buiness model..... breaking off parts of the game to sell as paid dlc or pre-order bonus'. I sadly paid for a pre-order for factions which are already in the game. This is a practice that really needs to stop- dlc is meant to ENHANCE your experiance, not steal from it. This is just pure greed and very consumer unfriendly. 5) Lackluster design. The game looks horrendous on anything but a top-tier machine. It actually looks worse than its 10-year old predecessor. The designs are generic and disinteresting with a horrible art-style to boot. A poorly optimised source engine also meant that even when playing this with a computer well over the minimum specc, and being forced to play it on low/medium, it stutters with a framerate of 5 frames per second in the 'cut scenes'.  In all- a heartbreaking mess for anybody who loved their previous games. Be warned- this is an avoid and if you are really desperate to play this than Id say its not worth anything over £10.",

The AI is littered full of bugs, the between turn 'other faction' time is still ridiculous, and the units have been diminished.  Skirmishers in Rome 1 would carry two spears. Now, they carry roughly thirty each. Though this has made them significantly more useful, it's not realistic in the slightest. Further, and much to everyone's dismay, the God forsaken 'Flaming Sticks of Death' are still present. Attacking some walls? No siege equipment? No worries, just throw some sticks at their gates and burn them down in seconds. That's unrealistic enough, but you carry on the assault after that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you'll find the gates have an infinite amount of boiling oil in a nigh neverending stream of death. 5000 legions dead in 2 minutes flat. I guess that balances them out, but why they couldn't have forced you to make siege equipment AND limited oil instead is beyond me.  But that's just you attacking. Defending, you might as well just put your feet up. I've successfully defending against 10,000 angry gaul with just a few hundred dagger wielding untrained plebs. Why? Because the AI doesn't understand sieges. In fact, it becomes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the first second of a siege. They actually patched it so that the AI can spawn with ladders to attack your walls, rather than simply blindly charging with Flaming Sticks of Death every time, but all that's changed is they now push the ladders to your wall before thinking '♥♥♥♥ climbing that ♥♥♥♥' and begin throwing Flaming Sticks of Death at your gates.   Oh, and the patches broke War Dogs. My favourite unit, which mowed down enemies, but for some reason glitched when the handlers were the other side of a settlement's walls to the dogs which could cause a game crashing bug. They patched it, and instead, the handlers now CHASE AFTER the dogs to engage the enemy too! I don't know how they can actually break something more in a patch.  The list goes on and on, many of the bugs are niggly little things (for example, siege weapons will 90% of the time reposition after ordering to attack someone, even though they already could perfectly well hit it).   I enjoy playing Rome. But it's too broken, and abusable. I've only got as far as I have in my game due to the broken AI, and it's unavoidable to encounter the broken AI. It's fun in the beginning, and many of the bugs are ignorable, but after just 10 turns it becomes blindingly obvious that this game is neither complete, fixed, or enjoyable in the long term. And the icing on the cake? It's not even realistic.  Final thought: They did add a patch which introduced the revolutionary mechanic that formation units will try and stay in formation. Shame that after so long, testudo is still broken, so raising your shield above your head actually increases the missile damage you take.",

On one side many things have been improved like the Campaign U.I making it easier to manage settlements, armies and navies. The setting is perfect, it feels as if the Roman period is THE period for stratergy gaming, But the release of Rome 2 was shameful. Massive bugs, pathetic A.I and barebones features. After several patches the game is starting to take shape but it shouldn't of needed to as CA should have delieved on the hopes and expectations this game created. I personally think Rome 2 after it's patches is very enjoyable for both veteran Total War gamers, newcomers and general history lovers. I recommend this game to anyone interested in stratergy games and now that it is on the Steam sale, definatly pick this one up. The game consists of turn based campaign and real time battles. On the campaign map you build up your settlements, creating buildings to achieve various pursuits. Recruit troops for your armies and navies. Engage in diplomacy with other factions to form alliances and trade agreements. Use your agents to foil the enemy, train your soldiers and improve the happiness of your people. Real time battles are immensly fun and give you a sense of awe. Hundreds of Roman legionaries crossing swords with barabarians or Spartan Hoplites going head on towards some African Elephants. It is a sight to behold. Mulitplayer campaigns are fun when you get them to work,most of the time you will de-sync which is very annoying and frustrating. Multiplayer battles are the only other form of multiplayer which is a shame as Shogun 2 (Rome 2's predecessor) had customizable armies and generals, a campaign mode called avatar conquest, it is a shame to see this feature go. If you can look past some of the issues such as barebones features and occasional A.I issues, Rome 2 is a game you can invest hundreds of hours of gameplay into. A fun and interesting stratergy game, Rome 2 at present gets a 7/10.",

            "review_text": "I, like many other TW stalwarts, bought RTW2 on release day (in my case a retail copy). As some may have heard: reactions were... strong. It is a sad fact that CA released what was clearly an unfinished game (I do not blame CA however as it seems more likely that SEGA were responsible - I cling to the hope that it was another case of business execs, knowing nothing about games, pressuring the developer to release the game ahead of schedule even as the team cried out for more time (it's EA, Bioware and Mass Effect 3 all over again!)). I however, was one of the few lucky ones who had no serious graphical/loading or indeed any problems at launch (in fact I was able to run Rome 2 on higher settings than I ever had Shogun 2 and still have a stable game - something that the many patches released since has reversed). So when I was so blessed as to play the game without obstruction what did I find?  A pretty solid game to be honest. Though the AI was not the best I had ever encountered I never experienced any of the horror stories of enemies charging towards my lines only to turn and bolt at the last second (there were also naval battle issues but as I auto-resolve all naval battles anyway this did not trouble me in the slightest). The AI in battle seemed to me no better or worse than in Shogun 2. Campaign AI was another story. Suicidal armies attacking well defended settlements with 1 or 2 units, AI moving their armies to nonsensical locations and making absurd demands in diplomacy. Check, check and check. But to CA's credit the patches released have improved these issues considerably. Graphics by contrast is the mirror image of AI. At launch I was stunned not only by the quality of the graphics but the fact that I could run them on middle-high settings without a significant frame-rate loss on my Windows 8 Dell Inspiron 15R laptop (yes I play my PC games on a laptop laugh it up). Mutant faces and blurry textures were only a problem when I zoomed out from my beloved legionaries. Sadly that is only a memory now as patches inteded to fix the problems that plagued the majority of players seem to have reduced the graphics quality I enjoyed at launch (quite why this is I am at a loss to fathom). But graphics have never been a major concern of mine and I am not very skilled at the TW series (poor AI on easy settings can give me a run for my money on a 'good' day) so perhaps I am not best qualified to judge the game on these aspects. What about the features?  One complaint that I often hear about RTW2 is the lack of family trees in the campaign. This complaint (I feel) is based on a lack of understanding. Roman patrician families were not 'royal dynasties' like in Medieval Europe but were more akin to Mafia families. Not all patricians aligned with say the Julia would be related by blood or marriage but instead are bound by employment, friendship and debt. Thus a family tree would be of little use in laying out relations within a faction. However this structure would not apply to more hereditary factions so the failure to include a family tree for non-Roman factions is a failure on CA's part. As for the capture points. I hate them (at least when they occur in small settlements and open field battles). Diplomacy is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand there are now some interesting options and it can serve a purpose beyond extorting money and establishing trade (marking war targets is helpful). On the other hand some older features missing that should have been included such as territory trading and being able to specify the exact value you pay/demand from another faction (as things stand if you want to bribe a faction into helping you in some way then an absolute minimum payment is enforced based on your faction's total wealth - this is pretty annoying when you are a highly prosperous state dealing with a measly minor faction and have to offer them double their entire treasury to get them to agree to a non-aggression pact - can't we haggle?). The main feature which annoyed me was the 1-turn=1-year system. Quite apart from ridding the game of discenable seasons it also means that generals and agents never develop as they die of old age before making a mark on the world. This means that only incredibly long lived or active characters ever recieve the higher upgrades. Fortunately a number of mods are available on the workshop to tweak this to many degrees (I personally recommend the 24 Turns Per Year mod (1-turn=2-weeks)).  Some will have noticed by now that I am somewhat forgiving of the fact that patches and mods are needed to improve this game. Note well that I am not pleased about that! I would much rather that CA had released to us the game we had been promised. The one shown in demonstrations. But it would seem that SEGA are the guilty party in denying us this. As a publisher SEGA naturally have no real talent but profit from the talent of the studios they publish. To SEGA CA making a TW game is not an exciting prospect for the same reasons as it is for us. We look forward to a new game in a great series. SEGA see an oppurtunity to make more money. Thus they encourage hype and release games early to maximise their profits. The problem with this of course is that the game then fails to meet expectations. Hopefully, SEGA will learn from the disaster that was the RTW2 launch and allow CA more creative control in future (note 'hopefully' - we have no idea just how stupid the guys at SEGA are but repitition (or not) will tell). But as for Rome 2 itself? It's a decent game, much maligned and haunted by it's stumbling first steps into the light of day. But it is my own fervent hope that the patches (a sad necessity) released by CA will eventully bring Rome 2 up to the level of game we hoped for.  7/10",

A strategy title removing many options to simplify strategy is just stupid. You are limited on the way armies can be built. You are limited with ways to reinforce them. You are limited to how towns develop. You are limited to how spies/diplomats/champions work. In battles you have to defend random FLAGS in OPEN FIELD BATTLES for NO REASON AT ALL. The idea was to streamline fights... But I don't want streamlined battles that's why I'm playing your stupid game... Its as if the developers copy pasted Rome... and then found all the ways to make 8 year olds be able to click anything they want to play.  Highest budget ever and yet we have the same AI problems.

There are a lot of cool aspects to this game if you're a first timer. The conversations the soldiers have between themselves is a nice touch (although forced in my opinion). And the battle sequences are entertaining (to start off with).   However quite quickly you get over the the pointless frills of the game and you get into the grit of it. As a huge fan of this game since Rome: Total War I am absolutely livid with the progress. The Grand Campaign makes no sense to me. So many buildings have negative effects on your campaign (i guess to promote balance). Generals will fight two or three battles before they die of natural causes so you will never really develop a general into a scary ♥♥♥ mutha f***** (which used to be one of my favourite aspects of the game). There is no family tree (which is also one of the most annoying aspects of the game). And the inner faction conflicts make absolutely zero sense and have zero visible effects on the game. Also irregardless what you do in the game you face WHAT IS THE MOST ANNOYING PART OF THIS GAME is 'civil war'. When I say it is the most mindless addition to the game I am not understating it. I have crushed the civil war twice in two seperate campaigns but it is just an annoyance. Nothing else. You would never say, 'oh yeah, that's a cool addition. That makes everything really interesting'. Instead you will be left cursing constantly at your sheer disappointment and quit at the first sign of those banners.  Unfortunately, this seems like the path that the Total War series has decided to take. In Shogun 2 it was the same thing, where all of the factions would turn against you and just begin an onslaught. As all series do, Total War seems to be losing it's way a bit. Medieval 2/Rome was still the best game Total War game to date, simply because everything was awesome in it and I never stopped dropping my jaw.  Anyway, because there is no neutral button I would have to say No, do not purchase this game. ",

Recriutment, though the Garrison only really needs Pikemen, the fact that you cannot recruit to your town or city is a departure from every Total War game before it. It does take some getting used to. 4. Why can't we recruit nobles to help with happiness? Every turn I face slave revolt imminent from at least 10 cities.

Sparta can't unless you declare war against your own Allies at Athens or take another City that allows it.

Pros:  Amazing Atmosphere Amazing Maps Amazing Sound Design Amazing Animation Great Graphics Great Music Surprisingly Immersive Relatively Historically Accurate Combat Mechanics consistent with the series Great game for Total War players (like myself)  Consistently being updated with bug fixes  Cons:  TERRIBLE AI Very disappointing multiplayer Vs.  Extremely slow multiplayer Campaign load times Graphical Glitches for a majority of players Unit Power Balance Issues More taken from the franchise then added As with the rest of the franchise, long loading time is present Bulky UI   Immersion is known as one of the most important aspects of gaming, a game designed around making YOU feel like you're playing the character, or a general moving armies is very important part of gaming. Immersion can be achieved with graphics, sound, and realistic map styles. Rome II gave me the immersion feeling, I felt, in all honesty, like a bad ♥♥♥ general. The sound design, graphics and animation played a very heavy part of this. For those people who think that RTS, TBS, or similar games cannot give immersion, I invite you to try Rome II.  Unfortunately, the game falls short on far too many issues. The AI for the game is poorly designed, to the point where even the newer players will notice. Either they make terrible decisions, or just stand there.. and never move. Waiting for the player to attack.   The multiplayer is by far my most disappointed aspect. It goes without saying, a great multiplayer will keep a game alive. Conversely a multiplayer without features is an easy way for players to lose interest in the game. I really hope they add more features to the multiplayer soon.  I am very impressed with the attention the game is currently receiving from its support staff, and the programmers that are consistantly releasing updates. If they keep this up, the game will keep going strong. Either way though, you only get to make a first impression once, I'm sure they know that, and so do the hardcore fans. Rather disappointing.   Either way, I would recommend this game for anyone who loves either RTS games, or history buffs. For newer players, I recommend it a couple months down the line, wait until they fix all of the resounding issues.",

This game lacks all of that, instead is a game were loosing your Generals has bearly any consequence, the engagements feel lame, and almost all Barbarian units look alike. I remember in Rome 1 how i was playing as the Julii family, trading with powerful Empires and signing many important deals, i had an economical Empire. Just to have the armies of Gaul pass between the Alp mountains with an army 10 times my size (i had 5 full and well equiped armies) to take most of my territory in 25 turns, on my last settlement i sat with few men and my last General, i was staring at defeat in the eye when the Senate brougth up their armies and helped me retake back my territory. For the next 20 turns i repaired my cities and my military, to strike back at Gaul and make an Alliance between Spain, Britania and i the Julii wich defeated the Gaulic dogs in less than 10 turns. That was Epic, that was intense but this game falls short and lame. Shame on Creative Assembly for creating the worst Total War till this day, i hope the next Total War to come migth be set in WW2 or WW1, it migth give this new engine they have a game they can make, cause so far it haves failed with Empire and Rome 2.",

Although it certainly wasn't when it first came out. I was one of the few people who could actually play the game from the beginning since I have a fairly powerful gaming rig and I was absolutely disappointed. I tried with all my strength to love Rome 2 from day 1 but I just couldnt bring myself to enjoy it. So, like so many others, I left it. And I waited for CA to fix it. They most certainly did.   Now, I won't say that the vanilla product, even now, is a perfect game because it isnt. But if you get certain mods(i.e. Divide et Impera, any of Radious' stuff), which take no effort to install, this game quickly becomes one of the best strategy games out there in terms of gameplay, history, replayability, and just simple fun.   I HIGHLY recommend this game (with mods) to anyone who loves strategy and Roman history. You will not be disappointed.  PROS: +Great unit variety in bigger factions (all factions have awesome unit variety with mods) +AI offers a fairly good challenge  +You will truly feel like you are fighting real wars with real mens lives at stake, especially in the mods. +Army traditions/leveling up generals add a great incentive to keep armies alive and make each battle a little more tense. +Very easy to get totally immersed in the game and lose hours to it.  CONS: -Barbarian unit variety (without mods) is poor.  -Sometimes you can feel too overpowered as a player, especially when playing as Rome -Seiges are VASTLY improved from how they used to be but they still aren't that great.  -UI sucks  Neutral: +/- Most battles are won as soon as you turn the enemys flank. This makes complete sense and is ALWAYS satisfying, but things can get repetitive occasionally. Especially when fighting a series of small battles. +/- Some factions that should be powerful can get wiped out very early game (i.e. Carthage, Athens, Sparta, Rome). I can best describe this as disappointing. Because all the fantisies of having Legionaries pitted against Spartan Hoplites can get stomped out very early on in the campaign. Although this isnt a bad thing because it leads to very interesting diplomacy and wars later in the game.    Bottom Line: Total War: Rome II without mods: 7.5/10  Total War: Rome II WITH mods: 9.5/10",

There are many cultures who play different from another culture, so it won't be the same playthrough time after time like it was in Shogun 2. The siege AI had a major overhaul in patch 14, and no longer uses torches most of the time, and will instead opt to use siege engines, and even reuse them. The battle AI is among the best in the game, far superior to Shogun 2's AI where it will not only flank, but it will also attack your rear if you are not careful. I myself once got caught off guard by battling two armies, and instead of them combining like they did in previous games, one went around me and attacked my rear catching me by complete surprise. The province system, once you get use to it is great as you don't have to hover over the particular city to upgrade either it, or the buildings in it. You can also dictate a number of edicts, which at the moment is not all that great as they have no advirse side effect to them. The polticial system is still in need of some serious work, but it is better than it was at launch. The overall system stability is far better than it was at launch, as I no longer have any chrashes, and most of the glaring bugs are fixed.   Overall, this is a really great game, and worth every dollar. Just a heads up though, it is not as pretty as Shogun 2, but this game has far more soul to it than Shogun 2 does in terms of faction uniqueness. Also, before anyone asks, no there is no family tree.",

In fact, if you tailor the game with little mods here and there, like applying music from the first Rome, or getting rid of civil war or limiting agents (just minor mods) from steam workshop, the game is actually enjoyable than any other game CA has produced - even more so than Shogun, simply because how massive the Rome's playable map is.

The game is now a good representation of the series and I have to say I am really enjoying it. The large battles and beautiful seiges are fantastic, building an Empire in this game takes not just time and effort to do, making it really rewarding but also a lot of effort to keep together which is great as it keeps you on your toes, I find myself getting pretty attached to my Empire because of the work put into it and proud too!  The new poltical system, if you have played EU4 you might find it similar to stability, really makes every charecter in the game personal which is a nice touch. The provence system is good because since multiple factions can own a single provence it leads to a kind of border friction so it's great for the war diplomacy aspect but on the other hand sometimes you can go to war with factions without capturing whole provences and therefore lose the benifit of being able to issue provence wide edicts for bonus's. Playing as the Selucid Empire I went to war with multiple factions at the same time and fought a hard war, won them all but captured no whole provences for example.   The game has improved, a lot. The AI is smarter, it uses units much better and seiges are a lot more fun and challenging. The AI makes effective use buildings now on the main map and the diplomacy seems much improved as I used to get war declared on me a lot even if I was obviously going to win.  Point being the Devs have definatly fixed probably 80% of all my complaints (I didn't go into all of them on my negative review, I could have gone on for a while..) which is great. I would now reccomend the game..",

And even after the civil war broke out, those factions are still in the senate!! surely we should have excute them all. but we want to give them another chance to plot other civil wars in the futuer. well done CA and SEGA I did not and will not buy any of their DLC, because the game is broken, it is so badly made, there is just no chance for any fixes that will bring it remotely to what shogun 2 has achieved. Hornestly if SEGA and CA cares profit so much, they should really make sure the quality of the game is high. In stead of looking for a quick cash in and release more DLC for even more sales.

The AI, in campaign and battle, has had many bugs ironed out. - Of particular note are siege battles, where there is now a legitimate challenge. - On the campaign gameplay, the building and politics systems were extensively overhauled, although politics does still suffer from a certain level of unresponsiveness and inexplicable behaviour.  This is still a different experience from previous titles, but one thoroughly worth giving a shot. If you're still on the fence then there are Let's Plays aplenty on Youtube.  ****Original Review****  Graphically impressive. Excellent combat animations and sound effects. Streamlined empire management. That's the good stuff.  The campaign itself has the depth of a puddle. The much vaunted politics system is pathetic. Diplomacy and CAI in general is broken. Essentially, you'll be doing exactly the same thing 250 turns in as you were 20 turns in.  Battles are ridiculously fast. Units are horribly balanced. Plenty of features and controls are broken or poorly redesigned. Voice work is mostly poor. 90% of battles are sieges and siege battles are currently broken.  All in all, an extremely poor addition to the Total War series that suffers as much from bad design choices as it does from a lack of optimization and extensive technical issues.",

Rome II Total War wastes your time and resources with intrigue and factions that detract from what serious gamers like to do: fight battles. You can never get enough soldiers where you want them as you are limited to the number of generals that you can have so you have large areas of your realm uncovered were any mutinous rebel force can come in and take them after 3 rounds of combat. That's because the garrison force depletes of manpower after every round of combat while the rebels are completely reloaded after each round that you decimate them as if nothing happened. You cannot build walls around every one of your cities either - unless it's a capital province so you may as well write of those territories to any weak invader or rebel force. The unit icons in your battle force look like a 5 year old drew them and that goes for the silly-looking faction symbols as well. My 9 year old niece may as well have drawn them. And to top it all off, your female agents look ugly. If you like to screw alround with intrigue and factions, then go play Crusader Kings II instead.",

But, as they say, better late than never. So..here goes:  On the whole, I would say buy this game, on sale or no. I think it's worth the money. There has been no small amount of controversy over the bugs and unfortuneately, i think that has put many people that owuld have otherwise enjoyed this game, but instead decided to forgoe buying it all together. For those that did not buy the game, you've missed out. From what I can tell the bugs have largely been addressed and rectified, and the correction of these bugs (I never noticed them. I never had one problem with the game. I still don't know what everyone was talking about. I started to suspect that people were playing this game on a PC or Laptop that simply did not have the chops to play and truly enjoy this game at its full potential. And therein lies the rub. If you have a low end PC or a laptop that did not cost you about 1100 bucks to purchase, chances are you will be very miffed. This is a VERY high end game. And when you experience the cinematic view during a battle, you will understand why. While there has been every effort made to make this game agreeable to lower end PCs, you are doind yourself a disservice if you do nto have a newer model video card designed for PC gaming with it's own onboard RAM, and enough RAM otherwise to choke a yak to play this. I know it's not the be alll and end all of computer graphics, but for Total War, their battle engine and it's cinematic mode are beautiful to behold and are singular in the TW Franchise. If you DO have a good high end machine, buy this game, and when you are following your unit of Hastati through the woods, point your mouse so you look, so you can see the light filitering down through the leaves, and tell me tthat the sight is not beautiful. Not only that, but it tends to put you into the game on a level that was simply not present in the previous installments of Total War. The DLC for this game is outstanding, and the MODing community is very active.     As far as the things that I think CA might have dropped the ball on, I would have to say that getting rid of the family tree, along with the traits of a ruler that you could mouse over in previous TW games was a mistake. The way characters were set up before, it was much easier to, at a glance, discern their personality. I always though that the Devs of the Series had done well for themselves when they created that previous aspect of the game. Lets see, what else....Oh, the Encyclopedia leaves a good deal to be desired, the unit tiles, more specificly, the artwork they use, was a poor choice. I know what they were going for therre, but I don't like it, but there is no accounting for tasste and that shouldn't affect any one's decisions to purchase this game. Finally, the Political system needs a complete overhall. I like the idea of it. It's a good concept, but too little effort was spent in fleshing the political system out, and this is reflected by the the players complete and utter lakc of careing whether or not their factioin leader character has enough Gravitas. The Faction leaders seem....boring, and lifeless with no real reason to root for them, or sing happily when they finally die. From what I have been made to understand, the new game, Attilla, which comes out on the seventh of Fedbuary, will, at least (and hopefully much more) address this aspect of the game with the reintroduction of family trees. I get the feeling that Atilla will evetually far outshadow Rome II as the better of the two games.   Would I reccomend this game? Only if your PC has the chops to play it. I give the game a solid....8.0 of of 10  ",

I don't like it when people put on rose-tinted glasses to declare that so-and-so old game is better than its sequel, and I especially don't like hyperbolic declarations that a game is broken or unplayable. So from the outset I was rooting for it to be not broken and terrible like all the haters are saying.  But.... here's the thing. That's what Rome II feels like. Kind of incomplete and poorly thought-out.  Rome II has a lot of attractive window dressing. The campaign map looks gorgeous, there's a lot of authentic flavour especially that feels like a big improvement over the first game, and I really like the streamlined menu interface - being able to jump right back into your campaign from the launcher for example is great.  But all this window dressing conceal core mechanics that are kind of a mess. The battles are a confusing slog - in ten hours I almost never felt like my skill on the battle map made any difference whatsoever to the outcome of the battle. I get what they're going for with the classical-style unit cards, but they don't do a good job of telling me what is going on at a glance. Likewise with the units themselves - while they look fantastic up close, it is often hard to distinguish units from one another until I zoom all the way down. Naval battles are outright broken. Ships often just stop responding in the middle of a battle. I had a close naval battle that just ground to a halt as the AI apparently also switched off, and the combatants just floated awkwardly at the edge of the battle map until the timer ran out.  The campaign seems to have a lot of potential, but it's full of oblique mechanics that the tutorial prologue and the advice pop-ups don't seem to ever explain. How much negative public order is bad? Why does it take years for a Roman army to march up the length of Italy? What's the deal with slaves?  R2:TW gets a lot of flak for being super buggy on release. This, along with the 'Emperor Edition' label, implies that it is a good game now that the release-day bugs have been ironed out. In my opinion this isn't the case. It's conceptually interesting and pretty to look at, but at its core it just isn't  fun . For this reason I find it hard to recommend.",

But there is a quite annoying problem in the game: AI. Before Rome II, the AI was not very brilliant in campaign map just like in battles but this time CA tried to compensate this lack of intelligence with cheating. AI always musters units much more faster than I do, its agents have a frenzied success rate against mine even though my agents' skills are much better and in battle and low moraled units of AI always stand more than my best units even though they're surrounded from all sides. Also my generals usually dies with one arrow but AI's generals are like a god. Suppose that my generals have stressful lifes and smoke too much.  Do not pay this game the whole price, wait for a sale and buy it with DLCs. Sega always uses players as beta testers. They did that with last 2 Football Manager games so it would be much better for you to wait for sale.",

Rome II could've been the biggest, greatest and best entry in the Total War series of all time. It showed signs of greatness and grandness, but in the end it fell flat due to a lack of production time. Thank Sega for that one.   Pick this game up when it's on sale, it's a decent game in a genre and time period that is not well explored by modern games. If you can get it for 20€, that's fine.   If you want to majorly enhance your experience, go to the steam workshop and get yourself some mods. Implementing Workshop support was the saving grace of Rome II. Personal favourites: 'Radious Total War Mod', '4 Turns per year with season effects', 'Dresden's Sack, Liberation and Diplomatic options' and 'Traits, Talents and Toadies'. These mods significantly increase the fun factor and change the way you'll play the game.  A downside that mods can't fix is the terrible optimization. It runs like ♥♥♥♥ and looks like ♥♥♥♥, and the battle AI remains terrible. Enemy AI sucks at siege battles (You can win with 300 men against 3000 because they never split up their forces) and the clash of melee units will always result in a mosh pit like fight, even your disciplined Roman legionaires or Elite Spartan Hoplitaes will break formation within seconds of the engagement, even when in Testudo or Phalanx, which results in a lot of unnecessary losses and maybe even a loss.   It's still fun though, but only because of mods. Great job CA and Sega. I'll pick up Attila when it's 5€, that's all you moneyhungry punkasses will get from me.",

It adds nothing new worth adding, and the only improvement is in the graphical parts.   Frankly I am not going to buy their games again unless I see a massive improvement. They should have added new things, things that were nescessary, but instead they took stuff out.   Let me put it like this, if I had never played Medieval II before and it was released at the same time (not an updated version or one with modern graphics or anything, just the normal Medieval II Kingdoms game) as Rome II, I would buy Medieval II. As simple as that. I hope that makes things clearer.   Mods just make Medieval II vastly better, try sword and spear (Schwert und Speer), Stainless Steel, Deus Lo Vult or 3rd Age (LotR mod). Rome has (due to the fact that they wanted to sell overprised junk as DLC) limited mod support. So if vanilla is already better, imagine how good it is with 10+years of mods!!

            "review_text": "***I made this post on total war center. I believe it fits as an updated review as well!***  I don't think that battle nor campaign map AI deserves such high praise considering that battle AI does barely more than flanking with 2-3 units on both sides while running straight into center with the rest. I like that AI uses CAV to attack my rear and that it apparently focuses on pike units with its range but that is really all that it got which isn't in all seriousness a whole lot to write home about in my opinion. CA should watch more youtube multiplayer tournaments to get an idea of what is possible when we talk strategy &amp; tactics. For example, splitting an army into two to attack from two sides instead of only focusing center would force - no matter what - the player to react to it. I mean, R2's battle AI is so unimaginative that my favourite game during battle is to beat my casualty record instead of wondering if I had a chance to win or not. They are also always using the same army composition which makes different approaches during battles for AI even harder. The only difference here make those horse archer factions but that's about it...  Campaign map AI frequently declares war on me for no reason, even when way weaker or far away. The only explanation I can come up with to justify their behavior for myself is that another faction probably paid them to do so. A positive thing is that the AI indeed uses agents to cleverly stun one of my armies to attack my second one with superior numbers. A negative point is that AI constantly gets ambushed by my armies due to the fact that it simply has no clue how and when to use 'forced march'. It constantly loses entire armies by sending them over the sea without any protection while the game mechanics, on the other hand, allow it to attach one army to a fleet for protected sea transport. Allies conquer settlements just to lose it one turn later against bigger numbers right next to the settlement and without using other available forces in the immediate area. That behavior forced me more than once to stop my advance to clean up the mess which the AI had caused. Allied AI wastes its forces by taking over settlements which are way too far away from their reign of power just to lose it one turn later instead of concentrating on targets which they're actually able to hold and reach.   There are still a ton of bugs which are admittedly not game breaking anymore but still annoying (see list below). Naval combat, on the other hand, desperately needs fixing. Vessels occasionally get pushed around as if the hand of a divine being was pushing them. AI can use magnetic powers to board vessels. AI can use a second ship to support an ongoing boarding battle while it's impossible for me to do the same. A very awkward situation is when you defend a coastal settlement against an attack from the sea. Such maps only offer a restricted amount of spots to land on, once this amount depletes every other unit of the attacker will just wait on sea without anything happening. This is especially very frustrating when you decide to play without battle timer. Therefore, you either give up or wait until the timer runs out!  I play on legendary and got about 500 hours of R2.   My main problem with R2 at this point besides buggy naval combat is that the whole thing simply turned way too fast into one of those 'shut off your brain and do the same thing over and over again' games almost as bland as fetch quests in MMOs. Instead of streamlining CA should rather take a look at overly complex paradox games like EU4 or CiV5.   The more options AI and player have, the longer players can enjoy the game instead of streamlined boredom...  List of bugs which are still present and annoy me: 1. Forts which are covered in hills. Happens in Wrath of Sparta campaign DLC. You've to attack a fortified AI army in the area between Larisa and Pharsalos. 2. Character portraits which get stuck half-way during the process of popping up so that only their foreheads are visible in vanilla and Wrath of Sparta campaign DLC.  3. Arrow towers which are impossible to be taken over in Wrath of Sparta campaign DLC. I cannot remember anymore on which siege map exactly this bug occurred.  4. Diplomacy and other buttons which are randomly greyed out in vanilla and WoS DLC. You've to fix that by opening another screen like politics (where you can see influence etc). 5. Army signs/emblems which randomly disappear on campaign map in vanilla and WoS DLC. Army emblems will become invisible on campaign map. I think it has to do with reinstating armies but I'm not sure.  6. Factions where way too many generals have the same name in WoS DLC and very rarely in vanilla, too. As Athens, I had once the name Pericles spead over three different parties 5 times at the same time!! 7. When you click too fast between leader portraits on the diplomacy screen, the next leader will finish the sentence of the guy before him with full lib synchronisation! Happens in vanilla and WoS. 8. Sometimes, especially during turns the faction flags of armies turn black several times in vanilla and WoS DLC.  9. During battles units shout randomly their name even when you do not even own this type of unit but fight it! Happend in vanilla and WoS DLC.  [edited 04.02.15]",

I would skip school to play these games on a regular basis, but this game is incredibly flawed. The political system is worthless. Like I said 1,698 hours and the politics have never effected my campaigns whatsoever. The combat leaves much to be desired, the great cavalry charges we saw in Medeival and Rome 1 are gone the one-on-one combat system ruins it to them strolling toward one another to fight individually. The sieges are no longer the great battles they were on the older games either. Units become unresponsive and try to move in strict formation for any order given at all. When told to retreat it becomes them turning around 30 feet away and trying to fight again. It almost feels like a point and click type of strategy.  It's not an awful game, I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. I still do mainly for the time period it's in. But it feels like what could have been the greatest game in the series it just came up short. It's like a young boxer for example that was talked about to be the next greatest of all time but when it came time to prove it he squandered his chance because he thought he had already made it, if that makes any sense.

Graphics are mostly good but still has weird texture issues with peoples' faces and is not at all as it was advertised. Still has stupid redistribution of territories (for example Carthage owns only a tiny part of its territory, as does Seleucia, with the rest being 'affiliates' that in my case at least, declare war on me within the first two or three turns). Vanilla is very arcadey with MOBA-like powers and battles are over WAY too fast.  In summary, the game is 'fair to good' but far from 'great'. I do not recommend playing it without a bevy of mods, particularly Lines of Battle, which dramatically alters the combat making it much more tactical and thoughtful.",

            "review_text": "I think that the Total War Series was right to Choose Rome 2 as the next Total War Game, I've been an enthusiastic Total War fan since Medieval Total War 1. I Loved Rome 1 Total War, and Have played over 1,000 hours. I played the rest of the Total War games and really enjoyed them, especially Medieval 2, and Shogun 2.   That being said, I tried to like Rome 2 Total War... I tried so hard, and couldn't. The Game is terribly broken. I pray that someday it is fixed and fun to play. To be fair I haven't played Rome 2 after the first few months it was released, and many (but not all) little glitches have been fixed since then, but the things that ruined the game for me have not, to my knowledge been, nor will be, fixed. I have only played 12 hours at this point, and I am know that the game has improved since I played it.  First of all The Army/General system is dumb! No longer can you send some units to hold a bridge, or split your forces to accomplish multiple goals. You can't lure enemy forces out of fortresses, nor can you deplete the armies to that their cities are weakly defended. YOU CAN ONLY MARCH A FEW ARMIES AT A TIME,!!!!  '......why???'    Construction in cities is so dumb I don't have time to talk about it. Instead let me role play, 'Ahhh I have my great city, with tens of thousands of people, time to choose what to build, oh look I get a hand full of options to choose between, hmmmm dock, or stable or inn hmmmmmm. WHY CAN'T A CITY HAVE ALL OF THEM? what real city says, oh I'm sorry you've filled all six-eight building slots, we can't build any more. The building and city management seems so dumbed down it is not only uninteresting, but frustratingly limiting. Also I shouldn't have to choose between two buildings to decide what defense is SPAWNED to protect the city! To see an intelligent model for comparison observe the way it is done in Rome 1.  Also Why can't you build city walls? how is it a siege without walls? baahhh  My review is that I love that creative studios made this game, I just wish they had made it well. I dreampt about this game for years. When it was released this game dashed my faith in Total War and the direction it is taking. I've gone back to Rome 1 and medieval 2 because they are much better games. I also really enjoy Shogun, because even though they had started to mess up building management, the game still contained soo much genius, art and strategy that it was a blast.  I plan to Check in on Rome 2 every year or so, hoping that either through patches, mods, or a combination of the two, this game can become a worthy sequel to Rome 1.",

But I recommend it, this is total war brings the Roman era to a great height on your PC, provided you have a suitable configuration",

Alot of reveiws say this is the reason why they are not buying anymore and or dlcs or titles form TW again. I believe that they may have lost money in the overall scheme. Not many people buy the extras so they just made the game look stupid selling it in pieces but people got less content for their money leading them to invest it elsewear. They might as well give away all the DLC's now. During christmas and say it is a present. This should pick them some sales as well as boosting peoples opions about the franchise.",

Yes there are many faults but constructive comments helps developing. Its a beautful game.  And finally Yes stop making money off basic 'add ons' but I can only blame Steam for this growing culture. We've all heard this before.  -Great combat Engine Total War group, just focus on AI ability without these massive advantages they seem to have when increasing difficulty. Faction objectives, attaining them if unable one way. Very difficult I understand. Hearts of Iron 4 has a great Engine for this on a world map base. Very Clever. Something to look into?  -Little bit more work on units indeviduality... the workshop really has shown some imagination and work ethic on this idea. Detail without driving Computer demand through the roof. Which is another fantastic point of this game, again well done. Was a shock.  -Naval Combat ability... it's a little bad lol, but great graphics and Smoothness.  -Possibly a freshen up on Leaders and heirachy but very nice work on political idea's and 'balance' as you're empire expands. maybe even ability to customise?  There are other points but thats developing research, of which i'd love to be part of as a dream. Keep going Total War Group... I can imagine a re-run of Medievil 2 on the cards, super exciting.  This is a fantastic game people, yes the add ons are expesive but you can thank Steam for that culture that they have promoted. There has been so much further development in this, it is unreal since the original 'Rome Total War'.  its a 9/10 Game, expect no less. Fantastic combat engine. Stunning.",
