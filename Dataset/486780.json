            "review_text": "This might be a fun game for children, but it is not a fully fleshed out game in any way. You can 'slice' the fruit in half with the flat of your blade (simply impossible with a 'real' sword unless you are baseball-bating it) or the back of your blade.  Additionally, it doesn't really have much to add beyond what you get for the free phone game.  While I've never returned a game before, this one is getting refunded. It is DEFINITELY NOT in any way shape or form a $15 game. If it was $5, I'd keep it...but this is not worth it at all to me (and I've kept terrible VR games just to further the the VR market). This game is just overpriced for what they are trying to sell it for and they are just trying to cash in on the name recognition from the mobile phone game. I'm going to wait for Zen Blad to come back which seems like a much better game from what I have been able to read.",
