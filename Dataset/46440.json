    "description": "Battle it out on the proving grounds and get ready for Future Wars. Similar to classic titles such as Advance Wars and Battle Isle, the game takes strategy gaming away from the micro-management overkill that it has become and using simple, proven rock-paper-scissors principles, reopens the genre to everyone.",

The plot was uninspiring, the characters at least as much. The art, animations and unit design also leads much to be desired. Complemented with bugs, and a lack of other Advance Wars features mean that even Hot Seat and Editing fail to make this enjoyable and engaging.  Much regret on my part for buying this game...",

(no snow or deserts?) *Play by mail, need I say more? The game is chugs a lot. Not sure if my PC is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but, I mean I can play Team Fortress on it just fine, but THIS. NOPE. Overall its not worth the five dollars. (I bought it with a coupon for 50 cents, and it still wasn't worth it :I) ",

The game isn't as good as it seems just go and buy the newest age of empires and you should be happy. The game is the same type of game as civilation or age of empires.",

            "review_text": "Future Wars is a turn-based strategy game where you build units to destroy your opponents' armies and capture their headquarters, much like Advance Wars. In fact, it's so much like Advance Wars that it falls in the 'blatant ripoff' category. The formula is the same, the strategy is the same, even the maps are the same. The only difference is the design, where the bright and distinct pixel art is replaced by 3D models that all look the same. What I saw of the story was stupid and pointless.  The games in the Advance Wars series are wonderful strategy games. Sadly, Future Wars just doesn't quite live up to the game it emulates. If you think you might be interested, get a DS or a much cheaper GBA and buy any version of Advance Wars.",

The camera angle is unique to say the least, it doesnt even go where you want, very original. the multiplayer isnt even multiplay. infact, you cant play multiplayer. Its the best multiplayer ever.  Its litterally like civ 5 but much better with all dlc.  lets not forget grafics. its litterally bf4 crisis 3 engine superamizing cod 100 worth.      ",
