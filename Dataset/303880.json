            "review_text": "A tedious, easy bore with poor controls and non-existant level design. This looks and plays like someones school project.   PROS: -Nice 'rim' and edge mechanic.   CONS: -Need to permanently hold down fire button. No reason to ever let go. -Very bad controls. (EXTREMELY hard to move left/right accurately) -Progress and level design are extremely poorly paced -Keybind not documented and doesn't really make sense (only joystick bindings but default controls with mouse and keyboard...) -BORING levels, impossible to lose (the first 13 levels that I played, all you do is hold down the mouse button and move your hand left/right. You cannot lose....you don't even have to look). -Not much in the way of menus or options (and those that exist are not easy to find or navigate) -No leaderboards",
