(but is still more fun when you play it with a friend).   This is not your standard action adventure-Tomb Raider game. The game has an isometric view and is all about small puzzles and killing enemies, while still collecting treasures. The awesome graphics really add to the atmosphere and the level (not Steam) achievements keep things fresh and interesting, with a high replayability.   As I said before, the game truly shines in co-op mode where you actually have to depend on each other to complete objectives.  Lara Croft And The Guardian Of Light lasts about 6-7 hours or so, depending on if you're a collector or not.  Highly recommended !  [Rating: 88/100]",

It has online multiplayer CO-OP which is awesome. Playing coop you WILL have to use team work. You either play as Lara Croft or Totec. Lara mainly uses guns and grappling hooks while Totec uses spears and shields.  In coop Lara will use her grappling hook and Totec must walk on it like a tight rope to advance in puzzles or platforming. Totec uses his shield to help boost Lara upward and throw his spears on the walls for Lara to do some parkour action. Both of these mechanics are a must and can not be avoided.  Online or local coop in this is absolutely fantastic and a must play for people looking for some coop fun. Lots of stuff to do with a story and there are fun bosses to battle as well. Can grab the complete pack for $20, but goes on sale a lot for $5. Extremely recommended! Play this game.",

I haven't played single player yet, but in the new online multiplayer, this has caused a LOT of enjoyment as we figure out ways through puzzles, and plenty of laughs as we accidentally get squished, stabbed, and fall to our deaths. Not Tomb Raider, but equally as fun in my opinion.",

CONS: - Storyline, really bland. - Odd bug here and there, but nothing to harm immersion. - If you do local co-op you cannot continue your progress from a save point if you return to online co-op.  VERDICT? One of the best co-op games i have ever played, as it provided much fun and relies on communication.",

            "review_text": "Very enjoyable isometric strategy / shooter / puzzler. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of Tomb Raider even though it deviates from the 3d norm. I'm not particularly a fan of tomb raider and I enjoyed it.  The story is that a curse/god is released and you play as Lara adventuring your way through many levels then do a boss battle to put the boss back into his prison.  The game consists of shooting, dodging and solving puzzles in roughly equal measure. If you rush the game without the extras you'll have it done in 3 - 5 hours. These are 3 - 5 very enjoyable hours and well worth the price.  The levels offer a challenge but aren't too hard and you can generally figure out what you have to do quickly. This is no hardcore puzzler, it's a casual puzzler. In the levels there are lots of optional puzzles which reward you with various things. There are also optional tombs containing puzzles that reward you with very nice extra things.  There are a few things to help you along, and this is where the strategy comes in. You can hold 3 weapons plus unlimited low-damage bombs and your spear (which despite being the weakest damage weapon will be required quite often for puzzle solving). You can hold 2 artifacts and 1 relic, which change the attributes of things like defense, speed and attack in varying ways. The relic is only activated after you've killed enough enemies without being hurt, or after picking up enough diamonds and when you take another hit, the relic effects are gone. The ammo is very simple. It's an ammo pool for all weapons (except spear which takes no ammo) and the more powerful weapons use more ammo per shot, simple as that. This is all introduced gradually, and does sound confusing, but it's easy to master once you've been playing a little while and the artifacts and relics allow you a few options that can turn a battle where you haven't got a hope around.  Checkpoints are frequent which is great. And you can quit the game and it'll resume from your last checkpoint next time.  The graphics get a bit repetative - lots of beige and brown rooms with stairs and pathways. But the action flows nicely and you're so busy either battling or figuring out where to go next that you don't really care.  Lastly the boss fight was thoroughly enjoyable. It wasn't particularly challenging on normal difficulty, but it lasted a few minutes and didn't get stale or boring.  There are four gripes I have. 1. There are times when the aim-assist (you'll need it, really) can let you down, this is especially frustrating with the weapons that take lots of ammo per shot, but mostly it was very good. 2. Jumping gaps can also be slightly irritating if you misjudge the direction of the controller. 3. The mission briefing pauses the game to pop up on screen. This can break a nice flow you have and left me saying 'I know, I read it before, just let me play damnit'. However, these are necessary so you know what you're doing. 4. It's too easy on normal difficulty.  One last thing. In one screenshot you see spiders. There are many spiders in this game. Nothing really pounces and there are no jumpscares.",

Rather than the traditional jumping puzzles and third person combat, we get isometric, arcade-like, twin-stick shooting and some of the best puzzles I've seen in any action game, ever. On top of this add gorgeous graphics, satisfying weapons and incredible coop gameplay, and you have a real winner.

The co op option shines more than I expected - each player has unique abilities and both players must work together to solve the puzzles ... although you play the same levels in co op, they have all been altered so that each player must use their special abilities in cooperation with the other player to get past each level. Its a lot of fun in co op with plenty of laughs when you or the other goofs up. At the price, its a no brain-er and MUST BUY ... 9/10 score from me.",

GAMEPLAY: It has the isometric view of Diablo, with the twin-stick movement/shooting of Geometry Wars, and platforming and puzzles and treasure hunting and customizable weapon load-outs. The hardest puzzles are in optional challenge rooms, so even if you're not great at solving puzzles, you can keep playing.   CO-OP: Each player has unique abilties, but they have to use their abilities in concert to get through the game and solve puzzles. For example, Lara has a grappling hook, which she can use to create rope bridges for her partner, Totec, to cross. Meanwhile, Totec has spears that he can throw into walls which Lara can use as platforms to reach higher places. There's also separate scoreboards, so you can even compete against each other for the highest score while solving puzzles together!  Play it!",

I just spent twenty tedious minutes trying to get past one puzzle, and died time after time without making any progress at all. I am a HUGE fan of the franchise, but this is getting uninstalled now. I seriously regret wasting my money on this.  Update 2015-02-06: This definitely a game for a controller or joystick. If you're a keyboard/mouse player, you are probably going to find this incredibly frustrating. However, if you're a controller user, you probably will have zero problem at all. I plugged in a XBox-type Logitech controller I got for another game and had better luck. Personally, I need to re-read the guide to figure out how to play because it's not totally obvious to me, but I could be working off an old save and skipped the initial tutorials. I don't know that I'll put much more time into it... I'm more of a first-person shooter kinda gal. Perhaps if they at least had worked in Diablo, Starcraft, etc. type mouse controls I might get into it more easily.  So, summary: look at screenshots and vids. If this is the type of game you like, get it. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider FPS but don't really play this kind of top-down isometric thing much, think twice.",

There is a high replayability factor as each level comes with a number of challenges, such as finishing the level within a certain time frame, finding hidden blocks or areas, finding all ten red skulls, et cetera. These also reward you with better weapons or artifacts, and sometimes new costumes.
