The gameplay has very tight controls and the A.I. is very intelligent. Aesthically, everything is fantastic: original consistent art style, very fitting music for each environment, and funny dialogue. Great game.",

            "review_text": "Urgh, I nearlly clicked 'recommend', but only because, like me, it might be worth adding another 4p local multiplayer game to your library if you're collecting them. But only for something a little different, not because it's particularly good.  In the end I decided it's wierd to have a 'recommend' and then actually rip it apart in the description. So I changed it to a 'don't recommend' to catch the eye of the devs in hopes they might take on the feedback.  It's main problem is it's just not obvious how to play. You all kind of randomly kill each other over and over and over again, in a chaotic mess ove over-sized bullets that bounce off the wall and are moving too fast to react to. Half of your deaths are by shooting yourself. Yes you can eventually get better at it but the fact that everyone's initial game is just random deaths where you can barely make out what's happening amongst the chaos, is a testimant to how unintuitive the whole thing feels.  By comparison, I use TowerFall in game tournaments at the college I teach at, and people who've never played before quickly become used to it and really get into it, even people who don't normally play games. It's quite obvious what you're doing - you can jump on heads, aim and shoot, and re-collect your limited arrows. You can clearly see the cause and effect - everything is a good size, and a good SPEED, and not cluttered at all (in spite of having 4 players on one screen) and everything important (aiming, kills, etc.) is broadcast very very clearly. AND YET it is still very competative, and you can get very skilled at it, and it can be classified as 'twitched based gameplay' (just as Charge Shot does). I have seen some ♥♥♥♥ from Towerfall, man. You can get so good at it.  With Charge Shot, we played it for a good 10 minutes and I still don't feel like I 'get' it. I get that you kinda don't want to be horizontal with anyone, and if you do pass in front, press the shield button and you'll more than likely bounce the shot they fire at you and kill them. But everything still feels 50-50. Wins don't really feel like wins, just 'oh that turned out in my favour randomly, cool, I guess.'  It does come down to the controls a lot;   The jet pack thing feels fairly frustrating, the delay before it sends you upward doesn't seem like you can use it to get out of the way quickly, and when it does pick up speed, it's so fast you can't really use it effectively and mostly go all the way to the top. So you kind of just float around, kinda trying not to pass in front of anyone.   The bullets are very big, very fast, and bounce off the wall, so once someone fires in your direction, you're not going to dodge it - in fact you're likely to kill yourself from your own shot due to the bounce. That's really unintuitive, to fire a weapon which has such a high chance of killing its owner.  On top of that, each shot has a huge amount of kickback, which added to everything else, is the icing on the cake in really taking control away from you and feel like you're trying to remote control a toy car on a bed of marbles by pushing it around with a stick. That's an analogy I just came up with to express the lack of control we felt we had over the characters.  Look, I'm sure the developers really love this game and are 'good' at it and have fun with it, otherwise they wouldn't have put so much polish on it. I just don't feel like it was tested on other people very much. I don't think it's a good idea to make a game that only you can play, it needs to be acessable as well as being competative and skill based.",

Pros: Pixel art in this game is beautiful. Its great to look at. Fast Paced, and controls are very responsive. Even when playing in singleplayer mode, the AI is pretty good A great game to play with friends Unique variety of worlds.   Cons: Online Multiplayer would be an amazing thing to add. There's no real point to getting every characte Limited amount of content",

The mechanics are very strange, especially only being able to shoot horizontally. The shield needs a bit of cooldown.
