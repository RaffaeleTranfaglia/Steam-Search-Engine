What emerged is an emotional psychedelic roller-coaster of interactive vignettes.",

It is a series of interactive vignettes. Players have to find their own meaning. The trailer is quite a good representation of the game, so if it looks interesting to you from the trailer, grab it. If not... maybe don't.",

            "review_text": "It goes without saying, but don't play this game if you suffer from photosensitivity.  I'm not sure that POP really classifies as a game.  There is no coherent story, and only small segments of scenes that actually have a gameplay element to them, and even there it doesn't surmount to much. That said, this game wouldn't be out of place in a modern art gallery. It would fit right in there. It is very abstract, i guess.  The controls work with either a keyboard or a controller. And it is worth noting that while at the start it says hold anything, not just any button works.  The music in some of the playable scenes is ok.  I wouldn't even recommend this game if you're a fan of 'games that aren't really games', as this just flies right off the scale.",

            "review_text": "What is POP: Methodology Experiment One ?  Genre: adventure, told in different, non-canonical scenes Setting: different 20th century themed scenes, both famous and common, to be travelled by the player Difficulty: 0/10 --&gt; you progress, no matter what. 9/10 if going for achievements Length: about an hour for a single playthrough Mode: singleplayer campaign, replayable 'vignettes' (=scenes)   The positive aspects:  - different scenes from 20th century's history, such as manned spaceflight, mignight air raid, boarding a helicopter in a war territory  - strange scenes mix with bad resolution videos and lets you guess what the story or moral of the game could be (This could also be on the negative side, though)   The negative aspects:  - Horrible controls. In some scenes, you don't know if pressing keys does affect the game at all - The options menu is no use at all. rebinding keys does not work - Loading times. For just a small scene, it can take a modern computer up to half a minute to load  - General slowness. Press a button for two seconds to continue here, press it for six seconds to continue there. Seriously: WTF?! - No storytelling, no moral, no underlined questions, no nothing.  - Considering these aspects, getting all achievements will become a tough challenge, to say the least   Result (and summary for those who have no time reading):  POP's an art game designed by some art-related guy for art students primarily. At least that's what it felt like for me. Actually, being an enthusiastic player of games with a little weird spin, playing it didn't enrich me at all. Plus, short length, screwed controls and loading times impair the playing experience negatively.  Thus I do not recommend buying this game at all.",
