Those criticizing the physics should take note that the game does not come across as one that takes itself too seriously ;) I like it.",

            "review_text": "Boneless Zombie has potential, but it fails to reach it (no pun intended - you'll understand if you've played the game).  The cartoon graphics are quite nice, and the basic idea is fine, but the game is let down by its other elements.  If you play the game for a few minutes, it is fine, but as you start to level up, it just becomes annoying, due to the key mapping. I found the controls to be terrible, especially the use of I and P as main keys; I think that it would have been better if it was designed with the two keys chosen to have been right beside each other. In any event, that problem could have been overcome if the game allowed players to change the key configuration, but it doesn't - so it fails miserably on that score.  As a minor point, the Help screen informs players that Esc is the self-destruct key, but it actually is the Space key that is used for self-destruction. As it is one of the few controls for the game, it was a bit slipshod to have got it wrong on the Help screen. Luckily, one of the tips you receive when you first play the game tells you that you can use the Space key for self-destruct, but if you miss that or gloss over it, then the Help screen will be of no use (I only discovered it because the tip appears in a screenshot that I took).  If the controls for this game were improved, or - better yet - if players could change the configuration of the keys used, then that could make all the difference. But, as it stands, I could not recommend this game.  It's fun for a short while, but overall it's a thumbs down for this game.",
