            "review_text": "One Sentence Summary- A high-end point and click adventure with great graphics for the time it came out.  ***(If you encounter a bug where the game freezes on the world map, please see my last Con (-) bullet point for a fix)***  --MY THOUGHTS-- I got this game very cheaply as part of a bundle. I did not know what to expect. This game seems to follow a pseudo-historical timeline, meaning it takes place in a fantasy/historical setting. The graphics are great. This game comes from a time when developers were learning various tricks to make games look amazing with little processing power. Think back to the early ps1 days when they used 3d polygonal characters with pre-rendered backgrounds (Resident Evil, Final Fantasy 7 thru 9). This allowed developers to make games with graphics way more detailed than what would be possible with real-time 3d rendering. Then, even later, developers improved upon that with making these pre-rendered backgrounds more lively like a cinematic video. This game is very much a point and click adventure with 360 degree living/moving pre-rendered backgrounds. For example, you can look every which way. You can see soldiers moving, animals moving, and things happening all around you (quite beautifully, too). When you talk to a person, it moves to a much closer view of the person speaking to you in the similar form of the cinematic vidoes of the past (about xbox360 graphics). The impressive thing about this is, is that this is a game that can run on a 400mhz processor and 128 mb ram.  This game should take most players about 7-10 hours to complete. Below are pro's and con's:  --PROS-- +You can get this game cheaply in game bundles on various game bundle websites. (I've seen it twice so far) +The game has very low minimum system requirements. +The graphics are quite good. + The voice acting is pretty good for the most part, with few moments of exceptions. +The story looks to be interesting. +The game has pretty high production values. +The setting is a fantasy/historical setting, which is pretty creative. +There are some pretty creative puzzles that will make you think.  --CONS-- -The game seems to be a bit dark on it's storyline and setting (some people may like this) -Pretty much all of the characters are selfish, greedy people. Even the protagonist, Spendius, seems to have few redeeming qualities. -The game graphics and style is dated (but it has aged fairly well, IMO) -There are a few puzzles where the solutions are simply too obscure. For example, in one puzzle, the player would need to know that apparently Carthaginian writing is from right to left, from bottom to top, and that the grid without numbers has an opposite order of how numbers appear on a phone (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, etc.). There are one or two other similar puzzles. I would recommend consulting an online walkthrough if you spend more than 30 minutes on any puzzle. -There seem to be a few bugs or compatability problems (I am using win 8). When I changed the resolution, things got really messed up and I had to verify the installation to replace a file. Another time, the game crashed. The biggest error I saw (and others have experienced it as well) is one where after you acquire a animal to ride, you have a map where you can choose where you want to go. After choosing the location, the game simply stops. After an internet search, I found a post on the steam community board where one person mentioned a workaround. If you encounter this bug, press f5 repeatedly, and you will see the cursor slowly move towards the destination. If you have a laptop, you may need to press shift and f5 or another similar button combination. Very strange, but it worked.  --SUMMARY-- All in all, the game seems pretty interesting. The asking price ($4.99) is not bad, but I would recommend picking it while on sale or in part of a bundle.",
