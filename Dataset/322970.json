            "review_text": "One thumb up. Not two. Game is not overly difficult at all. Pixel hunting and cursor control seem to be the most challenging part. Many of the puzzles are based upon ideas that have been used before. Mayan math and the dreaded minesweeper are two of the most prominent. Played most of it in previous games over the years. The graphics are just as old as most off the puzzles. Not a bad game but not a game where you say ' WOW' . Probably a good challenging game for newbies to the genre. Hardcore adventure gamer's will find it to be tolerable. The minesweeper at the end is just a bad way to waste time in the game. I give it a solid 5.",

            "review_text": "An adequate puzzle game, nestled in disappointing packaging.  The puzzle types are standard (some inventory-based, some sliders, etc), though a few do stand out as novel twists on the formula. Unfortunately, the lack of a save system means that you will have to play through the entire game again to revisit those gems. (Achievement Hunters beware: one achievement is granted for completing a certain puzzle quickly, so take longer than the threshold and prepare for your full replay)  The game appears to auto-save whenever the voicework kicks in... Oh, yeah, that checkmark under 'Full Audio' is overstating things. While there is 'voice acting' (more on that in a moment), it only occurs alongside scene transitions or via a specific kind of item. The rest is unvoiced... which I failed to notice right away, missing some helpful tips in the bottom right corner as I was experimenting with the 3D perspective.  That said, the game might actually be improved by silence. The sound quality is perfectly fine, but the performances are flat, merely reading the lines aloud, so characters experiencing fear and stress come off as pleasantly calm... Bye-bye immersion... Also, I imagine that the script itself was translated into English, which would explain some of the stilted dialogue and odd syntax.  I did experience some minor bugs... or, perhaps, amazing superpowers on the part of the protagonist, as he could occasionally see through solid objects or interact with items that were left two screens ago... but nothing gamebreaking.  In the end, I would recommend for puzzle adventure gamers, who have not already been turned off by any of the above. The puzzles were fun, the graphics were fine, and the story was occasionally intriguing, though it does end on a bit of sequel bait. Wait for a sale though...",

            "review_text": "extremely short. Only one vaguely interesting puzzle (the one involving the monkey statues) the rest all things we've seen before. The inventory puzzles are strictly of the understand what you've done after you've done it variety. And the story is...poorly implemented.  On the positive side, the final scene leaves things a bit open to interpretation, so a sequel might be better than this opening act. Also, like all Microids games it is very pretty, but there are really only three scenes: the facility, the island, and the temple.  Also, the achievements don't all seem to be working for me since I did find all the testaments, but the testament achievement says I found zero.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this Subject 13 because I'm generally a fan of puzzle-solving games, but I feel like there are too many rough edges here to ever settle in and enjoy it fully.   I got off to a rough start because the controls are not intuitive. The game's launcher has an option to customize controls, which is misleading because it's mouse-only. As a result, I spent the first several minutes mashing buttons on my keyboard and becoming frustrated because nothing seemed to be working. Further frustrating is that it's possible to accidentally click through the tooltip that tells you to how to navigate the controls. My first ten minutes in-game were completely wasted. I started over twice before understanding that holding down left-click over some items on-screen opens a wheel menu at the cursor.  A lot of the information you'll need to complete the puzzles isn't visible in the default camera view, so you'll have to contort your view somewhat in order to find the key items you need. The camera controls are only unlocked sometimes, though, which leads to frustratingly inconsistent controls. Mousewheel down is a particularly frustrating example - sometimes it means 'zoom out', sometimes it means 'leave this area'. Eventually you'll figure out how to work with the controls, but even after several hours in-game it doesn't feel familiar.   Probably half of the key items you'll pick up present their own puzzles that you have to solve before you can use them. If you spend enough time examining each object (and checking the help/tips) you can probably figure out how to use it. Prepare to spend a lot of time figuring out what obscured detail is preventing you from taking an intuitive path to your goal, though. Have you ever had to use a socket wrench on a ladder before? I haven't. But your character will, and not for any good reason either. The game wants you to make twisting motions with your cursor to turn keys, unfasten bolts or open lids, but these motions feel out of place with the point-and-click style of the rest of the game, and they frequently don't work correctly on the first attempt.   The puzzles cover a pretty wide range of difficulties, from 4x4 sliding-tile-puzzle to Mayan kind-of algebra, but for the most part the game has a help/tips system that gives you a new clue every few minutes so that you don't get stuck. It'll also let you skip a puzzle once, so that if you get completely stuck the game's not ruined. You can only use it once, though. Unfortunately, some of the puzzles don't make any sense, and the only way I was able to get past those was either by brute force (combination locks) or by looking up the mechanics or solution, both of which really spoil the fun.   Some of the mechanics are downright bad. There's more than one instance where you'll have to scour the screen for a nearly invisible button or item, and you won't be able to progress until you find it.   At some point in the game there's a large cylindrical minesweeper-type puzzle that I just can't get past. I've uncovered every non-trap square and marked every trap square, but I don't know what's missing to trigger the completion and after three attempts on just that puzzle I'm not sure that I care enough to try again.   I don't know whether I'll ever finish this game. I feel like I gave it a good effort, and if I'd been able to finish it I think it might have been a good buy at $12.99. As-is, I just feel frustrated.

If I had more time I would love to play this game more in the future. This is a really good game I really like it. It deserves more than this. If you like to challange, this is the game because it's hard.",
