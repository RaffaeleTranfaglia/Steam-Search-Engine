Take this game engine and remake the Steel Panthers series and then you'll be on to something!!   *edit* 8/18/15   After beating both main campaigns I can say that the scenarios were interesting and very well balanced and designed. With a few of them I had to restart 2 or 3 times to get a force mixture that would allow me to win, but it was fun and not tedious. Many scenarios are really long, upto 60 turns+ and after a few missions I realized that the longer they were the more fun I knew I was going to have! Played it long into the night and even first thing in the morning it was the most fun I've had since Panzer General 2. Hats off to the devs hope to see more from them!",

            "review_text": "Order of Battle: World War 2 is a turn-based strategy game developed by The Artistocrats and published by Slitherine Ltd. It was released in April 2015. It is set in World War 2 and there are multiple paid DLC campaigns that unlock new settings based on 'What Ifs' in the war. For instance, Winter War is a paid DLC that covers Finland. Order of Battle primarily is free to try, and this means that with the free version you can play the boot camp tutorial campaign and try the various paid campaigns. Furthermore, if you want to play more campaigns you need to buy them and if you want to play multiplayer you need to own at least one DLC.       Gameplay  ",

            "review_text": "A great game. It offers an interesting look at some of the less explored theatres of World War 2: the campaign in the Pacific and China. A new DLC has been announced that looks at the Winter War.  The game is visually and mechanically very good. The map is extremely easy to understand and the flow of operations is quite clear. The mechanics are quite familiar to hex-based wargames, but the addition of supply and fatigue mechanics make the game deeper and more interesting.   I've been through all the campaigns (some more than once). I'm looking forward to the new DLC (and hopefully more interesting campaigns down the line).",

            "review_text": "Don't read, just go buy it.    You're still here? Ok, let's talk about OoB:P. It's simply the best example of a Panzer General-type game since the original (and it may be better than those revered titles). The game is rock-solid and the production values are high (love seeing the troop animations when fighting). But that's not what makes this beer-and-pretzel wargame great. There's three things going for OoB:P that make it the gem it is.  (1) Combined warfare - sea, air and land. There are so very few games that combine all 3 of these together into a workable package. Most games of this type focus on Barbarossa or Normandy where your Navy has no real application. OoB:P's focus on the Pacific allows them to focus on all 3 and they do this very well. Some scenarios are navy/air only and some are land/air only but most incorporate all 3 into one large package. As such it offers you some wonderful opportunities to work some combined arms scenarios which other games of its ilk do not.   (2) Units - Not too many and not too few. Some games have an overwhelming number of units where it's difficult for the player to keep up. Others have very few units where the game is too limited. This game has a pretty fair number of units and thus you can select the ones that work with your style. My inability to effectively use anti-tank units correctly mans that I don't have to deal with those and instead I can use heavy infantry or light tanks.  (3) Scenario Construction - I saved the best for last. Dear Reader, you probably already know there are many games that play similarly to OoB:P. Panzer Corps, for one, is widely recognized as a very good game. In my opinion, this is where OoB:P beats the competition. I always had a difficult time in PC because I felt the maps were too small for the number of units present. The game turns into a giant slugfest with no room for manuever and thus the scenarios become very much a puzzle and less strategic. Conversely, OoB:P's maps are quite large and there's room to move. The opportunity to flank and even attempt wide encirclements are possible. I have yet to play a scenario that felt constricting. It's the careful crafting of the scenarios that make OoB:P the great game it is.   The only real complaints from my standpoint is the lack of a branching campaign structure and no voice-overs to introduce the scenario (boring text).   Simply put, go look at the hours played in the other reviews. It's not uncommon to see 100 or 200 hours played and thus the game represents a massive value for your money. I'm currently over 20 and I'm not even done with the first campaign. I could easily see myself putting in 100 hours into this great game. So if you're still reading, it's time to get off the pot - go buy this one because you won't regret it. The price may be higher than other games but what's another few bucks if you get double or triple the value (and gaming time) out of it?",

            "review_text": "I haven't played many strategy games, but I got this one because of the Winter War DLC (few games have this interesting theater). I'm completely hooked now.  Without DLC, there's about 10 hours (probably less for hardcore strategy enthusiasts) of gameplay in the Bootcamp campaign, plus the first mission of every DLC campaign, plus an entire Battle of Britain free DLC campaign. It's certainly not lacking for free content.  I played through the Boot Camp campaign first and had a great time. I hadn't wanted to buy the DLC in case I didn't like strategy games, but the Boot Camp campaign convinced me I'd love it. I'm now playing through the Winter War DLC and, at this rate, will be getting the other DLC later too. I'll wait to leave a review for them until I've finished them, but I consider it well worth the $15 I paid already.  The units are interesting and feel different from each other and other nations, it doesn't seem like a 'puzzle' like the few other stategy games I've played (it feels like there's a lot of ways to win, rather than finding the exact combination that will win), the sound and visual design is great, and the game is very fun for me.  I'd elaborate more on what I like, but really, you've got 10 hours of free content (ignoring the free DLC and first campaign levels) to figure out if you like this game or not. If you're interested, give it a try.",

I have played quite a few strategy/war games since then and I would say that this was one of the most enjoyable games I have played. I like the balance, not too easy and not discouragingly hard, you sweat a bit when you win and sometimes you don't. Like that air, navy and land are all integrated. Have played both campaigns - the Japanese campaign reminded me of a strategy I used in USN back in the eighties. Lots of good fun. Thanks",

            "review_text": "I highly recommend the basic game (Rising Sun/US Pacific): Grade A. It covers the highlights of WW2 in the Pacific and is fun to play as either Japan or the US. You keep a core group of units that can be upgraded over time. Units include land, naval and air units. Even a nuclear armed bomber is available at the end.   As for the rest:  Battle of Britain (free mod): Grade F. Not worth the time to describe all the problems because it is unfixable. I recommend not downloading it because it creates an extra step in starting the game. (You have to pick between the basic game and the mod).   Rising Sun: Grade C (meh). Could have been so much better if I could play as the Chinese. What if China had been well led and had received the right equipment? Not much challenge to win as Japan. Some scenarios are badly designed requiring a rush to take objectives that otherwise would be very easy. You can win the entire campaign without ever buying armor or aircraft. Russian pilots flying for China and no American Flying Tigers? Some scanarios are ok, but overall not as good as the basic game.   US Marines: Grade D. All of the scenarios have short time limits because otherwise it is just a matter of time to win. New units include the Buffalo Brewster, a piece of crap airplane. The raider unit is good, but is wasted because the islands are so small there really is not much need for recon units. (They can't take territory and end up getting in the way.) If you want a heavy weapons platoon, (you really do), then you have to pick an army unit because the USMC does not have one. In fact, you could play the entire game with army units. Why is this called 'US Marines'? At least 1-2 of the few scenarios came from the basic game with tweaks, and not much was new or interesting. Kind of a rip-off. Not recommended.   Winter War: Grade D. I played the first (free) scenario, but did not buy this one. The Finns just do not have an exciting army; no aircraft, no ships, and fairly poor armor. The Russians would be unstoppable if not for the dumbing down of the AI, Russian tanks can't figure out how to go around poorly armed infantry. That may be historically true, but it is not fun. Not recommended.  ",

            "review_text": "Order of Battle: World War II is a free to play game, but has optional DLC campaigns that you can purchase for around 10 or 15 or 20 dollars, all totalling up to around $80 (at the time of this review, SEP/04/2016) not including tax. I do advise waiting for a sale if you want all the campaigns, but you can still enjoy about 3/4 hours of play time per campaign.  But, for the main game, it's more of a sort of tutorial with it's main scenario 'Boot Camp', that will explain how the game plays and how things work. This will get you, perhaps an hour of gameplay if you're a quick player. With Boot Camp finished, you are able to select the currently released campaigns from the singleplayer menu. However, if you do not have a campaign, you can click the desired campaign and it will give you the option to either purchase the campaign, or try the first mission of the campaign.  Each of the missions will give you about half an hour's worth of gameplay if you're particularly quick, but the campaigns feature a little more then a dozen more missions to enjoy, with optional secondary objectives to complete that will affect future missions along with five levels of difficulty, all of which help increase overall replayability.  Should you purchase even ONE of the campaigns, you will be able to download community-made scenarios and multiplayer maps without further charge. But, again, it can only be accessed IF you purchase at least ONE campaign. It doesn't matter which one.  Now, with this being a Free game, I recommend giving it a try and seeing if you will like it. If it doesn't seem like a game for you, there's no money lost and you can uninstall it no problem.  I should mention that sometimes, when there's a lot of effects going on and a lot of units are on a map, it's possible for the game to have heavy frame drops and input lag. Not a major problem with turn based games, but it can lead to motion sickness with frame drops and skipping. Lowering the graphics and effects should help with this issue.",
