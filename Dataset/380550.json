            "review_text": "I like the aesthetic/appearance/sounds/music but the game really needs some polishing to be worth playing.  Controls lack tightness and precision - esp movement (360 controller)  If you take hits, the ONLY feedback is a declining health bar and controller vibration - no other clues!?  Enemies spawn in pretty much anywhere/anytime without any warning!!  Enemy bullets travel so fast as to be mostly unavoidable  On some levels you can simply stop playing and you'll survive for long periods as some enemies simply stick to preset patterns and don't hit you (after a while they will kamikaze but I reckon you could make a quick coffee!!)  It's the polish which makes the difference between a shooter and a GREAT shooter - that feeling you CAN avoid the enemies if only you're lithe (rather than lucky)  This doesn't have that",
