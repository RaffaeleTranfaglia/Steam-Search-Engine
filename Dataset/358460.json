            "review_text": "Talisman: The Horus Heresy is a Board Game with a Warhammer 40.000 Setting. The Goal of the Game is to beat the Emperor or the Warmaster Horus onboard of the Vengeful Spirit. To reach your Goal you have to gain a Talisman first, a very specific piece of Equipment, by completing a Task, given at one of the Planets, drawn on the Board of the Game.   The Game can be played with up to four Players in three different Modes: Single Player Mode, Online Coop- or Versus Mode and Local Coop- or Versus Mode. Especially the last one can be very interesting, if you play the Game with your Friends or Kids at Home.   At the Beginning the Player has to choose, if he want to play a Loyalist Warlord or one of the Traitor Legions. Both sides have their own Warlords, everyone with own specific Traits and Abilities. Some Warlords are designed for a more Strategic kind of Gameplay, others are more powerful in Battle, so all of them can or needs to be played in different ways. After every Match the Warlords will gain some Experience Points, which unlock up to three pieces of Equipment, which they will receive at the Beginning of a Match. Or in other Words: The Warlords can permanently level up, if they are played more than once.  The entire Game is played with Dices. You will need them in Battle (Melee or Ranged Combat), you will need them if you try to reunite with Forces of you chosen Legion (if you find them on the Board during the Game), you will need them, if you try to prevent the loss of a Life when you get beaten by your Opponents. After every turn the Game will save the Game automatically, so you will be able to continue the Game, if you need to abort, cause of a lag of Time (Note: one Match can take more than 3 Hours).   During every Match you need to level up your Warlord to make him powerful enough, so he can move onboard of the Vengeful Spirit. This will happen during Battles against other Warlords, enemy Units and Fleets or even Daemons of the Warp. You will find, collect and use Items, which will give you some advantage against your Opponents, you will reinforce yourself with Units of your Legion and supporting Fleets. You will have a good Time in the Warhammer 40.000 Universe, if you remember the most important Thing: There is only War.  The Game is made for Fans of the Warhammer 40.000 Universe and it’s made for Fans of Board Games. If you like such Games, you can’t do anything wrong, if you purchase and play this Game. Maybe you should purchase it during a Sale, but it would not be wrong if not. You can have more than 100 Hours of Fun with it, if you have some Friends (maybe in Real Life), you can play with.  I also want to recommend to purchase the Seasons Pass as well. It will add a Board Expansion to the Main Game, where you can find additional Equipment, unique Legion Units, very special Events and some Stuff more. If you own the Seasons Pass you will also get several Warlords to both Sides, and you receive a second Board Expansion, when it will be released in a few Months. With the Expansion that is released yet, the Game will become more different each time you play it, and that means it will become less repetitive.   Finally some Words to the Guys, that knows the Original Talisman, but aren’t familiar with the Warhammer 40.000 Setting. DON’T BUY THIS GAME, if you don’t have any idea what Warhammer 40.000 is. In this Game there is only War, but without Magicians, Elves, Knights or speaking Animals. If you don’t like Space Marines, if you don’t like Space Crafts, if you don’t like Laser Weapons and interplanetary Bombardments – you are completely wrong if you buy this Game. Please think about that, before you waste your Money or create a negative Review. This is not fair to the Game and it’s not fair to the Developers.",

            "review_text": "Talisman but with warhammer 40k, honestly a brilliant combination that works well, AI could still use work however nothing is perfect. I'd say if you like Talisman but want a change of setting and pace this works well, though it's not every player for themself. The two loyalists are on the same team, the two traitors are on the same team and it's now a 2v2 battle if your doing 4 people.    If you get it then play it for yourself before making up your mind, this is just my opinion and review and should only give you my input on is it worth it. So I hope you do enjoy it, as the negative press people have given I see is unwarranted as their just giving us 40k fans something new to add to our libraries.",

            "review_text": "Might be worth buying if you don't own talisman but like the game.  It is basically a reskin of an existing game. This is actually something that is very common in boardgames, but I purchased this hoping it would fix some of the more glaring problems with the original talisman.  There are a few added and changed elements to the game that makes the mechanics slightly different from the original, but make no mistakes. This is Talisman with a Warhammer40k paint job (Warhammer30k, technically.) Expect no real innovation, especially in DLC and pricing.",

            "review_text": "I'm sorry but I really don't like this game. I picked it up for less than £2.00 inthe Autumn 2016 sale so I don't feel robbed but...   1) It IS Talisman. Inner region. middle region, outer region, big ending in the middle. Strength and Craft are replaced by Close Combat and Ranged Combat and several others but effectively it's the same game except,   2) It's not as good. Talisman's bright colourful board is replaced by a space scape. Even the cards on the board aren't shown - just letters to denote them that you can click on. The one interesting change is the game generally plays out as a 2 vs 2 - two loyalist marine captains vs two chaos marines with team wins. Accordingly most cards are Chaos which Chaos can attempt to join into their army for combat bonuses and Loyal troops can fight and kill for experience and vice versa. I've still not got to the bottom of why sometimes you can try to roll to attach friendly units to your army and sometimes you can't.  3) I hate the graphics. The Marine Captains appear as see through holograms and most of cards are similar in style. To my eyes being familiar with Warhammer 40K models and games this is wrong. Warhammer 40K is substantial - power armour, land cruisers, big guns. The ethereal style seems inappropriate.  4) The different troops are not as clearly delineated as Talisman cards. There are red soldiers and blue soldiers and really all that changes are their attack values. There is a much wider culture for the game to draw upon - Squats, Eldar, Orks, and Tyranids for starters. I have a feeling that they are being held back as DLC and expansions but in my view wrongly. The base game is left feeling dull and repetitive as a result.  5) There is one minor alteration that is really annoying. Strategems - Horus Heresy's equivalent of spells can only be used before you roll to move. So if you have a combat bonus in most cases you have to use it not knowing whether it will be relevant or not.   Talisman is an awesome game where I have put in hundreds of hours play. This version, unfortunately, is inferior in every way.  S..x. ",

            "review_text": "Local play is really fun, been playing it with cousins and friends a lot and it has been a blast, haven't played online but I've heard is really empty.  contentwise the game is OK alone, good with 1 or 2 character packs and only really good with the Istvaan campaign add-on otherwise it truly feels barebones named-characters are OP in one way or another and it can really affect balance so try to play using generic Preators/Chaplains.  with all the add-ons it truly becomes a really fun game that can change from one moment to the other but if you have no friends which are also into 30k/40k/really want to bother buying all the DLCs, you may want to skip it as you'll probably have to buy all the DLCs to make it worth it.",

            "review_text": "It's Talisman with the 40k business model. Pay through the nose for the game, then find out the base character set is rather lacking. But you can pay for more characters as they're released!  The wording on several of the spaces is incomplete or inaccurate. For example, the Realm of Chaos (Rubicon Straits) says Access 2 Dataslates OR Roll 1 Die to cross the warp. But landing there immediately defaults to 'draw two cards.' The other thing is if you want to move through that space into the inner region.  The Random Number Seed appears to be set from the get-go, and the tendency for one character to just tear through a heap of weak cards early on gives him a nigh-insurmountable lead. Certain characters are flat-out better than others, which is a familiar carry-over from the original Talisman. I suspect that characters in the DLC packs will likewise show crazy power-creep.",

            "review_text": "Single handedly the worst 40K (30K?) game I've played, and there are some very shonky 40K products out there. I simply do not possess the vocabulary to describe how utterly tedious this was even while playing with a good friend. Also, I have played Talisman (board game) so I was aware going into this that there are good game mechanics and not so great ones.  Here are a few things I didn't like:  - Horrendous UI. It is both aesthetically ♥♥♥♥♥ and also functionally broke. In-game descriptions of game mechanics are vague with some guesswork required. You are also locked into watching each player's turn and can't explore the board or your own items while you wait. No helpful labels, if you're looking for a particular planet you better know them by memory or you're clicking each one to find a name. Colour palette is very ordinary. Yes 40K is meant to be dark and gloomy but this is just so boring compared to other 40K franchise interfaces. - The AI. Couldn't find a quest on the questingest day of the year if they had an electrified quest finding machine. Also, I know Talisman can get a little 'grindy' but comeon AI, your stats are ridiculous, head towards the middle now or maybe start that quest? AI, do you really have to play ever possible strategem you have during the end game when turns are already tedious enough? Really? - The ending. I cannot even begin to explain how utterly mundane it was. An image shows, some random in-game 'achievements' count up the stats in a vain effort to encourage you to do more playthroughs on different characters (even the day one DLC ones, see below) and then you're dumped at the main menu. There's no explanation of the monumental feat you've just achieved, no lore to read through. Nothing. Hey I'd feel good if I didn't just want the game to be finished at that point. - Day one DLC. Why let your ♥♥♥♥ game get in the way of charging more money for characters? Maybe the funds raised could be pumped back into the game to make it... better? Nah. - The fact I cannot get a refund because my one complete playthrough took me over 2 hours. Yep. Pretty sure that's an intended feature.  Also Apologies to my mate Rick Havoc who I shared this experience with. We were making the best of a bad game but towards the end we both just wanted out.   tl;dr: Bad interface, bad colour palette, bad AI, bad ending, day one DLC. Do not buy.  Fin.",

Would be nice if there were players in the online play lobby - but that's no reflection on the quality of the game. For the comparitively low price - it is definitely good value for money. (Although the DLC is a bit expensive in my opinion for what you recieve)  With the chance to increase melee and ranged rating a lot easier than talisman - by just winning conflicts and building your legion, it really isn't as hard as people are making out.
