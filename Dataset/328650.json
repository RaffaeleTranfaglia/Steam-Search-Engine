List of big problems, even the most basic of games dont have, but THIS DOES!  -No options menu during the game, so there is no way to change or view your controls. and since al the actions are labeled with the PoS xCrap console controller symbols, you will spend an infuriating time figuring out what is what(i never found out what the ♥♥♥♥ RB is when your using mouse and keyboard, mouse right it aint for sure xD) so yeah, when you get stuck into the training already because of this, it is promising as ♥♥♥♥!  -The UI where you have to walk with the knight on what action you want to take, is clunky as hell.  -There is no actual exit choice, not atleast a clear one, you can keep hitting Escape and search for various methods of leaving the game, but there isnt, apart from crashing it by force...  all in all, the cute graphics, simple game play and mediocre music, do not fix the brain cancer you get from dealing with this games UI.  final verdict; Nothing outstanding. 5/10  but an ok time waster...",
