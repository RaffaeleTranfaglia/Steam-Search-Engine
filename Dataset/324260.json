I beat it three times and I think there is still at least one ending I haven't seen.     Supports mods.   Bad:     Crashes to desktop for me about one in three hours of play or so, not a huge issue because it saves frequently.     The story telling overall is weak, even though quests often have interesting options.     Combat appears hard at first, but late in the game it's too easy if you power up everything and fly the best ship.   If you are fan of games like Escape Velocity or SPAZ then you need to play this.",

I don't mind playing reading games, and this game has a lot of text dialogue, so be warned. The story is not terrible, but it is not that great either. The graphics are not bad, they are actually quite decent for this genre. There are a lot of side quests, but they aren't interesting like Space Rangers 2 HD. The combat is so so, but becomes pointless when you get a good ship, late game weapons, and high level combat skills. This game turns into a drive around simulator, and I got tired of autopiloting through repetative star systems and fighting the same 3 pirate ships over and over. I mean, 99% of the galaxy seems to be pirate ships. It stopped being fun after a few hours.  If you are really considering this game, I recommend waiting for a steam clearance sale of 75% off or greater. Somewhere under the $7 USD mark. Space Rangers 2 HD is better, and Endless Sky is free.",

            "review_text": "I'm generally a fan of this genre of game, notionally the 'privateer' style game where there is space based action/combat along with RPG elements. I played about 18+ hours prior to this review.   This game contains a bit more of the RPG than some, but it's presentation is extremely basic...a dialog screen that list who at a given location you may talk to. Interaction is fairly straightforward after that.   There exists a very large skill web to populate, but not a great deal of content to use to level up...so its the same 4-5 quests (kill the pirate, get some ore, deliver a message, rescue some stranded civies, or buy and deliver some goods) over and over, or mining ore for cash and xp. The music is repetitive, the AI voice (computer on your ship) becomes anoying fairly quickly, and the main quest requires digging through a good bit of text (repeated by a large number of 'characters') to comprehend and follow. There are a number of factions, and I've focused on one thus far (order).   The route planning is attrocious, and given the dependance on autopiloting built into the game, the route planner has gotten me killed MANY times, mostly due to the fact it can't seem to go around an asteroid, so that the most boring parts of the game require your attention. Ultimately, this along with the repetitive nature of the other elements makes this a 'not recommended' game.   If you're looking for a similar game, done much better, go play Rebel Galaxy.",

Good if you want to space truck and look at pretty space backgrounds while listening to pretty space music.  The classes feel more or less unique with room to branch out of your chosen speciality. Decent amount of ships, especially with the workshop, same can be said about weapons and equipment. Not much in the way of story elements tying the quests together. The mainquest is to go kill the aliens over there. Despite the lack of fluff the game pulls of a great atmosphere. If this game had 10X more stuff in terms of story, quests, items, etc. it would be one of the best games every made. I hope it gets more love from the devs in the future.  There is room for improvement. The multiplayer could be a lot better, setting up a server should be as easy as pushing a few buttons, and joining the servers of strangers often means the main quest is mostly done. Perhaps some sort of replayability mechanic for the open servers.  Play it, love it, get your friends hooked.",

Check out my Bob Build-a-Review    Pros: _Looks good: The game has a simple top-down look, but zoom in and you can see a great amount of details in the ship as well as space stations models. The background looks really nice as well. _Sounds nice: The weapon has a nice punchy sound to them. Music is very nice as well. _HUGE: The game map is really big, with plenty of things for you to explore and see. _Controls well: Movement, particularly when in cruise mode, feels really tight, with an appropriate amount of floatiness that come with space games. The weapons are accurate and feel nice to use. _Plenty to do: As with most open world space game, you can fight, trade, pirate, or explore at your own leisure. There are also quests for you to do, if you're into that kind of thing. Also, factions for you to join up. _Deep RPG mechanics: You, the pilot, levels up. Plenty of different ship to find, outfit and fly as well. _Immersive: The game world lives and breaths with or without you. People come and go about their own business on their own.  Cons: _Some weird UI quirks: Some screens just don't have enough information on it. Rather minor, but can be a tad off-putting. _Some quests are kind of boring: Some of the quests are just simple tasks. But you won't care anyways, they're just excuses for you to explore more.  Overall, is it worth the price tag? ♥♥♥♥ yes! If you're a space game enthusiast, this game is already in your inventory. If you're not, still, this is simply a good game that you can get into very easily.",

            "review_text": "First impressions, after about 6 hours of game, and level 30 character.  While definitely worth the price, the game is still lacking compared to classics like Space Rangers, Drox Operative or SPAZ. It needs about 5x as much content as the current selection (5x as much mission types, module and ship types, random stuff happening, etc) to be a real classic. Still, the basics are all good, combat is fun, mining and trading is profitable, there is some danger in dying, so definitely a good start. Devs seem to be working on it with full steam, so that is also good.   +- It seems to have a more strict 'storyline', with some 'story missions', and the universe seem to be very static unlike Drox or SR. It is somewhat similar to SPAZ in this regard. +- Visuals are okay, but nothing stellar. Personally I like this, but some people might want a prettier game.  + Some missions can be solved multiple ways, which I liked very much. Fight, negotiate, or just betray the questgiver all count. + Mining is somewhat entertaining and can be profitable unlike most space games. + A good selection of weapons, like mines, guided and unguided missiles, pulse and beam lasers, plasma, machine gun, gauss gun, etc. + Fight is also fun, if you like realtime dogfights with active aiming and such.  Negatives: - Ships are less free to change around. Ships come with weapon hardpoints, like 2 missile and 1 laser slot, witch you cannot change. You cannot install multiple shields on a ship or anything like that like in Drox.  - There aren't much random mission types, just mine stuff (always the same type and amount!), kill pirates, escort stuff.  - There aren't any random events (or at least I didn't found). No 'treasure maps' or ambushes or such.  - The game world seems to be a bit empty, despite having asteroids, wrecks, pirates and such - they just wander around aimlessly, instead of actively building an empire or something, like in Drox or SR. Maybe adding radio messages and such, showing what each NPC is doing, would solve this.",

            "review_text": "This is still a very unpolished game. I'm still experiencing a lot cases where the game crashes on start, and occasionally during gameplay.   The combat system is OK, but there's few quests and the ones that exists are the tired old 'fetch me X number of Ys', kill this enemy, rescue this NPC. Some of the faction quests actually involve dialog, and those are OK, but too few and too shallow. There's very little plot in this game.   The backgrounds, planets and ships and space stations are definitely beautiful, there's no lack of pretty graphics.   Issues with the Gameplay:  Autopilot will run into stationary objects like space junk and asteroids. It's bad enough that it plots courses through groups of enemy ships, but it's a space game. Even if you're only allowed to move in a 2D plane the autopilot could go under or over those obsticles, or just plot a course around.   SWARMS of PIRATES EVERYWHERE. There's just too freakin' many. Tone it down, especially in space controlled by other factions.   I've had the game for 2 days, and I've already got all the best equipment in the whole game. It appears that the rest of the game will just be an annoying grindfest and the tenuous plot isn't enough to make me want to finish.  Also a recommendation, just one jumpgate per system. That gate should be able to send you to the other connected systems. So when you get a fetch quest you don't get blown up while the autopilot crashes you into asteroids while a dozen pirates rain fire on your ship. Then you can reward curious players that take the time to explore a system by hiding interesting things in it (and no, the alien relics that are only good for science points don't count. Interesting stuff, more stories, easter eggs, etc.)   And more plot...some of the faction quests were nice, but there needs to be more!",
