            "review_text": "This is not a great game. In fact, it's really barely a mediocre game. There are some problems with the AI, a lot of the weapons are situational at best, and fairly useless at worst, ammo is too limited, and there's a lot of hunting for buttons to press to advance.  But it's not a strictly bad game. Particularly compared to other 90's FPS games. The engine is comparable to Build (Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Blood), or Jedi (Dark Forces), and there are some neat features, such as some picture-in-picture weapons that let you remote control them. The game does have inventory with some neat ideas in there. And, while there's only a few you will be trying to use most of the game, there's a pretty wide selection of weapons actually available.  Overall, the game is serviceable, if a bit short. The plot is threadbare. But there's plenty of things to shoot, and plenty of secrets to find, like any good 90's FPS should have. As a note, it has native mouse look, and it works fairly well, once you tweak the sensitivity enough.",
