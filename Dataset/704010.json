    "description": "In LongStory you can be and date who you choose. Play as the gender of your choice and date the cutie you like best! LongStory is fiction, but it’s based on real stories - things that have happened, if not to us, to people we know and love. We hope it is funny, sad, perplexing and wonderful… Just like life.",
