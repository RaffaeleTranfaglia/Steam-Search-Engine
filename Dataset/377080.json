            "review_text": "If you have played Hatoful Boyfriend and enjoyed it, this is a must for you. It has every bit of the same wit and charm as the original, and delves yet again into a surreal and tragic nightmare world that you would not initially expect was hiding beneath the veneer of silly, charming birds. If Bad Boy's Love ruined you before, this will ruin you yet once again. Be warned: Once you fly towards the Holiday Star, there is no coming back from the emotional train ride that is waiting for you.  I highly recommend purchasing the Collector's Edition. You'll receive the sound track, and though most of it is duplicated from the original Hatoful Boyfriend, there are a few new tracks in there. You'll also receive a high resolution picture library of 36 artwork from within the game, five wallpapers, the rather disturbing Holiday Star dossier, and the King's Storybook, which features a bonus story not included in the game proper. If you do purchase the Collector's Edition, be sure to play all the way through the game before viewing the bonus content as it may spoil some things.  If you have never played Hatoful Boyfriend, be sure to play the original to its completion prior to playing this game. You'll need to in order to understand the events here.",

            "review_text": "Once every few years a new tittle is released which shocks the whole gaming industry. This year, we were blessed with Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star. If you played the orginial Hatoful Boyfriend game, this is an absolute MUST. Just like the previous game it was able to capture how beautiful the world would be if it were run by our flying brothers: birds. It's actually rather impressing how someone get sucked into a game like this. This game made me realize I should stop all my studies and just give up, for I will never be as good as the birds in this wonderful datingsim. I have come to realize that I should aim to find myself a beautiful birdhusbando who will take care of me. This game will absolutely change your life and it will make you realize how weak we are as a race and how we should invest all our capitalist scum moneyz to create a school as wonderful as St. Pigeonations for birds and exclusively for birds. This game will deliver you some amazingly phasant times! It's perfect for the holidays, as long as you don't mind the psychological scarring! Though you might find it hard to eat poultry ever again after finishing this masterpiece. 14/10.",

Holiday Star continues to develop the personalities of these gorgeous birds. I just wish there was wooing in this one.  To the negative reviewers:   The negative reviews for this game complain that Holiday Star is birds doing a lot of talking. The game has the tag 'Visual Novel' and all the preview images are of birds talking. Did you not look at the game before you bought it? lol  ",

            "review_text": "+Original pigeon cast +New pigeons +Fun stories +Short episodes with option of human portraits  -Very little user interaction; most episodes are just reads, or have 1-3 choices -Continuity errors from the first game -Short -Little to no replay value  I loved Hatoful Boyfriend. I got every achievement, and enjoyed getting them. Some parts dragged, but overall it was incredibly enjoyable, which is why I bought Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star. I'll preface the rest of the review by saying this isn't a bad game. That being said, because there was so much user interaction in the first game, I expected the same here, and was sorely disappointed. I think had I gone into Holiday Star knowing it was mostly just stories to read, I would have appreciated it more, and I'm hoping that reviews like this one can keep other people from making the mistake I did.   My pet peeve in regards to sequels to games are continuity errors, and this one definitely has a few. Nothing game-breaking, just a couple things that, if you've played through all of Hatoful Boyfriend, you'll kind of pause and go 'that doesn't seem right.'   For me, because this is a primarily story-based game, it doesn't have any replay value. Once you've read the stories, you're not going to get anything else out of it. It's not like there are multiple endings like in Hatoful Boyfriend; unless you forget the stories, you're never going to have a need to reread them.   All of that being said, for what it is, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star is an enjoyable game, and a fun sequel to Hatoful Boyfriend. It gives you an opportunity to interact with all of your favorite birbs again, and experience some fun and weird stories with them. If you really enjoyed Hatoful Boyfriend and if you really like visual novels, then Holiday Star is the game for you.",

I feel like I'm just reading a book: a book I wouldn't even take out of the store with me. Its a book I would think the cover is really cool, but after a read of the short summary of the novel I put down immediately.   This game would be way more fun with a storyline that I felt like I created. But like every episode I'm given 1 or 2 choices to make that I feel like aren't even affecting the story.",
