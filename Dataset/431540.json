Semyon shares New Year's Eve with five of the girls and depending on which route you take, gets a kiss from one of them at the end.  At this time there is nothing else to it, you can get all endings in about 40 minutes and achievements do not work yet, but if you liked 'Everlasting Summer' it's a nice bonus story / post-epilogue.",

            "review_text": "It's a good little sequel to Everlasting Summer. It seems to confuse New Year's and Christmas heavily. Technically the day they're celebrating is New Year's, but they celebrate it like it's Christmas. Also, this game makes the harem ending, where all the girls show up at Semyon's apartment, the canon ending. The English isn't the best, and Miku is referred to as an 'anifag's idol' Not sure if intentional or not. Sadly, Slavyana has no special CG like the others do. Also, you pick Lena for Slavya's ending, and Slavya for Lena's ending.",

            "review_text": "  I definitely recommend Frosty Kiss to anyone that enjoyed their experiences in Everlasting Summer. Frosty Kiss is filled with small things that make your memories from Everlasting Summer come back; memories of those blissful days in Sovynok when everything was so simple, yet so complicated. And most importantly memories of our journies with these star-crossed strangers that we grew to love (possible pun intended there), and the memorable moments we went through with them as we began to strive less and less to find that cursed bus and more and more to just get them to accept us. I love all the little references to the events in Sovynok and how the characters have grown as individuals, as well as a group that can share such a great treasure together. The music adds to that atmosphere and offers a laid-back vibe and the tone of every character pleasantly gives the suggestion that there will always be something to look forward to in life.  On a side note, despite going through each route I never unlocked any of the four achievements for the game. And they are all hidden achievements so I don't know what to do to unlock them. Other than that it's a very nice and simple game, certainly fulfilling, with no mazes or Yulya's coincidentally gathering supplies for the winter. (And regrettably no stargazing even though that was always a thing with Lena)",

The story isn't perfect, and the paths fairly cliched, but nonetheless very touching. Would recommend reading on new years for sure. My favourite part is probably the CGs- they're gorgeous! Kinda odd improvement in quality compared to a fair bit of the game but hey no complaints here, love them.  Small complaint considering it's just a short, one-off game, but the achievement appear to be broken? I assume 5 of them should be for the main paths but I didn't seem to get any depsite reading all of them.",
