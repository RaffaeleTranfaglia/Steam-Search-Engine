            "review_text": "Simplistic and brutal, I wanted to like it. I really did.  While the zombie/monster genres are oversaturated, this game adds something relatively rare. Far from being a hack and slash game or a bullet-fest, it's a survival game set in the aftermath of the apocalypse.   Graphics: I've seen worse, but thats not a compliment. it's not deliberately retro, nor is it polished. It looks low budget, which to my knowledge is an accurate description of the game in general. If you can live with that, as I could, then this should not be a problem.  Gameplay: The trailers conjured up images of a snowy, immersive, single player version of the free MMO 'Dead Frontier'. If you're looking for that or thinking that way, stop; Despite the similar graphical style, this is not it. Controls feel a little awkward but manageable, but, dodging seems virtually useless as enemy reach is well beyond their visible attack radius, and well beyond your dodge movement. Instead, avoid engagements if at all possible.   This is a strategy game at its heart, and if you try to treat it any other way, you'll be disappointed. The game is made up of a series of smallish incongruent maps rather than a more traditional 'open world', whether seamless (like skyrim, excluding interior cell loading) or seperated by a loading screen (like Dead frontier). The stealth is fun, if you're looking for a game where you are to creep around places trying not to engage in combat, then this may scratch your itch. Though it is a top-down game, your view is limited by your character's ability to hear or see. In turn, the monsters must sense you before they will attack. Moving slowly helps as does the skill that lets you listen closely to what's around you, allowing you to sense movement (through a visual effect). Bullets seem hard to come by initially, and the monsters are bullet sponges, so save what you have for a special occasion. Melee seems virtually useless too. You may kill one of the less dangerous monsters, but you'll probably be nearly dead by the time you kill them.  The AI on the monsters is simplistic and breaks immersion, it is all too easy to evade them in a chase by utilzing their poor pathing to escape. Seeing as many of them are quite capable of killing you quickly, it felt like exploiting their AI is the easiest way to succeed sometimes. If you're making a brutal game, it should be even harder to exploit a game mechanic that's presumably working as intended, otherwise the player could begin to feel that they could easily get out of the situation but must instead choose to die for the game to play as it should.  Sound: Simplistic, unimpressive, but functional.  Overall: Most of the problems, bugs, and under-developed ideas would be forgivable for an early access game. However, this game is considered to be in a 'released' state, and overall, I cannot recommend it.",

            "review_text": " TLDR:  If you're looking for an entertaining and somewhat challenging survival sandbox game, I warmly recommend this one. It has some quests, a very good mood and environment and a higly randomized open world. And you only get one save slot.  The winter setting has a bit dark taste, which suits the mood for these kinds of game. You start off in a hut with some random stuff in your inventory and around you. At the beginning, the game is challenging, even on Normal difficulty, but your struggles are rewarding. The randomness of well...almost everything in this game makes you feel uncomfortable at each visit to an area, and especially at each death. You might find totally different loot after reloading your only save. You might ponder on this save option making the game 'too easy' for hardcore survival gamers, who prefer permadeath above all, but I'd say otherwise: it's a game, its purpose is to entertain you, so it's good to have a limit to the consequences of a decision you make.   PRO:  - randomness: puts excitement to a new level, you find different area layout at every start of a new game - open world: you can stop anywhere on the map, the game will generate a random area for you, with some loot, enemies, resources - one save slot only: and the game only saves when you enter an area or exit the game - setting: this cold, wintery environment with blizzards and fog and wind can increase your worries, if the lack of save option would not be enough - many items: you literally have (or...litterally LOL ) dozens of types of stuff to acquire, and many of them have no real purpose, but you cannot know in advance what might come handy later - support: the dev team is very helpful and responsive   CONTRA:  - randomness: sometimes the loot in an object is crazy and somewhat illogical, and you cannot go and search for certain items, because almost anything can be found in any lootable objects...but hey, what if another survivor thought the toilet would be a perfect place to hide an assault rifle, or a box of matches - abundant loot: after some time in the game you just have too many of everything (except for tech weapons :-) ) -&gt; I've played the game on Normal difficulty only, maybe it's indeed 'hard' to survive on Hard diff - controls: need to get used to it, takes some time, but not long though, still, it's hard to measure proper distance from an enemy with melee weapons - lack of quests: OK maybe it's not the game's main purpose to provide endless side-missions    but there are only 2 quests which you get at the beginning of the game   ",

            "review_text": "Not much time played but first impressions have menthinking I'll be addicted for awhile atleast, sci fi some horror and a survival game definatly worth a go if ur into those genes, not usually a fan of the top down view but it works, the game makes me forget it's top down view for the most part pretty immersive  UPDATED after 75 hours.... one of my favourite indie games, it could use more crafting content but there are alot of pick ups in the world to compensate, definatly play on hard, normal is cheese mode, way to many supplies, the game starts hard to suvive but after a few days you build up lots of stock to be able to explore. there are a couple small bugs and one exploite ive found but nothing game breaking, there is just enough storyline and interesting pickups to keep you interested just as it starts to feel alittle stale. im still finding new ♥♥♥♥, only problems with the game is that you cant have multiple saves going at the same time, and the fact that when you upgrade your gear you dont change your outfit, just small gripes.  people complaining about the view and controls feel like they are exaggerating the controls are fine and the view only gets annoying once in awhile but you can use your `hearing` to see if there is an enemy just inside the doorway.  Modding would be amazing for this game, would love to make some extra content for this... would definately buy and expansion if they make one in the future",
