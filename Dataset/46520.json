            "review_text": "Considering that I got all of the achievements in this game I guess I should say something about it.  Wasteland Angel is the humble story of a woman and her car trying to make it in America. The Wasteland Angel doesn't have a name, so let's call her Mad Maxine. Her car Gypsy is built like a tank, ready to take on World War  3....oops?  WW3 already happened and everybody lost. The scant remnants of humanity are just trying to survive under the crushing weight of evil. As the vigilante heroine you gotta protect the cities and kill all the bad guys.   This game has been making the rounds on various indie bundle sites. It's likely that you already have it (and you don't even know). My suggestion is to give it a shot and here's why:  First and foremost this is an arcade-styled game. There's a scoring system, multipliers, bonus points, all that good stuff. Your primary objective is the survival of both yourself and 100 civilians. The enemies arrive in various vehicles and they're either targeting you, the civvies, or both. Regularly out-numbered (but never out-gunned) you make short work of everyone as they arrive in waves. Any leftover time in-between waves is best spent recharging in the city for bonus points. Occasionally secondary objectives will pop up. They are of the 'do this' or 'destroy that' variety.   Aside from the first-person bonus rounds, Wasteland Angel uses an overhead view. It's pretty easy to track the action and indicators will light up if enemies are kidnapping people. Destroyed vehicles tend to drop power-ups. I'd probably be a little worried if everyone happened to have an air strike or a nuke in their car but eh...it's a videogame. Every few stages there's a boss fight. They're pretty standard, though they can only be damaged by power-ups (napalm, mines, etc).   For the most part Wasteland Angel does the job. It's a fun game. Destroying those stupid bad-guys is satisfying, especially when it involves dropping a nuke on 6-7 of them. After you destroy their vehicles you can gun them down. The controls are satisfactory, and with 20+ stages and leaderboards there's no lack of content.  HOWEVER. There is room for improvement. First and foremost, Wasteland Angel runs a bit long for an arcade-styled game. While playing single stages for score is fine, going through the entire campaign is going to take a few hours. Even with the option to save and quit between stages, this isn't quite ideal. I'm thinking instead of one long campaign, just cut it up into three or four. Also in the interest of pacing, each stage would have less but more intense waves.  Another issue is that the controls could be better. Well maybe better isn't the right word. Maybe uh...more technical? Technique? Ehh I'll think of a better word later. Anyway I'm thinking that Gypsy could use some more moves. While getting around the wasteland is fine as is, some tricks would help getting in getting out of screwy situations. It would also give the developers more room to try more ideas. For example, maybe the RB &amp; LB buttons could be used for doing barrel rolls. Yeah I know 'Do a barrel roll!' is hilarious &amp; timely but seriously. Give the car a flippy move for dodging dangerous crap like missiles. Or if it looks like you're going to hit a building and crash just WHOOSH look at all the time you're saving. As a bonus, pressing LB &amp; RB together could result in a 180 spin. The controls in this game are responsive as is, but more abilities couldn't hurt.   Updating the controls would also lead to better boss-fights I imagine. The few in Wasteland Angel 1 are lacking. The first couple are indirect fights. By this I mean you're dropping mines or napalm for them to run into, you're not actively fighting them. The current level of maneuverability just isn't enough to take these big guys head-on. Also there's a fight with a super mutant. I guess it's kinda direct in that you actually have to shoot him, but that's only after dropping an EMP to stun him for a couple seconds. Also the tank boss can be annoying, since it prefers to hang back and snipe at you rather than run over all the fresh mines you've laid out for him.  Also this probably counts as more of a nitpick but there have been a couple occasions, where I got stuck on something. There was also a time an enemy seemingly disappeared, but it didn't count as destroyed so I lost out on bonus points. Some of the stages are also a little too cluttered and lack the proper amount of 'flow'. Maybe for a sequel, they could use a base design for each stage. It doesn't have to be something obvious like a circle, but it has to be easily indentifiable to the player so they're not driving into a seemingly random wall just to rescue some hapless civilians.  Oh and make it so it's easier to run enemies over.   Still, Wasteland Angel isn't too bad a game. It has the right concept, a solid core, it just needs some tweaks and it could turn out to be something really good.  YMMV  PS - Everytime I type 'Wasteland Angel' I keep accidentally typing 'Wastleand'. Yeah I don't know either.",

It's not a masterpiece for sure, but i like it alot. + Classic post-apocalypse Mad Max style (so-called 'postapunk') without zombies, 'realism', and so on - rare stuff now. + Classic Hard Rock / Heavy Metal music - also not often now. + Tons of fun!   Short, but fun game!  Totally worth the sale price, maybe worth the regular price, but kinda too short.",

It's rather fun at first driving around and shooting things (at least with a controller), defending the towns against invading waves of Mad Max-style invaders, but it doesn't really go anywhere from there. It's just kind of the same thing in the same pattern, level after level, without any more depth to it. It even recycles bosses and bonus objectives, which could've been a good opportunity to give it some variety, but instead it just makes it tedious after a while. Oh well.",
