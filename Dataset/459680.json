            "review_text": "A friend of mine first introduced Auro: A Monster-Bumping Game to me a couple of years ago when it was going through beta for mobile devices. The gameplay immediately became addictive and very challenging. Although the game may appear at first to be a rather simplistic mobile port I’ve long hoped that the game would find a home in the Steam catalog because the game’s depth is exactly what a lot of strategy fans have been seeking for.  The object of the game is to bump monsters off of the map and into the water. Doing so will award you points the amount of which is dependent upon the combo that you are currently riding. You need to score a certain amount of points each level to progress to the next. Players have spells at their disposal to aide their progress and learning the best use of these spells is arguably the most important aspect of the game. This will take time and experience proving that the game is difficult to master.  This may sound contradictory but the game is relatively simple to pick up once you understand the basics. But it’s learning the basics that may cause a relatively steep learning curve for beginners. You’re going to want to watch the how to play video, which is below in the Steam description, to give yourself an understanding of the basics before you begin. Some of you who do watch the video will gain an early appreciation for just how deep the game can become.  From a technical presentation perspective the music and the graphics are more than suitable for the game. Neither are overly flash or fantastic but they achieve what the developers hoped that they would.  The $8.99 asking price is quite reasonable for a strategy game of this nature. It’s only a couple of dollars more than the iOS version of the game and considering that it was fully released last year onto the device you can understand why the game is slightly more expensive. The game on iOS has a 91% metacritic rating which is well deserved. This isn’t just a game that has been ported cheaply onto Steam only to be forgotten about as the devs have given strong support to their game on all platforms. I would only ask that they add Steam achievements and trading cards so that the game can become fully Steamified.",

            "review_text": "Auro is the only turn-based game I still play, and the only recent game where I don't feel awful when i'm in a tough spot and trying to find a solution by experimenting. I also appreciate how Auro uses an 'ELO' system to encourage the player to keep playing and improving, instead of just a high score list. The art style and music are very nostalgic; it feels like i'm playing a game on a sega genesis or super nintendo. All in all, Auro is a very good game that feels worthwhile to play.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I am currently a part time developer for Dinofarm games. I was lucky enough to fall madly in love with the mobile version of this game (where I player well over 1,000 runs) prior to joining the dev-team, though, and can safely say that I would enjoy this game tremendously even if I wasn't one of the programmers behind it.  Auro is a turn-based rogue-like that introduces two key innovations to the genre. The first is its ranking system, which generates levels for the player based on their persistent skill level. It cuts down dramatically on the stress you may experience in the first few hours of most rgue-likes, and helps make sure that you always have a fighting chance and that all of your runs will be exciting and dramatic.  The second key innovation is how you kill monsters. Instead of hitting them until their life-bar depletes, you simply 'bump' monsters off of the board and into the water. This idea of bumping is at the heart of Auro, and just about every action you and your foes can take involves bumping in some form. This leads to characters consistently synergizing in surprising and delightful ways, like being bumped out of harm's way by a Slime, or setting up a charging Troggle to plow through your enemies.  They may seem like simple features, but they work together to create some of the deepest, most rewarding gameplay you're likely to find in a rogue-like. If you're a fan of either rogue-likes or strategy games, you should really do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I promise, you'll be glad you did.",

If I wasn't associated with the project, this would still be the case.   Auro is just as replayable and continually rewarding as chess, tennis, tetris, go, etc. Take half an hour, learn the rules, and the game will reward you for years. I've played thousands of matches and I see no sign of that changing.   I feel lucky to have been a part of such a special project.",
