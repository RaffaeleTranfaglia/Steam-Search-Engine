            "review_text": "Amazing sequel to an amazing game, with some infuriating enemies 8D Story and voice acting is once again absolute top notch. And Soul Reaver 2 swaps out its predecessors love of block puzzles for light reflection puzzles. The game is solid, if short, but a very worthy entry into the Legacy of Kain series.  Knowledge of Soul Reaver 1's plot is basically essential here, as it picks up EXACTLY where the first leaves off.",

            "review_text": "What to say that has not been said already. If this game was a cup, it would be overflowing with epicness.  If you never played it before, you are in for a story you will never forget(most likely you wont understand it either if you havent played previous Legacy of Kain games). Naration is just epic, all voice actors(Kain especially) are very gifted voice actors and will make every cutscene feel amazing. Also, story is well written and leaves little to nothing unexplained but rest assured that after finishing LoK series, all shall be revealed.   Speaking of gameplay, combat is good, fast and dynamic and fairly challenging at some points. Puzzles are entertaining, and a bit challenging every now and then. Only thing that is worse, in my opinion, compared to previous Soul Reaver game is that there are no things to collect, as health upgrades or glyph magic and that the world feels much smaller than the one in the original Soul Reaver  Pros: -Epic Story narrated by epic voices -Fast, dynamic combat -Fun puzzles -Detailed world and nice visuals  Cons: -No 'secret' collectables -Can crash on PC's with multi core CPU's(avoid by making it run on only 1 core)  9/10",

            "review_text": "The greatness carries over, and where Soul Reaver I would leave absences for expanding upon the same dark narrative... the plot thickens, it twists and turns, and beginning right where the first game ended, we see Raziel follow his course of fate and vengeance, not through Nosgoth, but through time itself. Take again the Soul Reaver, and put those welps and weaklings to pay. Feed on them, grow, as you find the shackles of destiny, and of time itself, clasp about your wrists.  This game is gorey, bloody, just as much so as the first. Raziel must sate his dark hunger.  UPDATE!!!: You should get an xbox controller, or a programmable mouse / controller to play this game. The default controls are shakey on PC, as this was definitely intended for the Playstation. I would most likely extend this comment to all other Legacy of Kain games.",

Lots of people have problems with random freezes during cutscenes, which is a pain since save points are often an hour or so apart and you can't even skip cutscenes you've already seen.  The localized versions of this game, while they exist and are generally considered good quality, are simply not available on Steam. This is English only, and worst of all, this game comes from a time when not having any kind of subtitles was acceptable (way to do accessibiility, by the way).  I don't care how old this game is. If you are republishing it, you have to do basic support. Why are we still paying for it if not this?  Update on this : So it appears the frequent freezes are related to processor affinity in multiple core systems (most modern PCs). There are workarounds, none of which are very convenient for end-users. This could be fixed somewhat easily for everyone if Square Enix had any care. For this reason, and for the non-inclusion of versions other than English, I still don't recommend it.",
