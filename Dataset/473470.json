The original negative reviews should be changed cause the problems have been fixed with the movement and stuck due too many summons.  Overall it worth the price for a short play, if you want something to do in the mean time with tiny games the studio pack worth that money if bought on sale.",

            "review_text": "I thought about liking this game anyways just to offset the like-dislike ratio a bit, but this game honestly isn't good enough to warrant that. The art and gameplay are slightly reminiscent of the Heroes of might and magic games which is why i bought this, however, it is far inferior to those classics. It only costs a dollar, so if you are curious then perhaps it is worth buying regardless.  The biggest problem I have with the game is the overall alpha level feel and polish. There are very few assets in the game and there are no movement or attack animations. I found the game too easy though I have not gotten too far yet. Every part of the game reeks early access with the constant feeling of 'this part might be good once they do a proper job on it'.  Edit: I have edited this review in response to a comment from the developer. There is now a tutorial available, and it seems I was mistaken about the developer not intending to update the game. It will perhaps improve in the future. However I still do not really reccomend the game in this state unless you are curious.",
