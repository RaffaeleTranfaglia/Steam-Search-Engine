            "review_text": "I actually liked this a decent amount. It's about two hours long and features you walking through a 13-room house in something that's obviously been a bit inspired by P.T., but in my opinion it actually works as the words 'inspired by' are key here. It's not a rip-off and forms its own identity as it goes along. The game is mostly based around atmosphere, exploring your house for notes and slowly changing differences, while avoiding an occasional entity, and checking your phone every once in a while to answer survey questions and check your mail. The phone also has a hint system where if you can't figure out the current thing to do within 5 minutes, it'll give you a hint.  I don't want to say too much more than that, but I think it succeeds at what it sets out to do. It also avoids a lot of indie horror pitfalls; It's not jump scare focused (the few scares in it are pretty well done though), the flashlight is decent (and no batteries, plus most rooms have a light switch), and I didn't run into any form of bugs, performance issues... It was actually pretty polished and pretty good looking. My main issue comes that though the story is enjoyable, it's not really that surprising or deep (and the notes have a few typos I noticed, nothing too distracting but they were there), and I honestly felt the survey element was underutilized; About a third of the way through the game it's dropped entirely, and that's a damn shame since it was pretty effective and interesting up until that point. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend if you're up for exploring a fairly creepy house with some light exploration and where something lurks inside with you...",
