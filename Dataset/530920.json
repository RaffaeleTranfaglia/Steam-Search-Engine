            "review_text": "Archimedes concepts and ideas are very interesting and somewhat novel. Yes, the game is short (3 hours in my case), but that doesn't make it any less interesting.  A word of caution to non-native English speakers though: your capacity to understand spoken English over a low-quality signal may or may not slow down your progress. Same for your keyboard configuration. There's a puzzle that took me over 30 minutes to understand _how_ to input the required keys, because apparently the default way of inputing those keys on my keyboard was not the expected answer. I'll classify those as 'localization' issues and they should not halt your progress, thanks to the community. However, be careful when going to forum so as not to get spoiled.  This game rely heavily on external resources like dropbox or mediafire. That is a very interesting concept for sure and change the way you 'play' a game. I even had to install a program on my computer to solve a puzzle, that a first for me! However, story-wise it is unclear why those files would be hosted there. From a story perpective, it would make more sense if the person you are talking to would avoid corporate firewalls by sending you things through these media, however that's not the case. What you'll grab from these external resources are 'highly-classifed' data that should have been hosted on their internal network. Kind of weird.  Another puzzle goes through an external resource where there's a mix of curated content and user-uploaded content. That is dangerous. I hope no one uploads false leads into there, but I suspect that it already happened. For the same puzzle, the developer didn't seem aware of two different ways of displaying an information, leading to much confusion in the user group. I don't want to spoil, so I'll use an analogy: the puzzle requires you to input a temperature and gives you a field like [__] F. Out of that, you would think that it's expecting fahrenheit, but no, it's expecting Celcius. This is not an actual game puzzle, it's just to give an idea of the mismatch between the two 'formats'.  Overall, I enjoyed the games but I had to go to the forums too often. The ideas are great, but if the realisation of those ideas had been a bit more polished, it would have been truly awesome.  I do hope that the developer takes the time to polish these few puzzles. Not to make them easier to find out the answer, but to make it easier to get pass them once you have the answer. (Like any puzzle, the fun is in finding the key -- not loosing an hour to understand how to use the key).  I would recommend the game to Amercians/Enligsh users who won't stumble on not-puzzle-releated stuff. For international user: wait for a patch or understand that your experience will suffer (but very slightly)",

            "review_text": "It's a decent for the two and a half dollars I paid, but it felt rather lacking overall.  For one thing, the game's premise is awesome. I love the idea of browsing a haunted, or virus-ridden OS with bugs you have to work around. However, that premise is shattered the minute you boot up the game and get the message from the 'User'. Then it quickly becomes one of those games where the plot is driven by the fake chatroom and not the act of browing and exploring a fake OS. You kind of depend on the person in the chat room to give you the 'next step' to access more files, or trigger the next part of the narrative.  This game also does that 'fake typing' thing (Where you can press random keys but pre-canned responses come out regardless of what you actually typed), so you can literally roll your head across the keyboard to advance the plot. I personally hate this trend in general because there's always a disconnect between what I feel at the moment and what I'm typing out. It constantly reminds me that I'm just playing a game and not actually browsing an emulated OS. To top it all off, your responses for the first few minutes are whining about not playing a game you downloaded from Steam, and that really brought me out of the whole thing.  My other issue is with the 'OS emulation' aspect in of itself. Sometimes it's fine, and allows you to copy, paste, and type whatever you like. But one huge issue is the inability to move windows around by clicking and dragging. This gets especially annoying later because there are clues on certain windows that you need to advance the plot on other windows, but you have to close one window to access the other window behind it to type in the information you just learned. So, play this game with a phone or some pen and paper handy.  One other thing I hate, which is another annoying trend in games, is the puzzles that exist outside of the game, which you can only access by downloading certain files from dropbox and mediafire. Not only are these rather artificial, if just one of them ends up corrupted or pulled down, or if the site hosting them goes under (remember Megaupload, anybody?) it runs the risk of breaking the entire game and making it impossible to progress. There's also a QR code, which is a whole other can of worms, but thankfully, it's just one.  Last bit, and this is going into spoiler territory, so don't highlight it if you are still interested in playing.    The virus itself only shows up in the last few minutes of the game, which was extremely disappointing. I expected it to start interfering with you in subtle ways throughout the game, but the corruption only starts happening during the climax of the plot and when you attempt to install another virus to fight it. That said, the imagery for the final 'battle' was AWESOME, and I would have loved for that to be spread across the game.    In conclusion, that is how I feel about the game. I still recommend people check it out because I would actually like an Archimedes 2 that maybe doubles down on the OS emulation aspect, and I imagine that would require a higher budget and more development time. This game was a neat little experiment overall, but it just didn't click with me.",
