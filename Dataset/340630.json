            "review_text": "Developer didn't put in much effert for this game.  It's graphics is painful to look at, it's control is weird and crude, story suppose to be funny and it's not, the music is bad and repetitive, the voice acting don't find the theme of ninja.   In truth this game is a very generic and short hackslash game that use the pretext ninja as it's selling point. The moves you do in this game is generic hack and slash and whirlwind. It's got a couple of levels and once you finish all of them all achivement is unlocked. It shouldn't take you more then 2-3 death to go though all the levels and get 100% achievement.  For a Racist, bad mouth ninja game this is really one you should avoid even if you like ninja.  3/10.. avoid at all cost. This is just a mess to play. Quick 100% achievement though.",

            "review_text": "Ninja Guy for Steam is hilariously random! You really can’t expect a game featuring a “Holy Cow Sensei” to be taking itself seriously! lol  The game is priced pretty much the same as Ninja Guy HD on iOS - except now it has huge waves of enemies, support for joypads and really cool effects that weren’t in the original (of which I was also a fan).  The game mechanics revolve around managing your “Ninja Focus”. When you use your ninja stars, jump attacks, whirlwind or torpedo moves this all uses up Ninja Guy’s blue bar. Even though it regenerates slowly on its own, the idea is that killing enemies boosts your Ninja Focus allowing you to potentially chain an unlimited supply of special moves one after the other. If you simply hack and slash without much thought (without killing enemies), you’ll run out of Ninja Focus and be left with simple melee moves - and that leaves you vulnerable to ambushes. There is definitely an element of tactics required to succeed in this game.  All things considered, for this price the game is great fun!",

The Bad: - The controls are awful, even with a controller. - Complete lack of camera control. - The game is short, 90 mins or so in total. - The voice acting is completely amateur and stereotypical. - The graphics - even for a mobile port, they're awful.  Don't kid yourself by thinking 'hey it's only a couple bucks, I might as well get it.' You'd be better off tossing that $2 out a window than subjecting yourself to Ninja Guy.",

The controls are horrible, the gameplay is bad (and i mean REALLY BAD).
