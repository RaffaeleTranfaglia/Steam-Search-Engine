            "review_text": "I really hope these kind of games will emerge more often in the future. Having the music as a basic part of the game is a mechanic I wish would be implemented in 'usual' games, as in, games that are not classified as 'music games'. Anyway, Inside My Radio is a nice little music platformer that uses a rich and very nice adapting soundtrack and builds the game around it. It doesn't quite reach the perfection of 140 in this regard, but it's really fun to play through it none the less.  A few things I disliked were that the input for specific actions only possible on the beat - might be useful on rhythm games but a platformer like this not so much. I don't see a use for it anyway. Also in my humble opinion all the dialogue boxes were unnecessary, the game would have worked without any of those just as good.  Aside from that I had a fun - albeit short - time with Inside My Radio and I do recommend it to everybody who likes games with interesting music mechanics.",

I think I was on the final phase on the final boss, but I've never liked 'die until you memorize' mechanics, not even back when they were popular, and this is no exception. The whole rhythm based thing went right out the window, and the game became an unimaginative just-dodge-and-memorize platformer. Shame.",

I don't know why people are complaining that the final boss battle was bad because it wasn't using the beat rythm patterns like what was used in the entire game. However, what were thrown at you were still in sync with the beat even though there was a pattern to it.  Bought this on sale and it was a great short music type game. :)",

            "review_text": "I would consider this a 'broken' platformer game. While the world itself should definitely move with the beat, forcing the player to have to move and jump with it, causes nothing but endless frustration. Especially when you only have maybe 1-2 frames to actually press the jump or dash button. Also, sometimes you have to do so in order to escape timed and moving obstacles. Not a good mix.  Can't recommend buying the game in its current state.  I can recommend the soundtrack though. It sounds good, so it's got that going for it.",

        {
            "review_text": "I would normally end up writing this game off as a standard- if rather bland- linear sidescroller to sink a couple of reasonably fun hours into and then abandon forever, but the beatmatching mechanic makes actually playing the game too obnoxious to even recommend to that extent. Put simply, you can only perform basic but essential platforming actions such as jumping and dashing if your key presses match the 'beat' of the background music. I personally don't think this type of rhythm mechanic goes well with a platformer at all, since each type of gameplay requires a different sphere of concentration- and for me, they were near impossible to combine. Clearly, I'm in the minority, given the prevalence of positive reviews, but I also doubt I'm the only one who might become frustrated with it.   Could one say I am biased because I'm not normally a rhythm game fan? Well... yes, I suppose. But I had hoped that a game that combined rhythm with a genre I'm familiar with might be easier to get into. However, Inside My Radio does not cleanly marry two types of gameplay- it merely restricts one behind another.   The keyboard controls are extremely awkward as well, but you can rebind them, at least. The music and art serve their purpose but certainly aren't anything special. I admit I didn't finish the game, but I feel like I really don't need to, given that I could barely play for a few minutes without thinking about how much more fun I could be having if the game's primary mechanic was no longer present.",

Or at least look it up on youtube and see if it's their type of game.",

I would recommend this game to anyone, especially someone who dislikes games like Super Meat Boy because of the difficulty. This game presented a challenge to me, but I never found my self getting frustrated because I was able to clear most obsticles in only a few tries and there are checkpoints a-plenty. My only issue with this game is the length. I had a lot of fun for all of two hours, then suddenly the game was over. I would love to see DLC or a sequel with more characters, levels, and bosses. Overall, I'd say this game is worth the $15 price tag.",

I've never bounced up and down so much when facing a final boss before and I even failed the boss enough times for a usual game to make me frustrated, but instead here I was smiling and even happy to get to try it again from the start of the tune. Could use more content, but as I said, definitely worth the money.",
