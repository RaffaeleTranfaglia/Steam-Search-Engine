            "review_text": "Certainly not a bad game as such, but the original idea has not been executed as it could have been. As a 'dot in space' (or elsewhere), you have to dodge incoming lines. Seems familiar enough, but it comes with a twist: you can only move fairly slow, and when moving in a fluid motion, you can 'direct' the incoming lines (I can't help of thinking about them as missiles) to a certain degree so that they slap into each other. The slow pace and the rather peculiar, somehow relaxing music, contribute to the overall feeling of ease the game offers. But that's also, to a certain degree, its downfall: in order to progress through the levels, one has to stay sharp and move accurately. Somehow, I didn't manage to achieve that and the game became rather boring after a while. It felt more and more pointless to progress through levels offering basically the same mechanics over and over again.  There are several game modes, including an 'endless' and a 'score endless' mode, so there are some possibilities for variation, but ultimately these modes only change the 'rewards' you get, not the playstyle. Borealis surely has an art-style all of its own, and can be visually quite pleasing. The game comes with trading cards, at least on paper since even after more than four hours of in-game time, none has dropped yet. The achievements, although not original in any way, are mostly not too difficult and with some dedication  Borealis  could be a nice 100% game for achievement collectors.   Not really recommended, although it is worth trying out if you can get it on sale. ",

            "review_text": "I read the description of the game before I bought it, and it gave me exactly what it said. A game where you move a small object around slowly dodging lines. I can't really complain, even if it really isn't that fun.  I am however, very saddened that you cannot select a graphics mode to play in, turn off the music, or anything else. I was looking forward to playing the stage with the retro green lines and turning off the music for a semi enjoyable nostalgic experience, but alas, you need to go through the entire game every time.  In short, read the description before you buy a game, and don't complain like a jerk if you got exactly what was advertised.  Price could be a bit lower though, there's really not much to offer. Then again, the developer has mentioned adding more options to allow a bit of customization to your game experience, and has shown that he cares about what others think, so you know, at least you're sending your money to a nice enough person, which is always nice.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game since it seemed to be right up my alley. A zen-like synesthetic audiovisual experience? Great! Only to be disappointed once i played it. First of all, the game isn't as beautiful as the screenshots would lead you to believe, It's blurry in fullscreen and the graphics are spartan to say the least. It only consists of the scrolling backround image and the lines that you are dodging. No fancy particle effects or anything like that. Also the game has no options menu what-so-ever, So you can't even set the audio levels and resolution.  Secondly, the gameplay is too barebones and generic. i guess you could call it 'zen' if you WANTED to, but i expected something a bit more experimental and intresting out of a indie 'zen-game'. Instead it feels like some arcady ♥♥♥♥ that you'd play for free on ipad or newgrounds.  Mostly because the game doesn't have a core-gamemode/campaign. It just consists of the three musketeers of score-attack games:  Survival: Dodge the 'bullets' for as long as possible, one hit and it's game over. Score run: Which is the same as survival except you have three lives, and generate score faster by standing still. Endless mode: Which is the same as the other ones except there's no score and you are immortal, the 'zen-mode' essentially.  Finally, The music, which is SUPPOSED to be the focus here. is not that good at all. I know this is subjective, but i think many would agree. Because the music is generated, i.e: not carefully crafted coherent song structures. And because all of the tracks have that 'incompitech/kevin macleod' feel. Complete with what sounds like stock MIDI samples.  So yeah, not the most unique game, the only thing that sets it apart would be that the bullets are slow and comes in large numbers, meaning that you have to plan how to best avoid them instead of relying on twitch-skills. The game never ends either, due to it being a score attack game. it will just cycle through a random set of levels infinitely, kind of like having 'shuffle' on your media player. Some people might like this, but i want my games to end so that i can depart from it feeling satisfied, rather than playing the game until i get fed up with it and click uninstall.  So basicly, don't waste your time and money on this. even if this game would be free, it would only come off as a mediocre timewaster.",

The game itself is just straight forward evasion nothing else to it, so if you are into this kind of games go for it on the other hand if you are just experimenting with the genere I would probably not bother myself with the game.

It's surprisingly good.",

And when stress rears it 's ugly head, there are two options to relieve yourself of that pent-up frustration: Go play Carmageddon and enjoy mindless violence or play Borealis, a fun and relaxing abstract game. In Borealis, you are a small white dot trying to escape the touch of many incoming asteroids. Game rewards slow, precise and focused game play while actively punishes twitch-like behavior. The story is practically non-existent, but it does have an emergent meaning to it thanks to the superb music and sound effects and the look of the levels, where you'll wonder if levels are allegorical representations of basic human emotions, or maybe it'll look like a feverish dream of a would-be hacker. In one of the Card's descriptions, the main anti-hero of the Neuromancer is mentioned, so go figure. The main stars of this game are the carefully balanced rhythmic gameplay and excellent atmospheric music and sound effects that elevate Borealis into a 'special kind' of game. Borealis is relaxing, wondrous, tough to beat, fair and introspective, and it gets a two-thumbs up. The price is quite fair too, so don't wait and enjoy this little Zen trip now.",

What dissapointed me the most was the lack of a mode where you can select stages that you played before. This in my opinion is a really a major flaw, since there are no checkpoints (of course, it's survival mode) and the level transition is way to slow, making the whole experience quite boring.  So, if dodging caught your interest in this game, you can freely skip it. There are some challenging levels but you will get bored pretty fast. On the other hand, if you came to find your zen zone I guess this could keep you attracted for a short time, but don't expect too much.",
