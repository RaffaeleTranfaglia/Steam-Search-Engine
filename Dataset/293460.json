            "review_text": "Its basically a top down action hack and slash akin to the Diablo/Gauntlet style games, however, the movement is a bit slower not requiring 500 clicks per second with constant item use buttons.  -Instead of swords, bows, and shields... you got WW2 era pistols, flamethrowers and machineguns.  -The serum to cure infection bit was a bit unnecesary as it barely effects gameplay at all but it gives you a feel of time running out urgency without actually straining you.  -The weapon actually are akin to diablo to having levels and bonuses on the weapons themselves which encourages you to constantly switch weapons and the limited ammo means you gotta switch between guns which I find great because you actually gotta manage that as you play.  -The quest system was in style of Diablo but really... I think they are more of a guide so you don't get lost.  -The music is freakin great, spot on incredible adding a sense of depressing atmosphere.  Great game, would reccomend.",

            "review_text": "The game is a steal for the price. It's got the good ol' rpg elements (dungeon sieger) in a post-apocalyptic world with zombies. Lots of customization options for your character, stat-wise, lots of abilities and lots of loot. It's nice to fight zombies in the dark xD. It's a bit hard at the beginning but but it gets easier as you progress on, as all rpg's do. Yes, there's some downsides, as with all games, like murky graphics, hard to see at times, too much text (i'm not the reader type) but it's all in a good package.  I'd say definitely give it a try if you're into RPG's or zombie survival games, as it's cheap as chips.",

            "review_text": "For most people, some of the games Mechanics, and Graphics are off putting. (even with the graphic option 'Aging Filter' fully off, does make it more appealing, and vice versa) Compared to newer ARPG's this games graphics, and combat is outdated. Missions can be confusing to follow, the game gets way to dark, and your flashlight dies fairly quick leaving you with a pitch black screen, usually at the worst time possible, with floods of enemies attacking you. With all the bad said, if you stick with this game, and give it a chance, most will enjoy this game. The leveling, and item mechanics in this game, such as repairing, enhancing, and how resources are used. Does add more appeal to this game. Overall its not that bad of a game. Given a chance you will see how unique this game is to all other ARPG's. Its really a hate it or like it game, personally i would recommend it. But ask no one to blame me if they dont like it lol..",
