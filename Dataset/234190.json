    "description": "Receiver was created for the 7-day FPS challenge to explore gun handling mechanics, randomized levels, and unordered storytelling. Armed only with a handgun and an audio cassette player, you must uncover the secrets of the Mindkill in a building complex infested with automated turrets and hovering shock drones.",

You can't just press R to do a reload animation. You have to conserve ammo and fire accurately, while learning to reload the gun manually. That's the beauty of this game.  The point of this review is, it's an amazing game for its price, and considering it was made for a challenge the length of a WEEK.",

It gives you the ability to really understand how guns work which games such as 'Call Of Duty and 'Counter Strike' don't provide to you.  The game has suspense so you do not know what is around the corner so you must make sure that your gun is fully loaded and ready to go.  Some things I would recommend added is machine guns and smgs of some kind instead of stinking to pistol classed weapons. I sometimes find the help A.I to be annoying because it is telling me to put the gun to automatic, etc. I highly recommend this game for people who like the way guns work or a looking for a gun game full of suspense.",

The reloading mechanics are fantastic and I hope to one day see the same mechanics in a more fleshed out game. Sadly past the reloading mechanics receiver is quite a shallow game. You only ever come across 2 types of enemy; turrets and drones, neither are practically fun to fight. There is only a small number of possible rooms so after you've played for a few hours the level design becomes very repetitive. The only objective is to find the tapes which can either be very tedious or ridiculously easy depending on the random level generator. Most of receivers problems come from the fact the bulk of the game was made in 7 days with only one real update after it's release, It's just a shame no more content was added afterwards.   I hope one day a game developer will notice Receiver and make a properly fleshed out game built around It's gun mechanics. but until that game comes out I'll just have to keep playing reciever and you will.",

I also feel that this game deserves some credit due to the little amount of time it was issued for it to be produced, there a re three weapons including a colt m.1911, some form of the automatic glock series (i'm gonna guess a G17) and finally the classic colt revolver (I cant put a finger on the exact model). I personally also feel that a full game would be downright awesome, hopefully including something else than just pistols (assault rifles, shotgun etc.) This game actually ends to give a sort of tactical feel as well as a form of rage inducing. The 'rage' (more annoying) is the F***ING flying tasers are incredibly hard to hit however not impossible (i personally think that they fit perfectly into the game). The other understandable point that is still annoying is that whenever you die, you start all over. Once again, I feel that this an understandable piece of the game and is completely rational, however it is still annoying.  All in all I feel that this would be an amazing full game and is still a great game as the 'competition edition' (the thing that it is right now) 9/10",

            "review_text": "Surprising indie gem. One of the tightest FPS experiences I've everplayed.   Premise of the game is simple--you're dumped into a kind of 'dream world', and you need to recover a series of tapes to 'wake up' (think The Matrix meets Videodrome meets Vanilla Sky. Or something.)  You're moving through a series of what are, apparently, interconnected apartment buildings, each with multiple floors that connect across. There are enemies scattered throughout, but only two types: flying kill drones, and turrets. Kill drones will fly straight for you and electrocute you at close range, turrets will shoot a spray of bullets at you from afar.  So far, so generic, and a lot less content than most FPS. So why play?  Well, what makes the game work so well are the detailed mechanics.  First off, if you're struck even once, or fall, that's it--you're dead. Going gun blazing into a room is pretty much game over.  Second, you control every mechanic of your gun with a separate keyboard key. Just arming and firing your weapon will take you a few playthroughs to learn, but when you do--it's amazing how rewarding your actions feel.  Third, running requires that you 'tap' the forward key, lending a neat kinetic element to the game.  Fourth, ammo is scarce, and you'll have to selectively choose which fights you want to engage in... and which to bypass or run for it.  Despite the sparse world and somewhat rudimentary graphics, sound design and aesthetics are brilliant, and I haven't been so kinetically into a game since the days of Atari 2600. Bravo!  It's hard to explain the culmination of all of the above elements; you'll simply have to try it out for yourself. It's unlike any oher FPS and revolutionary at what it does. I guess I would call Receiver the 'thinking man's shooter'.   It's terrific; buy it, then go yell at the devs to show it a little love and update it rather than spending all their time making rabbit-fighting games.",

I love the gun handling mechanics and its absolutely worth playing just for that. Once you've begun to master the mechanics of handling and reloading the different guns, it really is enjoyable. It feels rewarding to get proficient with each weapon. I wish someone would take this concept (of micromanaging reloads and gun handling) into a more playable more polished concept. As for Receiver, yes you can put a few hours into it, but ultimately it's too frustrating. There are only 2 types of enemies, some are too easy and some are nearly impossible. The stationary drones just spin in place, telgraphing their movements and give you plenty of time to shoot them with well timed and aimed shots. The aerial drones, which I refer to as 'Flying F!@#s' are impossible. There is just no way to see them (all) in time and they are just too fast, some rooms will spawn 4 or 5 of them. Your field of view is too small to see them and they are just way too fast and maneuverable. I think they were supposed to be an enemy who would force you to rapid reload under pressure, but in practice they either don't detect you and drop with one shot, or you empty your mag on one while the other one zaps you from behind. I really do like playing this, but its not developed to a stage where you'd really want to try and 'play through' to the end (believe me I've tried). From the enthusiasm of the 'tapes' I can't imagine the ending being very rewarding anyway.",

Automated Turrets and Flying robots are trying to stop you from finding all audio cassettes.  Using the gun is pretty realistic, you will have to reload your ammo and check if you got a bullet in the chamber. Also ammo is very scarce and hitting targets is difficult. Failing to take out the turrets and/or robots quickly will result in a quick death, they will attack you with precision and you will die after one or two hits. Everytime you start a new game the map (and audio cassettes) are randomised so that adds to the replay value.   For a game that has been made in just 7 days, Receiver is a really good game. Obviously you should not expect a game that will enjoy you for many hours, but the time you spend with this game is well worth it.  ",

It's pretty good, with two exceptions.  1: This guy is the weakest person alive. I mean, okay, getting shot once and you go down, that's fine, but I've jumped out of trees higher than the distance this guy will break his legs upon landing from.  2: It runs very poorly. I'm not sure whether that's due to inefficient coding or whatnot, because we all know the circumstances by which this game came about, but I can hear my computer chugging away even on the lowest graphics settings, and the game stutters like a chipmunk on crack. Meanwhile, I can run The Witcher on its highest settings without so much as a drop in the framerate.  Had this been pitched to me on paper, I would've said, 'Go back and finish it, then we'll talk.'

I aimed and fired... although all I heard was a *click*... I had a clip in my pistol, but there was nothing in it.

The plot of the game is you are what is known as a 'receiver' and you exsist in what people call 'Reality B.' Receiver is known as a rouge game, meaning everytime you die, you take a new body, the rooms are connected in a different order, to top it all off, you start off with a new gun in a different state, maybe even a flashlight. The guns you could receive (no pun intended) in the game are either a Colt M1911A1, a Smith and Wesson Model 10, or a Glock 17 with a full auto mode. It tries to potray a 'realistic gun' in a way (seeing how the graphics are pretty basic); you can manipulate every part of the gun, from safety to pulling the slide half way to check for a chambered bullet. The enemies are what the game calls Killdrones: An flying one with a stun gun on it, and a basic turret. What sucks about the game is how one hit means death. (Hex, Remember to write a transition between death and goal, -Hex.) The objective of the game is to 'absorb' 11 tapes holding information about the world around you.

The map is randomly generated for each playthrough and each time you die but things will definitely start to look familiar the more you play. Your mission is to locate 11 tapes that are scattered around the map and listen to their dialogue while staying alive. Be very careful while turning each corner in this game because a single enemy shot will kill you and send you back to the beginning. Oh and did I mention the guns are also randomized? There are 3 guns total but how many bullets they have and whether they're loaded, cocked or with the safety on can vary between each start.  On the negative side, there are framerate hitches whenever you walk into new areas and the levels can get really dark. The flashlight proved more of a nuisance than help because it only lights up a few feet in front of you. This could mean life or death in this game. There are no gamma settings in the game. Also, as I mentioned previously, the levels can get a bit repetitive at times because they are seemingly different pre-made areas which are stitched together in different ways because of the level generator.  All in all, a very entertaining game. Definitely get this on a sale. The adrenaline rush and realistic gun handling are definitely worth quite a few hours of random fun.",

The core concept of the game is, 'What if using a gun in an FPS was as complicated a process as it is in real life?' and that boils down to each little part of the gun having it's own button associated with it. You don't just tap the R button and watch a cool little animation and then be on your way, you have to do all the little things required and in the right order as your situation dictates. At the start you will fumble around with the gun functions and may not even figure out how to shoot for quite a while. Then after a few minutes you may start to get the hang of it, albeit taking your time between shots. After a few hours of playing you will really get the hang of things and reloading will be like clockwork.  Even the enemies, which are little robots, have a similar complexity to them. They don't just have an HP bar that empties out after a few shots. You have to hit them in very specific parts to disable certain functions of them until you can safely pass by. It's up to you to learn where your shots count the most for disabling them.  The world is rather bland, however, and consists of a bunch of randomly generated rooms in sequence. You will get very used to these room as there is very little variety between them. You will figure out pretty quickly where the ammo drops can be and where the robots can be placed in certain rooms. It's the only real flaw in the game.  The music is decent and gives a proper mood to the whole thing.  One odd thing to note about the game is that you have to go to a separate website to patch the game.  Specifically here  [forums.wolfire.com] . Otherwise the game run's very poorly I've heard. I've only played the game patched and it is recommended.  If you are someone who want's a score then I give the game 5 cassette tapes out 5.

I suck at this game. the gimick of mechanical deatail to how to operate your gun is extremely sastifying although confusing and difficult to get use to but the smart help system really eases that difficultly curve. Shotting enemies in different places all have different effects and learning these on your own can be excited although it is explained in one of the 11 tapes you need to find.   Lacking areas would be the voice over for the tape dialog and the lack of really interesting text but looking for the tape is whats fun and you probably arent looking at this game for a gripping story. also the aim sensitivty just never seems perfect for me i can't get the pinpoint accuracy i want even with all the dpi settings on my mouse.  overall i say that this game is worth the $5 and will last quite a few hours",

The storyline is short and not compelling, the game doesn't run or look particularly well at all, and the gunplay is unique, but not enough to hold my interest.   The story is told through audiotapes found randomly throughout the game. I found it rather uninteresting, which in part is to be expected as the primary objective of the developer was to experiment with gunplay mechanics. As a result we have a storyline that just gives you a reason to collect audiotapes and shoot guns at robots.  The game did not run particularly well for me, and I doubt it’s a problem with my hardware. Clipping and pop-ins are fairly common. The environment is not textured so anything other than the guns you use look bland. The backdrop of a metropolis was a nice touch but overall the game was unimpressive graphically and technically.  The gameplay is centered on the gunplay. You are given a random gun in a random condition with a random amount of ammo. You can manipulate nearly any aspect of the gun including pulling the hammer back or loading bullets individually into a magazine, and each action requires a different key. It takes time to learn, but once you start to figure it out it becomes increasingly satisfying to quickly empty the casings out of a revolver and reload it. You fight two types of enemies, a flying taser robot and a turret. Different parts of the enemies react in different ways when shot, so accuracy is rewarded over speed. For example the strategy I usually attempted to employ was to shoot the camera on the turrets as ideally it would take one bullet, and they would no longer be able to detect me. Admittedly the gunplay is interesting, but in the end I don't think it’s capable of holding up the whole package.  Without a worthwhile story and weak graphics, the gameplay fails to make this game worth the $5.00 price tag. I'm glad someone experimented with gunplay to make this game, and if you can pick it up for a cheaper price or free, it is worth trying. Gun enthusiasts should also reconsider what I have said, because this game might be something you will find quite enjoyable.  ",

The Colt and Glock have the same controls except that hitting V forthe Colt will put on the Safety while the Glock makes it either go Semi or Automatic. I like the Revolver and how you can spin the chamber as much as you want with the mouse wheel. Or you can spin it before you place it back.

            "review_text": "This is a brilliant game, I have to say. It only has three guns, and it only has two types of enemies, and it isn't full random generation (Like games such as Starbound), more on that later. However, the game is so much fine. If you think you can come into this and hit R to reload and see your ammo in the bottomright corner, then NO. This game is much more than that. You have to move every individual piece of the gun by either holding or tapping a button, and if you get ONE thing wrong, by the time you go around a corner and attempt to fire the gun and you realise a drone is flying towards you with its taser on the ready, you're basically dead unless you're me.  The game features permanent death. If you die, that's it, all of it is erased, but if you get hit by something ONCE, and that includes your own rebounded bullets (Or bullets you accidentally shot yourself in the foot with), you die. The game generates the world via procedural generation. It basically takes a load of giant buildings, adds some custom things to that giant building (Bullets, enemies, etc.) and then connects it to another giant building. All of the giant buildings have three floors. The game then spawns you in with a random weapon, a random amount of magazines, a random amount of loose ammunition, a random amount of ammunition in magazines, and a random state of your weapon, also it decides whether or not you will spawn with a flashlight and decides whether or not there is an enemy looking at you just as you spawn in to challenge you. You then tuck into a corner and get your weapon all ready. If you find yourself ejecting live rounds out of the side of the gun and then pulling the magazine out of the gun and dropping it off a building or similar, you should press the ? key to bring up a context-sensitive help menu. What this means is that it will show all the things you can do, however things recommended to get your weapon into recommended operation (As in, full auto off, ready to fire, safety off etc.) will be coloured white, and things not recommended will be a dull grey.  The enemies in the game consist of only two types. There are actually four types, however two of them were cut for time restriction reasons (Or I assume), as this game was made in a 7 day FPS challenge. The two enemies in the game are the immobile machinegun turrets, which will now be called turrets, which spin around slowly with a blue light on them, and when they see you, the blue light turns yellow, it makes a beeping sound, it tracks you, and very shortly after the light turns red (to indicate 'THREAT DETECTED') and then it opens fire. You have to either sneak past it or kill it if you want to advance in that direction most of the time, and the way you kill it is not just 'fire until it has no more HP', you actually have to aim and shoot at something and if you shoot, for example, the camera, it will not be able to track you, or shoot at the magazine and it will not be able to chamber any more rounds, but that still means it can still fire one bullet, and I've heard that it tends to trick you, as in hold fire for a few moments to indicate you probably shot out the firing control, and then fire that one bullet straight into you, though no confirmation. There is a small chance for you to be able to hit a nonvital area on an enemy and shut it down, however most of the time absolutely NOTHING will occur when you do this.  There is also these shock drones, which most of the community tends to call them taser bots, or just drones (However don't get into that habit - there is another type of drone that isn't in the game but may be in the game sometime in the future), however I will just be calling them shock drones from now on. They fly around, they find you, they then have the same lights on them as the turret, but then they engage, they rush at you, they try to taser you. These are flying death if you don't deal with them shortly after they spot you, they will even hide above or to the side of doorways and wait for you to come out so it has a tactical advantage, they are VERY intelligent but they have no fear of you, keep that in mind.  The two unreleased types of enemies are: The mobile turret, which is basically a turret on wheels, it looks like it'd go quite slowly and would obviously have the inability to go up stairs, but it'd be terrifying. The other type is a drone with (what I assume is) a gun on it, which would be one of the most deadly enemies to ever exist if I think I know how they'd work, however they probably wouldn't fire nearly as fast as an immobile turret (Nor would the mobile turret) or be as accurate, the turrets are deadly accurate and will one shot kill you if you aren't moving, and even if you are moving and not running they still have a high chance of shooting you in one shot.  I've told you alot of the game mechanics, you should get a basic idea of it, however I haven't told you about the story or the objective.  The objective of the game relates to the story, therefor I have to give you a basic understanding of the story for you to fully understand the objective. I will try not to go into detail at all, the story will probably be much more advanced than I describe. Here we go:     The story is basically an unknown force called 'the threat' wants to neutralise humanity because of their ability to gain an 'awake' status. There are two realities. Reality B (which is basically actual life) and reality A (Which is basically dreaming). An 'awake' status is where you can exist fully in both realities, if so much as a single human achieves an Awake status, they would see beyond the horizon. The threat weakens the resistance to The Mindkill through media. Once they were sufficiently weak, The Threat striked and initiated the Mindkill (I forgot what it actually does, listen to the tapes in the game to figure it all out (I'm not good enough to listen to them all yet!)). The Receivers are able to resist the Mindkill, and as such have to be neutralised specially, so they are placed in this universe (The universe where Receiver takes place). There are supplies aswell as casette tapes around the area (Placed by I don't know! I haven't listened to the tapes in a long time). To achieve an awake status, Receivers must listen to the tapes repeatedly. The maximum amount of tapes required to achieve an Awake status is around 100, however the minimum is 11. There are 11 tapes. One of them is a Cleartape, which, to most people has nothing on it, however if you are close to the Awake status, you will hear things on it.  To stop the Receivers from reaching the Awake status, the Threat 'Dreams' killdrones (the enemies) to the Receivers' location, which then activate.     Alot of this is not implemented such as the cleartape things or the repeatedly listening to tapes, but it will give you an idea of the storyline. You have to collect the 11 tapes before being killed.  The game has mod support, and it has a quite popular mod which adds a firing range aswell as a few new weapons. There is something you should do with this mod to get you started, it's an exercise I created: Basically, you go to the firing range, activate the weapon selection, and then choose the first weapon in the list, and then hold L to reset your game. You then need to put the weapon into full operation order without making a single wrong action, this does not include pressing a button that does nothing, however it includes things like dropping the magazine. You have to repeatedly do this correctly and discharge the weapon a few times without making a single true mistake and as fast as possible, you have to set the amount of times you want to do a weapon, I recommend 3 to start out with, however after a while move it up to 6. If you perform one error, you need to hold L, reset your score, and then try again.  Once you get to the limit, you then select the next weapon in the list- I'm out of space.",

I will give the creator of the game the benefit of the doubt and say they were trying to go for interesting mechanics, but all they really succeeded in was creating a frustrating game that's pretty much just annoying to play.  The game is essentially rogue-like, so even if you end up progressing in the strange plot at all, one small misstep, and you (which I assume is made of paper mache) die and need to restart immediately.   Interesting concept, terrible execution. Honestly, I'm not sure if there is a way to execute said concept WELL, but as it stands, I cannot really say much in favor of this game. Maybe if the devs actually spend more than a week on this game and actually polished it, I could recommend it (Not even making this up, the game was made in a week). But it's buggy. It's basic. The core gimmick mechanic is annoying at best. I got it for free and would not say that anyone should buy this game.",

You don't like magically full magazines? neither does this game. It takes gun functionality and makes it one of the most intuitive challenges you'll face. While the enemy may be limited to mere turrets and drones, the main antagonist in this game is yourself; your muscle memory for gun-handling. Taking out a few turrets is easy, but how easy is it to remember if you fired five shots or six in the heat of the moment?  Key aspects I commend are the damage states and hitboxes for enemies. Bullets may ricochet, merely glazing the target, unaffecting it. Others will damage a target, but not disable it. The feel of my blood running cold as I hear a turret lock onto me from behind, only to realize it was one I left disabled, but still haunting me. Will you spend an extra bullet for some peace, or tread on eggshells, jumping at every beep and bump in the night?   You cannot risk dying. Unlike most other shooters where they toss every possible means to keep you alive (second winds, medkits, revival, unrealistic health), one mistake - one bullet - and you're done. A game emulating gun mechanics would be less of a thrill if your faulty actions did not lead to the distinct taste of failure. In a real-world situation, you have NO room for mistakes, and Receiver makes sure you understand that.   I recommend this to anyone actually looking to own a gun outside of your lovely virtual collection of military surplus. Receiver teaches the minor nuances of gun handling innately through gameplay; a nice way to grasp some gun basics before dealing with a live firearm. Of course, I MUST say it is no substitute for lessons of any sort, merely a glimpse at the responsibility behind gun ownership. Though the game still persists on a 'if it moves, shoot it,' basis, with so many factors to account for, you really think twice before pulling the trigger.  The interface is straightforward and tells you everything you need to know in one place, mid-game. The help menu simply bold fonts actions necessary to 'proceed' in-game, while keeping itself minimal to teach the willing. No flashing 'Out of Ammo' mid-screen alerts. I found myself checking that the gun chamber wasn't obstructed during the less hectic parts more and more after an agonizing defeat brought about by my gun jamming.  The game is well worth the price, and assuming the plethora of cookie-cut shooters out there have already satisfied your need for instant-action, colorful explosions, and lush visuals, Receiver is a great game for someone who has a little patience and wants to play a more serious game.",

This game is mostly a fun little exploration into more complex gun mechanics than we normally see, and while the controls are awkward, they add some depth to the game.

Keep going until you find a tape. You listen to it. Once done, you need to find another 10. After finding 1 more, you die, and lose all progress. 24 hours into the game, you have only found 4 in a life. You give up.  The next day, you come back.   Repeat until you die.

The price of every crappy app on a cell phone that does nothing but pester you to buy the 'full' version while smothering you with ads.  Due to the time constraint it's a very minimalist game, but they concentrated on what matters: the guns, and the enemies. If you look at it in the same light graphics wise as the VR missions in the Metal Gear games, you realize that the tactics and enemy positions are what matters, not the textures and set pieces of the world design. The guns themselves do a great job at standing out and after a day or so of playing you get to where you learn all the actions to effectively use your weapons. There's no HUD telling you how much ammo is left, and the only way to see how many rounds have been fired from the revolver (the trickiest gun to use) is by opening the cylinder and looking at which primers are dented, just like real life.  As for stuff I dislike, the voice on the tapes (no spoilers here, I promise) is just about the last person I would have picked. I hope someone makes a mod that either changes the voice actor to read it more dramatically, or to someone doing a funny voice instead. Anything would be better than the guy they used.  The other thing that screws up just once in awhile is the jumping / collision on or around stairs, but once you realize how the game is procedurally generated I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often. It's really few and far between.  If you've never fired a real weapon before the game adds insight of what it takes to handle one. This is not a run-n-gun spray-n-pray CoD fest. Press R and you eject a round. Press E and you pull out the magazine. Accidentally press E again and you drop your magazine, just like flustered people under duress in real life. This game is fearfully survivor based, and if you happen to run out of ammo with the only way forward guarded by multiple enemies you'll find yourself cursing this worthless piece of empty steel in your hand, just like you would in real life.  This game is about creeping, tactics, cover, and ammo conservation, akin to the first Resident Evil game. If you're looking for Resident Evil 6 then save your dollar for the next Farmville or Flappy Bird clone.  If you hate this game so much then I challenge you to make a better one in seven days. Hell, I'll give you a month.",

I wouldnt have a problem with this normally, but when you combine it with the controls, the awqward inventory system, and enemies that will come careening at you at Mach ♥♥♥♥ing five, it can get really frustrating. But Receiver does do what it wanted to do, and did it well. The gun animations and mechanics are solid, and it wasnt how it usually is in games where it just feels like a weapon. It feels like a real thing, like this is whats between me and death. Reciever is good for those who adore realism, but falls short of the top rating. 4 out of 5.",

I don't know anything about guns, but I'd assume they resemble reality decently.  Unfortunately, the rest of the game is plagued with problems. The design of the game itself is so poor that the furthest I have ever gone in any of my games is finding 2 of the 11 objective items. Frequently, sentries and drones would be placed in locations where they cannot be disabled without being killed. The random initial gun/ammo state meant that I frequently ran out of ammo at inopportune times, with no reliable hope of finding more. The random chance of finding or starting with a flashlight meant that often, I'd find myself in a pitch-black area with no means of exploring. And in one worst-case scenario, a drone killed me right after I spawned, before I had any opportunity to react at all.  Then there's the lag. This game has a horribly severe lag problem. On my laptop, which is capable of running Just Cause 2 on medium-high, this game struggles to run at 800x600 on lowest graphical settings. On my desktop, running it at full 1080p resolution with the lowest graphical settings causes my GPU fan to spin up and create a considerable din. For a game this graphically simple, optimization this bad is simply disappointing.  Receiver is good as a novelty and exploration of game mechanics, but as a game itself, is a poorly produced product and not worth your time.",

Your goal is to collect all 11 tapes and listen to them, which are, not surprisingly, placed in random locations. Also randomly placed is extra ammo, which you'll need to destroy the turrets and Manhack-type things that are, GASP, randomly placed.

The complete spawn randomness makes you constantly feel on edge: 5 out of 10 times you die because you haven't encountered enemies for a while, got lulled into carelessness and strolled around the corner without a care in the world.  This and the need to constantly be aware of your gun's condition and the number of remaining bullets provokes you to actually think and plan your encounters (however lame that may sound in this case).  The one unpleasant thing I can't come to terms with is the inability to drop flashlights. Once I got lucky and found 6! of them, so that my inventory actually continued off-screen.

            "review_text": "This... Isn't really a game.  TL;DR at the bottom  Receiver is a one mode 'game' in which you spawn randomly in a generated 3D world with no textures, with one of three guns, a random amount of ammo, and sometimes a flashlight. Your goal is like slender or other random generated indie games, which is to collect all the messages throughout the level which include voice overs that vaguely describe some plot to give the game some kind of flavor or depth, and in my opinion fails to do so. Collecting all of them means you win, or, at least that's what I'm told, the game didn't keep my attention enough to complete a run through.  Part of the reason for that is this game is rediculously unforgiving. There are only two annoying enemies in this game. Flying buzzsaw robots from Half Life 2 and shooting turrets from Portal. They both kill you in one hit, but the same isn't true for you. Many times you aim and shoot at them and for some reason their 'weak point' hitbox doesn't register. It is overall very frustrating, especially if you can't find a flashlight and you happen to be surrounded by very dark rooms. I ended up just cranking up my gamma.  One last deal breakingly bad thing in this game. When you enter a new generated area (which there are like 6 or so for the game to load to my knowledge), the game freezes for a split second. My computer more than exceeds the requirments this game suggests, but it happens every other time, and can mean a turret might shoot me when it otherwise would not, which, again, means a complete game over and starting the ENTIRE game from scratch.  The redeeming factor of this game is the neat gun concept. You are given no tutorial, but instead a key map shows up on the right of the screen with the next step to getting the gun ready to fire highlighted. A different button is required to perform all of the functions of the pistol you spawn with, from safety, to releasing the slide, to loading an empty mag with fresh rounds. Speeding up this process by remembering the right combination of presses is pretty rewarding, and is also very accurate to real life and educational to those that don't really know how guns work. Slow claps.  If this pistol simulator wants to keep marketing itself as a game it needs a MAJOR content update. New enemies, objectives, a difficulty other than butt clenchingly hard, and a story that isn't one guy breathing into a mic.  TL;DR - Only 3 guns, 2 enemies, 1 game mode - Stutters at loading intervals, which can end up killing you - Has very dark areas but may or may not give you a flashlight nearby - Bland blank textures and one (maybe two?) drab songs constantly playing - Frustrating level of difficulty with no way to change it - Boring generated map - Sprinting requires spamming the W key. Seriously, when was this ever a good idea?  + Fantastic gun mechanics + Shows promise if content keeps getting added  Verdict: Buy it on sale if you reeeeaaally want to try. But otherwise in it's current state it should be free and in beta.",

Today I decided to give it another try. I still don't like it.  Pros -Every gun has a different feel -Sometimes you start with a flashlight  Cons -WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS? -Some bots/turrets take one bullet to disable, some take 4+ -It's very dark and there are very few interesting things to look at -Sometimes you start with only one bullet and there are none around to pick up -Every gun seems to have different controls -If a bot sees you and you have no bullets you're just dead  So since every gun has a different feel they all have slightly different controls. At least this is what I think is happening... I don't know if I missed something in the options for what the controls are or to set the controls, but I could not confidently tell you what button does what. Since every time you spawn you get a different gun it's hard to determine what the controls are based off of trial and error. Literally just adding a button map into the options would make this game so much more enjoyable to me.   I'm not saying that this game is bad, but the way it's presented is incredibly difficult for anyone to begin playing. Overall I'd probably give it a 4.5/10. Overall it feels like a tech demo more than a game.",
