            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this game, but I would not recommend it.   Gameplay  The game begins as a simple farming game which introduces the controls to the player. I liked this portion of the game the best, but I completely forgot what happens afterwards and was surprised. The levels began somewhat easy then got more difficult and longer as they continued. Along with a chase scene in between. I feel as if the chase idea was somewhat stolen from other games (such as Temple Run, Subway Surfer, etc.) I viewed it as 3 different game types mashed into one short game. The stealth portion of the game got stressful due to the fact that I messed up at certain parts, but certain checkpoints help you continue back to where you left off.  I am mainly upset at the fact majority of the screenshots displayed a farming game, but in reality that part lasted me maybe 5 minutes. It was most likely easy to guess it wouldn't last long due to the fact of how small the starting map was. If you explore it the only things you find is your farm and a small stand for the seeds. I wished the developers would of included more screenshots of the stealth portion than to have screenshots of (most likely) the shortest portion of the game.  The graphics are okay, not horrible but not the best. The coloring of the world is simple, no different shades really. As for the music, as soon as I launched the game I noticed I had to turn it on myself and it was not enabled already. I am unsure if it is like this for anyone else, but I played through the game without any sound. I went back and enabled it to help me write this review. The main soundtrack though, seems quite annoying. The main beat is repeated and does not change at all (I would recommend muting it to keep one's sanity.) Sound effects are not bad, better than the music. I just think it's a tiny bit weird I can hear the river across the map as clear as I can next to it. Could be better.    Thoughts  Not really worth it. After I finished my save deleted. I wasn't even allowed to go back to my farm (;-;) which was kinda disappointing. The puzzles were a bit annoying along with the fact since I played it all in one sitting it didn't save my settings (example: windowed, resolution, etc.) which could maybe be annoying for people who might want to play it again for the achievements. The game shouldn't be worth $3.99 and more so the price I bought it ($0.99)",

            "review_text": "I genuinely just want to get back to farming, what kind of bs is it that you make over half of the screenshots of the game about the farming aspect, when really that only lasts a couple minutes ingame.  Absolute bs. I was looking for a chill game that I could play during class without getting too caught up or bored out of my mind, and I thought I'd actually found something. Just let me get back to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ farming, or at least give me my 4 bucks back.",
