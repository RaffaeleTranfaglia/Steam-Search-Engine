            "review_text": "Although I've only logged 10 hours on Steam with this game, I've been playing this game since day one and I have over 10,000 hours logged on legacy platforms like X-Fire.  Call of Duty: United Offensive is the best addition in the franchise by far. No weapon skins, no perks, no kill streaks. Those things don't make a game great in the slightest.   Starting with the Campaign. To this day I still go back and revisit the campaign at least once a year, the campaign is action packed, tells a fantastic story of some of the battles during World War 2, although the graphics, animation and physics do not compare to the newer versions of Call of Duty or new games in general, playing through the Campaign never fails to entertain me.   Call of Duty United Offensive has bought me probably the best multiplayer I have ever played, again it's dated compared to games nowadays but you can't get more fun than going through Foy in a jeep or tank with your friends or even going it alone will bring endless hours of fun.  Unfortunately, the Multiplayer is not as active as it used to be, however there are still plenty of servers running stock maps and generic settings.  Mods are another thing that make United Offensive such a great game. There are so many different maps (Both serious and silly) the game will never go stale and unlike modern versions of the Franchise which release yearly and provide no modification tools to the community, effectively making the game stale after a year.  Is the game worth getting? Yes Is it worth $24? Yes and No. A 10 year old game should be cheaper.  If this game is ever on sale, I recommend this game for hours of something new and fresh.",

            "review_text": "The Good: Amazing cinematic atmosphere, holds of graphically even today, immersive sound effects, realistic feeling gun play  The Bad: Visually look pretty dated in spots, no one playing online, a tad short  Another World War II game, but wait this came out 7 years ago during the subgenre’s peak. Why should I play this? It’s just another Call of Duty. Before you go making drastic decisions Call of Duty started out as a WWII series way before the Modern Warfare explosion. Call of Duty was known for great cinematic atmosphere, tight gun play, and excellent story telling. United Offensive is the expansion to the award-winning debut game in the series. Offensive is just superb and even hold up on all levels today.  The game has three campaigns that run between America, England, and Russia. You play as three different faceless soldiers, but the environment is the main character here. Each campaign has an amazing opening scene as well as some memorable moments like the escape on a Jeep in the American campaign, the gripping plane scene in the England campaign, and the tank scenes in the Russian campaign. There is never a dull moment in Offensive and everything from sound, great voice acting, and realistic sounding war effects bring together a riveting experience that I truly have not found in any other WWII game (even in later CoD games).  Instead of trying to pack every scenario into one game (including weapons) we get some long battles that feel challenging, but not terribly hard. Some scenes can last up to 20 minutes (like the plane scene in the British campaign), but it holds you out just enough to make you feel the terror of war and a little helpless. Some battles require waiting a certain amount of time before reinforcements arrive and then a wonderful orchestral soundtrack picks up and makes it that much more intense.  The gun play is solid and feels great with favorite weapons like the MP40, M1 Garand, MP44, and the Springfield sniper rifle. We’ve used the weapons dozens of times but each weapon feels different which includes power, accuracy, and mechanics of the gun. I feel the grenades still have no weight, but there are a variety of them. Each level and scenario feels different and gripping, but you never get attached to any characters because the environment is the main attraction.  Mutliplayer would keep you coming back, but due to the age there is no one playing online ever so you have to stick to LAN. War games just aren’t like they used to be, and United Offensive shows how to put across the feeling of war as well as realistic feeling weapons. United Offensive stands up graphically as well thanks to tiny details. The only thing dated are the low poly models, low resolution textures up close, and some static lighting. Most of the time you won’t notice because you’re sucked into the experience too much. If a game from 2004 can suck you in after playing modern war games then that really shows how much a games stands up.  --Score: 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "Even though it is an expansion to the first Call Of Duty, United Offensive is one of the best games in the franchise. Because it is an expansion, UO does not waste any time with tutorials or hand holding as the game begins with a bang and never stops until the end. If you played COD1 you know what to expect gameplay wise, but UO stands out with its missions and level design. Just does a good job of mixing things up. My favorite part is probably the British campaign. If you like the COD franchise or WWII shooters in general, I would recomend UO. Word of warning though, you should probably own and install COD1 along side of it.",

Success of this title star Trayarch vs. Infinity ward contest for best CoD game. Enemy AI is more agressive and you are happy to survive wave after wave. There are more objectives like defense and conquer, but they are not so boring as in original game ... you will literally cry from happiness after surviving the mission. What I personally like is the addition of semi-automatic rifles for Soviets and Germans, which make you feel like on Wild West. I finished this game at the second hardest difficulty and I was suprised, when I found out that It is Day of the Victory against fascism today, so I could count this as commemoration for WWII heroes.
