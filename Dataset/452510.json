            "review_text": "We live in a world where MKX is actively giving the finger to PC players by restricting content to console ports, and SFV is a full gaming package the same way a chicken bone and warm beer is a good lunch. As someone who's been thirsty for a good PC anime fighter since Touhou 12.3, I'm thrilled to see Under Night get ported onto Steam in good condition. Could use some mouse-driven menus and less wonky keyboard controls for said menus (this game works best with a controller, if it needs to be said). Other than that, it's a solid PC port running at 60 FPS at 1080p. You'd be hard pressed to find a machine it  doesn't  run well on.  For the uninitiated, this is a 2D fighter featuring 16 different characters, half of whom are in high school as per anime fighter tradition. Don't bother with the story; you don't need to know it. You just want to see gigantic lizards being summoned out of books by a glasses-wearing hipster, whirling blood scythes of doom controlled by a maniac who forgot to take out his Tokyo Ghoul contacts, and of course, very large swords being wielded by very pretty ladies with very large...erm...assets. Controls are tight and responsive for the most part (although F,D,DF is not an easy input for anybody), combat is satisfying and tense, and so far I've had a blast playing this game.   If you have a thing for flashy and engaging combat, but also don't want to put up with any of the recent AAA fighters' shenanigans, give this game a bash. If you are an MKX or SFV fan, pick this up anyways. A very solid investment at $30",

            "review_text": "Just as good as the PS3 version. No obvious issues so far (hour in). Fightstick worked with no issues as well. Small number of resolution options though. Anything above 720p is just upscaling which is to be expected since it is sprite based. No borderless windowed option. Haven't run into any performance issues with an i3 6100/GTX 970. Game definitely is more CPU heavy though for what little it uses.  Overall seems to be a pretty solid port.",

            "review_text": "Under Night In-Birth ported to Steam?! 2 year old game (4 if you want to count arcades) that was ported to PC by ArcSys. This beautifully anime pixel artstyle fighting game made it's way across Steam/Pc for others to be played. The visuals and colorful aspects of the game would appeal anyone who enjoys good, vibrant art style along with flashy effects. The OST is the best in the fighting game genre with it's variety of character's. Different characters to choose from, different stages and modes to play through. You can enjoy various gameplay mode's such as Arcade, Survival, Time Attack, Training and Network! You can also customize your characters by puchasing colors set to your profile, as well as your online Avatar, Title plate, and title! Play in VS, Arcade, or Network to rake IP points to buy all colors! *10 additional colors for every character to purchase in the store*.   Under Night in-Birth is my favorite fighting game, however, it is being proclaimed dead by the FGC. It my favorite fighting game, I will give it my honest review for anyone than being biased about their traits.   Gameplay (8/10): For those who enjoy fast, chain-combo'ing fighting games, this one's for you! If you've enjoyed Blazblue or any of it's iterations, give this one a shot! Flashy vibrant colors, awesome sound effects, and an enjoyable soundtrack to go through makes this the perfect anime fighting game. Different variety of characters to choose from, all being very distinct to their character and not being copy/pasted. Modes ranging from Arcade, Time attack, Survival, and Network, you can choose to play different types for maximum playthrough.   Netcode/Online (8/10): Having played Network as soon as the release, based off the initial Netcode, it is most like the PS3 version of the game. Rarely any lag spikes, and smooth sailing for your combos.   Artstyle (10/10): The game's beautiful!! For being an anime pixel game, you can expect non-boring colors while playing Under Night.  Sound/BGM (10/10): Best background music and sound effects in the game. You can expect different style music, and very fitting and distint to one character's personality. Hard to get tired of listening to any of these OST.   Offline 1v1 (X/X): Being a port from the PS3, you can safely assume that offline is much better than online. I haven't tried this offline yet, but basing off online you can expect it to be just fine.   Now to wait for UNI[st] C:",

The gameplay is very good, at least from what little I've played, and there is a very diverse cast of characters to choose from. The netplay also seems very stable and only with a small 3 or 4 frame delay. Great for button mashers and pros alike. Very successful port.",

            "review_text": "Amazing artwork, neat character designs from both visual and gameplay perspectives, deep yet accessible core mechanics to all levels of play. Chaining moves together almost doesn't have any restrictions and doing a basic combo to enjoy the game is easy and doesn't take much time to figure out.  Story mode is decent and there are few other single player modes to enjoy if one isn't feeling like grinding in training mode. Speaking of which, the training mode in Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late is on of the best training modes in a fighting game, presenting options to recreate virtually any situation that might arise in a match, although some of the options could use better organization. The training mode also allows the player to set a delay between 0 and 8 frames to simulate an online environment.  Online play is quite good but there aren't many players, which leads to sometimes long waiting periods before getting into a match.  Overall, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late is a very solid and enjoyable experience for new players and veterans of the fighting genre alike. Waiting for the 'St' update to make it to Steam.  Oh did I mention how awesome the soundtrack is? Highly recommended.",
