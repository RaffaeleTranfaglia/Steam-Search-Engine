    "description": "I Can't Escape: Darkness is a quicksand trap for the senses - the more you listen and look for clues, the deeper you fall into a damp, living dungeon. Plunge into the depths and scrape together whatever tools you can find, then try to escape one of the most diabolical puzzles of all time!",

            "review_text": "It's a really tense game. It's the kind of game where the unknown plus all the sounds make you feel really uncomfortable, but it doesn't have jumpscares. As other reviewers have said, it's all about building the tension.  It's also not a rougelike, despite being procedurally generated. Every time you play you learn something new about the game and can push slightly further ahead. But of course since there's a bit of randomness to the game, you will sometimes find yourself in very uncomfortable situations.  My Scare-O-Meter reads: nopenopenope",
