            "review_text": "  Have you been looking for a cartoon 3D platform that is reminiscent of 1990s and early 2000s platformers? Ginger: Beyond the Crystals may be the game you have been looking for.   Basically Ginger: Beyond the Crystal is what you come to expect out of a 3D platformer. You jump, you fight enemies, and you solve some easy puzzles. While that might not sound that original, Ginger: Beyond the Crystal is a fun platformer. Basically if you like 3D cartoon platformers you should really enjoy Ginger: Beyond the Crystal.   Probably the best part of the game is the game's level design. The game has fifteen main levels along with 15 bonus levels. While all of the main levels basically use the same mechanics, the game does such a good job creating unique ways to use the mechanics to make a fun platformer.   As far as difficulty I would say that the game is easy enough for children to play and yet is not so easy that adults will be bored. If you play a lot of platformers you probably won't die a lot but it is challenging enough that it is still satisfying.   Regarding the length I would say that the game is probably around four to ten hours long. If you just do the bare minimum to beat the game I would guess that the game would take four to six hours. If you want to 100% the game I would guess that it would take closer to ten hours.  If you don't really like cartoon platformers or really want a challenge, Ginger: Beyond the Crystal is probably not going to be for you. If you are looking for a platformer reminiscent of 1990s and early 2000s platformers though I don't think you could go wrong with Ginger: Beyond the Crystal.
