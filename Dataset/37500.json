With clear and fun gameplay, Magnetis have a challenging progression, nice soundtrack and cool sound effects (play it with a good headphone, please), online (via Steam) score and achievements, and local multiplay in coop and versus mode up to 4 players.  Definitely, this is a Steam underrated gem and worth the ridiculous price it costs.",

There is simply not enough room on the field for this game to be played for more than about eight minutes before throwing up your hands in disgust. Simply doubling or trebling the size of the playing space would vastly improve this game. As it is, two thirds of a wide screen display are absolutely wasted and only to make this game too frustrating to play.  TLDR - Space too small to be fun, DO NOT buy.",
