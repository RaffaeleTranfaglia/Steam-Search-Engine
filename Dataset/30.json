            "review_text": "Bloody frusterating as all hell. Why? Walking through an ally way with team mates, at least four Im at the front, theres a machine gun at the exit and I can't get out. Suddenly, team mates all decide the best course of action is to throw  their grenades out of the exit in an effortless hope to kill the gunner. They all miss horribly.  Allyway is filled with grenades, I turn around and start screaming maniacally while the rest of the team says 'GO FORWARD DUMBASS' I sprint out of the allyway at mach speed, get gunned down, the rest of the team gets blown out of the allyway by the force of a thousand  suns into one big pile of clipping corpses in front of this mortified machine gunner who just witnissed the first friendly fire induced holocaust. The gunner siezes this fnck-up and takes advantage of our major failure. He pushes up into the allyway where all of us, again,  try to have another go at it. This time, im not first. someone else is. The first guy sprints into the allyway and is gunned down. I decide to  throw a grenade which promptly kills the machine gunner and I run  into the ally. My ♥♥♥-backwards sorry sh!t-for-brain team mates  don't read the bloody kill feed and throw grenades at me, thinking  the machine gunner is still there. I scream 'GUYS WHAT THE HELL, IT'S CLEAR, DON'T THROW GRENADES' but apparently all they heard was 'IT'S CLEAR', because they all came sprinting into the allyway practically slipping on their own grenades like mario kart banana peels, and the grenades vaporize our asses clean off.   The game is pretty good. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Despite it's age, ''Day of Defeat'' is still alive and doing well. A lot of the players are non-Steam, so the charts are only correct for the Steam users. It's a WW2 shooter with realism. It is very hard to get into this game since it has a big learning curve and pretty much everyone is extremely good. Most of the maps are very well made and balanced. There are a few narrow maps which are a slaughterhouse if there are too many players though. I believe that there are things you should know before playing this game, so here are a few words of advice:   - Grenades are very powerful - Grenades are detonated quicker if you pull the pin and do not throw it for a while  - Most Grenadier and Sniper shots will be a one shot kill  - In narrow maps it will be very frustrating, so play on larger maps first  - Automatic weapons have recoil which is very hard to handle, so take your time to learn the basics of each weapon  - Constantly check the map to see if you have teammates around, so you know if it's safe to push  - You will die. A LOT.  That's pretty much it. Things like spots, weapons, maps and tricks you will learn along the way of playing it. First few hours will be very frustrating, especially for someone who hasn't played realistic shooters, but you will find yourself scoring more and more kills over time and it will be very satisfying. So, give this game a shot even if at first glance you think that the game is bad or everyone is too good or cheating. It is one of the best WW2/Realism games I've played for sure.",

            "review_text": "Whether looking for an old game to play to remember the days before steam, or because nothing else will work on your computer, this is an ok buy, but only if on sale.  The original Day of Defeat, graphics wise, looks like ♥♥♥♥. Half life, CS 1.6 and TFC look far better than this, and they are much older. Trees, Barbed wire, and various vegetation textures are glitched, and will somtimes not be transparent as they should be. effects are also, unreasonably crappy, as grenades do not show an actual explosion, unlike most older HL games (keep in mind this game runs on another engine, though), and gun fire creates and unjustifiably large, half-♥♥♥♥♥ light effect.  Gameplay is not terrible, though certain effects form jumping, running, and going prone can be annoying. There are many diverse classes with unique weapons, and sometimes even map specific weapons and gamemodes. Most maps are conquest, while some are search and destroy. Unlike CS there is respawning, but on wave timers. Controls are ok on default, but I would recommend some custumization, as some keys, like flashlight, are stupidly placed (it's 'n'). Some maps are poorly lit, quite a few are unnecessarily large, and most are designed so that the battles of WW2 end up more like WW1. A bloody stalemate in the middle of the map that shifts forward occaisionally, only to be stopped by someone in a bottleneck with an MG.  While there is still a community, there are alot of empty servers, so lukily there are mods for bots. While playing can be pretty frustrating at times, it's still a fun game to play, and is far better than it's source counterpart. Get it during a sale.",

Stopped playing for a while in the middle of the decade, picked it up again a few years ago, and have been playing pretty regularly.  For new players, a little advice, please change your name before entering your first game. Communication is key, don't get sniped and neglect to tell your team where the sniper is.  Do not sit in one spot for too long. Some of these guys have been playing since before you were born and can hit any spot on the map. Crouch and shoot unless you're caught unawares, then make yourself a moving target and aim for the head. Stay in cover, but if you kill someone move your position, good teams communicate. Don't take the mg to the top of the bank on Caen or to either sniper loft, you will die very fast.   Learn to snipe on your feet, laying down and sniping is the worst. Try to vary your routine, if you choose the same route too often, experienced players will learn to anticipate you. When sniping an exit from the side, place your crosshair a few feet in front of the exit to give yourself enough space to shoot a streaking opposing player exiting.   Throw your nades on the ground and pick them up, hold them for a sec and then throw them [holding time will vary].   If you use an automatic weapon, aim at center mass and quickly streak up to the head. When walking let your crosshairs naturally rest in a slightly elevated position, that way if you suddenly come upon an enemy, you will likely already be aiming at his head [beware, pros will crouch to avoid this very thing [ofc they'll also jump to avoid your shot, idk do your best]]. Fire in short bursts. Change your crosshairs to dynamic instead of static.   Have fun. This game is great, there is a core community left that is mostly polite and old. But there is still some young blood, like me and others. Try out the Merrill's Marauder's 24/7 Caen and Avalanche servers. They are consistently full and well administrated. I'm usually on in the afternoon/night. GG.",

I spent hours on it since i was 7 and i dont regret a single minute. Okay so lets talk about cons and pros.  Pros: + Big maps- feels like bigger scaled COD WW2 maps.  + Graphics- for the time when it was released they are awesome, detailed textures of guns, troops tanks and such.  + Community- you will never see a little annoying kido`s playing this game since the community is 20+ year olds (thats why sometimes i prefer playing this rather than CS:GO).  + Price- it is worth it even without the sale, since there are cool mods like Gun Game. Zombies and many other cool games.  + Engine- well the game is obviously works on source, but there are major differences between other Valve FPS games. Recoil is absolutely crazy, you cant just sprint and just put a whole clip into someone, even when you are crouching the recoil is less but still hard to control. (which i find more interesting to play and experiment with) This game is not for ragequiters and easily frustrated people.  +\\- Weaponry- since 2006-2007 the new patch removed some content as well with Brittish weaponry and teams, (since then its only Axis vs Allies). And still there is a decent amount of weapons considering its just a simple DM game.  Cons;  - Community- Each month less and less people play this game, idk why but it happens. But there are still like 30+ servers with classic DoD communtiy which i find enjoyable to play on.  Conclusion: I cant really find something bad to tell about this game.  My rating is 10/10 since its the best fps multiplayer game on Steam. (a lot of people may disagree with me and i respect your opinion). ",
