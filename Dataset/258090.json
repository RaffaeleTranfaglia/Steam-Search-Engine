PROs : - interesting story with nice &amp; cute anime arts. - unique battle system utilizing reflex/reaction, short memory, and simple english vocabulary. - steam cloud, achievements, &amp; trading cards.  CONs : - battles are very repetitive and time consuming.  I wish there is an option to skip any battles, or make the battle become much faster  by remove the attack &amp; defense session but keep the word guessing.",

The reason I'm not recommending this game is because in my opinion it's a total rip-off for the full price, you can get better for much less, but that's not even the point, the game get's really boring after a few minutes playing.  The same unique and original battle system that I complimented above gets insanely repetitive and uninteresting, after you discover most of the spirits it just feels like an immense waste of time. The music also gets really repetitive and annoying.",

You take on the role of the heroine Hanabusa who has received the one and only weapon that can defeat the Tsukumogami. The Tsukumogami are everyday items that have come to life, in order to attack them with the sword you must first name what they are using the hints receive. The field in the game is grid based but can be used to your advantage if you want to avoid battling the Tsukumogamis that wander around on each map. At times you will be required to fight specific Tsukumogami and capture them in order to open up new areas. The game can be a bit frustrating and at times fell like it drags on, I recommend spacing out play time.",

This is beautifully visualised in an 2D art style and complimented by the music. It set a good atmosphere kinda like Okami. Though it's has a low resolution. Which is unacceptable in these times. But the gameplay is my issue with the game. Mainly with the combat. It's a mix of quick time events with word puzzles like Scribblenauts. It is very slow and tedious. The rpg part is that great either. You walk around on maps with only tiles with you and enemies on it. And between these maps everything is told by characters talking to each other. Which makes you feel like you are reading a story instead of playing a game.But you have to go through the tedious gameplay to read further. And the story isn't written that good either. So I can't recommend this game.",

It has a visually appealing style and interesting set of mechanics in combat that help keep you going and the story is fairly interesting with plenty of stuff on the side.  Also there is a lot of content outside the main story (blocked areas, scavenging and you can gamble for moniez)  Would recommend for an RPG nut or someone who knows Japanese because the game has 2 versions (one English version and the original full Japanese version)",

            "review_text": "(NB: I have cleared the game on Desura in about 10 hours in addition to the hours logged in here.)  99 Spirits is a Japanese indie game localized into English. The gameplay itself contains mostly turn-based fighting, JRPG style but with just one character, and with blocks and counters requiring quick reflexes.  The battle system is the main novelty here: the character must first find out clues of the enemy's name, then guess its name (an English noun, such as 'beads', 'hatchet' or 'hat'), and only then can the player deal damage to the opponent. As the game progresses, the combat gains more complexity with the enemies guarding against attacks and the player capturing the monsters to do her (Hanabusa's) bidding.  There's not much progression in the way of gear - the only gear the player can change are the Tsukumogami (the monsters). By identifying more different Tsukumogami, the player can boost some abilities that will make the battles less of a chore later down the line.  The translation itself is mostly competent. Especially the monster names - that the player has to guess properly - use English words known to most, with the only exception being 'Torii'. The puzzles are simple and usually require only a specific type of Tsukumogami to accompany the player to a marked spot. Again, there's only one problem and it is knowing that the 'wand' Tsukumogami is used to purge evil spirits. Then again, these aren't a problem due to the translation itself.  Visually, the game is bare-bones. It's functional, but in the battles the enemies are not animated at all and in the 'walking' mode Hanabusa and the Tsukumogami just 'teleport' from one tile to another. There's nothing wrong with the character portraits displayed as they do a lot of their talking in the game.  As for the plot - there's a lot of dialogue, some tropes, and some branching points between which the game progresses with nary a sidequest. A sandbox game of any description this is not, and there's about only one sidequest in the whole game.  The battles have some voice acting, with separate tracks in English and Japanese. The dialogue itself is not voice acted at all. The music is a curious blend of modern and old - you might want to check it out (and not only the game's theme song).  Bottom line: 99 Spirits is a bit different game. The visuals are a bit underwhelming and eventually, the game gets a bit monotonous in spite of how the new features are added for several chapters from the start of the game.  Give the demo a go and see if you like the concept and how it was handled.",

My first question was, 'did someone makes this game using the RPG maker program that steam occasionally flogs?' I had to click and read for a good 15-20 mins before I actually got to do anything, and when I did it was largely clicking again: choose defend or attack, with very little other game play to speak of. I am guessing the draw of this game is story driven, but even then, I was bored to tears reading the setting at the beginning. This game has officially replaced Surgeon Simulator as the worst of the 400+ games I own.",

If you're easily distracted, you'll find it especially hard to piece the words together when you repeatedly have to attack to obtain the clues over and over again. The Combat will quickly become repetative, obtaining clues during battle will just serve to annoy you into quitting and it doesn't help that the maps are just grids with no design. The battle music is very distracting and will start to get on your nerves after failing a defense or two. 99 Spiritis could have been a dungeon crawler with the current battle system still intact, but it became something much worst with an ugly grid styled field and annoying battle music.",
