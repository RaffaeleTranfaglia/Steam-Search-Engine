            "review_text": "14 years ago if you told me european fishing was even remotely similar to american fishing i would've punched you so hard in ur grill that at least two teeth would've fallen to the ground and shattered (so dentist cannot replace)  but now in my moderns days (i'm twenty-nine years older) i'v erealized that fishing is by and large the same regardless of whatever continent you're in  it is all white men standing near bodies of water with rods with strings attached looking to bait the creatures of the sea into biting their hooks.  karl marx once said, 'the products of fish belong to all people, especially poor people because they're pretty great.'  i really like european fishing. it's like sailing in a boat in a body of water and casting a line into said body of water and waiting for a fish to take the bait.  it's fishing more or less.
