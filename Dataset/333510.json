            "review_text": "  TL;DR   A danmaku platform game where instead of shooting the aim is to dodge bullets and try to survive. The goal is to fill meters before yet again more dodging, until you trigger a final spellcard in a traditional touhou style. Smooth controls and platforming while also being difficult yet rewarding, is what sets this game appart from the crowd not for the faint of heart!     Game Detail   Name: Isbarah Gameplay Style: Platformer, Danmaku Personal Score: Infuriatingly Fun    What is Isbarah?   Isbarah is one of those many games where the term danmaku shooter or bullethell shooter should apply in which player dodge hellish amount of bullets and return fire with their own bullets as swarms of enemies, bosses and special bosses line up for a shot [at the player].   However, Isbarah removed the countless mooks, the player shooting and instead of top down shooter we get a platformer instead which should means devastation upon the game but what they have put in place is enough to make up for it and i argue even differentiate it from the others in the saturated market. But does it play as well as it should? Read on.    1:Gameplay   Remove the shooting, the buildup before the bosses and the mocks, what do you end up with? A brilliant little game where the aim is no longer about how many power-ups you collect nor how many mooks you kill but instead you ended up with a clean fuss free game where the boss is your one and only enemy [save for some unkillable backup that shoots bullet occasionally] locked into an arena. Each boss has a set of 3 railgun that the player must dash towards to activate before remaining within in its area of influence to charge it up before it knocks off 1 shield bar from a total of 3.   Once all 3 railgun are activated and the shields are gone, the boss power up and now the player must stay alive within a small part of the arena as a magic circle is being slowly charge. Once completed the boss are weaken and player have a limited window of time to dash towards the boss to receive a hefty point bonus and a restore a lost life or should their life be full they will receive an unstackable shield instead. Failure to do so will trigger the auto attack and no bonuses are awarded.  Easy enough to say but much harder to perform these feats requires to defeat the bosses as they will quite literally spew out rains of bullets towards you requiring you to dodge them should you lost one of your 3 lifes.   Good news is the controls are smooth and tight, this coupled with the 3 powers you are given makes the boss manageable rather than impossible with each defeat[s] serve to hone your skill in preparation for the next battle.  The powers are slow, platform and dash. Dash is the most important as it allows you to escape bullet filled situation and is what allows you to attack the boss after the final spell and activate the railgun needed to bring them down to the final spell stage. Slow basically slowing down time allowing more time to aim the dash or to simply perform tight maneuver in between the bullets. Platform is basically that, allows you to place to place a platform to reach high grounds or its more important function, to be use as a shield blocking bullets from everything. All of these powers have a cooldown time with Dash being the fastest to recharge, platform the second and slow the slowest but it does has the highest reserve.  Each boss you fight often has a gimmick to each of them which affects their bullet pattern somehow, teleporting sudden bullets, fiery bullets and such.  And lastly the game has 3 bosses in one chapter with increasing difficulty as you go further before finally facing the final boss who is very hard compare to the first. Next chapter 1st act, the first boss is as hard as the 3rd final boss before that.  Also your hitbox is a tiny little circle, so long as nothing hits it you're safe.    2:Sounds   Nothing much to say here other than the guitar rift really gets the blood pumping, Especially during the boss power up sequence it switch to a more dramatic version of their songs.  Although you wont be able to appreciate the song much being barrage by bullets and all.    3:Graphics   Like all danmaku games graphics should be good but not intrusive and Isbarah nails it down very well, bosses and environmental items uses bright colours while background and non essential are relegated to muted colours.  However while everything sprite is pretty the bosses seems to lack some animation frames which results in stilted movement akin to wooden puppets, but it doesnt really affects the game so oh well.    Conclusion   Isbarah, very difficult and very frustrating but at the end of the road is the satisfaction of earning lots of points from pounding out that boss is really satisfying. Do beware the difficulty ramps up quickly though as Danmaku shooter should.     EXTRA STUFF   DO NOT STAND NEAR THE BOSS. DO NOT FULLY USED YOUR SLOW, IT TAKES TIME TO REGEN. DO NOT GET HIT. DO NOT GET COCKY AND CHOOSE THE 7TH HEAVEN DIFFICULTY.  and lastly.... Do use normal mode if its too hard.   changelog 1.0 released 1.1 fixed words 1.2 brendon scolded me and fixed stuff   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group     Check out the Original Network Groups.
