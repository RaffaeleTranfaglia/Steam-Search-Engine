Coming from a guy who never shows emotions, has been gaming for a good 12 years and has mainly been playing horror, FPS, and MMOs those twelve years...  I both see and feel why this game has a warning about support groups for real life... This game guilt-trips you so hard and then kicks your emotions around like it's a soccer ball...  I haven't had this much of an emotional roller coaster in, well... ever. I've never had a video game make me tear up before... Life Is Strange changed that.  Easily my 'Game Of The Year'. I know a lot of triple-a titles came out this year, and I know Life Is Strange doesn't get as much attention as other game... but holy hell you guys. I've never played a game with such an in-depth story as I have with Life Is Strange... Hell, I've  NEVER  even played a game that kept me up all night, wondering about what the next episode will be, or how my actions in the last episode might impact me...  This is a game that I will never forget, and it is most likely a game that I will always come back to.    Now, for those of you that are thinking 'ah, ♥♥♥♥ this game. It's a story-based game, it's practically a virtual novel! Who cares!'... Take this from someone who was 'that guy', and said almost  exactly  that before trying this game... You will not regret buying this game. I promise.",

And, yeah, ♥♥♥♥s that the dev trying to get me make me complety ♥♥♥♥ed Dev did a good job, kudos (y) Life is Strange is a masterpiece, people should try this game at least the first episode Forget about the teen drama, this game is not all about it, it's all about how you see future, past, and present time, every action has reaction, and most important thing that you can't fix everything   Enjoy the feel that you live in multiple different realities!    ~ [my ep 1 experience so far review] This game is so relaxing, i like to play it for another couple of hours just to see Max sitting under the tree, it makes me think about my strange life too :p Things that i like about this game : + Nice hand-drawn graphic + Great music that follows your current mood + Interesting story, can't wait for next episode! A must buy 2015 game!  ~ So people asking about my 'relaxing' part of my review Maybe i should edit this The relaxing part of this game maybe just for ep 1, when you advance playing to ep 2 and ep 3, it's the thrilling part, sad and happy and confuse and anger at once because you'll meet new characters, know the facts about your missing friend, or new environment (maybe?) It's a rollercoaster feel when playing this game. And still... i recommend you to feel the rollercoaster feel of this game.",

Life is Strange is the only game that made me actually feel empty after finishing it, it is so well made, it doesn't even feel like a game anymore but like something actually happening, you grow attached to the charachters and actually care for what happens to them, especially Chloe and Max. The story is very well written and is very engaging, basically every decision you make will have further consequences, some are major, others minor and some are just so hard to make that you sit there not knowing what to decide for 10 minutes and after you chose one option you spend the next half hour thinking whether or not it was the right thing to do. Besides the great story there also is the soundtrack, which is absolutely stunningly beautiful, the music fits so well and only empowers intense or emotional scenes. Talking about emotional scenes, the game has lots of them, many of which will (almost) make you cry. Life is Strange is definitely the best game I've played so far, the amount of detail in this game is insane!  All in all I love this game and I can only recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Playing Life is Strange, it felt like I was looking at a hazy photograph of myself. It follows Max, a nervous, geeky teenager with a love of photography and obscure alternative bands, with big plans for her life but no idea how to achieve them in a world that feels simultaneously overwhelming and incredibly small in her remote hometown. She’s her highschool’s weirdo, tumbling through life trying to do her best and avoid the asshats that seem to wait around every corner. She is, so much that it almost felt creepy, a digital recreation of the person I was and in a lot of ways still am (though certainly a cuter one). This is the most I’ve ever felt like my character in a game was “me”, and that makes for a powerful tool for sparking empathy in a story as personal and scarily relatable as Max’s.  But Max is also her own person, not just a shell for me to live out a virtual life in. Reading over diary entries, snooping at her texts, watching how she interacts with the people around her, she doesn’t feel like a character, but a human being. I might be able to shape the path she takes, but there was never a pretense that I’m actually in control here, and though that might sound like a bad thing in a video game it works amazingly at creating the same feeling of being powerless in the face of people that seem so above you that Max feels as she struggles to make it out of Blackwell Academy alive.  Highschool is an inherently terrible time, and that’s captured in the people around Max who would seem like diluted cliches if they weren’t drawn from the same people you probably had to put up with too. The rich snobs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jocks, elitist science nerds, and general air of animosity is highschool in a nutshell, drawn in a way that’s far less glamorous of cartoonishly absurd as we so often see in media. It’s just highschool, bland and full of petty dramatic; an environment I recognize and want as much as Max to get away from.  If that sounds like a strange recommendation, it’s because it really is a bit hard to say full heartedly that this is a life I want to go through again. I can relate to Max, but that doesn’t mean I’m any more thrilled about dealing with her idiotic compatriots as they try their hardest to be absolutely despicable. But, that also feels like something that has to exist for Life is Strange to work, and a big reason it feels so real to me. Life just really sucks sometimes, and you have to push through that to find the things and people that make it worth living.  In Max’s case that person is Chloe, a childhood friend left behind when she moved out of her hometown, now caught up in her own mess. She’s Max’s antithesis; rebellious, outspoken, willing to do anything and think of the consequences later if it means getting out of the hole she’s been left in. Her and Max are all but entirely opposites, and yet able to understand and help each other. It’s not a cheesy kinship, or necessarily an easy one; it feels natural and human, something you have to work at but you can’t imagine losing. As of its first episode, Life is Strange is mostly about the relationship between these two people ostracized from society (though for very different reasons) trying to find their way in a world that seems larger than life. And maybe it’s because I could see myself so clearly in these characters, but that worked for me, and was enough to make me want to stick with these characters.  But that’s not the only story developer Dontnod wants to tell here, and the other is where they begin to slip up a little, though also where they have the most chance to take the game in limitless directions. See, Max can rewind time, and already she’s had to use it to save someone from being killed (as well as herself). She doesn’t know how she can do it, but now she’s having premonitions, watching the world repeat again and again, and feeling like a lunatic with no way to explain what’s happening. It sounds like the crux of the narrative, and maybe it will be in coming episodes, but where Life is Strange so far really screws up is immediately making Max’s power feel small and ordinary.  Though initially shocked, Max immediately understands how to rewind time, and is entirely unconcerned with using it for even the most mundane tasks. Dontnod has taken something that should be terrifying and impossible to comprehend, and made it just another mechanic to use, which feels more out of place than ever in a world that’s otherwise starkly realistic. It’s also a mechanic that’s used fairly poorly, with puzzles that feel like poor excuses for the mechanic’s existence and causing the choices you make to be fairly unimpactful. Being able see an outcome and then decide if you want to rewind time and change it removes the tension and permanence of the decisions you make, and is something I’m not sure how Dontnod is going to be able to fix the way it’s currently implemented.  As of now Life is Strange definitely feels like a developer still not entirely sure how to make the game they want to, but it’s a game that also has just as much potential to become something really special if they can break out of the mindset of the more traditional games they’ve made in the past. In a sense, they’re a lot like Max as well. A social misfit among their peers, trying to do their own thing while finding it hard to break out of the current they’ve been caught in, and capable of amazing things if only they can find the voice to channel their passion.   Episode 2: Out of Time - Update   Though the calendar says otherwise, there’s the unshakable feeling of space between the events of episode one and two, and it’s a space that leads into the troubles Dontnod has fallen into in deciding what direction to take their game. The sense of indecision in “Out of Time” makes it hard to dissect. There are sparks of brilliance within it, yet a glaring amount of wasted time and unfocused direction.   Episode 3: Chaos Theory - Update   Episode two of Life is Strange ended catastrophically, and entering episode three, it’s clear Dontnod and the characters they’ve created haven’t forgotten. The tone is noticeably subdued and disquieting, with the walls between characters having been broken down as they all share in the shock of what has happened. In these opening moments, it felt like Life is Strange had finally found the direction it wanted to head in, following characters we don’t often see and being willing to go to dark places to tell a story that’s emotionally resonate.   Episode 4: Dark Room - Update   For so long I’ve been so unsure of what Life is Strange is that I’ve been unable to even begin to determine what I want it to be and how well it has managed to live up to that. My expectations have risen and fallen with such erraticism that by episode four I was actively attempting to throw out any preconceived notions about what I was getting myself into in the hopes that I’d come away less disappointed, or preferably be utterly blown away.   Episode 5: Polarized - Update and Final Thoughts   There are so few narratives in this medium that even approach what Life is Strange manages on so many levels, that even if it had to happen within a game which often couldn’t decide what it considered important, what it accomplishes despite all its flaws should speak for just how much this game matters, and how important it is to experience for yourself.   Unfortunately I've reached the character limit for Steam reviews so I'm unable to post my full review past episode one.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: If you look for very emotional games with amazing story and characters, you have to play LIS.  I wanna start by saying that DONTNOD's developers deserve all the praises :).  OMG... Life Is Strange...I love this game. I'll be honest here, I was so fascinated throughout the whole story. I went blind into the game without knowing much and I didn't expect to be mindblown, so it was one HELLA surprise. It quickly became one of the best games ever for me :D. Of course everyone got their own points, which make a game 'best' or good but for me the most important part are them strong and tearful emotions.  It's a very interesting and beautifully crafted masterpiece, which focuses heavily on story and characters, with fantastic time bending gameplay. You will care about the characters a lot, much love to Max and Chloe :D (ultra crush on M+C lol), who feel so real as characters by the way. Their voice actors Hannah Telle and Ashly Burch do superb work in the roles. Also the soundtrack is so wonderfully beautiful, it hits you right into the deep emotions.   LIS is like an amazing journey through friendship and life. It's as if you are there with Max, making all these moments become so real. I would say that it's kinda a mix of Telltale games, Heavy Rain, 80's Twin Peaks tv-show and Butterfly Effect-movie.   It made me remember my younger days and old friends... which is amazing. I was able to relate to the characters a lot, especially Max because of my similar experiences during school life, relationships and shyness for example. I don't often play a game with so much decision making and some of them honestly feel SUPER difficult, so need to think a while about what choice is right. It has a lot of funny stuff and some puzzles too. You make your own unique adventure in cool ways.   During first minutes it might seem like only some typical school-drama stuff, if you aren't still interested in it. But trust me the more you play, the more awesome and mysterious it gets and it will surprise you. As you progress further, you will know what I mean as it gets jaw-dropping. I was already addicted to it from the start of EP1. The journey through Max's and Chloe's time together is unforgettable experience to me, with choices that made me laugh and cry tears of joy and sadness.  I didn't think I would cry rivers at first, but especially endings of every episode and 5th...holy ♥♥♥♥. It was unavoidable and I'm a sucker for this kind of story rich experiences about friendship &lt;(^_^)&gt;... Yeah, I do love games that make me shed some manly tears, because not many have given me something like this during my 20 years of playing and I personally think it is truly special for a game to give that. You will love LiS too. I think Life Is Strange made me feel all these emotions more than any other game, movie, tv-show etc after so many years... Which is why it is the best game I have ever played. LIS touches closely to my heart and soul.   Anyways, long story short... everyone should live through this Strange Life. I know developers make art, when they make me care about characters so much to feel this way and when I can't stop thinking about the journey, I rate it HELLA 11/10. Thank you so much DONTNOD, I'm forever grateful for this best game ever. Bae 4ever!   It inspired me to start drawing again too after 8-10 years, now after almost a year I still listen the OST every day, play it, think of it, read fanfictions and made me meet fantastic friends from all around the world. LIS hella changed my life &lt;3...and I think it can make people to become better. ",

            "review_text": "LIFE IS STRANGE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Life is strange is a point and click adventure game / movie set in a place call Arcadia Bay. This game is very similar to “The Walking Dead” and “The Wolf Among Us” with a little twist to it.   You play Max (ine), an eighteen year old teenage girl with a passion for photography. During class Max experiences some sort of trance and sees something which is similar to a tornado ripping of Arcadia Bay lighthouse, and then she is suddenly back in the classroom totally confused. Finally the class ends. After wandering around the Campus our main character witnesses a crime and, believe it or not, she is teleported back to relive her previous 10 minutes in class. A classic case of Groundhog Day! Then, she realises that she can rewind time. Fabulous idea, especially that all your actions have consequences (just like The Walking Dead but you are not rushed into it). And you can decide which one sounds the more appropriate to lead you into the story.   Episode one sets the stage and story beautifully. You will meet interesting people including Chloe, Max’s childhood friend.  The visuals are superb with plenty of opportunities to take great screenshots. Max will certainly envy you for that. The soundtrack is good and the point and click system is very easy to use.  I really took a punt by purchasing episode 1 – 5, but if episodes 2 – 5 are as good as the first one I am in for a little treat.   Positives: ~~~~~~~~   - Beautiful graphics - Good dialogues - Great atmosphere - Achievements - Trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - We have to wait until March for the next episode  I really enjoyed episode 1. If you like the Walking Dead, you must give this one a go!  10/10 for episode 1    MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE      FOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE  ",

This game (In my opinion) Is about 'Social behavior', Its about talking with people and learning how to reach them, how to fit to the society you're living in, watch people actions and  Learn about their personality. Why do you need that?  To fix the problems and horrible scenes this game is gonna put you trough.  'Ever wondered how its feel to play with time, Jack?'

Its a mix of Heavy Rain (Only without the mellodrama of David Cage), A TellTale Style Adventure game, Alan Wake esque setting and story telling in a High school slice of life drama with the feel of an Indie Film with incredible music, acting and writing.  You Play as Max (an 18 year old girl who moved back to her home town of Arcadea Bay to study Photography. Waking up from a nightmare in class Max whitnesses another student being shot and she realises she can reverse time to prevent it.  Thats all I can really say without going into spoilers.  Every character here is amazing, From your main cast to your typical Jocks, Teachers, Fellow students its just amazing.  Game is packed with funny geek humour, softer moments, action and you might even get the feels here and there. You might even learn a bit about Photography here :) I feel like I did.  You really feel like these characters know each other for years, they have there own live and hobbies and circles of friends and nothing is hammered or forced unnaturaly in. (Atleast I felt like that from Just the 1st Episode)  I am totally hooked and cannot wait for more episodes to come out.  I am absolutly recommending this game to anyone who loves story ritch adventure games.",

            "review_text": "Just to begin with, this game hit me with chills right before the credits rolled for episode one. I want to say this is comparable to a Telltale game but, honestly, the writing and narrative style can't be compared. However, if you enjoy episodic video games you'll probably enjoy Life is Strange. I've heard it has a similar feel to Gone Home, but I can't comment on that myself.   So what can you expect with Life Is Strange? After the first episode I can say that I hope you can expect meaningful choices that matter. I would be supremely dissapointed in this title if your choices didn't really affect the overall narrative. A core aspect of this game is the rewind system and I'm hoping that it was put there for reasons other than an 'oopsie' button. It does feel like the rewind system has more purpose than to drive the narrative but we can only wait and see.  You may notice this game looks hipster as ♥♥♥♥. You probably aren't wrong and the pop-culture references do get a little old but they fit the characters and the story. They don't feel tacked in at all. Hey, we were all high schoolers once. Or maybe you still are. At any rate, we can all relate. But if you don't want to play Tumblr: The Game, you may want to stay away. In a way, it's like playing an indie movie. The characters are well written, the dialogue is superb and I was hit with the 'Donnie Darko' feeling the entire time.  If you're on the fence, watch some youtube videos. Not TOO much! And if you're still on the fence just buy one episode to start out with. But I really look forward to how this series unfolds. Color me impressed.",

            "review_text": "Episode 1 :- I wasn't sure what I was quite expecting when I came into the townof Arcadia. Withing the first few monutes, however, I knew that I am going to enjoy these episodes. The Time rewinding mechnic is a lot of fun and makes your choices that more complicated rather than easier. The characters introduced in episode 1 are very much alive and each have thier own lives, opinions and storied for you to look into and comment on or ignore. The soundtrack adds so much to the game that makes me more connected to both the world and Max and I cannot help but become attached to Max having access to her thoughts and personality. She deals with the struggles of college life which are prominent in both our own lives and movies and it is interting to deal with them with this time rewinding mechinic. I can only hope that the pure fantastic atmosphere and storys continues through the episodes and I cannot wait to see if my choices have doomed or saved realtionships in the future. Time may have felt like it was on my side, but only time can tell me whether I have made some terrible choices.  Episode 2 :- After the cliffhanger of 1, I was wondering how the world would have changed. Well, more like how much Max's world would have changed. We see more of Chloe and have a seemingly pointless fetch quest in the middle of the episode (involving beer bottles) but while fetching these bojects you stumble upon some more story about Chloes life and her realtionship with Rachel and also hearing Max's thoughts on leaving Chloe behind. However, Chloe really takes a back seat for what is really an episode that deals with another character that was introduced in Episode 1. The episode is much harder hitting and your choices from episode 1 will come and hit you in the gut here if you have made some wrong ones, and when the episode closes you will either feel like a Hero or feel helpless. Rewinding time cannot help you all the time, and Max's ability can only go back so far. Either way, if episodes continue like this, we are going to be in for one hella ride.",

            "review_text": "What if you could go back in time and change history? Would you fix your mistakes? There is only one catch, fixing your mistakes might cause severe problems in the future. This is the basic premise behind Life is Strange, a charming adventure game from DontNod Entertainment, where mistakes are a trial run and friendships last forever.  Set in the idyllic seaside town of Arcadia Bay, the story centres around two great friends who are searching for a missing girl. To find her, they will use a time-rewind ability that allows you to change conversations and solve non-linear puzzles. You play as Max Caulfield, a softly-spoken photography student, who is joined by her best friend Chloe Price, a rebellious teenager. Together they experience joy and sorrow across 12-15 hours of memorable adventuring in five substantial episodes.  From a gameplay perspective, it is most similar to the Telltale games. This means lots of conversations and basic puzzles. But rewinding time changes things for the better, and is used cleverly in some of the earlier episodes. It also has some exquisitely crafted scenes with brilliant camera angles and compositions. Also worth mentioning is the charming music, featuring slow guitar strumming and gentle voices, perfect for those emotional moments. Lip-syncing is really the biggest disappointment, not up to standard for a game with this much dialogue. It also needed more voice actors.  Aside from these minor pitfalls, DontNod Entertainment has crafted an endearing, time-bending and memorable adventure with Life is Strange. It takes players on a quirky sci-fi adventure through time and space as they uncover the truth. It will be hard to forget the special moments these two great friends share.

            "review_text": "I was rather torn when I finished playing Episode one. On the one hand, I loved the game: It played pretty smoothly on my computer once I lowered the resolution, which is more than I can say for the average game (there were some weird rainbow glow colors thing going on during my first play-through, but it was fixed by the developer and the second play-through I had no such problem), I liked the story (it seemed interesting, from what little you can glimpse on just one episode), I liked the style (gameplay wise it was somewhat reminiscent of, but not at all like, 'The Walking Dead' - as far as choices and timing and actions, I mean), and I love being given options on what to reply. Plus, the time rewind was beautiful. I wish all games had that, because I always have my 'No, wait, that's not at all what I wanted to say!' (particularly when they only offer you one part of the answer in text and it's not at all like you thought it was meant when they say it out loud and then you're stuck with the bad choice because the developers couldn't put things down clearly. Not here, though!). I also liked that I had all the time in the world (sort of) to consider each answer carefully, there were no real quick time events (which I kinda hate) and what did need to be addressed 'quickly' could be fixed with a rewind... so...   On the other hand, the first episode was way too short, even for the price tag, and as much as I want to play the next episodes, I'm not sure I'm ready to shell out the $17 for the season pack. And here's why:  I understand things have to be scripted, but I would have liked to have the opportunity to explore more on my own. I understand it's a story game and not open world, thus is has to be linear, but it doesn't have to be that linear. What I mean is, why can't I go to the parking lot and tell the guy 'I still don't have the USB drive' but look around the place anyway? I would have enjoyed the ability to go back and forth and explore thus a bit more (locked to the 'area', sure, as in, unable to leave school grounds, but still free to move within the areas within the school grounds).  Moreover, I feel like not a single thing was resolved in Episode 1, and I think it would have been better if [is]something[/i] had been resolved. I don't even mean the big plot stuff, but... something small. I don't know, so that you felt like you actually accomplished something, which I think it's important in episodic games if you want them to get more.  As for the answers, while I do believe what you choose now will have consequences later, I was a bit disappointed upon replay that there really wasn't that much difference in the answers you got if you went one road versus another...   Also I read on the comments that a lot of people had troubles with the controls (on how to look/use stuff), but I had zero problem with it. It's the same some other adventure type games have used, there's nothing wrong or broken about them.  I can't really comment on the story as a whole from just one episode, but it seemed interesting enough and I'd be curious to know more about her power. I hope it's revealed in further episodes how she got it or why she has it.  Replayability is rather low, at least having just the one episode, because like I said, there weren't that many differences when choosing another road. I did love the time-rewind concept though, and I'd be looking forward to the season pass if it went on sale.   All that aside, I'd still recommend the game if you're into this kind of adventure/story types.",

            "review_text": "Life is strange, sure. Also, it's sometimes a bit disappointing no matter how many do-overs you get.  A review of the game really needs to start at the ending. After four episodes (a few hours each) of making choices, seeing consequences and constantly double-guessing yourself the game culminates in a final episode that goes completely off the rails. Setting aside player opinions on the climax and whether or not your choices were meaningful, the ending is bogged down in lengthy cut scenes interspersed with irritating mechanics such as a maze sequence or scenes that try to turn the casual interface into a twitch game. Your 'rewind' power gives you infinite attempts to get it right but timing a kick or a trip just didn't feel right. The pacing was off as well -- one moment you're leaning back in your chair doing nothing for five minutes as people on the screen talk, the next it's hustle, hustle. Simply put, I didn't have much fun for the final hours of the game.  Up until that point though, Life is Strange is an interesting enough journey and occasional puzzler revolving around a teenage girl, Max, who learns in a moment of crisis that she has the ability to rewind time, using the power to attempt to solve the mysterious happenings at her school and re-connect with her estranged best friend. With the plot focusing on the teens, the dialogue is sometimes eye-rolling and Max is a bit too precious and twee for anyone's good but the story has moments of genuine pathos and the mysterious story line has its own twists. I may be a bit too removed from my teenage days to get 'hit in the feels' (as I understand the kids are saying these days) but the story kept me playing despite this not really being my preferred genre of game.  Game play is usually very simple and casual: You walk around, items of interest get highlighted with a circle, you look at or interact with them in some way. Interlaced with this is your ability to rewind time, allowing you to prevent things from happening or alter the course of a conversation by presenting new information. Many small instances of choice pop up as you play and each chapter ends with a break down of the decisions you made (or failed to make) and how many others did the same. It's interesting to make a seemingly obvious decision and then see that only 35% of the players thought the same way. The art is usually attractive and visually consistent although some parts looked distracting low-res. The mainly acoustic indie soundtrack wasn't my cup of tea but fit the overall feel of the game.  Ultimately, I give the game a somewhat reluctant recommendation despite its unwieldy conclusion. The road to that ending was interesting enough and had enough bright moments to make it worth taking even if ending falls flat.",

STORY (Spoiler-Free &amp; Short):  U playin' as Max Caulfield, a student in art school, who out of nowhere learns how to rewind time. And she sees her best friend from her childhood, Chloe, after a long time and they start to solve a mystery of a missing girl together n' w/ all of that comes an amazing plot w/ a lot of a stuff going Max's life &amp; school with all the different scenarios &amp; relationships.  The story overall was perfect, it had so many plotwists that it kept me interested all the way through, n' of course the humour was great as well.  They established a great atmosphere on this game as well, amazing job with that.  The characters in this game are as good as any game ever, they did all the different persons &amp; personalities amazingly.  I won't spoil it, but there are 2 different endings n' I must say that I was kind of disappointed with the one that I chose... Not cos' of the actual choice but cos' the game kind of didn't do justice to it. The other choice was so well put together &amp; presented deeply but the ending I chose just didn't really show what happened...  GRAPHICS:  The game was also very very pretty. The graphics &amp; camera angles were perfect. The game was really artistic &amp; I really liked that, ever.  GAMEPLAY:  The game is point &amp; click game, very similiar to Telltale's games. U make ur own choices &amp; find different stuff as u wander around that matter the story.  SOUNDTRACK:  I had to make soundtrack as it's own category. This game has one of the BEST sondtracks of ANY game that I've ever played! The soundtrack is just absolutely amazing.  VERDICT:  I would suggest this game to almost everybody, if u are into story rich &amp; choices matter games, this is ur choise. I just want to emphasise n' point out the excellence of all the characters &amp; soundtrack of this game one more time, it was just mindblowingly good, this is truly a memorable game.

            "review_text": "Well, I just finished episode one, so this review will at start ONLY give my views on the first episode.  What is 'Life is Strange'? Well, I would say Life is Strange is an story driven adventure game alá Telltale Game.  Is that it? No, that's the thing, it isn't. If it was I might have called these guys 'copycats' but that wouldn't really have been fair, since I do not call Call of Duty copycats of Battlefield or the other way around.   But to return to the subject, it isn't a Telltale Games clone in that way that it actually has game play.  Telltale Games are famous for letting the player draw his or her own story by choosing different paths, and sometimes some easier puzzles (At least in The Walking Dead S1) This game has that, and a little more. This first episode has more puzzles than a whole season of Telltale Games, sure they aren't hard to do, but... The way you are doing them, that's the interesting way.   As you probably know, this game is about a girl, her name is Max and she's 18 years old, she just started going to this high-school which name I've unfortunately already forgot. It was something typical American. However, she discovers very early in the game that she can timetravel, at least a few seconds. This time-traveling is the main focus of the puzzles in Episode 1. You want to do something, you try to do something, you fail, you rewind time, see what's going on, change what you did earlier, and ta-da success!   Unfortunately this time-travel option is not available, but only when the game want it to be, which at times are a bit frustrating. I was at the time of playing talking about the game with a friend who became very interested when a certain scene happened in the game, so I said I could show him with the Steam-stream, however I wasn't able to turn back the clock at that time. Nothing big but I just wanted to state that.   How is the atmosphere of the game? Does it fit an 18 year old girls mind? Well, in a stereotypical way, yes. Do I like it? Yes. It fits perfectly to Max and her surrounding. The music is great, the art style of the game is beautiful. Not perfect though. There are quite a few graphical glitches and the faces seem... a bit... lifeless at time. But Life is Strange eh? ;)   One thing that did surprise me quite a lot was the length of the episode. Used to playing Telltale Games I thought this would be like... 1.5 - 2.5 hours at most. I spent a bit over 4 hours playing this game! I wanted to explore everything! Get to know everyone. Unfortunately I didn't even get that chance! The episode is taking your through different areas of the campus and some other places, but there are loading times between these areas, and if you enter 'Area 2' from 'Area 1' and you have something to do in 'Area 2' you can't return to 'Area 1', it simply tells you 'I can't leave yet' or a similar message.   This was quite sad because I didn't explore 'Area 1' fully, I missed a lot of photography possibilities, yes you can actually take pictures of things. (Only things the game wants you to take pictures of though, and there are achievements) So not only did I miss these things, but I also missed achievements. (Not that important though, I just wanted you to know)   Now I talked about quite a lot of things, but haven't really mentioned the story, except the whole time-travelling thing, which by itself is big thing but the story is more than this. A girl has gone missing, which is made known by all the 'Missing person' papers everywhere, and this made me think the whole story has something to do with her, she is mentioned more and more often while the time is passing, so I guess there is something mysterious going on around her.   Either way I can't wait for the next episode! Which apparently will come in March 2015. I highly recommend this to any adventure game player.",

When you base you entire game about your choices matter, everything you do has consequence and you cant back out of those consequences, you shouldn't end the game with a binary choice that removes all the weight from your other choices. You can get one ending or the other and what's even worse is one ending is clearly the one they want you to pick; They put more effort into that one, to the point there is a right ending based on this one choice. Also this game is red herrings and unfinished plot lines galore there are so many from the native American stuff to how the time travel works in this universe or what gave the powers. By the end of the game I really loved it but thinking over my time with the game I feel frustrated, I feel like I wasted hours of my life playing this game which pisses me off. If you don't think it will get to you then maybe you'll enjoy it if you can get past bad lip syncing the artstyle is beautiful some of the characters are interesting and there is some LGBT+ stuff if you like that.

I write this review just after completing the third episode and I have to say I have had my moneys worth already!  I would recommend this game if you enjoy a slow-paced game that is story rich with a wide variety of characters. If you're looking for constant action, look elsewhere.  To summarise what the game entails, you play as a student at Blackwell Academy called Max. We follow and control her decisions through her daily life - decisions that can have heavy consequences. Max later finds out that she has a power to rewind time and leads to lots of crazy shenanigans. Feels included.  Do I recommend this game? Duh its cool, why would I write a review for it?  (Don't buy it solely based my review though, I may have mislead you all because I enjoyed this game too much)",

AND OH GOD IT IS ! Life is Strange is both one of the best game I ever played and one of the best show I ever saw. The gameplay is very relaxing, if you enjoy looking around everywere to find little details or easter eggs you're gonna be amazed, and there are somme puzzles to solve (not very hard ones) that makes it even better. (*spoiler free*)The story is completly amazing, at first I thought it would get boring but it really doesn't and I never expected anything that happened, the endings though are... well one of them sucks a little, but no worries since it's a choice you can watch both of them and make your choice :) Every single episode is worth watching and buying (even though I didn't buy all of them yet, im planning to do so but the money's not flowing you see ^^') and they are all so good that I can't decide wich one I prefer :P TL;DR : This game's awesome, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna cry, and you will always remember this game.  To Dontnod : PLEASE make a silent hill like game, that section where max broke time in the last episode was so awesome and scary :3 And I'm looking forward to play Vampyr too.",

Kinda longish review  I just beat this and all I can say is what a ride it's been. Serious props to the team at DontNod for making this gem. I got it not really knowing what to expect, but this is now one of the best games I have ever played. The characters and story are simply fantastic and very creative. Decisions are hard and actually have meaning, and there will be instant regret. 'WTF did I just do' was probably my most common thought during my playthrough. Presentation-wise, the visual style/graphics are great and really fit the game's theme, voice acting is top notch and conveys emotion amazingly well, and the soundtrack is absolutely perfect for this game (in my opinion at least :P). It is also very well optimized. Had no trouble running nearly everything maxed with a nVidia 660m.   Honestly, I'm having trouble putting my experience into words, but I will say this: If you are big on story in games, or games where player choice matters heavily (and are not afraid of shedding a tear or two), this is the game for you. Simple as that. I cannot express my satisfaction enough. The team at DontNod have truly done an amazing job with this. (Thanks DontNod! :D) I've seen it on sale quite a bit both here and other sites, so if you want to wait, you probably won't have to wait too long. Again, highly recommended! Amazing experience.",

            "review_text": "Sigh. What to say about a game that decided to throw all of its potential into the trash with the very last episode?  Smart, I guess, since the game had everybody hooked with the first four episodes. But like the great Freddie Mercury sang: “It started off so well”…  First, the good.  Life is Strange is a game that depends on the relationships between characters, and the attachment that grows between player and characters. What made Life is Strange powerful for me was the coming-of-age story that it is – for teenage characters to come to terms with, and confront, difficult concepts like grief, loss and ultimately, acceptance, was great to see and executed with a bittersweet, very human touch. Chloe is a beautiful example of this – she starts out as an angry, defiant hellraiser, even with her estranged best friend, but develops into a mature, appreciative woman in a matter of days through the difficult events that are testing the residents of Arcadia Bay.  There’s a lot to explore in the quaint little coastal town of Arcadia Bay and its high school, Blackwell Academy. Through exploration, you discover more about the backstories and problems of minor characters – even if they have given you reason enough to dislike them in the main narrative. It’s easy to pass up or miss some of these opportunities, but it wouldn’t make the game quite so good if you did. DONTNOD have created a sufficiently immersive world in that regard, because it feels like something’s always simmering in the background in Arcadia Bay. Max’s adventures are not all there is to the world; some of her schoolmates are wrestling with their own demons too.  Of course, the rewinding of time is a neat little mechanic too. What makes Max’s powers poignant to me is how they mainly exist to help her grow and mature as a character. What starts out as a convenient power to have then teaches her the danger involved in defying ‘fate’ and the difficulties involved in trying to shape events that should be beyond anybody’s control. The ability to use your rewind powers in tiny situations – such as when you’ve upset an acquaintance – is a nice human touch, because who hasn’t wished they could take things back? Who hasn’t ever hoped for a chance at a do-over? Even one of the core mechanics to the game is intended to appeal emotionally to the player.  Then, the not-so-great.  At times, the twists are unnecessary and feel as if they exist purely to shock – but that I could handle, because they do still serve a purpose in the story, and in this game, the objective really seems to be the growth and development of all characters involved. Still, the dialogue and the events could’ve used a more subtle, nuanced touch at certain points, but most people would be willing to overlook these flaws because the focus has always been on the people and relationships in the narrative. One criticism has been that the dialogue can be forced and cheesy.  Finally, the dealbreaker.  I regret to say that the closing episode really killed the entire game for me. I’ll always have fondness for the first four episodes, but in Episode 5, the game tried too hard to be things that it was not and decided to shelf the minor details in favour of the main ‘story’ about Max and Chloe. Perhaps a prudent decision, but not particularly satisfying or helpful lore-wise when you remember that many potential plot points, like the overarching influence of the Prescott family, the strange popularity of the missing girl Rachel Amber, and the native American symbolism woven like a thread throughout the fabric of the game, all remained woefully underused. Even things that were directly mentioned in the game went neglected in the final episode.  Bearing in mind the deeper sufferings and motivations of even the side characters, the story’s main villain was a mere caricature by the beginning of Episode 5. The first half an hour or so was a mad rush of exposition and nonsensical ramblings of a madman. Not exactly the best use of your time and resources, DONTNOD. Then, the game takes you through a series of trippy dreamscapes – very out-of-place, considering that although Max’s powers are very magical, she’s always dealt with reality and the myriad possibilities that are constantly in flux through the narrative. The hour or so of navigating unrealistic nightmares suddenly felt very foreign and overused to me – what is with everyone who wants the player to experience some kind of bizarre psychological acid trip within the game? (Far Cry 3 boss battles anyone?) Also, it was a poor choice to spend all that time recapping the ‘crucial’ moments of the game while the episode was in progress. People forgave the atrocity of this episode precisely because of the attachments they had formed to Chloe and Max – there was definitely no need to remind us of the emotional moments again. Then, the classic Mass Effect 3 mistake. Red, Green or Blue (although there were only two choices in this game) that served to negate every single meaningful decision in this game. Perhaps it was fitting that Chloe has to remind Max that we live for the journey and not the destination – perhaps they anticipated the criticism and meant that to be a direct message for the player, because that definitely reverberated through the fourth wall and felt like a patronizing, direct slap to the face.  Sorry, DONTNOD. I’ve been known to revisit games and replay them countless times, but Episode 5 wasn’t a closer, it really was the nail in the coffin.  Rating: “Was it all wasted, all that love?” 5/10, 5 whole points taken off for the disappointing finisher. Play for the first four episodes and just write your own fanfic ending afterward.",

            "review_text": "Life is Strange is one of the best ‘experiences’ I’ve had for a long time. I say ‘experience’, because Life is Strange is a real mix between game, story and movie. They creators have taken the best things from those three things and combined them into a game where the choices you make throughout the whole story influence everything that will happen after you have made that choice. And with the power of Max, turning back small portions of time, they have given you… doubt… Did you make the right choice? Should I rewind and make a different one? What will be the effect?  Max is a typical teenager, but while witnessing the murder of a girl in the bathroom of her school, she gains the ability to rewind time and this gives her the chance to change events, minor and major ones.  The story she gets herself into goes from normal teenage drama (do people like me? Do I fit in?), to a psychological drama (the disappearance of a girl and the state of depression of another) and the end of a city because of the scariest tornado you can think of.  Choices you have to make are hard and while you think it might be the good one, you always have this nagging feeling something bad will happen because of it. And you might be right about that!  The story reminds me of the movie ‘The Butterfly Effect’ (you know, the only movie where Ashton Kutcher could actually deliver a perfect role).  I recommend people to play the game one episode at a time. I think that makes the experience even better, because you will think about the choices you have made and gives you time to really ‘feel’ the story.  I started playing as soon as episode one was released and played the game episode by episode while they were released. And I decided to write this review only after finishing the game to make sure I wasn’t biased by endings of episodes.  Now that I have finished the story I can only say it was completely worth every minute, penny, agony and doubtful moments this game has cost me. And while others might b**ch and moan about the ending, this couldn’t have gone otherwise! I think people will need some time to think about it and, like the ending of Soprano’s and the ending of the non-Hollywood cut of The Butterfly Effect, then agree that it couldn’t have gone otherwise.  Since I have started playing I haven’t been able to put this game out of my head and I haven’t been able to shut up about it in conversations with friend and co-workers. This game deserves to be game of the year and more.  Hopefully the team at Dontnod will be able to surprise us with their next project just as much as they have with Life is Strange, and no, I do not want a season two… That would be a mistake (or at least, I think it would be a mistake to try and top this one).",

CONS: - Apparently all your choises don't mean anything after all, you just choose one ending and it simply wipes out all your previous decisions... - Both endings are completely empty unsatisfying cliffhangers - for real, they completely kill this game, did writers run out of ideas or what? - The fifth episode feels rushed overall - more than half of it is just one long weird nightmare that sums up previous episodes. -   I can't choose not to tear up Max's competition photo in the fifth episode. Seriously, I'd rather her to stay in San Francisco instead of choosing one of those two empty endings...   - I wish I could spend more time at Blackwell and in Arcadia Bay just having fun with other students to know them better. - The uzzles are a bit too easy in my opinion.

            "review_text": "Life is Strange is about two teenagers, Max and Chloe, who were childhood friends, coming together to solve a mystery. A girl named Rachel Amber has gone missing and Chloe is the most determined person in Arcadia Bay to find her. Meanwhile, Max keeps having visions of a tornado destroying Arcadia Bay and she also discovers that she has the power to rewind time and change actions/outcomes.   The game mechanics involve exploring various settings and making important decisions that affect the game's story. The graphics are awesome and many times very beautiful. The soundtrack was fitting, as it features many indie music groups and artists, and Max attends Blackwell Academy, which is an prestigious art and science school.   I really enjoyed seeing diversity in this game. There were some people of color. I, personally, would've liked to have seen more than just a few people of color, but at least it isn't a completely whitewashed game. There were a few overweight characters, which is definitely a rarity. Usually, everyone is thin and 'perfect'-looking unless they're a villain or comic relief character. Then, of course, there's the same-sex undertone between Max and Chloe, and also Chloe and Rachel.   Game Analysis (MAJOR SPOILERS):   As you come to find out at the end of Episode 4, Mr. Jefferson is the main villain. He's been kidnapping young women and using them against their will for his vision of 'innocence' in his photography. There are a few clues that could've led you to that conclusion earlier. In his lecture, during Episode 1, he talks about taking any one of his students and capturing them in a moment of vulnerability. In Episode 2, the biggest clue is the binders with women's names on them. There are several of them. But we only know about Rachel Amber's disappearance. This means that whoever is responsible for Rachel Amber's disappearance and Kate Marsh's blackout experience has to be someone new to Arcadia Bay. Max later confirms that the only missing people reports filed recently have to do with Rachel Amber, so where are those other girls from? They couldn't be from Arcadia Bay. As the game mentions, Mr. Jefferson only recently became a faculty member at Blackwell Academy.   As we find out in Episode 4, Rachel Amber was murdered. My guess is that Max gets her rewind powers from Rachel Amber's spirit, who is represented by the doe. The thing that really convinces me of this is how the doe shows up in the foreground when Chloe and Max discover Rachel's body. The doe also had appeared at the very beginning of the game, when Max is trekking through the storm to the lighthouse, and leads her through it.   I think the game developers had fun 'trolling' the Gamergate community. There are several instances of terminology being used that Gamergate members would use. Daniel has a shirt that has a fedora-wearing neck-beard man who says 'm'lady' ironically. There's a poster on Warren's dorm room door that (probably) Nathan put there with terms like, 'beta phag' on it. Later on, Warren talks about being 'alpha' and not a 'beta nerd.' Then, in the nightmare world, Warren refers to himself as a 'white knight.' I guess this is what Gamergate gets for flipping out over two female main characters.   So ... the endings. Well, I have to agree with the majority. I was a little disappointed with the endings. While the developers have stated that there is no canon ending, I must say that I do think there is an ending they prefer to be canon. I think they want the player to sacrifice Chloe. The 'sacrifice Chloe' choice leads to a much longer, detailed ending. The 'sacrifice Arcadia Bay' choice leads to a very short guilt trip scene of Max and Chloe driving through the destroyed town. Speaking of guilt tripping, in the nightmare sequence, there's the last part where it's the diner filled with Arcadia Bay inhabitants who are begging Max to not let them die. To me, the message of this game was 'one can be sacrificed for the greater good' even though by that logic, Chloe deserves to die and I don't agree with that at all.    Regardless of flaws though, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story-rich games and choices that affect the game's story.",

            "review_text": "Gosh... Where should I start? This game gave such a roller coaster ride to feeladelphia, I began to wonder how I can review this without spoiling too much?  GENRE If you are into interactive adventure story telling game, then this game is definitely for you. This game is story rich. All your choices in the game means something and it adds up to your overall experience. It offered some moral dilemma, and twist your heart here and there. It might be not the best puzzle adventure game out there. But this game has its own charms. It offered interactivity, to let you know that you fully in control of your own destiny. That your choice is really your own choices and consequences. If you are ready to feel fluffy inside, heartbroken, relieved, optimistic, and devastated with life. Enjoy this game. Buy it now.  PLOT I bought this game because I am a fan of time travel related science fiction. I've watched The Primer, Predestination, A Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Back to the Future, Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Butterfly Effect, and many other time travel related fiction. Like many other fiction out there, the plot revolve heavily on consequences of time manipulation abilities. Max Caulfield, the protagonist, suddenly found himself able to rewind time. I really don't want to spoil you much more than that. If you find the first episode contains too much cliche drama, or a little bit like teen chick flick, I can assure you, you will be surprised when coming to the next episode. By the end of the game, you will realize that the stories in Ep 1 is really necessary for you to have deeper impact, it was made for something greater. I can only tell you trust me, and buy the whole game. Just consider yourself like enjoying a TV series.  GAMEPLAY MECHANIC I'm a freak puzzle game enthusiasts. If you already played Braid, you probably able to adapt to the game mechanic more quickly, and able to grasp the concept of time rewind more intuitively. However, from a puzzle point of view, the puzzles were not particularly hard. It was designed for everyone (even for player not familiar with puzzle) to be able to solve. Even so, the mechanic of time rewind in this game is heavily integrated with the stories. You will be surprised that your rewind abilities is seen as your natural talent and affects so much in your life as Max Caulfield. This help you immerse in the stories more.  MUSIC/SOUND The music,ambience,sound fits perfectly with the theme and aesthetics of the game. You will found out that, when you heard the song again, you will remember fond memories you have in this game.  VOICE ACTING/DIALOGUE One of the game that has great voice actor with high level immersion. When you heard the voice of Max, you will know when she is truly desperate, optimistic, or just plain cheerful. The dialogue also nicely crafted. The line were not too cheesy/cliche and fit with the theme of teenager, but can be serious sometimes. It all feel so natural.  ART DIRECTION Very great overall aesthetics. Max is a photographer, you often will be amazed by many photos she took (or other) that is really really beautiful. You will appreciate visual artistry of the game. It really fits the theme so much. Choreography and direction is really good. I even wondered on such possibilty to create Movies/live action drama from this story.  SUMMARY To tell you the truth, after finishing this game, I felt very sad, but not with regret, instead with content. This game will taught you many things. How to cherish life, never give up, friends, acting rational and among other things, seeking the truth and look at things deeper than the surface. It was a very emotional ride. This is one of the games where I shed my tears, and believe me, not many games can do that.  10/10, because it is perfect as it is, and I can't see any more improvement for this Art.  I hope I can just rewind time and play this again as if I don't know anything :'). I'm really grateful I bought this when all 5 episodes came out. I can't imagine having to wait the next episode if I bought this before all are available.",

Technically speaking it is (just) an “adventure game”, with some innovative game mechanisms and some less innovative, still good, elements; and yet, “adventure game” would be an unfair and limited definition, that would pay no justice to the real value and depth of the whole experience.  The fact is that there is great intensity in this game: it lies in the story it tells, and in the way it tells it, with a captivating plot, a well paced timing of events and often surprising twists. And there is a kind of magic in the way the game brings to life the main characters Max and Chloe, with their feelings, emotions, personal dramas, contradictions, memories, dreams, fears and choices.   Also the supporting characters are well conceived, and they contribute, along with a high level of attention in detailing Blackwell Academy and Arcadia Bay, the places in which the story is set, to the feeling that while playing you are inside a rich and believable environment, with hints of real life happening everywhere.  From an artistic point of view the graphic style, with its “painted” colors and careful photography, is a perfect match for the nostalgic mood of the game… as is the soundtrack, which is a fantastic set of atmospheric songs, both delicate and powerful in lyrics and music, that really enhance your emotional perception of the game.   Life is Strange is a story about so many things. Just to name a few, friendship and love, choices and consequences, liberty and fate, good and evil, childhood and youth, dreams and reality, conquest and loss, who you are and who you pretend to be, happiness and despair… in other words it is a story about Life, in the deepest and richest meaning of the term.  Believe me, this is a game that will give you much, much more than you dare to expect. For you, lucky people who have yet to play Life is Strange, I do hope that you will gradually let yourself go in living the story of Max and Chloe, let your emotions flow freely… and you’ll obtain in return a richness that will stay with you for long after you’ve finished the game.

            "review_text": "Let’s begin with saying that, in my opinion, Life Is Strange is something unique, wonderful and touching.   Technically speaking it is (just) an “adventure game”, with some innovative game mechanisms and some less innovative, still good, elements; and yet, “adventure game” would be an unfair and limited definition, that would pay no justice to the real value and depth of the whole experience.  The fact is that there is great intensity in this game: it lies in the story it tells, and in the way it tells it, with a captivating plot, a well paced timing of events and often surprising twists. And there is a kind of magic in the way the game brings to life the main characters Max and Chloe, with their feelings, emotions, personal dramas, contradictions, memories, dreams, fears and choices.   Also the supporting characters are well conceived, and they contribute, along with a high level of attention in detailing Blackwell Academy and Arcadia Bay, the places in which the story is set, to the feeling that while playing you are inside a rich and believable environment, with hints of real life happening everywhere.  From an artistic point of view the graphic style, with its “painted” colors and careful photography, is a perfect match for the nostalgic mood of the game… as is the soundtrack, which is a fantastic set of atmospheric songs, both delicate and powerful in lyrics and music, that really enhance your emotional perception of the game.   Life is Strange is a story about so many things. Just to name a few, friendship and love, choices and consequences, liberty and fate, good and evil, childhood and youth, dreams and reality, conquest and loss, who you are and who you pretend to be, happiness and despair… in other words it is a story about Life, in the deepest and richest meaning of the term.  Believe me, this is a game that will give you much, much more than you dare to expect. For you, lucky people who have yet to play Life is Strange, I do hope that you will gradually let yourself go in living the story of Max and Chloe, let your emotions flow freely… and you’ll obtain in return a richness that will stay with you for long after you’ve finished the game.   You will understand what I'm saying when you’ll get there; in the meanwhile, I am sure you will enjoy the trip.",

            "review_text": "Life is Strange is a fantastic addition to the episodic-choice-based genre of games. Taking place in fictional Arcadia Bay, Oregon you play as Maxine Caulfield; a senior in high school attending the reknowned art school Blackwell Academy. A budding photographer, Max is reluctant, and frankly, rather overwhelmed and bewildered of where her life will lead. Anxious of the future, it isnt until she experiences the murder of a girl when she finds out she has the power to rewind time, and that her world will be thrown into a whirlwind of tragedy, emotion, and choice.  My time spent with this piece of art is something I will forever hold dear. When you develop an inexplicable love, attachment, and understanding for each and every character, noting their individuality and how well they are represented throughout, you know that you aren't playing a game, but experiencing a magnificent representation of what it is like to love, to cherish, to hate, and to forgive.  The story cuts deep into your heart of hearts, claws and gnaws at your moral compass, and thows you down into the depths to dwell in your remores, yet raises you high into the light to feel rejoiceful all at the same time. The choices poised here are more than just yes's and no's; each and every choice holds within itself a plethora of emotions that run rampant throughout your mind as you progress. You will feel the alcohol-soaked cut from one choice, and the soothing salve of relief from another. To think you have made the right choice at the start is to commit a fallacy. To better understand not only the choices, but the tremendous impact you leave on the people of Arcadia Bay, rewind and go back. The right choice is solemnly the first choice.  Nothing can really prepare you for what is to come when first experience this story for yourself; nothing can help ease you into the discomfort of knowing the outcomes of a choice, and the impact your actions will on the characters you grow to love, and perhaps it is better that way.",

The entire soundtrack was meant to be incidental but I could not imagine any teenager ever listening to such twee pap. Of course I myself am a decade removed from the age of the characters, but much of the script and music felt just a little forced.  That said, between eye rolls I did manage to examine ALL THE THINGS, make every choice, and take all the optional photos for achievements. On that note, I think it would have been a much cooler mechanic to let the player pull up the viewfinder and take photos at leisure. It would have fit in with the whole 'student photographer' theme and made the achievements feel a little more challenging than finding the thing you can use the 'take a picture' option on.  I'm interested enough to replay episode 1 and make the particular choices that will make this chapter hit all of the beats I'd prefer. Hopefully the raised stakes and (presumable) deeper exploration of the supernatural element will smooth over some of the unevenness I found in the introductory episode.  Giving this a tentative recommendation based on ep 1. It should be on the radar of anyone seeking big-budget interactive fiction. Whether to buy in now or later is left to the reader.",

If you're a big fan of Telltale games, Life is Strange is definitely worth checking out. As much as I love Telltale, this game allows the choices we make to actually have an impact on story, which a few of the Telltale games do fall short on. Whether there is alternative endings for the choices we make is still unclear. (I have a feeling there will be but who knows. I do hope there are alternative endings)  The game feels so cinematic. From the soundtrack, to the way they create each cutscene in the story (the shots/cinematography really make it feel like you're watching a film). The vibe from the game is essentially a highschool indie film. Yes, the characters revolve around teenagers and a bit of highschool drama, but being an adult myself, I don't feel like it takes the appeal away.  EDIT: I 110% stand by what I say above, and I have to add that the latest episode is amazing. The way the game has allowed us to become a part of the story with the discovery of mysteries is brilliant and we really do feel emotionally involved when everything connects in the end. Ok bye.",

Let me explain to you the love that I have for this game in the best way I can: This game is literally everything I have ever wanted in a game. It has the best story I have ever seen in a game, and I mean that as a lover of all the telltale games, mass effect, any story rich game thats out there I have probably played and loved. As a matter of fact The Walking Dead was my favorite game of all time. WAS. Then this game happened.  The feels that this game makes you feel are unlike any feels you have felt at a game. Everything in this game is so relatable and real. The focus of this game is around friendship and average teenager life, and everyone can relate to that because they have been through it. This game is one you show to your friends because you know they can relate to it and love the game as much as you do. This is the only game that has truly messed me up so bad that I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about what I had just seen (looking at you episode 4). You may not have the same impact I did because you may not be able to relate as much as I did to this game, but there is a good chance you will.  Oh and don't even get me started on the soundtrack. The soundtrack on this game will change your music preferences. Seriously its that good. This game uses a combination of liscensed and original music and does it really, really well. I mean really well.  Now about the voice acting. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the voice actors are phenomenal. They do such a good job of displaying emotion in very pivotal scenes in the game and you can just feel it. Its so good. Not to mention the art style and the way the characters act and look work very well. Its a very immersive game in that regard. There's nothing thats going to pull you out of the immersion in the game and it does very well in episodic format. You should take this game in chunks, episode by episode, so you don't stop in the middle an episode and pull yourself out of the game. You won't get the same impact that way.  If you are thinking about getting this game, do yourself a huge favor and do. It is so worth it if you want one of the most special, beautiful, heartfelt, and real gaming experience you have ever had. That is if you like story based games and are ok with not having quick time events or heavy amount of interactivity at all times. If you are ok with that, then buy this game as soon as you possibly can. Seriously do it.",

A few key points in the plot will be seen from a mile away, and you'll think to yourself: Anyone could have seen this coming. However, that doesn't mean this game has no surprises, especially because it's a 'Choices matter' kind of experience.  Without spoiling much about the characters either, the only real problem I had with this game was Chloe, your run of the mill, angsty, punk rock clothes wearing, stereotypical I-hate-my-life-so-much-and-I-also-dye-my-hair-blue rebel... Well, at least she is for the first two chapters, from there on she actually starts to show good reason for being somewhat of a nuisance for everyone in her life, and, even if little by little, work towards improving her attitude. And THEN the game becomes really good, way better than it already was.  All in all, this game could give Telltale a run for its money. If you have the ~20 hours (at least that's how much it took me to complete the game and get all the achievements) to spare of your week, definitely give this game a go, I am sure you will not regret it.",

But this game is giving you more than a gaming experience. This is the true reason to play it.   I had so many flashblack of my real life when i was a teenager, lot of things i had forgotten. I think this game bring you really back in time, at least for the 3 days i was playing it, i was feeling like i was 19 again, because everyone of us, experienced similar situation, conflicts, confrontations and decisions this game forces you to face. And in one character or another, we find the 'young ourself'. And this is the magic this game is able to provide.  Whatever is your game genre or you think this kind of games are not for you - Just buy it. You won't regret going through this experience.",

Gorgeous visuals, incredible story, and captivating characters. Many parts of each installment had me gasping pretty loud/shouting 'No Way' a tonne, and made me realise how insanely nosy I am (rumaging through bins, looking at peoples phones/tablets/PCs/staring at people/touching everything in sight). I adored games such as Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain, so Life Is Strange is obviously no exception to the rule of my favouritings. The main game mechanic (rewind), is excellent, and regardless of whether you rewind or not, most cases I was left panicking as to whether I had made the right decision or not. I also got so into it that at times in real life, I had a few occasions where I thought I could rewind time myself, haha...for example, I spilled my drink in the kitchen, and for a really fleeting moment my brain flickered with 'Oops! Re..wind...wait...'. I get way to into these types of games, for sure. The voice acting is something left to be desired though. I mean, the individual dialogues are ok to some degree, but I'm pretty sure each actor was popped in a room by themselves with the script, with the person they are interacting with in the story dialogue in a different room altogether, mind. If I'm honest, this wasn't offputting to me, and actually made me giggle in some instances. I hope the series rolls on, and on, and on. Like my feelings with The Last of Us, this game will break my heart when it has to come to and end. I'll never get over it, haha! ",

The short version is this: Buy this game and play it. If you find yourself staring at it in the store or your library and thinking 'eh, do I really want to put my limited gaming time into this?' the answer is yes. You do.   This game was a masterfully crafted, written, and acted story that captured my imagination and my heart, and I never once felt manipulated into feeling what I felt. The twists are surprising, but not forced, and they make sense. The characters are very well written and deep. The choices fit the situations very well, and I never once found myself thinking 'Gee, I wish they'd let me make this common sense decision'.

They either didn't sound believable, silly ('You deserve the best stationery') or outright stupid ('I know I should evolve, but I love bacon' - how can someone who thinks that vegans are 'evolved' have any emotional attachment to bacon?). But, other than that, great game.  Also, at the time of this review (29.01.2016), the game has some issues that haven't been solved yet, even though it's been out for a year. For example, the achievements don't unlock if you play with a controler (even though the game states - rightly so - that the experience is better with a controler).",

            "review_text": "This game. Man, this game.  It's very, very good, especially when compared to other games like it - in my opinion, this is so much better than what Telltale has done. The story actually feels meaningful and so much focus is spent on lovingly crafting wonderful characters - including everybody's favorite blue-haired punk, Chloe - and a beautiful setting. But these characters and settings aren't perfect - they're remarkably flawed in a way that makes them seem so much more real and human.   At the crux of the game is its core mechanic - the ability to rewind time while keeping your position on the map, any inventory items or photos you have, and any knowledge you've acquired. Using this ability, you solve puzzles, navigate conversations, and save lives. It feels so intuitive that I found myself frequently assuming that any time I made a mistake in real life, I could rewind and undo it. That's how well this game infects your brain - main character Max feels like an extention of yourself.  Did I mention the game is beautiful? Especially the environments - just gorgeous. Everything is done in this pseudo-watercolor style that just suits the game so well. Character design is also top notch, however, compared to the setting, the characters and the animations aren't quite as stunning. Regardless, the game still looks amazing as a whole. Along with that, the soundtrack is wonderful and does a great job of reinforcing the nostalgic, sad, and mellow chords this game aims to strike.  I know that there have been concerns about the endings - and yes, there are technically only two of them - but I actually think that they're pretty good. Don't get me wrong, you'll probably cry. But that doesn't mean that they aren't good - rather, to me it reiterates the power that they hold. This world that Dontnod has created can absorb a player very effectively, and the conclusions do a great job of ending Max and Chloe's main character arcs and finishing the game's main themes.  I definitely recommend at least trying out Episode 1. I think you'll find yourself hooked, just as I did. The game really isn't all that long, so it's easy to play through the whole thing in a few days, especially since the narrative is so compelling. That short length, though, is not a weakness - for I think you'll find that the effect this game can have on your life and worldview to last far longer than a dozen hours.  After all, life truly is one strange piece of work.",

Стилизованная графика, местами выдающая завораживающие картины, также привносит в игру особое восприятие событий.

            "review_text": "A moving coming-of-age story about an 18 year old photography student who discovers that she has the ability to rewind time – set in a fictional town in the American state of Oregon – inspired by stuff like Twin Peaks. It has plenty of tonal variety, jumping from being a teen drama to a crime thriller, whilst dealing with all kinds of everyday social issues that most games rarely dare to tackle. Above all, it’s a tale of true friendship. Life is Strange stars a wonderful cast of realistic characters (aided by excellent voice acting), who at first may seem like archetypes yet are gradually developed over the course of each episode to become quite human. Some of the people you will meet are at first almost objectively abhorrent, but many of them turn into actually likeable personas by the end of this graphic adventure, showing that a coin always has two sides.  It is difficult for aspects of Maxine’s journey to not resonate with the player’s life experiences in at least some ways; anyone who was (or still is) a teenager between the 1990s and 2010s will likely relate to much of what is presented here. Visually, Life is Strange is absolutely beautiful – although it does not try to be photorealistic, it is nevertheless detailed and genuine. The only problem here is the subpar lip-syncing along with the facial animations in general, which must be this game’s largest flaw (other than rare glitches and occasional frame rate drops)… but that doesn’t stop it from being an emotional voyage that has brought many gamers to tears. It is definitely helped by the great sound design, thanks to an original composed score as well as clever use of licensed music.  Now that the first episode of Life is Strange has been made free, you can try it to see whether it is something you will enjoy. However, please do not judge the whole product based only on its first fifth as the game becomes much more complex later on with numerous plot twists and extensive character development. If you liked The Walking Dead, or The Last of Us and its Left Behind DLC, chances are that you will love LiS just as much. Plus it actually has more content and is still cheaper than Telltale’s recent offerings – most people seem to finish it in about 15 hours, but if you play at a leisurely pace to explore environments, see different options and really take in the ambience of all those introspective moments then you will easily squeeze a lot more time out of it (my first playthrough took me 22 hours).  Sure, it's not perfect and it's not a game for everyone. But if it clicks with you, then it will probably hit you quite hard. And like I said earlier, it's worth giving it a go. Many people who at the start thought they did not belong to the demographic this game supposedly aims at ended up loving it.",

It's is exactly the type of adventure game that is so story-driven that almost feels like you are put inside a movie and able to change the course of events with your choices. Choices matter. A lot. And with them it allows the player to shape his/her own very special turn of events and actions all related around a very specific core background that follows a chain reaction of actions and consequences through time and space.  You play as Max, an art college teenager that dreams to become a famous photographer and who gets in a college located in a town where she spent her childhood accompanied by Chloe, who used to be her best friend.  Max is a photography geek, a very low profile character and a shy person while Chloe having to go through different circumstances of life has turned out to be a dropout punk chick who gets often into trouble and hides a very sweet core beneath her tough behavior.  The story starts the moment you, playing as Max, find out that you have the special power to rewind time for a few seconds or minutes, allowing you to actually be able to undo and redo actions, choices and dialogues, giving you the feeling of control over reality. A feeling that turns out to be less and less strong as laws of chaos theory and relativity begin to take over leading you to a climax of events and choices that will even test your consensus and the way you understand the world you have emerged in.  The game, depending the way you play it - and how your own character and ethics are as a person, can turn out to be a unique symbolic corner-stone of what friendship is about and offers you one of the most basic morals that a human brain must cope with in life, that for every action in life, there's always a reaction.  Technical-wise the game has simplified graphics, probably playable by most hardware setups, it is amazingly designed and voice acted. There's a lot of color, attention to cinematic-like environmental settings and the direction is very well done. And i'm talking about actual direction tricks being used, like camera views well combined with background actions, dialogue combinations, and some times well balanced views.

And I am not into this type of games because you are not really playing, so watching them on youtube is just the same, if not better (I can lay on my bed without the need of clicking every now and then).   Best played in Youtube Recommended Buy Price &lt; 20$ Score 8/10 ",

            "review_text": "Okay, so, I am a big fan of telltale's interactive story 'games', and went into this with many past story game experiences under my belt. I was expecting something good, based on steam's reviews and my past experience with such games, and boy was I in for a surprise.   I was expecting something good, but what I got was something phenomenal. Sure, the mouth flaps didn't sync perfectly with the voice acting, but damn it I don't care! Right away I was interested in our main heroine and her journey into becoming a photographer, I expected a slice of life take on entering adulthood and going your own way, but I was immediately surprised by a twist I wasn't expecting, having gone into the game relatively cold of knowledge about it's story. The characters are all believable, and through 'natural' voice acting from some lesser known actors, the characters get a new layer of realism and allow you to identify with, and relate to them a little more easily.   The only game I can equate this to from any past experience I've had is probably 'Gone Home', it's a very personal quest that Max is on, trying to find herself, and then she gets mixed up in a totally bizarro situation, but the whole thing is sort of grounded in this believable, real world.  I sat down, dimmed the lights, put on my headphones, and lost myself in the awesomeness of this game's atmosphere and character. I beat the first 'episode' in about a 3 hour session of play, and that's looking at everything, talking to everyone (sometimes a few times for different results) and generally getting the most out of the chapter, and at roughly 3 hours per episode, this series is looking to be a solid 15 hour epic! And for $5.50 for the first chapter, I'd say it's worth every cent.   I know these thoughts I'm having are sort of all over the place, it's because I'm having a hard time properly expressing just how much I enjoyed the first Episode of this series, and i am eagerly awaiting the next... and next and next installments.   I went into this game expecting a good time, and I came out being a little sad that I had already finished the first part and have to wait so long for the next. This wasn't just a game, it was an experience, I thought about my moments with the first episode for about 2 days after I finished, and am still mulling over the events, the atmosphere, the character, and of course the wonderful soundtrack of in game songs and themes.   So, in conclusion, I rambled a lot, but everything about my time with Life is Strange is great, I enjoyed every second of it, and I hope that everyone else does too. Get this game, if not then at LEAST get the first episode to wet your feet, and see if you like it enough to take the (super affordable) 20 dollar plunge.  YES YES YES, get it.  EDIT: I have since of course finished the entirety of the game, and my thoughts have not wavered. The game gets incredibly more interesting and even quite dark, the feels overwhelm and you find yourself feeling sad alongside these characters you've come to see almost as friends of your own.   Life is Strange is the best game I've ever played, not because it's the most technically impressive, or has the best story, or has the best world... But because when I was playing; it was able to immerse me into this real world, it made me feel like I was apart of the story and interacting with these characters. I love this game, it's my favorite, and I got a tattoo, lest I never forget the impact this game has had on me.",

I heard this game was coming out and the teaser seemed really awesome. Now that I am playing it, I must say the attention to detail is off the charts. I'd recommend that you pay attention to your decisions because I didn't realize how quickly my decisions would affect the course of the story. The power to rewind time threw me in the beginning changing trivial things and altering the decisions I had made with conversations. But all in all that is what makes this game amazing. Even the smallest decision you make seems to alter the future in someway. It is truly a masterpiece in game design, art design and how a simple mechanic can make a choose your own adventure (already great in it's own right) into something truly amazing. You should buy it immediately.",

Life is Strange relies on a choice and consequence narrative in which you take on the role of high school student Max Caulfield who has just discovered her ability to rewind time. The game focuses on Max's school life but also sheds a light on her relationships and the mysterious disappearance of a local girl.  As Max, you navigate school life through a linear path, interacting with classmates, teachers and friends through choice-driven conversation. However, these decisions aren't set in stone; once a conversation is finished, you are able to 'rewind' time. You can relive a scenario as often as you like choosing which path to take and therefore which consequence may follow that.  Looking forward to the next episodes!!",

            "review_text": "This is only a review for episode 1 and it's a good start. If you enjoy Telltale's adventure games, you'll probably feel at home with Dontnod's foray into the genre. One of the most striking things I came to realize was how much better these modern adventure games can feel when they're built with solid technical design. I felt so much more absorbed into the story without all of the stuttering, texture dropouts, and crashes that seem to be so consistent in Telltale games. This game looks and runs like a dream, with beautiful, confident, and unique visual design.  In spite of some cringeworthy dialogue here and there (they lean a little heavy on teenage lingo that's occasionally dated and a little out of place) I found myself connecting and getting invested in the characters and their drives very nicely. The time rewinding mechanic was a fun way to play around with the short term impacts of your actions that I hope will be expanded upon in later episodes. When I finished this episode, I had found myself so enamored with the experience, I played it through one more time to get the achievements and see the consequences of actions I didn't take the first time around.  I'm finding myself slowly becoming a Dontnod groupie after thoroughly enjoying Remember Me and now the first episode of Life is Strange. Their games aren't perfect, but the unique female driven angles they take and solid technical execution are really something I value. I whole heartedly recommend this.",

As for execution, the graphics perfectly fit the game, the authors didn't aim for triple-A photorealistic graphics, but a stylized one. And hell, that makes this story even better. Gameplay, this is how adventures in 21st century should look like. It is the way 3D adventures should go and tell stories.

Little does she realize, changing the way events play out can have considerable after-effects.  The game quickly drops you into Max's world of school life, one that is riddled with mysteries that keep you asking questions and wanting to learn more about the events taking place around you. There is no denying that after the first episode of Life is Strange, DONTNOD know what they are doing. Life is Strange easily rivals popular Telltale titles set in the same Episodic Story-based fashion.  The voice acting is superb and really makes you feel like Max's classmates are real people with real problems and helps draw you into Max's world which is filled to the brim with tidbits of information that you can learn just by exploring, providing tons of interesting dialogue that expands your view of life in Arcadia Bay.  The art-style used in the game is simply perfect and fits in a way that, once drawn in, makes you forget that Max's world is one of fiction.  Episode 1 offers around one and a half hours of gameplay if you play the story straight through without much exploration which is to be expected for the first episode of an episodic series.  I very much look forward to Episode 2.",

I was bored out of my mind so I decided to purchase Life Is Strange because my friend had suggested it to me. I wanted something to cure my bordem but what I got was so much more than that and I'm grateful.  I don't consider myself an emotional type of guy and have never felt really 'torn up' over how a video game or movie ended, but that was changed at 7:00 AM when I stayed up all night and morning to reach the end of this fantasic experience. This game tore me open like a lion devouring it's prey and as the end credits rolled, tears ran down my face. The pure emotion I had over this game was insane and I never wanted it to stop.   As somebody who instantly fell in love with Chloe,   watching her die so much messed with me more than I anticipated   and I'm not sure if I should be angry at the developers or thanking them for their genius and awesome work at making me so connected to her. I relate to her problems in more ways than one, so learning more about her character turned her from 'the cool chick with the cool hair' into 'the person I must protect no matter what'. During my playthrough I chose the romatic path between Max and Chloe which only made the ending 100x harder to do, but I felt the connection between them.   Now about the problem I had with the ending.  It was easy to see that the developers wanted you to sacrafice Chloe and get the more fufilling, emotional ending. Thats why they deliberately made the save Chloe ending as bland and unfufilling as possible which I don't agree with at all. If you give players a choice, make them feel like it actually matters. Fanfiction can only do so much.   Now about how I felt with the events leading up to it and the choice I made.    I chose to save Chloe. If it's not obvious yet, I'm a huge Chloe fanboy. But that didn't really influnce my decision as much as you'd think. What did influence it was the bond that developed throughout the entire game between Chloe and Max. When I made the final choice the first thing I thought about was every intimate moment, every bonding session, every time they spilt their guts out to each other, and every time Max defied reality to save the person closest to her.    I wasn't going to let everything that was done go to waste. And everytime I ask myself why I made this choice I reply to myself with, 'love is the why.'  I would go into 1000x more detail but this is crushing me so I'm going to wrap it up. Get this game at all ♥♥♥♥ing costs. 10/10 experience, 10/10 characters, 10/10 story, and 10/10 everything else.

Yes, it comes down to just one choice, but the two options you are given will be heavily weighted based on how you played the game.

However, the developers do an amazing job when it comes to tackling the unpredictability of life. Everyone thinks they can change things, and everyone thinks they are the hero of their own story, but sometimes things are out of our control and the choices we make, regardless of good intentions, end up doing more harm than good.

The story feels both large in scope yet incredibly intimate, with characters you care about and relate to.  I'm eagerly awaiting episode 3 to come, I have no idea where the story will go, but the ride is well designed and oozes an indie movie style charm. This is one of the first games since Mass Effect that I've genuinely cared about the well being of the characters. The scenes where they are in danger are stressful as they should be, and each descision leaves you with a lingering doubt whether you made the best choice despite being able to rewind and see out the other options.

I ended up marathoning all three of the episodes (each of them was around 2 hours) I was hooked. As soon as I got the chance, I went out and bought it. And to all of those who simply watched it instead of playing it... BUY IT. It is so worth it. The story, despite having a mildly slow start, is incredibly engaging, and being able to make the choices throughout the game sets it apart from a simple youtube playthrough. I honestly have never had a game that impacted me on such a deep level. And, without any spoilers, the ending is incredible.

I wanted to be able to get all the endings and it took me roughly 5 minutes after finishing it once to get the 2nd end. I wished there were things like the true end, good end, bad end, etc. It had so much potential and it built the characters and the story. You could see it go in different directions only to end up in a very limited setting, and those 2 choices you ended up with aren't really all that great imho.  The impact of your choices were referenced albeit only as a minor appearance in the game. It opened you to some choices sure, but those choices really had no prominent role aside from a feeling of kinda like a cool easter egg.  Chapters 1 through 4 were great I got absorbed in the story. The way they handled the reveals, plot twists, and how they made the characters grow on you is excellent. The ending however could've been WAY better. 9/10",

When I started playing it and it was feeding into the teen drama crap in the classroom, I felt like my original thought of the game was correct. But then seeing Chloe get shot and now all of the sudden I'm back at class, I was shocked, honestly shocked to the point of I sat there for a minute trying to gather myself. When I finally started going again I realised that I could sue my powers to gain the edge in conversations, which added a whole new level of depth into the game for me. So I went through the whole of episode one, captivated by this new world that was before me.   Buying the season pass was the easiest buy I have ever made and I recommend whoever is reading this do the same as me. Watching how the decisions I made in episode one pan out and having to sit back and watch as the reality before me shatters due to my actions. This game truly captured the feeling fo regret, a feeling that seems almost impossible with time travel. This game is teaching a lesson on this, no matter what you do, no matter who you are, and no matter how many times you try, you will always regret something whether it's big or small. I remember a moment where I was sitting in my chair shaking, I kept rewinding begging for a better way for something to end but every option ended with someone getting hurt in one way or another.  DONTNOD Entertainment, thank you for giving us something that if games were ever defined as art, this would be solid proof of that. You've made me happy, sad, cheerful, and made me cry. I end my review by saying this, Life is Strange deserves a place in gaming history, and I hope this will be used as a model that people will follow when they make their own games.

You play as the 18 Yrs. old Maxine Caulfield. The Games has 5 Chapters and in each chapter the play has to take photos and gather clues about the vanishment of a student called 'Rachel Amber'. The game itself is based on the Unreal engine and is very well done. the graphics are stunning and the story is catching. i saw the first episode as a let´s play and i was totally caught in the story and wanted to play it myself. another amazing feature is that your decision counts in every episode. you really need to think about what could possibly happen if you make the wrong decisions, so choose wisely!  i really can recommend this game for people who really need a cool story to life through while playing. but i also recommend this for players who are going to take a break from shooters or other games.",

That being said, I feel that after playing episode one, I have an obligation to add to the overwhelming number of astounding feedback which this game has already accumulated. The reason for these amazing reviews is simply because this is a true masterpiece. In all my hours of playing story given, decision making games, I have never experienced anything close to what this game is able to accomplish. I admire a game that can get me to feel for the characters; I praise a game that takes that one step further, going beyond what any other story can do, making the player truly have experiences. Through smooth, well crafted gameplay and mechanics, I was transformed into the character of Max (also notable considering I am male). I was able to feel like the story was built for me, which is a truly amazing feeling. If you take nothing else away from this review, know that it has life. It's a game with feeling and emotion, and one which will really make you think about each and every action you take. It's up to you to decide whether or not you purchase this game, but remember, this choice has consequences. ",

And OMG, it was really good. I haven't felt so emotional in a long time, and definitely never from a game. You really get attached to the characters. Some of the decisions you have to make are super difficult (it touches on subjects such as suicide, bullying, gun violence, date ♥♥♥♥, etc). It all adds to the experience.  I decided to play the game because I LOVED Remember Me's game mechanics and story. This game was an improvement upon that, although I still personally prefer games of the sci-fi dystopian variety. DontNod has to be one of my favourite game developers.  I highly recommend this game...if you're into realistic narratives and interactive stories. The soundtrack suits it perfectly as well.

Play episode 1 for free to judge if they match your taste.  My thoughts? Yeah, it's a fairly good P&amp;C game. The rewind mechanic mostly functions as a puzzle solving tool, but one can also use it to change any choice made in-game, thus enabling you to experience all the immediate resulting variations of your choices without requiring multiple playthroughs; but rewind does not show long-term results (if any exist).  The puzzles are very easy and mostly serve as in-game 'speed bumps' to slow progress; in fact many puzzle solutions only become available once you hit a mandatory fail-state, forcing you to use your rewind mechanic. The game designed the choice system well and your decisions have a varying level of impact on the NPC interactions, however don't expect an ability to make story driven choices as there is really only one track of story to follow. Nevertheless the dialog options do add colour to the tale.",

The story feels both large in scope yet incredibly intimate, with characters you care about and relate to.  I'm eagerly awaiting episode 3 to come, I have no idea where the story will go, but the ride is well designed and oozes an indie movie style charm. This is one of the first games since Mass Effect that I've genuinely cared about the well being of the characters. The scenes where they are in danger are stressful as they should be, and each descision leaves you with a lingering doubt whether you made the best choice despite being able to rewind and see out the other options.

So what is 'Life is Strange'?  First of all: THIS GAME WONT BE WHAT YOU EXPECT IT TO BE. Until now I've only played Telltales story driven games and almost everytime I was fascinated by the storytelling. But what Dontnod did here is simply amazing.  It first of starts like a story driven by a typical highschool drama. You play Max Caulfield, a teenager that just turned 18 years old and moved from Seattle back to her old hometown, Arcadia Bay.  She attends to some kind of elite highschool, The Blackwell Academy, and loves photography. Her teacher is the famous photographer and artist Mark Jefferson. Max's classmates are also the typical ones. You will find ♥♥♥♥♥es,bullies and nerds.  These different classmates will also have a huge impact on the story and Max's journey.   Can you befriend them or will they hate you?  In the first 5 minutes of the game you will discover which powers Max has got. She can rewind time! This mechanic will be often used throughout the game to reserve decisions or add information to a conversation that you just gathered later.  With those powers she manages to save a girl in the girls bathroom.  After this events the story starts and gets more tense every minute.  But what she didn't know: The girl she just saved was her best friend from her childhood , Chloe Price. Together they try to solve the mistery about the disappearance of Rachel Amber.  Also weather is changing.... can Max find out what causes these changes?  She has to put her powers to good use throughout the whole storyline. Is it worth changing time? What will happen if you do? You will have to play it yourself. :)  Another great aspect are the great written characters. They feel like real human beings and you will be attached to them as soon as you meet them. The game also sends out important messages about life out to the players. It will teach alot of things and is a really valuable experience. In some moments it will shock you, but also open your eyes.  Another reason to buy this game is the beautiful soundtrack. There are so many well chosen songs in this game, it's amazing! I found so many artist through this game and its music. It always manages to touch you and trigger some heavy emotions! :)  Every episode gets better and ends with a boom. Dontnod really overdid themselfes here. It's their second game and they delivered a top-notch story with beautiful characters. I promise. After the end there will be an emptiness inside of you and you will think about this game a long time. These characters grow to you like real friends. You simply are part of their story. Have fun guys!  Its my Game of the Year and a 10/10",

I've played a lot of telltale games so it's safe for me to say this was actually pretty fun to walk around and look around.

There are some open ended questions about them, why they are the way they are, if they love who you think they love - and yet they are so well developed it is clear who they are and why. You get to decide a small bit about why they act how they act based on the story line and it does not take away from who they are.  Let's face it, the scenery and world are outstanding. A super emersive environment that is gorgeous, full of life and detail and helps complete the story well.  This game plays like your very own quirky indie flick, where you get to decide how it plays out. The decision making is great because you can change up how the game plays, but not in such a way that it changes the entire integrity of the story.  The story itself is intriguing and interesting enough to keep you wrapped up from the beginning, and it keeps you wrapped throughout although there are some very interesting twists and turns you'll never see coming.  There are some particulars that will leave you speechless, some moments that will take your breath away, episodes that will leave you on the edge of your seat, and some that will wrap you up in feels the whole time.  I can only say positive things aout this game without trying really hard to find something ridiculous and knit picky wrong with it. It is as close to perfect as this genre of game can get, and it left me utterly sad that it had to end.  Almost better than any of the greatest books I have read, and has an emotional impact on you as you play from episode one through five.  I laughed a bit, I was scared, I was shocked, concerned and even a bit teary eyed at times.

The game is about Max Caulfield grew up in Arcadia Bay but moved to Seatle 5 years ago, just after her best friends (Chloe) dad died in a car accident. Now she's going back to Arcadia Bay to attend to Blackwell Academy. The game starts with Max discovering her gift/power: being able to go back in time. After 5 years of not seeing or writing to Chloe they meet up again. She has turn Punk as a way to express her pain: Her father died, Max left her and Rachel disappeared ... Rachel was Chloe's new best friend after Max moved away. The story is centered around Chloe and trying to find out what happened to Rachel.  Dontnod Entertainment did an absolute great job of every part of the game: - the way time travel was used in a narrative game - choice of music - the story - story telling and directing - rewarding players that try to discover everything - artstyle and graphics",

Pros:   + Amazing art style, looks like a watercolor painting. + Interesting characters. + Your decisions will actually impact the game. TellTale needs to take some notes. + Intriguing story with plot twists around every corner. + At least 5 or so big decisions per episode. + Delves deep into your feelings to make you feel really bad when you mess up. + Collectibles and different decisions add some replayability. + Great voice acting. + The ending is unforgettable. + The soundtrack is unique and fits the game perfectly. + Episode 5 will have you scratching your head saying 'What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on?'.  Cons:  - The characters look a little lifeless sometimes and aren't very good at showing emotion. - Dialogue can be plain cringeworthy at times. The game uses memes from 2011 at certain parts and just ends up embarassing itself. - 'Hella'. - Lip syncing is just plain bad.  Verdict:   Life Is Strange is a game worth buying if you're looking for a phenomenal story. At certain times in the game, it tends to just be a white girl simulator, but it's a good white girl simulator. Episode 1 doesn't do a very good job of getting the player intrigued, but after Episode 2 there's no going back. This game will stick with you long after you've finished it.

The storytelling is so great and unlike many Telltales (don't get me wrong: stories are cool in them) your actual choices do matter - or at least, seem to - due to the rewind time-theme of the game. The game also addressed some of the so-called social taboos on bullying, suicide, and the themes of episode 5 which I would spoil the entire game with should I put them here.   It's good that it's addressed in the gaming world and in such a way that it's not forced on you.

While I sit here typing this, I am listening to the bittersweet guitar tune from the game...and I am quite sad. Yes, I feel like an idiot for admitting that, but what you need to know here is that this is an INCREDIBLE game. And to call it 'a game' is quite nearly an insult to the effort of the developers.  This is an experience. A test. A journey.  'Life Is Strange' is fun, entertaining, interesting...but it is also uncommonly compelling, intriguing, and heart-felt. It is a game that makes you think as it reaches into your mind, tests your scruples and tugs at your heart srtings. If you are like me, you will in equal parts, become Max, wish you were Max, thank God that you are NOT Max...and feel deeply for her. You will want to coach her, cajole her, motivate her. She will then amaze you, bewilder you, and twist at your emotions. Then you will realize that, in a very big way, you are Max...and Max is you.  'Life Is Strange' is an amazingly well put together tale that unfolds based on decisions you make while given the opportunity try different approaches in reaching these decisions. Once you become immersed in the game, you find yourself using Max's power to test different responses in difficult situations, but ultimately you must make a choice, take a stance...and then live with it. And the effect these choice can and do have...can be staggering.   If you COULD change the past, present or future...would you? Knowing Not knowing if or how unanticipated ripples could dramatically affect you, or someone close to you.   Would you?  Bottom line, I consider this to be one of the best, most amazing gaming experiences of my life. The visuals are incredible, the look and feel is so realistic, the music choices and stying is spot on, and the voice acting is absolutely brilliant.  I am grateful to the developers for taking the time to create a smart, thoughtful and brilliantly executed piece of entertainment. When they come out with their next creation, I wll be there.  Life Is Strange.  Yeah, it's 'just a game'. But I found it to be sweet, touching, highly entertaining and in the end...heart breaking.   Stupid game.  I hope you play, take good care of Max, and come back and tell me what you think. ",

            "review_text": "This game is like being in an immersive interactive movie and it hits you in the feels a lot.. It definetly is catered to the current generation of coming to age kids, but you can still relate and fall in love with the story and characters even if you're older. The story is wonderfully told, and the soundtrack compliments the atmosphere and tone of everything perfectly. I felt like I was playing a chick flick movie or Tumblr: The Movie at times, but once you look past some of the stereotypes and hipster stuff it really is a very enjoyable experience..  I've always been a fan of movies with time paradox like Back to the Future, The Butterfly Effect, Project Almanac and such.. The themes are similar, and the consequence of having the power to alter time will have an impact big or small on the future. I had a heavy Butterfly Effect vibe throughout the majority of the game, due to the dynamic of the story being told and the drama that unfolds being very similar.   The fact you can't just go back and load a new save makes the decision making process much better, you have to go with your gut on what you think Max would do.. That's another thing, you really find yourself thinking like Max would think, not so much what you personally would think and that really added to the immersiveness of the game for me.  While I felt the game could of been a bit longer and Episode 5 could of been a bit less rushed, the character development and experience really gives that a pass.. It's been a long time since I've been able to care for minor characters in a game until playing this. Every decision you make you wonder what it will change as the story goes on, and leaves you wondering if it was the right choice.   My only real gripe is even though your decision making does impact the story, there are actually only two endings and your decisions made throughout the game don't really impact those endings at all. I do wish there were numerous endings, or at least 3-4 tops just to give some variety based on your choices.. (I guess the Witcher 3 spoiled me with the amount of different endings you could of had) That also kind of takes away from replay value a bit as well, I can maybe see myself having a second playthrough just to try different things and do the alternate ending but then that would be it.  Overall though this is worth the price, and with Episode 1 being free to play it's worth checking out to see if you can get into the game before you purchase the rest of the episodes.  7.5/10",

I ususally take time to read them and my purchase is heavily influenced by reviews, but I suppose I just couldn't have been bothered, this game is different. I read some reviews telling how phenomenal the character depth was and how heart wrenching the story was, but I've always found my self emotionally secure so I did not think for a moment this game would ever force me to tears, like I said, this game is different.  I honestly have to commend Dontnod for this work of art, because never in my life have I been so drawn in to a game or have I seemingly felt the same emotions the characters were going through. One thing I have always loved about games and books, is when playing or reading one actually makes you stop and think, and you gain a different perspective on things in life. I feel like there are many people who would like (or claim they would) the ability to go back in time and right some wrongs or do things differently, myself included, but after playing this game and the consequences you see for the actions you chose, it makes me honest to god joyful I don't have such a burden weighing down on me. The story in this game is more like an experience than just a plot, in my opinion, this is one of the best games I have played in a long time, Only problems I had, I'd like the Lip-syncing to be little better, and I would've liked it if the smaller, seemingly inconsequential things actually had a bigger impact, i.e. letting your plant live/die, helping Alyssa not get hit by things, saving the bird in Joyce's home, etc. One thing I noticed many people complain about was the final epsiode where (SPOILER) with the final choice, you learn that every decision up to this point was relatively meaningless, there are only two endings, sacrifice chloe and save arcadia bay, or vice versa. I wholeheartedly agree that the final choice seemed very limiting and made the advertisement of 'multiple endings based on choices' seem rediculous, however, the ending was broadcast from the very beginning. I believe that a bad ending doesnt necessarily ruin an amazing game like this. The hand painted visuals are amazing, and I love how Max comments on every little thing, sitting down and reading the journal really allows you to get in her head. Also, the soundtrack was incredibly suiting and the rich story of (being an introvert myself) such a relatable person made me truly love the game. The last episode was a let down, but I wont let it ruin such an amazing game for me, after all, I played Mass Effect 3 ;)  All in all, this game is a must buy, so if you actually took the time to read this, buy it, you WILL NOT regret it, you may cry your heart out though, I am honestly thrilled they are making a second season of this.",

            "review_text": "Well I finished Life is strange. Its really good. Its a really powerful story that engages you in a way no other medium can. I would highly recommend it to anybody. It takes the idea that if a butterfly flaps its wing it could lead to a giant tornado a few months later and uses it to portray many aspects of raw human emotion through the eyes of an 'average' teenage girl.  In the description of the game it is said to 'revolutionise story based choice and consequence games.'. I would not say it revolutionized the genre but rather interpreted it differently. There is a very narrow field of choice of words. In telltale games (Walking Dead, Tales from the Borderlands) there are usually multiple tones of speech (sarcasm, polite, rude, brash, etc) that are all equivalent in how they effect the story. This lets you choose the way your character acts to others which I think is engaging because you can majorly effect the characterization of the main playable character. That being said it may make sense to narrow characterization with Life is Strage because it focuses your choices elsewhere. To me it seems like there are close to 0 choices you make that effect the game's plot deeply. Every player will see all the same scenes with varying character interations. There are small little actions and puzzles that you can perform, or dialouge choices that you make that will change how the characters treat you in conversation but that is as far as it goes. I am not saying this is bad; in fact this makes you focus more on the emotions of characters and the way they think rather than focusing on advancing the plot. This is where the choice system shines because it sucessfully makes you feel like you are talking to real emotional people which is very emmersive. That is why I dont hate on the choice system. Its not bad, just different: which is excusable due to the fact that I belive it functions positivly for such an emotional game.   I like the art style and writing. The art is very unique and quite beautiful at points but looks unnatural and weird at some points. The writing is very High school but is betrayed by the lackluster performance on some of the actors parts. That is not to say it isn't good acting, just not FANTASTIC. The characters are written so belivably and with a lot of intention, but the greatness of the writing didn't stop with characters. The plot is very detailed (albeit there may be sone time travel logic errors) and you can tell there was a lot of thought put into every moment of the game. The use of symbolism in refernece to the butterfly effect is one of the cherries on the top that the excellent writing team put in.  The gameplay is supprisingly varied. I expected to be able to sit back and make some decissions and quickly hit buttons for quick time events like what I was used to with many of these types of games, but I was genuinly supprised to see a wide variety of puzzles integrated into each scene. rather than a quick time event you would get a time travel puzzle. There are also sections where you get a special little mini-game-puzzles to switch things up and advance the plot in an engaging was that didn't require spamming keys.  9.5/10",

It doesn't have mech-suits or guns or war. It doesn't have stealth or an open-world. But what it does have, is one of the most   kick ♥♥♥   choice-based story-lines I have ever seen, played or heard of. Seriously, this ♥♥♥♥ blows TellTale out of the water and makes their Walking Dead games look like child's play.  Firstly, do not buy this game if you don't understand what you're buying. You are buying a visual/interactive novel, with a branching storyline based on in-game choices. There are no guns. There is no army trying to kill you. Yes, you will walk a lot. Yes it is an   experience   rather than a open-world RPG or an action-adventure shooter. So don't come back to the reviews after you buy it and ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan and call it a 'walking simulator'. You knew what you were buying, and if you didn't, who the hell can you blame but yourself. Now that that's covered...  I mentioned this game is better than the popular games from TellTale. I say this as someone who owns and has played the Walking Dead games from them. While those are good games, in terms of choice-based impact on the story and actual meaningful content from the game itself, it'd be damn hard to somehow do better than Life Is Strange. Every single choice you make has a consequence (like real life almost!   whaddya know...  ). You forget to water that damn plant in your dorm? It might die. Water it too much? It might die. Should you warn that girl that she's about to get hit with a football? Or not? Do you help your friend confront her step-father about her Marijuana? Or not?  Every one of these choices has an impact on the game and the story it is telling, and believe me, you can definitely regret some of the decisions you make in the game.  The plot of Life Is Strange does a very good job of keeping you on your toes at all times. There are plenty of plot twists to be had and characters with very, very good development, and you have an effect on how that all plays out. You can befriend certain characters or be their enemy, that's up to you. You choose what crowd you hang out with and how you treat people. The story itself will obviously follow a set path, so you will have to make choices that you would argue you wouldn't really have to make, but that's a bit of the beauty of the game.  So the character development is good, the choice-based story progression is good, the plot twists and plot itself is good, what else is good? The art style is just amazing for the game. Not glamorous, but definitely nice and crisp and inviting. The voice acting. It is   phenomenal  . Seriously. Some of the best.  All in all, this game is designed to be about the story it tells, and while I won't spoil anything for anyone, I can say there are plenty of plot twists, choices you don't want to make, and the game does a great job of really making you   connect   with not just the main, important-to-plot-progression characters, but also the auxillary characters there to bring life to the world they created.  While I'm never surprised when Square Enix publishes a quality game with a quality story, this developer has certainly shined under their influence. Dontnod's only other game was Remember Me. A game with fairly mediocre/positive reviews. In this game, they have shown what they are capable in crafting for an audience. And they hit a home run.",

            "review_text": "Incredible. I could not stop playing, and completed it in one go...it couldn't be helped.  Life is Strange is one of the best games, particularly RPG's, I've played in YEARS.  Admittedly, I was skeptical at first. Don't let the bright, cheerful graphics and perceived age group fool you. Before reading into it and giving it a chance, I made the mistake of letting myself believe this game was only intended for a pretty young target audience. I was sorely mistaken, and found this out the hard way as some very dark subject matter slowly began to reveal itself as I progressed.  This game caused SUCH an emotional rollercoaster, and I found myself experiencing a full spectrum of emotions throughout the story. It's so well written that it's difficult not to become invested in many of the characters, and the thought of losing them can be stressful at times. For me, personally, that's a major characteristic of top-notch storytelling. Knowing your choices will directly affect the past, present and future makes it quite difficult to come to conclusions, and you're often forced to sit for a moment (or two...or three) to look at the situation from a logical standpoint. You're forced to take past events into consideration, while trying to remember who did what/who deserves what, all while playing detective. It was quite the brain exercise!  That said, it wasn't perfect, but no game is, nor can it be (imo). You have to be able to ignore some pretty cheesy teenage dialogue at times, firstly. Some of the puzzles were a bit tedious/frustrating and took up a pretty hefty chunk of time to complete, and I was a little unimpressed with the seemingly limited options when it came to the final choice. It was also VERY open-ended with a few plot holes, and I feel like I was left without full closure, but I do understand why, from a developer's perspective.   All in all, I'm so glad I finally caved and gave Life is Strange a chance. It was a unique and incredibly addicting trip through another world, and I can't wait for Season 2. Highly recommend.",

I never played a game that made me want to rewind so many times to change the decision I made to later only rewind to change it again.   Nothing I decided seemed good enough, nothing I picked ever seemed like the right choice. It's a game that makes you realize how much our choices affect not only our lives but the lives around us. Some of the choices in the game are so hard to choose from.. making you realize that some choices may or may not be the right choice but might not be wrong either. Then there were times when the choice was so easy, that of course we'll decide the right action because it's obviously the best one like deciding whether or not to let your classmate get hit in the face with a football. For me, the answer is to NOT let her get hit.  I HIGHLY recommend getting this game. It doesn't take any skill to play, it just takes someone who's okay at making hard choices and is able to handle the outcome. I promise you, you won't regret it.. but hey, if you do - maybe you can rewind time and never purchase the game in the first place. Stranger things have happened.",

I picked it up thinking it was going to be a great game. I was not only not dissapointed, but even still blown away by everything in it. everything from the emotional rollercoaster that is the story, to absolutely beautiful backgrounds and areas that really do seem just as alive as you would think. a bustling hallway really feels slightly but never actually crowded. a middle of the night park area really feels empty and lonely. this game just absolutely nails the atmosphere aspect of games perfectly. something that is really cool about it though, is the fact that they really did there homework on just how places look in a videogame. how people respond. everything in the game is spot on in the sense that not once will it leave you scratching your head going 'that just isn't even possible' some of the story points may seem a little unlikely, but never impossible. This is quite possibly going to become the new benchmark for story driven games, and for good reason. 10 out of 10 emotional roller coasters, would ride again.",

Voice acting is also uniformly strong and given plenty of personality which makes it a joy to get to know the cast.

You get immersed in the game and establish a connection with the characters, Max and Chloe, and learn about their story. Don't forget the artwork and soundtrack. Art may not be loved by some, but I for one think it's outstanding. It gives off its own sense of unique-ness(?). And don't get me started on the soundtrack. I, personally, like the atmospheric music and the songs that they play throughout the whole game. Especially, Obstacles by Syd Matters. The ending,   you guys know which ending   literally made me cry because it was... well, sad for one, but also it also makes you understand the emotions of the characters question if we were able to do that ourselves. REAL SPOILER-ISH:   All the memories they had with each other is all erased but only remembered by Max.   No, I am not an expert at reviewing or analysing games for that matter, but it still shouldn't stop you from playing this game. Overall, I give this game a 10/10.",

It all makes sense when Choles implores Max to trade her for the town, saying that the week she had with Max was the best parting gift she could ever recieve. After roughly 40 hours' play on all XBOX One, PS4 and PC, the storm is about to take away the Arcadia Bay as Max, Chole, and ultimately the players know it, and you have one choice to make--Bay or Bae. Woe follows whichever one you choose. The game has been billed as a game where choices matter, but this is perhaps the only one that does, since whatever choice you have made earlier in the game doesn't affect anything regarding how the finale is going to play out at this point. I do understand the frustration many of you have here, but I would like to argue that it kind of mirrors the way we make choices, in that although we make all sorts of choices with regards to the nitty gritty or something slightly more important, where different ones land you in different places in life, some favor you and some not, when it all comes down to the important one of which you have the say, you follow your heart in spite of whatever choices you have made before. Sure, Life is Strange is a heart-throbbing and tear-jerking ride that sometimes leaves more to be desired of, but after all, life IS strange, and I'm grateful the game recognizes that.  Life Is Strange also offers a fantastic playlist of Indie tracks that you will fall in love with instantly. Often I just sit back and do nothing but play the songs on Chole's stereo. I can't parise the idyllic, postcard perfect set and immaculate camerawork more becuase almost each screenshot is wallpaper-ready. Along with a very laid-back pace that sinks in your bone and well-written characters you will get to love, hate, understand, empathize, and sympathize, the game sets a good example for tonal integrity in video games. Again, kudos to the creators.  So, if you are fed up with routinely repetitive first-person shooters and want a tatse of something more 'human,' this is the 20 bucks that will be very well spent. It's one of my best spent 20 buck notes anyway.",

Life Is Strange is emotion provoking and made me laugh, cry and had my heart pounding throughout all five episodes.  The characterisation and relationship developments between Max and the town members of Arcadia Bay feel so real and made the final choice genuinely agonising.  Never again will I let anyone tell me that gaming is a waste of time. Life Is Strange is a deeply scientific, poetic and theorietical game that will make you come away feeling more knowledgeable than when you started playing. Since playing Life Is Strange I have learned about and researched into: Chaos Theory, The Lorenz Attractor/ Butterfly Effect, Multiverse Theory, Black Hole Theory, Cause and Effect and much much more; making Life Is Strange a game that stays with you even when you aren't playing the game. The storytelling and plot is imperfect due to the game development being rushed, but I personally prefer it this way; because the thing I love most about Life Is Strange are the exciting, interesting and eye-opening fan theories and online discussions. The game is full of ambiguity and makes you think in creative ways about unanswered questions existing within the game.  Life Is Strange also features a beautifully well chosen and atmospheric soundtrack that I immediately downloaded onto my IPod in order to continue the atmospheric mood throughout the rest of my day.  Life Is Strange is a gaming experience that will stay with me for the rest of my life for all the above reasons and the underlying dark themes and unexpected plot- twists that will play on your mind long after you finish playing  I would recommend Life Is Strange to absolutely anyone, and it makes me especially happy that I have found ambiguious representation of my sexuality within such an amazing game. :)",

Nobody was like telling me to get this game or anything, but my friend was playing this one part in the game that he was really bad at, so I saw some of the main storyline without understanding what was going on in like the game's plot, basically. Then he actually progressed in like the game sort of and got to this one point where there was really this cutscene, I think, and that cutscene was like really what made me get the game even though the outcome of the cutscene was really spoiled for me already. It was like so relateable to my life that I had to experience it for myself and try to play the game for that cutscene. Things were happening in the story and stuff and one part was even able to make me like experience some kind of emotion or something that games today actually do not really do anymore. That's like another way of saying I like felt really sad or something, but I did not like cry or anything because it is just a game, so just trust me on this one. The game did not really like happen in the fashion that I like wanted to, which is both good and bad, because it makes it so that the plot is like not predictable, but it also was like sometimes absurd in a way that I can not really explain and you just have to experience it yourself. You like like the characters that you like and then you like the characters that you do not like and then you do not like the characters that you like and you do not like the characters that you do not like but like that is not always the likely case to be happening in the game, or so it happens to be. Overall, this is a likeable game that you will like because I liked it too so you should get it because that is how the world is like.  I recommend that you play this game without reading any other reviews, because mine totally like explains how good the game is so you do not need anyone else's recommendation, okay?

This is a game equivalent of a crowdpleasing indie movie at Sundance festival. Most will really like it, but only a few will love it with all their hearts, because sometimes it is just trying too hard for it´s own good. Nevertheless, it has by all means an exceptionally strong character driven story, which isn´t afraid of mature „indie“ themes. It also fittingly decapitates that specific 'coming of age' period in life; the problems (or 'problems'?) of young adults in high school.   Not interesting enough for your taste? OK, so there is a twist to this formula, because you have the ability to bend time and space! Don´t be alarmed, ' Oh God, what a unnecesary gimmick ', and let me correct you, because in this case, it isn´t gimmick by any stretch of the imagination. On the contrary it´s a core mechanic around which whole game(play) and experience is built. It´s not used just for action purposes ' as odd duck from the art class saved the world ', but mostly for everyday situations, where you can watch 'what would happen if...' In later episodes there is indisputably more to it, but it´s hard to address it without spoiling anything so I will abandon this with statement 'developers bloody well knew what they do' and that they´re obviously inspired by Donnie Darko, David Lynch, original Twilight Zone, Blue Is the Warmest Color, Butterfly Effect etc. and they are not afraid to show it through countless easter eggs (some are too much 'in your face', but many are quite clever and well hidden).   Aesthetics (not mediocre graphics) are top notch, music is appropriately chosen, voice acting is mostly fitting (but lip sync is almost nonexistent) and only two bigger issues are incoherent pacing and that time to time, there are some paper rustling dialogues.    As a result we have moving and atmospheric (nostalgia and melancholy) game with strong (main) characters. Indisputably not for everyone, but everybody should at least give it a try. And it´s not ' just a regular TV show in disguise of a generic episodic game ', because this is ' as good as a quality TV cabel show with game elements “ and so it´s in game industry its own unique thing.",

The world of Arcadia Bay is very well realized, the characters are believable and the mechanic of Max's powers is intertwined with the game in a way that feels natural once you get the hang of it.  It's like someone noticed the practice of 'save-scumming', ie, reloading a save in a game whenever you get an adverse outcome from doing something, and said, 'hey, let's make that the character's *actual power*'. On a meta level, it's pretty amusing, and it provides for a well balanced power - while Max can fix obvious mistakes, the limit on how far back she can go to change time means she can't always foresee the larger complications of her choices.  The main character herself is adorkable and thoroughly believable as a protagonist. She does second-guess every single major decision no matter what she chooses, but when you have the power to retry something as many times as you want trying to get it 'right', wouldn't you?  Cons: * It took me an embarassingly long time to figure out the 'click and drag' action mechanic. Maybe I just needed more coffee? * The game goes way too far with having a literal popup saying 'THIS ACTION WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!!' at major decision points. If I carelessly leave evidence while searching someone's secret files, or rat out the school's richest kid to the authorities, I shouldn't need the game to tell me that this may come back to haunt me. It's a good thing to have a game where your choices impact the story in meaningful ways, but 'show me, don't tell me' applies. An option to turn this off would greatly improve the game. * The lip synch of the character models can be a little jarring if you pay too much attention to it.

I'll probably start a second play-through even today, just so I can see how some early decisions influence the decision tree later on. And of course I'll have to find the hidden opportunities to take photographs during the game.  The only thing I was and, at least in part, am still angry about is one inconsistency. At one point early in the game, you're told that if you take an object and then rewind, you keep that object. Later, you have the choice to either take a picture or intervene. Being the smartass that I am, I took the picture, rewound and intervened, only to find out later that altering my choice removed the taken picture from my inventory.

I absolutely love the dark yet realistic high school atmosphere.  We meet Max, our high schooler protagonist being thrown into all sorts of teenage drama. After a strange hallucination of a tornado disaster, she realizes she has the power to reverse time; leading to many choices with different outcomes.     The pros:      I think the art style of this game is absolutely gorgeous. I found myself taking many screenshots during cutscenes.    The story really pulls you deep in the game. Players will find at least one character they can relate with, regardless of it being the situation or the emotions.    I love a game that includes details and many things to look at and interact with, and this game is a perfect example.. Looking around in any environment, you can see grafitti, classmates to interact with, and photos to take.    Replayability with slightly different outcomes and details you may have not noticed on your first playthrough of a episode, although you probably will not play through it more than two or three times.     The technical cons:      Occasionally I would encounter minor glitches with the rewind control, such as the characters becoming frozen in a cutscene and I would enter free roam as if it was over. During these experiences I would have to reload from a checkpoint and watch the entire cutscene over again without the option to fast forward.    Lipsyncing would lag behind the audio, ruining the experience a bit.    I would sometimes have the audio becoming jittery, although video played fine.      All around issues:      I noticed that sometimes characters would have the same reaction no matter what you said to them. I found this irritating as I would rewind to choose a different answer to see what happens, and it was a waste of time. Having extra choices was misleading.    When first playing the game, I got a bit worried that something bad would happen after every choice because of the 'this action will have consequences' message. It took me a while to realize that message appeared no matter what.     I highly reccomend this game, as I throughly enjoyed both episodes 1 &amp; 2 and am eager to continue with this experience.

Every character feels different, even if they are cliched, but that works for the title. I quickly can to be deeply invested into all the characters to the point where I made choices based solely on helping them rather than thinking about the wide reaching effects of my choices. I can't wait to see the rest of the series. However I will say that this game may be priced a little high condsidering other games of similar length. If the other episodes are of similar length to the first then I would expect to finish in a few hours at most. But I feel the quality of the story is more than good enough to warrant the price.  tl;dr A beautiful game for people who like story, art, and clever use of a single mechanic.",

Still, this game tells the tale of a youngster, dealing with growing up, ostracism, loneliness, facing dreams about what life could be and the terrible fear of the ever dream-crushing reality. We've been there. Some of us are still dealing with it. Some will never leave this painfull stage of life. But Maxine can rewind time and, by doing so, she can change the course of her own history and that of those around her. Learning to say the right thing in the right time, and gaining infinite opportunities to try and try again and to go on, not only knowing that she did the best she could, but knowing at least the immediate the results of the choice she chose not to make. That bit of fantasy is what defines the strangeness in 'Life is Strange'. without it, the title would be, perhaps, just real every-day dull life.",

I just picked it up off the Steam sale for two dollars because, hey, might as well give it a shot, and the world the game thrusted me into was pretty damn interesting. The story is pretty catching. I like how they incorporated time powers. In a way, it’s pretty much a rewind button that you can use in case something doesn’t go as planned. But in another way, it’s a way to see how everything plays out before you make a choice. Time rewinding or not, you’re still stuck with one option, and I like how they made the choices have plenty of impacts, and the subtle, long-term, implications of your actions.  If I were to criticize it, I’d say that the protagonist (and a large degree of the cast for that matter) is rather… bland. They have their own dimensions and story, but none of them really stand out. Just the usual high-school tropes (Introverted loner, ♥♥♥♥♥y rich girl, punk rebel, jackass jock… Etc). Stuff you haven’t seen before. Which isn’t a  bad  thing, just that it makes it harder to really - you know - care about the characters. Other times, I’d have to say that the writing/dialogue is wooden, forced, and contrived sometimes (Especially when they use the slangs. Please God no.). And the controls are… pretty awkward (Very hard to get used to). Well, I only played the first episode, so things might be different in the other episodes. Dunno.  I’d still recommend Life is Strange if you want a storybased game. I’m pretty engaged in the story, and I want to see more.  … I just have to wait two weeks before I get money again.",

It gives me a very strong vibe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Veronica Mars (if more serious/less comical). Part of this comes through the story and part through the very strong characterizations, but also visually and especially the soundtrack all work together. The setting of a high school was well done, though there were a few oddities, like a high school having dorms.  There are also lots of choices to make, some of which you will realize when they're presented to you, and some only after you've made the choice - a notification will tell you that the decision you made will have consequences. It isn't entirely clear what those consequences will be, but from what I can tell, some are minor but not all are, though you might not see the consequence for a while.  Pros: -Solid story -Great characterizations -Visual quality -Audio quality -Lots of options -For the most part, puzzles seamlessly fit in with the story and don't seem like puzzles.  Cons: -Theres only one save that autosaves. Mostly this is an annoyance for completionists (since you cant just save at every decision, you would largely have to replay the entire episode to make a different decision, apart from the last decision made. -The lip sync doesn't match (IIUC, it's because the game was done in French first?). I honestly didn't notice this until after playing the first episode and having it pointed out to me there was a lipsync problem. -puzzles are mostly fairly easy (if you're looking for a puzzle game).",

Most of the time the solution is just a few feet or a few clicks away, nothing bend-your-head-around. Might be less of a challenge for adventure veterans, but again, it fits the game. - The characters are well done, complete with usual high-school drama and finding yourself.

However, if, like myself, you're not a huge fan of American teen drama sometimes the language used can be a little grating. Maybe I'm too old now, being 30, but hearing someone say 'serial' instead of 'serious' just sounds incredibly stupid. The game play is pretty simple with only very basic commands to walk, run, talk or rewind time. Of course that was to be expected with this being such a narrative-focused game but some might find it too slow. For me, being a fan of games like Myst, it was no issue whatsoever.  Two and a half hours of game play for only $5 is pretty good value, and I know I missed some stuff.

Well I didn't expect to be thrown into an emotional roller-coaster thrill ride.. All of the characters.. every one of them.. their backstories, their 'character-build' were just so very well done, especially Max's character! Nothing amazes me more than the beautiful art-style that this game is presented in, the characters have such emotion on them.. you can see their disappointment, you can see their pain and suffering, YOU CAN SEE THEIR REACTIONS TO EVERYTHING EVERYONE DOES.. My god.. and this is on the Unreal Engine for goodness sake! And man, don't get me all over about the outstanding soundtrack for this game.. god it was so well-composed, and fits every single emotional scene in this game!! Will I recommend this game? Yes I will!!! This game is just amazing guys.. just do me a huge favor and just buy it and play it.. 10/10",

I've seen this described as Gone Home meets The Walking Dead but I feel like that doesn't do this game justice (and I really liked both of those games). Life is Strange follows the story of Max Caufield, an 18 year old woman who is exeperiencing a lot of upheaval in her life and gains the ability to (limitedly) rewind time. While the rewind time mechanic has been used in a number of games for combat benefit, I never considered it being employed to explore alternate dialogue and decision branches within the context of the story. It's pretty brilliant. I was initially concerned that the characters were going to be one dimensional, but even by the end of the second episode, development can be spotted, even in some of the side characters. I cannot recommend this game enough. If you are remotely on the fence, just buy the first episode for the 5 bucks, try it and then buy the rest of the episodes as soon as you finish it. I've purchased the first episode for several of my friends, knowing they will fall in love with it as well.",

            "review_text": "[Played LiS thoroughly off-Steam: please don't mind listed playtime.]  Feigning the mundane maturing of a young adult discovering the value in second opportunity for the choices in everyday dialogue and relationships, Life is Strange suddenly graduates to responsibility and flourishes to capture its own identity, leaving its perfectly-imperfect imprint upon this growing interactive cinema genre. It transforms into a journey about people: their flaws, fears, regrets, and insecurities--and shows you how they can mesh together as a special masterpiece about how life can be strange.  DONTNOD's pioneer foray accomplishes its storytelling with powerful nostalgia in a direction that feels organically improvised--chaotic akin to life--with excellent sound and music assets, genuine and interesting atmosphere, uniquely immersive aesthetics style, distinct voice acting, and decision consequences that mean and matter more than most comparable games. These individual elements fall to form a deep empathetic experience that can leave you emotionally exhausted, and amazed how it managed to accomplish that.   I'm an ethusiast gamer with a high mental guard, and since childhood FPS and RTS have reigned over as my favourite genres. After these three years of The Walking Dead coming into spotlight and recently experiencing Life is Strange however, interactive cinema has become a truly unique treasure that I am humbly grateful for as a format that pushes and pulls deep intrinsic feelings far more effectively than any other. It was weeks since finishing could I finally move on from the emotional void caused by this game, but steadfast in appreciation that I had the chance to experience the culmination of the aggregate talent, trust in eventual success, and tremendous time investment to accomplish what so few even attempt to do within this industry, let alone succeed with.  This isn't a perfect game; there are significant early episode lip sync issues, some relatively low resolution textures, possible subjective disbelief in the cast of diverse characters, a few design gaffs such as a bottle collection sequence, and what might be a disappointing denoument leading to an imaginative conclusion, but it's still worth every minute of your time. Life is Strange has made me even more hopeful about this genre's future, and it's undoubtedly my best experience of 2015 by a wide margin.  Spending time on this review is my closure to Max and her story, and it's fair time to let go;   so,    Thank you for this experience, DONTNOD. ",

            "review_text": "One thing that I should point out before you all consider this review - these types of games are a niche in terms of the audience that will find this game worth buying. The story in Life is Strange is something that you take in over time, with the majority of the gameplay essentially being walking, jogging and time manipulation. There is no real combat or 'enemies', so to speak. Rather, it explores the various relationships and teenage troubles evident throughout the game -revolving around its (relatively elaborate) story.   BASIC GAME STORY PREMISE  A teenage girl, Maxine 'Max' Caulfield, has recently moved towns so that she may take up photography classes at Blackwell Academy. During class, she has a vision where a future tornado threatens town. She wakes up puzzled as to what just happened, unsure of what to do. Believing that she's just had a weird day, Max travels to the Girl's bathroom to calm herself down. A butterfly enters the bathroom, intriguing Max, and she follows it around the corner where she takes a photo of it. After, a boy walks in closely followed in by another girl. They argue and the girl is shot. As the girl falls, Max shouts out with her hand raised - only for time to reverse as she ends up back in her photography class. With a sudden realization of what happened, she is determined to save the girl in the bathroom - a fatal decision which essentially messes with the time-space continuum for better or for worse.  ABOUT LIFE IS STRANGE  Life is Strange is an episodic series, spanning 5 different episodes, exploring the mystery of Max's own time manipulative abilities as she tries to find out what happened to a girl that seemingly disappeared from school - Rachel Amber. Max's life essentially revolves around her daily life in Arcadia Bay and her mission throughout Blackwell Academy to find out what happened to Rachel Amber. Throughout the game, you explore the entirety of Blackwell Academy, in addition to memorable places in Arcadia Bay including food bars, beaches, farms and forest junkyards.   The different episodes all explore particular events in the game (hopefully limited spoilers):  Episode 1 - The mystery behind Max's time manipulation abilities and her own basic relationships with other students at Blackwell Academy Episode 2 - Max explores some troubles relating to a student, Kate Marsh, who is assumed to have been drugged at a party. Episode 3 - Max and her best friend break into Blackwell Academy's offices at night to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Amber Episode 4 - Max explores an alternate reality she had caused by time manipulation, relating to the past events of her own best friend. She flips back and forth between different realities, hopeful that she can avoid the impending destruction of her town. Episode 5 - Max enters a nightmare after being captured, flipping between alternate realities, as the fate of the town and her friends lie in her hands.  VALUE  Life is Strange costs US$5.00 for Episode 1, with the 'Season Pass' (the remaining episodes) being $15.00. The entirety of Life is Strange costs $20.00. All episodes have been released - Episode 5 having released around a month prior to the time I wrote this review. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in time manipulation revolving around teenage girls and their lives in school.",

            "review_text": "This will be a long review and this will feature SPOILERS from both episodes, so be warned.  When I first saw Life is Strange's reveal trailer, I wasn't impressed. I thought of it at first as a Telltale ripoff, just Square Enix trying to cash in on episodic games. When all the reviews came out, I decided 'what the heck, it's only $5'. I played it through and my opinion of it was turned completely upside down. This game is awesome on so many levels.  In this game, you play as Max Caulfield, an ordinary photography geek who is somehow given time travel powers. First off, the concept of the game is awesome, especially with a female lead. The soundtrack is amazing and it fits perfectly with the indie style of the game. The graphics aren't the best, but to me that's not really the focus. The focus is on the characters throughout the game and how they make you feel that you care about them and what happens to them, especially Kate Marsh, a student who is focused on in the first two episodes. The choices you make in the first and second episode will affect how she views you and this will have a significant impact on the game, or at least this episode. This game is extremely heavy and you may get emotional and feel differently about certain things after finishing it. Just a warning.   There are cons to the game, but I can easily get over them. Some may not, so this game may not be for you. First off, the lip syncing is pretty much non-existent. There are some points it matches up, but most of the time, it doesn't. This bothered me at first, but now I don't notice it. Second is the dialouge. A lot of people have trouble with the dialouge, saying that A) It doesn't fit what actual teenagers would say, or B) The dialouge doesn't fit the character. There are some points in the game where you cringe, more in the first than the second for me, personally, when you hear some characters talk. However, that really doesn't affect me much because I want to see this adventure, Max's and mine, continue. It's not perfect, but for me, this is probably the best game released in 2015 that I've gotten this year. If you liked Telltale's games, there's a good chance you'll love this; if you're skeptical, just buy the first episode for five bucks; you more than likely won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "N.B: This review was written after completing Episode 4 of 5.  Headline summary: If you like story, characters and mystery, buy this game.  Full Review: This game is definitely worth a look if you value stories with a feeling of mystery and nostalgia. The art style is compelling, if a little lacking in detail (which sometimes makes it hard to tell the age of characters etc.). The controls are a little frustrating, particularly when trying to get the optimal angle for those optional photos.  The choice system presents some genuine dilemmas. There are situations when the stress of not having enough information, coupled with the compelling nature of the characters, gives you a feeling of unrest and immediacy that drives the experience forward. This feeling of unease is cleverly enhanced by the rewind mechanic, which makes you just powerful enough to see the immediate consequences your choices have, whilst not providing you with enough insight to be sure that your final decision was bullet-proof. This is a unique experience in adventure games and to be seriously applauded.  However, other situations have a clear morally optimal option, which - particularly when combined with the rewind mechanic - can make them feel like a choice between the 'right' option and everything else. This is not a serious issue, as most 'optimal' solutions are harder to get, which can make reaching them seem like something of an achievement. Nonetheless, I expect that it will limit replay value for anyone who does not enjoy the feeling of deliberately making the 'wrong' choice just to see what happens.  The rewind mechanic itself is a very nice touch and extremely well implemented. It enables the game designers to create some interesting and counter-intuitive puzzles, which whilst not particularly complex, add gameplay depth to a predominantly narrative driven experience.  Nonetheless, by far and away the best part of this game is its cast of characters, who even the hardest of hearts will grow to care about. Max is a compelling lead who manages to combine strength of character with self-doubt and teenage awkwardness in a thoroughly believable manner. Without going into too much further detail - no spoilers I promise - the other characters do not fail to disappoint either. Some tend to be a little cliche at times but those with the most screen time have depth and realism.  The voice acting is solid, if not mind-blowing, with some lines being delivered a little flat and mechanically. Nonetheless, the writing is all there and really drives the game along. It is worth spending time just walking around and chatting to people to pick up those little extra hints and easter eggs, which are reminicent of those that made old school adventure games so much fun.",

The point that made this game unforgettable and unique: You can reverse time, every choice you make in the game can be reversed, and this is why the game, in my opinion, considered hard to make choices, because you can regret every single word you said. The main story is one of the best i've ever seen, charged with drama, tension and can provoke a variety of feelings on you. The game soundtrack is beautiful, great songs, mostly indie. Personally I love that kind of soundtrack. Life is Strange is divided in episodes as The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones by Telltale games. There are 5 episodes to be precise. Episode 5: Polarized will be released on October 20th. I say it's one of the best games i've ever played and totally worths it.
