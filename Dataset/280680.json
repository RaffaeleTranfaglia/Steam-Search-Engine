            "review_text": "Very early review in the use of this, but as a Tablet owner (Bamboo), and someone who use's artrage +Blackink, I'd just like to give my 1st impression.    This seems plagued by the same unresponsive nature as the free (Krita (x64)), which kicks in mid stroke on some brush's making it very disruptive at times to use. updating the pen position is vital at all times and priority needs to go to that.    Other than that it looks pretty nice, not as intuitive as I'd hope for, but sure given enough time that wouldn't be an issue.",

            "review_text": "Having used both the free version and recently having bought the steam version, I have to save that the free version has quite a few things that gemini lacks, and it's kind of frustrating to switch to gemini when it just feels inferior. but I love Krita and want to support them, so I guess I'll shoulder the burden. I would definitely say to download the free version and find another way to support them though.",
