Survival game that have no chance of survival unless utilizing the cheat item provided.  Does not understand why would a survival game be only 3x3 square grid, gives you a 'reroll of map' and repeat asking input of name.  Whats the point of watching a long snake wriggling around the map, referring to the line of team members.  Werecar, unique but silly.   Other than to clear the achievements and trading cards, at present, this game is pointless.",

            "review_text": "The idea behind the game is pretty good, and has a lot of potential, it just need a fine tuning on the fight system and hunger, the problem is that the world is very small, you can see everything in half an hour, maybe even less, it feels more like a demo than a finished game, this is why no matter how cheap it is, it's not worth it",
