            "review_text": "PLOT: There's a war or something.  Gigantic Army is a love-letter to NCS Masaya and their Assault Suits series. This might be before your time, but have you ever heard of Cybernator? Target Earth? Gigantic Army is designed much the same way. This is a mech shooter, but not that flashy Gundam Wing crap. The kind where all the mechs fly around looking beautiful, while J-POP plays in the background. This is more along the lines of The 08th MS Team. The best words to describe it are a mixture of CRUNCHY and CLUNKY. Let's call it CRULUNCHAKY.   Usually an action game being called CRULUNCHAKY is a bad thing, not so with Gigantic Army. All the mechs in this game have weight. Within seconds of starting the game you really gain an understanding of how the MECHanics work. Every movement in this game is calculated, and playing effectively is knowing when to 'lead' enemy fire away. Raw reflexes are fine, but your mech is a bit too slow, heavy, and bulky to make those tight dodges. For the most part, enemies aim their guns at you when they fire, and larger mechs have a plethora of weapons they cycle through. Truly understanding this game requires predicting every possible attack, and then moving into position to do the full amount of damage. The nice thing about all that I just said, is that it's alot easier to figure out in-game. Gigantic Army has a natural level of difficulty. If you play smart and don't rush things, you'll get far.   Upon starting the game you get to choose your primary and limited secondary weapons. What you choose decides your style of play. Do you want good crowd control, don't mind long mini-boss fights, but want to finish end-bosses quickly? Go with the spread shot and laser cannon. For anything that gets too close you've got a pile-bunker. Expect the jump, hover, and dash abilities to see a lot of use as well. When all else fails, bring up the shield to block enemy bullets. An important thing to keep in mind, is that you can't block while jumping. Think of it as a commitment, choose one that suits the current situation.  Unlike Target Earth aka Assault Suits Leynos, the missions in Gigantic Army don't have any real objectives. There's no escorting, protecting, or any of that nonsense. Reach the end of the stage, and destroy everything in your path. There's a time-limit to keep you focused, power-ups along the way, and occasionally there are mines. The bosses are well-designed. Some move around a lot, others rely on their superior firepower, and there are even a couple unique fights. This game moves and ends very quickly. If all you want to see is the ending, this game will last about as long as the average 16-bit action game.   But that would be too easy wouldn't it? Upon completing the normal difficulty you'll unlock hard, and eventually insane. Enemies pack more firepower, you'll run into some new mechs, and the action gets hotter and heavier. Also you're expected to bring your SSS game if you want to get those high-score achievements. Move fast, don't take any damage(NONE), and kill everything. Sure it might be what you've been doing since you started the game, but you've got to do even better.   Gigantic Army is a very solid game. I highly recommend it to fans of the aforementioned mech-shooters, but really anyone can enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "GIGANTIC ARMY is a side scrolling shooter that is very good for what it does, but due to some of the mechanics I am not recommending this. First off there is no way to quit this game without dying. It’s a bit frustrating when you have to spend a minute getting yourself killed so you can quit.  Next is the fact that you are timed. Now I know its ok with some other games, like metal slug 3 (a great game by the way) but in this your mech is very slow and having a time limit doesn’t really mix. Also they have a time booster that adds 1 second. I really don't see the point of this as you probably used 3 seconds collecting it.  Next are the controls (note I’m reviewing these based on using a 360 pad/controller) which are bindable but not to every button. For example I wanted to set the shoot function to the left trigger but it just did not work. It also does a pretty bad job at telling you what stuff does, like how instead of saying shoot, jump etc. it just says button 1, button 2 and so on.  Another thing that's done a bit poorly is, that there is no saving your game. Or if there ever was a way, the game doesn’t tell you about it. And if you can't save, you’re going to have to beat the whole game in one go.  Also, judging by the steam page the game is not that long at all, as I beat 2 levels out of 6 in 6 or 8 minutes. I know this because of the timer counting down.  So in the end, even though I enjoyed it, I am not recommending it , as steam has waay cheaper games that are more fun, longer and better in my opinion(since it’s an opinion, feel free to make up your own mind, if you buy the game). And even though I got over the game’s faults, I think a lot of people will just get way too frustrated to make it worthwhile. And that's the review. ",

            "review_text": "As a huge fan of all the games like this from the SNES era, I was really excited when I saw this come out. Unfortunatly it doesn't really live up to some of my favorites like Metal Warriors, and Cybernator since the controls seem a bit clunky. The 'robo-skates' is only a quick dash move instead of a smooth glide, you can't change your angle of fire unless you stop shooting (which makes it nearly useless against moving targets), and some of the weapons (both regular, and special) are pretty worthless.  All that having been said, I do like the graphics, chip-tune soundtrack, and how smooth most of the animations are. The melee attack is interesting in that it auto-activates when something is near enough to be hit, and the gauges showing health, shield health, and your jumpjet fuel are all well placed. I think I will try waiting a bit to see if they smooth this out a bit more in the near future and go from there.",

            "review_text": "I have Satazius, so when I saw that Astro Port and Nyu Media were releasing another game, and claiming that it took up the mantle of old-school games like Cybernator, Metal Warriors, and Front Mission: Gun Hazard, I was very excited. I played a lot of Cybernator and Metal Warriors back in the day on my SNES, and those two rank up there as some of my most favorite games. I played Gun Hazard when I discovered emulation in the late 90s (I had previously played through Front Mission 3 for the PS1). I tried Assault Suits Leynos (Target Earth in the US) on a Genesis emulator once, but couldn't really get into it.  Simply put, this game delivers, especially for the price point. I don't think I'd pay ten bucks for it unless it had more content, but at six, it's just right. And a Steam sale would make it even more attractive. You get exactly what it says on the box - old-school mecha blasting action that scratches that 16-bit itch. It just doesn't do anything to innovate or move the genre forward in any meaningful way. But that's OK because hey, bargain bin entertainment.  The action is non-stop. This is partly due to a timer, which forces the player to move forward or risk losing the mission. But there are also 'reinforcements.' Enemies might respawn forever, but it's not worth finding out as time continually is running out.  Players choose one of three primary weapons, and one of three special weapons. The primary weapons feature five upgradable power levels and unlimited ammo. The secondary weapons are ammo limited based on the primary weapon. So for instance, if one chooses the assault rifle primary and the beam cannon secondary, there will be three shots of the beam cannon. If one picks the grenade launcher primary, the beam cannon will only have one shot. I found this balances the weapons rather nicely, and was pleasantly surprised it was balanced so well, given that there only appear to be two people invovled in making the game, with maybe two additional play testers. There is no one 'best' option, as all choices seem to be suited to particular styles of play. I've found, for instance, that the shotgun and missile pack are the easiest for me to use. The downside is the player is stuck with one loadout for the entire game. It would've been nice to switch it up between missions.  The graphics look nice and fit with the 16-bit aesthetic the team was going for. I think in this day and age the explosions could look a little less like they were cut-and-pasted from an explosion generator app, but they get the job done. The backgrounds are especially well done, with the first few levels even having some cool battles happening in them. Some of the enemies do look a little rough, though, as if the artist was rushed and didn't have as much time to polish them as much as others. As a result there are times where the graphics do not look coherent, and it can be rather unsettling. I noticed this in Satazius, too. I also am not a fan of animating the sprites using rotation, rather than an actual animation sheet. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just looks strange to me, almost like really bad CGI in low-budget SyFy Channel movies. I understand why the developers do it this way, I just wish they had the resources to build traditional animations. The game would look so much better.  The sound effects are a mixed bag as well. Most of them are well done and fit with the aesthetic, however there are some sound effects that seem really out of place and tend to break the coherence of the aesthetic. The music, on the other hand, is great. It's energetic without being overwhelming. It blends in well with most of the sound effects and never seems to swell out of control or get annoying. It's a little more advanced than the standard MIDI-type music of the SNES, but I'll let that slide as it does such a great job of setting the mood in each stage.  Controls are very reminiscent of Cybernator. They are fairly easy to learn, but like that game it takes some time to master them. The character responds well to input and even though there is some clunkiness built in to help simulate moving a large hunk of metal, it is still easy to get around the enviroment, dodge bullets, and maneuver around enemies. The only real complaint I have is the double-tap to dash mechanic. This seems like a terrible move on the part of Astro Port, considering Cybernator and Metal Warriors both used one of the face buttons to activate the dash. Given that there are only six actions (fire, jump, shield, switch weapons, pause, and screenshot), and modern controllers have plenty of buttons, they certainly could've put the dash on a button. I don't like it when basic controls involve some kind of skill. The double tap is kind of finicky and difficult to time correctly, and almost impossible with the analog stick. If they do a sequel, I hope they fix that.  The length of the game is just right. Once you get good at it, it takes a little over a half hour to 1CC the game. I know we live in the age where everything is supposed to take 40-60 hours to complete, but as a dad with two kids, I just don't have that kind of time anymore. Sometimes I just want to sit down and blow stuff up for a few minutes after dinner. The old 16-bit games were all like that anyway. Plus for six bucks, you shouldn't be expecting Final Fantasy-length engagements anyway.  Like Satazius, there are four difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane), with Hard and Insane being unlocked upon completion of Normal and Hard, respectively. The difficulty ramps up nicely, with enemies firing more aggressively and environmental hazards increasing. I never felt like it was unfair or overly difficult. Careful and skillful gaming will get one through, as well as choosing the weapon loadout that works best for your playstyle.  Overall I really like this game. I like Satazius, too, and I hope Astro Port continues to make these great homages to the classic 16-bit era. I would even be willing to pay more, say $10-$15, if they would incorporate some modern touches like unlockable extras, more weapon choices, longer stages, maybe a progression system, and alternate endings. I mean even the old school games tended to change the ending based on difficulty. If you're fan of the old school, especially the 16-bit era games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Has some good points, evokes the classic SNES gameplay. The game style itself lends itself strongly to a homage of Cybernator.   And this is where the good points end, the gameplay is too reminisent of Cybernator, which I would not count against it if the controls were good, they are not.  The dash mechanic in the game is very short and does not have a dedicated button to engage on it's own. This is a minor point compared to a more glaring one is that your forward momentium is NOT preserved when jumping in the middle of a dash.  you can aim your main weapon to pretty much any angle you need, but it's tied to your movement and is held ONLY when firing, not a great setup when trying to setup a shot.  while another minor point, I feel it's still worth mentioning that if you get too close to an enemy, the game defaults to a melee attack against said enemy, which is fine until you're trying to prioritize something further away. Given the style of play feels like it'd be better just not being there.  Jumpjets in a game are always welcome to see. Again though, makes no sense if I can't dash and feather them for an extended glide at a good speed!  As someone who enjoyed the original Cybernator game back in the days of the SNES, I cannot recommend it to others as it just feels like the game was gutted of some of the more critical controls that made that game so fun to play. If you came here with it's description stating that it evokes the older games like Cybernator and Metal Warriors, you are better off not getting this game. It's definitely cheap and not a big loss if you don't enjoy it. ",

Has more in common with nintendo's contra then it has with Cybernator or Gun Hazard. -This will not pique your nostalgia.  On the plus side: It does have really neat graphics, and goes in directions those other games could not. For that the work is to be commended, unfortunately, the designers seemed to have lacked the vision the programmers of those old 16 bit games had. If youre looking for a nostalgic tour-du-force with all the elements that made the 16 bit era great, you won't find it here.

            "review_text": "First Impression:  It's difficult not to compare this to Metal Warriors for SNES, but that was the experience that I was looking for when buying this game. I feel it was a step back mechanically from SNES. Mainly the button mapping. It's great that you want a retro feel and you allow button mapping, but we've had 6 button controllers since the 90's.....you don't need to bind melee with shoot. I would also like to have a seperate hold button for my fire arc rather than holding down my shoot button to do that, forcing me to time my jumps and movements with my gun's rate of fire. This makes me feel like I have less control of my mech.  Movement of this game is very slow. You are walking everywhere. Yes, Mechs are slow, but every game usually adds something to help out. I am not always boosting up, can't I boost forward in the air (like the SNES)? Or something like the 'skates' from Heavy gear? I have 8 more buttons on the 360 pad. That won't happen, though, because the levels are very small and faster movement would reveal that.  These problems could actually be ignored if the story were less boring. But it's a Japanese game, and that's clear with the timer.....It's all about the score.  Overall, it's good. $6 is a fair price. It was worth skipping a Starbucks coffee.  + It hits the retro feel without being cheesy about it. + Good character design. + decent weapon variety (6) + Score based for an arcade feel.  - Sloooooow movement (not sluggish) - Music is alright, but nothing that I will be whistling on my way to work. - 6 actions tied to 4 buttons.  - One mech, no customizing - Single Player  If you are looking at this game and haven't played Metal Warriors, I also suggest finding a copy of that.",
