The content (enemies, quests, skills) are unoriginal. Could not refund the game because I fell asleep playing it in the middle of the day.   I will say however, If somehow this game were vamped up and polished it could be a fun unique mmorpg of some type. Not worth what I spent is my general consensus/feeling.",
