            "review_text": "This is a modern remake of an old title called Buzz Aldrin's Race into Space. You play as the director of the space program of either the US or the Soviet Union during the Space Race from the mid-50s to the end of the 60s. The goal: land an astronaut/cosmonaut on the Moon before the other side.  The original game was known for being very difficult, and the remake continues that tradition. You must research rockets and payloads for unmanned and manned missions and put them into space, all the while keeping tabs on the opposition. Sometimes you'll have to take chances that might end up killing your astronauts and setting back your programs. The game is about taking those risks, and keeping your eyes on the goal.  Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager is a good, but frustrating game. Buy it if you like bashing your head against a wall, and if you relish the feeling of achievement once you bash THROUGH that wall.",

            "review_text": "Pros : + Space game. There is a serious lack of space games today. + Good management aspects. This game is not about building the perfect rocket, but how the agency manages between launching less-important mission to get some funding and launching important mission for the moon landing. Also a juggle between the risk of launching a risky mission now to get some big funding for the next 4 years. Most of the game dillema revolves around this thing. If I launches this mission now, I may get huge funding for 4 years, but the reliability is still low, and I can lose my craft and my money, etc. + Different animation between NASA and the Soviet space program. + Lots of space program available : Mars probe, Sun probe, Saturn probe, Space plane, etc. + Lots of ways to achieve the final objectives (the Moon). You can use 2 man craft, or 3 man craft, using lunar rendezvous or direct ascent, a lot of choices. + The mechanics of research that gives penalty if we attempt something 'too foolish', or try to research for 'too advanced' systems.  Cons : - Mission is too limited, only limited to Moon landing. How about space stations? Mission to Mars? This is a serious problem. - UI at times is clunky, especially when managing your researchers. - No animation on destroyed/failed mission - You can't take any decision when mission is already a go. Success and failure is only a dice roll away. - 'Rocket' research is useless, only useful in opening stage of the game. - Failure in the opening of the game to secure big funding may make you fail for the rest of the game. - The competition between space agencies is not developed enough. We only know that the Soviets/NASA has done this and that, without knowing what technology they have used. For example NASA has completed an Earth orbit flight. As a Soviet player, I think it's important to know whether the NASA uses Gemini program, Mercury program, or Apollo program. Maybe I should also know the type of booster rocket used. That's what intelligence is for.  For gamers that don't have specific liking to space and aeronautics, you better stay away because most of the 'management' in this game is limited to human resources management only, and there are lack of anything else. For gamers that love space and aeronautics, this game have a lot to offer, and a must buy. ",

            "review_text": "UPDATE: looks like the main issue (black screens) has something to do with screen resolution (as mentioned on the forum by the developer); using another screen resolution fixes the problem.   As it is a fun game, I changed my review to recommend it (original review below). However, there's still a lot of room for improvement!  To list a few: - Either use photos for personnel or not. Not for just 1 in every 50 - Some extra audio (e.g. moon landing, or succesful return) would be nice - In-mission interactivity is missing: when a problem occurs you could e.g. add a 'abort mission (x% success estimate)' button - Every button, every label should have a mouse-over explaining it; what is the role of each ground crew member? Which sorting buttons is which? - Some screens that could use a filter don't have it - After completing the campaign, you should be able to switch over to sandbox mode - The back button (on the left) doesn't go back to the previous screen: confusing - You should be able to see more info about missions before paying to unlock it, e.g. which rocket is required - Opening a mission should bring you to the next unachieved flight, not to the first - Each mission page should clearly show whether it was successfully achieved or not (this is correctly done in the overview list)  - As mentioned below: there's content missing in the mission description screens (and elsewhere) - During the mission, you should be able to (fast)forward, skipping 1 or multiple steps - After a mission you didn't follow from the MC, you should be able to replay it from the MC; heck, you should be able to replay any mission (and with replay I mean review; I'm not expecting a different outcome ;)  --------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Far too many bugs in this game to recommend it at this time.  Most important one: unable to launch missions (the whole point of the game), resulting in black screens* There's content missing (just empty windows where mission info should be). Clicking on a button brings you to the window of the button next to it.  * I've played the game for 7 hours yesterday and it basically worked well, but today I haven't been able to get past the first mission.. Very frustrating.",

            "review_text": "I can't bore this game. Or actually I can, of course, because the road to the Moon is not too long (or not enough long), but I just pick this game again and again (over a few month) and replay it. The gameplay, the game mechanism is outstading. The player can feel and enjoy the golden age of space science through a very exciting game. But the whole game is focuse to the 'Moon race', so you just try to jump the steps to reach the Moon first. So you don't care the side missions (eg the early Mars missions). And after the Moon-landing, the magic is vanish. It would be great if we could continue: building orbital space stations (like MIR) and the current Mars missions... etc.  So this game is a small gem. Brilliant, but very short. Fanatics like me can replay it after months, but regular players probably left it after achiving victory by NASA or USSR or both.",

            "review_text": "A nice remake of the old BARIS. People who are on the fence about this purchase can download and play the old one for free as it is now open source. I loved it and think that a lack of 'museum' data and Arlington are big misses here. I don't like that the game can't tell that I would lose a spaceman over a fail to land an X-15 correctly, but it is what it is. Worth the price, but too bad it is so held back for mobile integration. I'd rather have paid $12 (which is the price in it's native realm).  The artwork is lovely and if you like this sort of game it's worth this time to check out. I hope they make it so you can transfer your crews from this one to the planned ISS/Mars missions later, or release them as an add on for this one so that ppl have to get it still to explore the new areas ;)  8/10",

            "review_text": "Since there are already a couple of reviews out for this, I will focus my review on the following three things:  - How it compares with the original Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space (BARIS) - Interface and gameplay - Price  1) Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager vs original BARIS   I loved the original BARIS, but for me it was flawed in two fundamental ways: Firstly, it was very difficult to compete with your rival nation (be it Russia or USA depending on who you were playing with). Secondly, if you hired astronauts without sending them into space, the left the program after a few years, which made the game even harder. In the present Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager both of these issues have been resolved, in addition to a number of other small issues. If you liked the original BARIS you will probably like this game too.  2) Interface and Gameplay  I've seen several reviews complaining about the interface of this game, and I do agree that it could be better. That said, once you get into the game and start getting use to the interface it works pretty well. It is still a management game and I don't think it is intented to be too easy. I do tend to juggle multiple programs at the same time, and you do have to think about who should be doing what in terms of training and assignments between the different groups (engineers, flight controllers, and astronauts), but it is a nice challenge if you are into management games.  Regarding the gameplay: The radio chatter, sound effects, and animations do a great job of immersing you in the missions and there is a nice feeling of tension and exitement as you try reaching new goals in increasingly ambitious missions. It is a little bit annoying that you lose the same amount of prestige for a given mission irrespective of what the failure was, and it would be nice if the developers included different levels of success for each mission.  With all that it mind, it should be said that if you are new to management games and have little knowledge about the historical space race, this game will have a steep learning curve for you.  3) Price  In my opinion 30 US$ is a bit steep, if only because you can buy Kerbal Space Program (KSP) for the same price right now. The games do offer different experiences, but in terms of space simulators KSP is more fun and you will probably get more hours out of it. Buy it at full price if you really like this kind of game, but otherwise rather wait and get it on sale.  ",

            "review_text": "Enjoyed this game and system management which is based more or less on an epic period of competitive scientific history. You need to be careful with your funds at the outset or like me you will get 'sacked' and the game is over, but that usually only happens if you haven't achieved any successful projects early enough. The amount of projects are obviously linear as you progress with your research and developement provided by your scientists and technicians.  Tips: There are photographs of various people you employ which look good but make sure you watch their ages as the photos are just that and not identities themselves. An older looking scientist can be 27 years old.  The actual animated space events are well made but overly repetitive as well as their audio after a while so this was a budget job by devs obviously and could have been better and more immersive by using more historical tracking and design, so that for me anyway was a bit of a downer after a few hours play and discouraging for replay as this is the only part of the game which has 'movement'!  The emergency 'fix it' teams preventing failures have a huge budget attached which I simply cannot understand at all but it has a challenge feature to the player which enables a choice anyway, 'do I fix it or just wing it' !  All in all it was enjoyable historical brain food but only worthy of a discounted price around the $10-$15 mark for me in single player mode.   6.3/10     ",

            "review_text": "In my years with Steam. This would be my first review. Plus I had a few beers _ so that matters...  Im impressed with the developers response implementing the tooltips in a timely manner. These were much needed to tie in the UI on this menu heavy game. I have to say......I haven't seen such professional and diligent response in a long time. It is obvious that there is a very dedicated person involved. This type of change wouldnt have happened if a team needed to have a say in every bit of the changes. I also love that this is truly a strategy game where small decisions have a great impact.  The feel of the race is there.....only wish there was more nostalgiac (era speciifc) UI or graphics. However, I have felt the sense of the reds gaining ground on me on every turn, which is almost enough. It was a great decision to go beyond a 'joint space program' and replicate the space race.  Fine job...and bet on me going in on all additional modules that these cats create.   Also_ although it doesnt bother that much, The only profile picture I've seen (besides Werner V. Braun) is some kind of modern angry Greek or Gypsy accountant. I'm sure that will change.  Love the game. Classic for me.  ",

Especially when I can have my own alt-universe Space Program where we land on the moon with a Gemini capsule.  The underpinnings of the game are very good. I like the way the programs and the goals work together - as you reach milestones, certain things get easier. Your scientists have a variety of skills, and you can either work with the folks who are bright and raw, or perhaps make use of a science team that won't accept training readily but can give you good returns now. Funding based on the prestige of your program is also quite nice. The weakest part is the opposition AI, which is not very strong. I very much felt like I was playing against a set of escalating milestones instead of an actual opponent of any sort (though admittedly, there's little visibility in to what the opposing AI is doing on its turn).  The biggest problem though, is that this game's interface is terrible. I found myself never wanting to have more programs open than I absolutely had to. Juggling my scientists and what they were working on was extremely frustrating, and keeping track of what programs still had goals left to achieve was not easy. At the end of the day, I finished the NASA campaign and it was so clunky I had no desire left to try the Soviet one. The assists they provided were OK - you could filter and resort your list of scientists, but there was no good way to side-by-side compare your list of all your scientists with all the possible research they could be doing. It was a lot of manual slot-by-slot optimization of my science team, which was really tedious.  Bottom line, the interface is not up to snuff for a management game which is a damn shame. The game was fun: I felt like I was making progress with every milestone I reached, and the game forces you to make decisions when you're close to your prestige review: do you launch a risky mission and maybe get more funding, or hold off because you don't want to risk a disasterous funding cut? It's a tough sell at $20, and a straight up no at full price.  ",
