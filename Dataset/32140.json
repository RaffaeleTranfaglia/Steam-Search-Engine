            "review_text": "This game is really just a series of hidden object sets strung together into a thin story. There is no real adventure/mystery game element or much of a break from the pure HO gameplay. Worst of all, I'd say, is that the resolution just isn't good enough to make the HO work very well in the first place.",

            "review_text": "This puzzle game is perfect for people starting out on hidden object and puzzle games of this genre. Cant get stuck since there is a raven you can click to help locate a missing item in the room. This game has ALOT of content three separate stories all combining into one big story. This hidden object game is the kind where every screen looks like a garage sale blew up. This is ok since it makes it a good starting game for new players and for veterans a relaxing well paced story to play through.  Bridgets bio on Edger Allen Poe: Edgar Allen Poe was rumored in his day as depicted in woodcuts of the era too terrorize the townsfolk of the places he lived throughout his writing career feasting upon the human hearts of those in the countrysides under the pale light of every full moon. It is reported that many who looked into Poe's eyes never lived to tell the tale of his unquenchable bloodlust to prey upon the innocent. His books explored his fascination with the murder of innocent people which many literary scholars believe were based on crimes committed by Poe while he was still alive. It has been said by some that upon his death police raided his posh living quarters where upon pulling up the flooorboards discovered Poe's secret stash of still beating human hearts with one of them having a bite out of it. Even to this day, around campfires at Halloween children still spin yarns of the nefarious Poe, who during every full moon stalks his victims in the shadows feasting upon their still beating hearts, only to once again vanish into darkness.
