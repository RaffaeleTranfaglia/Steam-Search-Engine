The game was incredibly short for the style of game it was; however, for what it was it was an amazing experience. It typically can be purchased for next to nothing during steam sales and for what you pay vs what you get, this game is amazing. Decent story line, fun old style turn based RPG, and let's not forget the humor spread all throughout the game. If you're a fan of the old style RPGs like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy this game will delight you for a few hours.",

After playing The Stick Of Truth and loving it so much, I wanted to get into turn-based RPGs. I saw the price of this game and decided to get it. I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.

Those looking for a nostalgia trip will certainly get their fix, while newer gamers will probably find it dull and uninteresting.  The game is fairly short and, except for a few side dungeons, very linear. I was surprised by the lack of a few features, like the ability to search every ever pot, crate, bookshelf for loot. The lack of mouse support was also odd; playing on a keyboard felt strange having played most games of this type on a console controller back in the day.  Combat was simplified with very few options and little gear to play with. The one thing I did appreciate was the random encounter...er, 'counter' that turns off random encounters in an area after a specified number of fights. (You can still force a fight via a menu option.) That would be a much appreciated feature in many RPGs I've played.  All in all, I enjoyed my time in 20XX and would definitely recommend it to fans of old-school JRPGs.",

Covers the bones of every JRPG Game, don't expext Breath of Fire, Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger level of complexity in mechanics.  The world looks like it was designed in Microsoft Paint, Its regional cubicle and doesn't have the detailed scenes and colourfull overworld like the games I mentioned above. If they we're going for a 8-bit feel, they used MIDI ingame music and it's the most generic RPG soundtrack that you know.   What I really miss about the JRPG games is The astonishing music, the incredibly detailed scenery and overworld, some depth in mechanics that is simple to learn but difficult to master, and most importantly the depth in character developement. So far no Indie JRPG game has learned from their masters in the past, and sadly these new feel like there was no effort to be made.  Aside me ranting, this is a cheap experience that maybe worth trying, but for a demanding person like me it feels like I'm wasting time.",

The developer really stripped out all the 'formulas' that classic RPG system had, and reduced them to the basics. Random battles are limited. Enemies get stronger the longer the battle lasts. Hoarding items is not possible.  The story is funny too. It's absolutely great writing!  After beating this, I recommend you check out their 'sequel', Cthulu Saves the World!",

The combo system was a nice change of pace, choosing level-up bonuses was fun, and while simple, the core gameplay worked.  Again, considering that I spent about $0.67 on this game, I was very impressed. I do understand that this was made for people like me, having grown up with the games this references and spoofs, but I still think newer gamers can find a good time with this game.  Yes. Buy this game. Be aware that it is oldschool in design, and as long as you know that, you'll be fine.  Oh, and pro tip: sit next to a white save circle and grind out battles until you clear dungeons worth of encounters. Boss fights will be a breeze.",

I can't speak much to the story, as it's very simple and silly, with no particularly amazing parts jumping out. Over all, it was the game mechanics that kept me invested til the end.  I really enjoyed how simple the character building was, with each level giving you two abilities (sometimes active, sometimes passive) to choose from, resulting in a few feasible builds for each character in your party. Another much appreciated feature was the Fight function, in which you can initiate a Fight automatically as long as you are in a dungeon or other area where there are enemies. This eliminates a lot of running in a circle for twenty minutes, waiting to for a Fight to start, that was so prevalent in the games that Breath of Death takes its inspiration from.   Additionally, HP is fully restored at the end of each fight, while MP is only slightly replenished. This makes HP a more immediate resource, with MP being something you want to ration. Potions are scarce, but will fully heal you, as well as cure any status effects, meaning that they're the only item you really need - which makes sense, as they're the only usable item in the game! This creates an interesting trade off of 'Do I use MP to heal, or do I use a potion? Should I attack, or try to end the battle more quickly with offensive spells?' The latter might be a good choice, as the fewer turns you use to end a fight, the more MP you recover, gold you earn, and experience points you are awarded. All of Breath of Death's systems are thusly simple, with a tinge of complexity that makes it just right.  You can immediately see these definitive design choices evolve in Zeboyd's following games, and having started with PA, Episode 3, it has been fun for me to strip them all down to the bare minimum with Breath of Death VII.",

The downsides are minor: the story is very tongue-in-cheek which is somewhat a departure from the stoic tones of the originals, it is easier to get into and therefore requires less commitment (which is barely a negative) and the story is not excellent thus far.

If you are looking for a short and fun trip down (and partially making fun of) memory lane then you won't regret picking this up.

This one, coupled with Cthulhu Saves the World, make for an excelent bundle of great RPGs. Make sure to play this one first to fully enjoy Cthulhu Saves the World. If you're an RPG fan, you should definitely get this one. DEFINITELY recommend.  It's full price is a MEGA BARGAIN for what you'll get. Really, I feel bad for buying this during the Steam Sale, it's worth so, so much more. You'll have much more fun with this one and Cthulhu Saves The World than many big-budget rpgs people shell out multiple bills for. GO GET IT DAMMIT",

Lots of games are set in the post-apocalypse, but I'm pretty sure this is the only one where it's after the end of the world and every character is undead.  This game is a nostalgic RPG-lover's dream, with the feel of an old, SNES-era RPG with most of the problems of RPGs of that time removed. The encounter rate is low, you regain all your HP after battle, and battle and leveling mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp, yet add enough complexity to make things interesting and encourage the player to plan ahead.  This game may have had me frustrated a few times, but its clever writing, kick-♥♥♥ music, unique story and user-friendly battle system ultimately won me over.  Recommended to RPG fans, both old and new alike. Or even anyone who wants a story they (probably) haven't heard before. Just remember to save often, as some battles may have your undead party end up... er, un-undead.",
