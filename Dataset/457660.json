It is a unique way of reading a book as you can listen to the narrator or read it and turn the pages yourself. I can see other books doing this. Say, a Harry Potter book reading. As they read, you go from under the cupboard to the hotel, the shack, on the train, in Diagon Alley, so forth.  If you want to read a new book in a new way, this is one way to do it. I liked it but others may not.",
