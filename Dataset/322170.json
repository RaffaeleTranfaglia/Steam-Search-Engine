            "review_text": " Geometry Dash is a challenging, one-button, colorful, techno rave that made me more emotional than many relationships.   Part of the allure of Geometry Dash is its simple controls; more precisely control. One button performs an action such as a jump, flip, or other momentum change. The game is either having the button down or not down, and performing this task correctly takes you to the end of the level where you can celebrate your victory as you see fit. Me I like a simple smile and approving nod, but I'm a class act that prefers to hide his emotions in the name of stoic professionalism, even in my moments alone.   This game is a grown up version of The Impossible Game who filled out quite nicely and gets much deserved attention. The look of the game can change substantially from level to level, particularly for the user submitted content, as can the music, but it is often colorful, minimalist, and very stimulating. There's a lot of great music tracks, and the game levels often use those tracks to determine when buttons are pressed yielding a feeling not unlike dancing, but on one button, which yields a pure sensation of rhythm.  There is a practice mode which is the preferred method for learning a level as death does not send you back to the beginning, and you can practice many areas repeatedly, although the real game is finishing real mode where you do the whole level in one shot.  Achievements in this game are linked directly to customization options for your beautiful little shape man. Coins are collected in level and linked to achievements, and the unlocking of additional levels. They are a challenge though, requiring rerouting through a level to pick up. Once collected the stage must be finished, so it seemed prudent to leave these until a level was well learned, unless you learned the level in the way through picking them up.  There is a massive amount of content for this game thanks to the user friendly creation tools in a variety of difficulties from, 'I tried everything to fail and couldn't, but what a trippy roller coaster' easy to 'I failed a thousand times on practice mode and desperately searched for something near me cheap enough to break' hard. There's a reason they're called demons, and it requires dedication to slay one. Remember that this game is not your friend.   Geometry dates back to the 6th century BC, and the first identified arithmetic related relic listed Pythagorean triples arising from geometry. The term dash can refer to a small quantity, typically when cooking. This random fact is brought to you in part by dashes from the  Original Curator Group . ",

I always played the game when I had free time, I collected over 4000+ stars and all the secret coins and all the map packs.  RobTop is love, I said, RobTop is life.  My brother laughs at me and calls me a fangirl.  I ignore him and continued playing.  He snatches my phone and turns it off.  I warn him that RobTop will get him.  He makes a face at me as he switches on his Xbox and starts playing Call of Duty.  I close my eyes.  Then, the car suddenly comes to a stop.  I hear a loud explosion from the back.  Everyone is panicking,  except me.  For I knew it was RobTop entering the mortal realm.  He forcefully opens the car door and grabs hold of my brother.  He shoves fistfulls of noobishly-created levels up his ♥♥♥♥.  My brother groans as his butt hole tears.  My parents could only watch in horror.  RobTop proceeds to snatch my parents phones.  He squeezes them until they become piles of ash.  Then, he came to me.  'You have helped Sary.' He said. 'You shall be rewarded.'  He gives me a computer, with the Steam game Geometry Dash.  I smile at him as he leaves.  RobTop is love.  RobTop is life.",

In other words, I highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Geometry Dash is a one button platformer with a strong focus on music and timing. With an extremely simplistic base design, it is easy to learn with a very high skill cap. It is a great time-waster with cosmetic unlocks, achievements, and an infinite amount of custom levels created by other users. The level creation tool is relatively easy to learn, but has an extraordinary amount of depth; when mastered, you can create beautiful, stunning and mesmerizing effects with entertaining gameplay. All custom level creators can choose almost any song on newgrounds to put into their levels, giving the game a pretty massive and incredible soundtrack. The community is relatively ok with quick bursts of exaggerated drama. The game itself can be played on PC and mobile, and both can have their stats and unlocks synced with each other. The creator of the game is fairly connected to community, relative to most others. Challenging and fun, the game is very addicting. All in all, a great game that I've spent a surprising amount of time on, especially for such a cheap price.  Overall, great game with an unbelievably high skill cap and great level creating tools for a cheap price.  Recommended to anyone who likes simple but challenging games.",

Thinks, 'Wow, I bet I'll beat that level in under 5 tries too and get all secret coins!' 3. Gets 30 secret coins after much sweat, tears, and rage in order to unlock Deadlocked. 4. Plays Deadlocked for the first time without going in practice mode first. 5. Dies at 1% 6. Tries Deadlocked for 1,000 more attempts without barely making it past 10% of the level. 7. Rages 8. Repeat from #6  11/10 would rage and break my PC again, thanks rubrub.  But anyway, Geometry Dash is a really frustrating to advance in a level but addictive and rewarding when you complete a level, and is a great game to pass time. I love the Map Packs, which are essentialy packs of levels which the levels are created by the community, and they make me rage as much as Electrodynamix did (I swear that level is a Demon level in disguise as an Insane one). Used to have this game on the phone but switched to PC because I always failed at easy parts and this game takes up a lot of space on the phone so I don't suggest getting this game on the phone, but it can be fun to play whenever you go. But this is all I have to say about this game, but I'll be back when RubRub makes us rage more with a new level soon on 2.1.",

The music makes the levels that much more interesting and fun to play. Some jumps are specifically timed to the music, but for some you really have to pay attention. Each level has it's own creativity to it, it's own new challenge, it's own ending. You can even make your own levels, and I really like it!   So overall, I think Geometry Dash is a game worth getting. I'd never played it on a mobile phone, never heard anything about it, thought it was very different, actually. I bought it blind, and it turns out to be one of my most favorite games on Steam! No second thoughts; buy it. Now. WARNING: THIS GAME CONTAINS RAGE TRIGGERS",

            "review_text": "This is truly an amazing game, a wonderful application of creative design in every sense of the phrase. The music is incredible, beautifully synchronised with the jumping of each level, it's very catchy and makes the replaying of the level every time you die a little more bearable. It's motivating and it's also pretty awesome for working out. The colours are beautiful, the characters you can choose for your cube are adorable and/or badass, and the way the game pushes you to limits beyond your imagination helps you accomplish levels you never thought were possible in your first, second, third, fourth attempt. This motivates you to keep going, to train for the harder levels and the both famous and infamous demon levels.   In my own experience, the game has done more beyond entertaining me. It has helped me a lot with building my patience. I wasn't a very patient person before playing the game, even when I started and up to a few days ago I would fail four times in a level and I quit the game, making the promise to myself that I would never play that 'piece of worthless rubbish' again. Then I played Meltdown for the first time and the design of the levels was SO beautiful, the music was catchy and so perfectly synchronised that I just enjoyed having to start from scratch every time I failed. Every time I started from zero I was so excited to get a little further to the end (only in the third level, really, because I never got to the levels of normal GD where you must use the spinning ball, so it was a new concept for me). Now that I play the harder levels of GD, my patience increase has been incredible, even on my daily life.  I honestly haven't experienced any cons. I know, weird, a game without cons? But there really aren't any. I just haven't found them. My rating is a 5/5, and of course I recommend the game! It's challenging, fun and rewarding. In the beginning it's frustrating, but it brings so many new elements to the table. Whether your regular gaming experience involves FPS-s, MMO-s or action/adventure, Geometry Dash will offer you new things beyond your imagination. You will truly enjoy it, buy it and give it a chance.",

It was like any other day, waking up and getting ready to venture into the world. I could hear the birds chirping and the car not starting. I sat in the driver seat waiting to start the car up again. As I tried once more this time slightly pressing the gas pedal the car began with an unpleasant sound, but it started so I was content. The day progressed and I took some time to eat my lunch as I had an hour break between my next classes. I sat and opened up my laptop like everyother day. I watched some shows and browsed some steam games which I had been doing every other day. Today was different a game caught my eye, it appeared to be a simple concept for a game. Using only one key to move a cube up to dodge spikes, walls and other obstacles. I contemplated on buying it at first due to how simple it had appeared, but I overlooked this after seeing an overwhelming amount of people who liked the game. Even still though I hesitated before buying the game unsure why, almost as if I my subconscious was telling me something. I proceeded in buying the game but did not play it yet. I still had a few hours left before I would play this game for the first time. On the drive home I decided to tilt the car seat back for the first time, I'm not sure what made me decide to do this as I had been driving home for over 3 years but none the less I had decided to. I also have been listening to some classical music that plays on the radio. Beyond relaxed on the way home, I was unaware of what unfortunate fate would soon become of me. I pulled into my garage and parked the car, as I got out I grabbed my bag and headed inside the house. I knelt down and untied my boots and the was greeted by my dog. I let her outside and started to set up my laptop to play the game. As I loaded the game I heard a scratch at the door and let my dog inside. That was the last thing I remember of my life before this game. I started to play and was easily lured in by the friendly colours and the customizations. I started the first level and died , I then began attempt 2 ofthe level only to die once again. It was fun, frustrating and addicting, but after completing the first level I felt some satisfaction. It didn't stop there though, I needed to fully complete the level which would take more attempts replaying it over and over until I could truly be free from the level. I have been seeing boxes and spikes and visions of the game since I have closed it. My thoughts are no longer my own I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to think without flashes of this game again. I have only one option now, attempt to play through the entire game and hope completing it will bring back what it has taken from me.",

Gameplay: The main idea of Geometry Dash is a Cube jumping over Objects, Spikes are dangerous, so they have to time their jump to the music, or else its back to the start of a level. There is also a ship, When you hold, you go up, and when you let go, you go down. simple as that. Then there is the UFO. If you played Flappy Bird, this will be familiar, but you can land on certain objects. Then theres a wave. When you press the button in rapid sucession, you will zig-zag up and down, the faster you click, the smaller space you can go through. Lastly, is the robot. Its similar to the cube, but depending on how long you hold the button/mouse, the further you will go. There is also a mini portal, a gravity switch, a mirror portal and a dual portal.  Music: This, in my opinion, the best part of the game. The music is always nice to the ears, and thanks to Newgrounds, there are a bunch of great song creators. Xtrullor,F-777,Waterflame, The list goes on. There isnt much else on this catagory, but I will say my favorite song is Leaving Leafwood Forest by Holydude (not sure if im correct there..)  Graphics: Depending on when the level was made, and how the creator uses the Level Editor (more on that later..) It can either be A.Simple B.Complex or C. Simply Stunning. Look up Fusion, Unity And X. These are great uses of the LE.  Other: The level editor is pretty complex, there is quite alot, but i will just link the wikia page for it.  geometry-dash.wikia.com/wiki/Level_Editor   Credit to Geometry Dash Wikia. ;)  Conclusion: So, what im trying to say is, this game is really good. and its less than £3/$5. Score 9.5/10.",

People don't realize that they can make something so...simple. Simple but yet effective and addictive.      This game doesn't have music that is new-agey and boring, its, idk, 'party/dancing' music. I love how each jump goes to the beat of the song.     Eh, It's just simply awesome :)  CONS:    Ok, im not sure this is a pro or a con, but, when you start the game you're like 'kewl' and you're so intrested in the little 'Stereo Madness' and it takes you a while and you beat it. Now that I'm at the FRICKIN' TOE2 im like this FRICKIN' CRAZY SHIVERING MANIAC THAT WILL CRY IF HE DOESN'T GET ABOVE 20%!!! THIS GAME REALLY MAKES ME MENTALLY INSANE!!!! ::::::))))))))     IT NEEDS MORE OFFLINE LEVELS!! WAAAAAAAAY MORE OFFLINE LEVELS!!!     Another thing I've seen a lot, are people that want a 'Random Infinite mode' where the level is simple, and it slowly gets harder and harder. So, someone can say 'Hey I got this high score, I betcha you can't beat it!'. It would be kindof weird and would need a lot of development, but, hey, its a start.   WHAT if, you went even further, and decided to add an online multiplayer, where whoever survived a certain map the longest wins! There's all sorts of stuff you can do. I'm REAAALLY loogin foward to the uh 2.1 update.",

When i first bought this game i thought it was gonna be easy, but it was not. The levels kept getting harder. The music to this game is great to.

It's similar to the popular Bit.Trip Runner series of games, but it has much simpler visuals (which actually makes it feel better than BTR in some ways). The first level starts so-so difficulty. The second level is hard. The third level is grueling. And from there you are challenged with attaining the impossible.  I must triple underscore this point: geometry dash is a VERY, VERY DIFFICULT GAME. On purpose. Geometry Dash hates you. Every time you stand up, Geometry Dash wants to push you back in the mud and laugh. It doesn't care about your feelings at all. Literally, this is one of the only rhythm games I have ever played where one of the cental gameplay features is that the game deliberately throws false alarms at you in an openly mean-spirited way to intentionally f*** you up and laugh at you. Imagine guitar hero where some of the notes in the middle of a super fast solo are bombs and if you play them instead of ignoring them, you instantly fail the whole song. Yeah. Geometry Dahs hates you. But for some reason it works.  Because of this difficulty, and because the game makes you restart the entire level for a single mistake (Oh yes, you better believe it), you will have to keep replaying the same level over and over again. Geometry Dash counts how many attempts you have made so far, just to taunt you. Attempt number 146, huh? Maybe you'll actually win this time, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh well, maybe 147 is a charm, ha ha ha ha ha.  But when you are actually doing really well in a level, and your palms are sweating with the anticipation that THIS MIGHT BE THE TIME THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT, and your jumps are thumping to that beat, and your heart is pounding like dat bass, and you feel like Luke Skywalker wearing the blind fold and kicking a** by tuning his senses to the force, then you feel really good. Finally toppling that level you've been trying to defeat all week feels like a huge accomplishment.  This game kicks my butt and I suck at it so bad, and you will too, but for some reason that's fun?  The one big complaint that I have with the game is that it gets you all excited about the fact that it has a level editor to let you create your own levels, but then it turns out that you can't use your own music. No, you can only use tracks from Newgrounds. The origin of Geometery Dash is at Newgrounds, so on one hand I get it, but on the other hand, that kinda makes it the North Korea of level editors. You may create your own levels, but only if they are a tribute to our dear leader.",

This is a very good game that is definately worth the money. If you like games like these(rage/rhythm/platformer games) this game is definately for you. It has currently been out for 2+ years, and was originally out on mobile, where it's populatity soared.  You jump over things. You fly over things. You go upside down. You flip the screen to make it seem like you are going the wrong way even though you aren't and you think the game is trying to troll you. You get into a ball and pretend you are in the gravity suit from Jetpack Joyride.   You play as flappy bird   You jump over things in a UFO. YOUR A ROBOT ALL OF A SUDDEN DUN DUN DUN  Pros: Everything above. No Lag at all(unless you are playing a level that is supposed to lag your system) Great 1-Button Controls. Awesome Community (not counting all the ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)...)  Cons: Very,very,very difficult. It can be hard for new players to beat the first level.(I wasn't one of them, I beat polargeist in 3 attempts...) Laggy on almost every tablet ever.  Good Job, RubRub. You have made the best game in a long time. I would reccomend this game to absolutely anyone. 10.5/10",

So I am gonna list some pros and cons and then say my personall opinion on how to really enjoy this game:  Pros: +The game's graphics are good, and it is looking really nice overall. +The music is GREAT +Level Editor +A lot of levels to play even without internet connection +Thousands of user-created levels, many of them are way better than the ones that come with the game.  +The gameplay is fun  Cons: -Demon Levels -Many of user-created levels are stupidly hard. (I am not talking about demons) -Requires a lot of practise to get really good.  -Gameplay is kinda repetitive. -The steam version is excactly the same as the mobile version.  -There are some bugs with the graphics. (like screen tearing, which is supposed to get fixed with v-sync, although I get framerate drop when I enable that, the bugs with graphics are not gonna touch your experience a lot but they are still annoying)   I would rate it 7.5/10 and recommend it of course, buy it right now if you want a fast-paced challenge. But do not bother playing demon levels, its seriously not fun dying 700 times in practise mode over and over again just to memorize when you have to jump/fly to get past the first 20%.  A nice game overall and it costs just 4eu. I recommend you buying it, clearing the easy official levels to get good at this game and then looking for easy, beautiful online levels. You are really going to have fun like that. If you want to become a 'demon chaser', then too bad for you, you will really pay with your social life and health.",

There are many user levels ranging from auto to Hell to silent difficulty. Beaten Sonic Wave? You can create an endless possibilities of levels. Still bored? There are new levels made every day for you to beat! There are also incoming updates that will spark the commmunity with even more levels and of course, harder levels.

I was hoping I would get an easy win in the next 100 attempts or so. It took me 253 attempts, but I finally did it. I was gleeing with joy. Probably one of the most happiest days of my life.'  Pros: -Create and customize your character. NO DLC at ALL. -Build and share your own levels. -No DLC. -Hidden easter eggs - I won't spoil them. -0% DLC. -Unlockable Icons and colors. -0x DLC. -At least 5 dogs- oops, wrong game. -Did I mention no DLC? Cons: -You can't draw an avatar. -1% DLC - Meltdown. -If this is your first time, there are no tutorial levels. -You can't implement custom backgrounds or music on your computer. -The graphics look like sh*t when you have Low Detail Mode on. Out of all, I give this game 8/10.",

            "review_text": "Before we start I'd like to point out that this review was (keyword: was) a joke review, i have decided to remove that and be more serious, and i will often repeat the word opinion, because that's what it is, my opinion.  Now, you've probably noticed I do have quite a lot of hours in this, that's to say, I really do like this game a lot, it's a good game. I'd love to recommend it, but there's a reason why I don't, and that is the community.  I understand that the developer cannot do anything about the community and that's fine, it's just my opinion at the end of the day. This game has a really outrageous community, It's the reason why I can't really enjoy this game as much as i would like to. (actually, the game developer seems to be doing everything wrong when it comes to making the community better, literally ignoring everything I say about it)  When I say outrageous (in a bad way) I mean childish, obsessed with overused memes, now I can understand that these are children and i should expect this but I'd atleast expect a bit more maturity than everyone laughing at 69 jokes or spamming lenny faces.  They love to create really lazy and bad levels. You wouldn't think the community matters so much in a game like this, but almost all of the enjoyment in this game comes from user levels, that other people that play this game create. So there's a big problem there, the game does become quite hard to recommend. It honestly just gets worse every day. Pretty much all of the level rob gives attention are just the good old classic EDM + single colour. It's really tiring, you know? Rob should realise that playing the same garbage with generic music and generic themes and bad gameplay, is just not fun.  The core game is enjoyable however, the main game levels are good, yet when you will go to the user levels, you will likely not have as much fun as i had, maybe you will, like I said it is my opinion  I'd recommend this game just for the main levels alone, the community levels are just overall bad and I wish they would be a bit more original instead of copying the same thing over and over again like it's the newest thing.  I'd like to finally point out that this review used only my opinions, and this is as accurate as it gets for me. Mature people will not have a fun time with the community, and if you dislike this review just because it is negative, that proves that you are one of the many immature children in the community.  EDIT: I've been asked by many for proof of this, and (even though there's plenty of it out there) I've got something here. So, I also moderate a Geometry Dash stream on twitch (some may know me as TheRealFurret out there), and I've recently found out someone has made a kik group about me receiving cancer and dying. I mean, why even do this? Is this not the perfect example of something that is wrong with a community?  A lot of GD streams tend to not be strict, but as I've made obvious many many times before, I do tend to be quite strict. And the streamer who I moderate for agrees with my ways. So if then, you come into a chat and act like an 8 year old child, receive warnings, and not stop, isn't a ban from the chat justified?  I'll tell you what isn't justified, talking about someone and legitemately wishing for them to get cancer and die.  If you still don't think it has a ♥♥♥♥ community, hell, just check the comments of this review.",

It can be difficult to beat a level but it is definitely possible, if you try over and over eventually you'll get the hang of it and beat the next level. Kind of reminds me of learning to play a new song on an instrument and if you practice it long enough you can play it perfectly.   Even if I fail a lot, and I quit to take a break after a while because the game is quite intense on the eyes and I keep failing more because I feel my focus is slipping away, I always come back, and each time I do I get a little futher. The game is a bit hard on the eyes as I said because you end up staring, also barely blinking probably as you try to see what is coming next on this fast moving screen.   Regardless of that, it is not an issue to me, because the game to me is something I just play for about 20 minutes a day and have a good time with. Sometimes I also I open it up to play for a little bit when I am waiting on someone or something of the sort, it's a great way to kill some time, but I usually find myself ending up playing longer that the planned 5 minutes and end up making someone wait because the game is slightly addicting to me. (And clearly to others for sure!)  Also the game looks very appealing with it's bright colors, and they did a wonderful job on making the music match up with the level as you proceed through it. On top of that, you can make and play custom made levels!   For such a low price, you really can't go wrong with buying this fun game. It's well worth the small amount of money you have to pay to be able to get it.",

There is a large number of different character/vehicle skins to unlock, and you don't need to buy any.  Along with the original levels, There's a built in Level Editor(can include your own created songs too) and Community Map Browser where you can easily and very quickly find levels created by other users and play them, filter different results/types of maps, rate them, etc. Everything from playing the game, to making levels, and to browsing the levels made by the community is all incredible polished and easy.  The game itself is very challenging, but there's a practice mode for each level where you can do it like normal, but can leave checkpoints so you can repeatedly try the hard parts. There are about 17 levels created by the developers, but there's an incredible amount of maps made by the community, so you'll never run out of maps to play.  Anyone who likes platformers, especially those with great music, should definitely play this game.",

            "review_text": "Geometry Dash is a game that expands upon The Impossible Game in many ways. You can jump over spikes and spinning blades and you can use boost jumps and pads (probably not real names). There are then portals that turn you into different modes e.g. Ship mode (Jetpack Joyride), Spikey Ball mode (Gravity Guy), UFO mode (Flappy Bird) and a new zippy thing (Wave mode). There are 18 different levels as of update 1.9 (2 of which are unlockable) but if you still want more, there are loads of community made levels and the ability to make your own. This game seems simple but it offers so much and is well worth the money. Some levels can be annoying at times but the music makes up for it. I, personally, am a fan of the style of music RobTop use but you can add your own music to custom levels if you want to. I played this on my phone and I still do but I think that the controls are better on Steam. I clearly really like this game and I couldn't recommend it more if you like this sort of game. It is worth a try.",

Geometry dash is similar in that it takes the basic idea of The Impossible Game but then it makes it so much more. Basically, Geometry Dash is The Impossible Game on steroids.  The level design is brilliant. The background changes and more obstacles are added as you progress through the levels (there will always be those pesky triangles though XD). The levels themselves progress in difficulty from fairly straightforward to insanely difficult and they do a really good job at introducing each new concept (e.g. upside down, reverse etc.).   I really like the fact that you can customise your cube and that more options are unlocked as you play through the game. I feel this kind of creates a driving force that keeps me playing even when I'm hating the current level.  I do however caution you. Do not play this if you are inclined to anger easily as you will be rage quitting every 10 seconds as every time you hit an obstacle, you start the whole level again. It is a very easy way to break your keyboard.  10/10 my friends don't know what they are missing out on.",

The thousands of user created levels gives challenges and the mind wanting to try and try again, till your just like 'RAGEQUIT' but then your like... but... but... AGAIN. it can be the uninstalling exe and reinstalling exe because you always want to play it and beat that level you never beat yet, the practice mode is very benificial and fun to use as many would kindof requir the use of it so you know what to expect and how to beat the level you rage at.

When the Age of Fire began, he ventured deep underground.  He acts as a god of death and disease, and is the master of the Gravelord Servant covenant. The player can join this covenant by interacting with Nito, but killing him (which is mandatory) will not break the covenant.  Location  Tomb of the Giants After the Pinwheel Servant area.  Playthrough HP Souls First 4,317 60,000 NG+ 7,076 120,000 NG+6 8,845 150,000 Drops  Lord Soul (Gravelord Nito)  Notes  He is the only covenant master that must die in order to finish the playthrough. Killing him doesn't break the Gravelord Servant covenant, but you can't upgrade its level until the next playthrough. Gravelord Nito cannot be harmed when you access him by using the catacombs' coffin next to the titanite demon. However, you can find the Paladin Set and your bloodstain (if you died while fighting him) and can still join the Gravelord Servant covenant provided he was not killed. The Gravelord Sword, Sword Dance, and Greatsword Dance are unavailable once Nito is dead, so if you wish to obtain these you'll need to do so before killing him. Weaknesses  Fire-based damage  Attack Patterns  Slam - Raises his weapon above his head, then slams down in front of him. Horizontal Swing - Swings his sword horizontally, does not connect at extreme close range. Miasma - Curls up and begins to glow, then after a brief time releases a shockwave that deals high damage and will at the very least stagger you. Grab - Raises his hand and attempts to grab you dealing high damage, alternating shoulder buttons will reduce duration and damage. Gravelord Sword - Screams and raises his sword, then thrusts it into the ground to summon a single Gravelord Sword from beneath you causing knockup and heavy Toxic status. Strategies  Upon entering the area you will be attacked by three Skeletons, a Divine weapon is recommended for killing them so they do not interfere with your fight. Additionally there are three Giant Skeletons at the other end of the arena that will not engage unless you approach them, these can be ignored as long as you don't venture too far. Any remaining at the end of the fight will permanently die as you kill Nito.  The recommended approach is to kill the three skeletons and wait for Nito to come to you, then fight him in the small area you landed in. You should still be able to run far enough to escape his miasma without pulling the three Giant Skeletons.  An alternative, if you don't have better rings to use, is to equip the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring AND the Ring of Fog which will prevent any skeletons from attacking you as long as you don't get too close. This does reduce your effective arena in which to duel Nito however.  For NG plus, if you have havels shield and a heavy weapon, you can stand in front of him, let him attack and be able to withstand his hits. This will make him kill his own servants and allow you to hit him a few times before he attacks again and before his servants come back alive. Rinse and repeat. This is recommended for tank characters though. Be sure to have quite a few high healing items(20 estus fully upgraded, divine blessing, humanity, Elizabeth's mushroom, etc.)  Dodging and Blocking  With high poise (such as using Havel's Set or Iron Flesh) most of his attacks will have no effect with the exception of his grab and miasma attacks, which should be avoided. His Gravelord Sword attack will still knock you up but he will not use it once you are up against him. You can watch a video here. For medium builds, a shield with high magic resist is recommended to block his miasma. Poise will assist with blocking his sword attacks, and his grab needs to be avoided. Staying right up against him should prevent you from being staggered if you are hit. Light builds should have little trouble rolling all his attacks except the Gravelord Sword and miasma. The Gravelord Sword should be avoidable by sprinting (heavier builds may need to roll at just the right time).  If timed correctly, Nito's shockwave can be cancelled while drinking an Estus Flask. Try this as a last resort if he has you pinned against a wall, otherwise it can easily be run from. The visual extends further than the actual area of effect so don't be worried if you're caught at the edge.  Melee  Being in melee range will cause Nito to primarily use his sword attacks, with an occasional grab and miasma. Avoid getting tied into long attack animations to give you time to react and try to stay behind him. Note that being right up against him will cause most of his attacks to miss or do very little damage.  To gain cumulative damage, Quelaag's Furysword deals good fire damage with fast attacks.  Ranged  Nito moves very slowly so when using ranged attacks you only need to worry about his miasma, Gravelord Sword, and running into the Giant Skeletons.  Pyromancy is also an option to consider, preferably Great Combustion, as being in medium range will put you at high risk of his sword attacks.  The Great Lightning Spear miracle is very effective and on NG should require about ten uses to kill him. Having a few casts of Lightning Spear in reserve is recommended should any further damage be required. Sorceries are all very effective but visiting The Duke's Archives first is recommended.  Bugs  It is possible to have Nito throw you into the rock formations in the center of the room, right in front of where you drop down. While hard to do, it will cause you to stay in a falling animation and performing the plunge attack. Every time he moves near you, he will take damage and can be staggered. You can still die here but his attacks seem to do less damage. You will have to save and quit after killing him to get out of the position. ",

It feels like RobTop has given up on the game.  2. We've been stuck with the same stupid creator items since 2.0. Um... Are we supposed to do something with these old items?  3. All creator content has gotten boring, hell I could build something in Minecraft and everyone would be bored.  4. If RobTop gave out a sneak peek, why isn't it done? Do you smell that? It smells like BS.  And that's all the reasons I have left, if you feel like waiting for a year for something that has to perfect but probably wouldn't be, just don't buy it. It might 2065 before RobTop releases a new update. It better a 100/100. Because we wasted alot of time for an update.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",
