            "review_text": "Worth the money, in my opinion.   Positives: + Interesting, deep storyline. + Many puzzles and lots of interaction, which provide a good challenge. + An amusing, entertaining protagonist. I really got into the character whilst playing this game. + Voice acting is not dull, and actually pretty good. + Character can die, making it different from most point and click games. Remember to save your progress. I think this is a positive personally. + You can tell a lot of work has gone into this game, and it shows in the quality.  Negatives: - As point and click as it gets. If you don't like point and click games, you should probably step away from this. If you're not sure if you like them or not, then I still think this is a worthwhile and fun purchase. - Although the tabs state that this is a 'horror', it isn't really. More of a mystery, without the typical detective characters.",

            "review_text": "A fun and enjoyable Point and Click game with interesting locations and characters with a very dark storyline - a welcome change from the usual light hearted competition. A few scares here and there, but nothing which you will lose any sleep over.  Yes , as mentioned elsewhere, the main character comes across a bit like a spoilt brat at first but his dry sense of humour soon becomes quite amusing to listen to.   Solid graphics with a mix of prerendered scenes and hand painted artwork this game was a pleasure to admire. It also features a 'Show items' hotkey similar to Secret Files which you may love or hate - I find it a very useful feature as well as the option for hints should you find yourself stuck.  Overall a very worthwhile Point and Click adventure which I look forward to replaying in the coming years.",

            "review_text": "A while ago i wrote a negative review of the first part Black mirror. But this (second part of trilogy) is different. Another team of developers worked on that part and i want to tell you about it, because they continued a good story from first part and did pretty good correction work, which led too edition of great quest.   At first, there is diary, where Darren will write all key moments and achievements. It means, that after a long break you can read notes in diary and refresh your memory. It is really helpful and you shouldnt watch in solution, when you lost lane, because you cant remember where you stopped or just missed some little item/dialogue.  At second, dialogues there are good and post scoring much more lively, then in first part. Plus, I liked, that there I interacted not only with residents of the village, but also with urban people and you can notice that contrast. Graphics. There is striking difference. Locations, where developers wants startle us looks really creepy, unlike in first part, where that scenes looks like cheap trash.   Gameplay is mostly tied to combining items in your inventory. There is almost no poor puzzles like barley-break, if they are - you can solve it just in 7-10 minuts. But working with your inventory was really interesting and hard sometimes.  So, I guess, its all, I just wanted to say, that if you didnt like first part of Black mirror, and therefore you dont want to play second and third part, in my opinion, you MUST, if you enjoy quest-genre. Unlike first part, it is very good quest with beautiful world and nice tasks.",

The story is the strongest part of the black mirror series along with the look of the game. The graphics are nice for an older game. The only things I don't like are 1. the walking is a bit slow and you walk back and forth a lot which can get a bit boring. 2. there are a lot of things to look at, and some of those things are rather meaningless. It would have been better if the developers had only included things to look at that were totally relevant to the game. For example, do you really need to look at the mansion and see a vine growing up to a window and comment on that vine?  I found I got sick of looking at every little detail because I just wanted to get on with the story.  But, In order not to miss clues you HAVE to look at everything, even the things that are not totally relevant.  Other than that..a really great little point and click.",
