            "review_text": "This game is not what it seems to be.   From looking at the screenshots, it would seem to be a good looking train sim, that provides an authentic train driving experience, using highly detailed models of real locations and real trains.  Unfortunately, and as much as I wanted to enjoy this game, I have found it to be a great dissapointment.  First of all, the game engine is a mess. Sure, the graphics look good when you turn everything up, but even if your computer was built by NASA you won't be able to, because it will kill your FPS.  So, turning the graphics down to acheive a reasonable FPS means that there are artifacts and graphical glitches... shadows that continuously 'catch up' a few feet in front of your train for example.  However, even when using minimal graphics setup, the game is FULL of bugs, glitches and other problems that make it extremely frustrating to use.   But it's worth pressing on because of the authentic 'feel' of the trains, right? WRONG. The trains in this sim are trains that I have been on thousands of times, when commuting from Brighton to London, for example. This sim fails to model the sounds and operating methods of these trains.  For a game that is supposed to allow you to control trains, there is an astonishing amount of difficulty in setting up your controls. They have gone out of their way to make this game frustrating to use and difficult to control.  Also, forget about gameplay. This sim is strictly about driving your train, with many scenarios requiring you to perform tedious 'shunting' tasks to assemble your train, a task made even more tedious by the games lack of user friendly options. The various scenarios are almost ALL BROKEN and have not been fixed by the publisher.  The publisher of this game charges a fortune for all the DLC, and it's broken, they don't fix things after it's released. Instead, they rely on the 'community' to add more workshop content for the game, which is completely ridiculous, like something a child would think of.  So, I am not recommending this game, unless you are looking for false promises and an un- authentic train sim.  ",

I have to repeat the same basic 'this is how to drive forward 50 feet' tutorial multiple times for different train types? 'Here's how signals' work without any explanation of how to use the routing map or read signals remotely. And so on. Alright, bad tutorials but I will just dive right in.  After completing a bunch of tutorials, I was pumped. Woo, gonna just pick a train and drive it somewhere! Wait, I have to select from a handful of trains, on just a handful of routes? Wait, you mean I only got like %1 of the game that I paid $45 (minus sale discount) for?  No steam locomotives provided out of the box? Well, game has DLC, let me go see how much they cost. Twenty bucks for a single loco? What does a new route cost? FORTY BUCKS?  I then look at the Steam DLC page for this game.  FIVE THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS FOR ALL THE DLC?!

            "review_text": "I really tried to like this game.. I really did but:..... 1. All that really matters in this game is the speed indicator. In order to do some of the missions you have to go a little bit faster than the speed limit (i.e. going 35.5 instead of just 35) in order to make it on time. Problem is... if you go 36 you get penalized. With trains that have a lot of cars, the speed get very irregular. You may go 3 mph under the speed limit and all of a sudden in a matter of milliseconds be going 3 mph over the speed limit which results in penalties. Since the only thing that matters in this game is the speed limit indicator, it is such a shame that the people who developed... say the scenery wasted their time cuz you can't enjoy the scenery with your eyes literally GLUED to the speed limit indicator.  2. I love steam trains... and they are still bugged from the 2013 version.   3. Saving your game is detrimental. I don't know if the developers didn't save the states of the junctions, but I have noticed that when I reload a saved game, the game bugs out and I can't get onto the correct track or other trains end up running into me, or light won't change because I am not where I am suppose to be. They have a save game option for each scenerio, but it is a gamble if you use it.  4. Expensive expansion packs. With as buggy as the game is, why would I want to pay more for expansions when the base game is buggy?  It does have its good points, but the more I played this game, the more I realized that the suck sucks way more than the good points. Beautiful as this game is, I can't recommend this game to someone when everytime I install and try to play this game, I am reminded why I uninstalled it in the first place!",

            "review_text": "TS has been the best actual simulator of railroads, but has offered numerous frustrations which I've tolerated. But upon hearing the release plans for TS2017+, I am depressed that it is no longer a viable use of my time and I have wasted hundreds of dollars for years for nothing.  I'm extremely disappointed in: - the yearly releases that don't add or fix anything for existing players, without requiring those players to fork over extra money for new routes - the astoundingly overpriced DLC which has many bugs - the extraordinary lag even on new computers with dedicated GPUs (you can disable lighting but that actually ruins nighttime visibility on some routes and actively removes scenery from others, making them as useless as wireframe)  But most of all, I'm disappointed that every bit of content I bought is now worthless in the 'World Edition' which we're being asked to buy. How do the developers expect me to keep gigs upon gigs of binaries &amp; content which I can only play in my old version, and get a new edition comprising gigs upon gigs which I can only play separately? This demonstrates the utter lack of support for existing users of this product: the team has stated they're completely uninterested in backwards compatibility AND even in rebuilding prior routes -- such as, say, Northeast Corridor -- for the new edition. And if they ever DID rebuild a route for 'World Edition' you can guarantee it'd cost you tons of money to re-obtain it.  New gamers beware: I can't recommend buying 2017 because you'll have to keep it as a separate game and have to install a future edition that won't play any of the routes you received (or ANYTHING else currently available for sale - look it up, it's true). Existing gamers, which are bread-and-butter for competitor developers like Auran, already know that this team's behavior is pathetic. This is just the nail in the coffin.",

I've also experienced some weird AI collision without any actual AI present on the map (had to restart the scenario).  The same applies to the bundled ICE missions where the whole signalling is just broken. Stuck in the depot while waiting for the red signal to turn green (waited for like 5 minutes) also had fun time applying emergency brakes just because some ghost speed-limit from 160 to 80 kmph. My virtual passangers thanked me at the end of the drive for sure! :)  And for this whole DLC model. It's insane. Their in-game store lists some locos for €6.99 but when you click the Steam checkout button you can see that they want to charge you €13.99.  Also €20-30 for routes containing 3-4 scenarios with 30 minutes of drive-time per each is utter BS. You can find highly detailed, realistic, non-glitching maps for MSTS for FREE. Almost forgot to mention that you can drive full-routes on those not just 4-5 stop services starting on deserted main-stations and ending in some random town in the suburbs.

            "review_text": "Updated 26 Feb 15 following comment and release of the Isle of Wight fixes.  You might think it would be fun, or at least different, to be able to drive a steam train, or indeed any train through rolling countryside, perhaps relaxing and a change from killing stuff. If so please look elsewhere.  The idea is good and I know simulations are not for everyone but the implementation is dire. There are repeated bugs and crashes and every update seems to introduce new problems without fixing the old ones.   There are 2 sides to this game. Driving stuff and building stuff in the editor.   Driving first.  Having never driven a train I cannot say if the simulation side is accurate, what I can say is that the missions and game play can be frustrating.   You get a handful of trains and routes from the outset and can purchase any number of additional DLC from Dovetail (or whatever they are calling themselves now) and 3rd party devs. There are missions where you have to take a train from one place to another in a tight time-table without speeding, falling of the tracks,crashing or going through a red signal which is harder than it sounds. Trains do not stop quickly, or like rain, hills etc so running on time is tough and it is very easy to miss a speed restriction resulting in a failure (or no awarded points).   Missions can last over a hour and you will loose if you go through a red signal, or make a serious mistake,. There is a quick save (press F2 - thanks paned) but to reload you have to quit the mission and then reload from the mission select screen. Some of these routes are very long and take quite a time to load. You only get one save slot per mission and so even doing a reload may not save you if you are about to pass a red signal. Get it right and there is a sense of achievement ( or relief ) but the bugs just get in the way.   There are other computer controlled trains on the line and you can be perfectly on time, top scoring only to have one of these crash miles away from you for the mission to fail. You did nothing wrong, the game bugged. remember how long some of those missions are? Imagine that happening 45 mins into one. It will.  You might like to purchase some of the nice shiny DLC, in a word don't. There is zero, zilch, nada, zip, guarantee that an update won't break it without warning, and never be fixed. When I first wrote this review in Dec 2014 the Isle of Wight career scenarios were totally bugged and would not load and had not since the 2014 update. Well at this has at last been sorted along with over 100 other bugs and glitches for one, rather old, route. OK congrats for at last sorting the problems devs, but you have released countless new bits of DLC in the meantime many of which have their own bugs.   One of my 3rd party routes (can't remember which) has you so that you are embedded in the roof of the train cab making driving 'interesting'. That broke in 2012. Since the original review I have found that some of the wooden post semaphore signals from the UK set have the signal arm at the bottom of the post (so embedded inm the ground), rather than where it should be at the top. I have no idea how long these have been broken, but given the devs priories (new DLC, new DLC etc) don't expect these to be fixed soon if ever.  Building  Hanker after your old train set, want to build a virtual one? Look elsewhere or the bugs and frustration will get you here as well.  The editor is complicated, and you have to do a lot of background reading before you start. Signals are complex things and getting them wrong with cause you no end of problems. This would not be a problem if editor loaded and didn't crash, and allowed you to move a track without sicking buffers all the way along it and has a sane way to build tunnels and didn't crash if you raised a track for a hill and... In short it's bugged as well. As for the documentation welll....  To sum up its a nice idea ruined. The graphics are nice (and bugged - check fully leaved trees that cast the shadows of bare branches, solid walls that have light flooding under their bases etc), and it could be a relaxing way to spend a few hours.  If it worked.",

I especially enjoyed when I arrive at stations and had to sit and wait for 3-5 minutes (real time) to elapse to leave the station on time. The controls for the trains I have require me to have to either constantly hold the throttle or keep losing speed then have to shift back down to not lose points for speeding. I guess the people who made the real trains these are modeled after never found a way to have linear controls that would stay in place so instead you have 25, 50,75 and 100% power or you hold the throttle in place at a mid point for 3-10 minutes as you travel. Don't read the speed limit signs or follow their map or you will lose points for speeding when you hit the occasional bug in the game where the programing doesn't match the visual cues. I can't bring myself to do a single scenario that will take 3-4 hours.

To move throttles and pull switches is a pain because the game is always freaking out with what it thinks you want to do. Just a simple pull of a brake is difficult to preform, what should have been just a simple 'move your mouse up or down' was actually a strange left to right circular motion which is extremely sensitive and frustrating to use. Second, don't be fooled by the fancy trailers or cool screen shots, the graphics in this game are absolute garbage! You could say, 'but isn't it about the gameplay not the game?' When the Title of your game is 'TRAIN SIMULATOR 2015' and your game looks more like 'TRAIN SIMULATOR 1999' there's something wrong! Not to mention that the gameplay is suppose to be a cool experience of driving a REAL LOCOMOTIVE, this should be a good looking system with at least great looking trains and with decent looking control rooms. I don't care if the outside looked like an 8-bit atari game as long as the vehicle, which i paid for to drive looks good and drives even better. Another negative is sound design. The opening credit sequence show live shots of trains at work steaming along, honking, whistling, and so on; but in the actual game, none of the sound feels real. All they had to do was get ahold of some recording from a train yard or something, but all the sounds in the game are cheap sound bites. I just had a terribly bad experience with this game and I shouldn't have had to have a bad experience for the price of this game. If Steam allowed returns, I'd returns this game without a second thought! Don't buy this game, there is no simulation in this simulation. Farming Simulator is an amazing game compared to this!",

In that sense, comparing it to dlc of an average game where more gives you often a fuller experience, does not work. If you are considering this game you likely are looking to just experience driving trains, drive through some nice scenery, enjoy controlling something that requires some proper timing. This game offers that properly in my opinion. Moreso than with other games your purchase will depend on how you regard the pricing scheme. You will likely want some new routes or trains to play with after a while. Do you consider the large offering of paid routes and trains as essentials that should have been (much) cheaper? Then perhaps better stay away. Do you consider this a hobby that will likely require or at least warrent future investments (which you can afford and feel reasonable enough, possibly during sales), then this is indeed a good simulator of what it claims to be in my opinion.",

The base game itself is quite positive for those looking to have a realistic driving experience (3rd or 1st person), but the reason i advise non-train buffs to not purchase it is because of the amount of facts and figures you will come across and the fact that if you are not into it, then the DLCs are useless. The total DLC cost is well over a £3000 which makes it an incredibly over-priced game for what it is; a simulator. For £3000 you could buy a real train. Although, being an enthusiast myself, it is excellent to have a wide range of locomotives, routes and skin packs to be able to customize your fleet. A real con is where they sell you a train for £11.99 and call it new even though it has only been re-skined. Of course you do not have to buy every single DLC, but for instance I have spent over £150 on DLCs alone, way too much for a simulator. A good feature of this game is the create your own route feature. This is very complex but once you have learnt the basics, an excellent way to plan out a model railway. There are also modes such as free-roam (self-explanatory), scenario based, career scenario based and quick drive. Quick drive was added in quite a recent update and is one of my preferred modes; you are able to select any locomotive on any route, setting the time and day etc... Comparibly the scenarioes are excellent and with the addition of the workshop are seemingly endless. Overall, not a great game but don't allow the 200 and something hours tell you otherwise; please note, this was a big waste of my life and I do not want it to be yours. This game (even though I stated it was good for enthusiasts etc...) makes dept a real issue and if you're stupid enough to add all of the DLCs to the cart then you might as well get another bank account. I may play it an awful lot, but honestly the outdated graphics may be the best for a train simulator, but the development company to take over this game hasn't evolved since the 1998. The trains do look excellent, but the AI are all the same in effect only retextured to the time period or the characters gender. I'd say a 4/10 would be being pleasant to the developers but it isn't a good choice for Christmas. I would plead you not to purchase an absorbing 2009/10 based sim that hasn't been updated (as in the bugs fixed or graphice improved) since its release.",

The most expensive route DLC shoud be only $15.00. The most expensive loco DLC should be $6.50.  2. DLC System  Also on the Holiday Express it says go 100 MPH but the speed sign says 25,30,45 when the 100 MPH limit does not go away. And they care more about DLC then bugs.  3. Impossible To Do  Lets say I want to make a custom loco. I have to use RW_Tools. There is no loco editor in the game or the Railworks folder. Plus RW_Tools cost money. If I want to use any wagon or locos in the quick drive train creator, It only lets me do certain locos and wagons.  4. Bugs  The game will create dump files randomly. Not just my computer but a gaming computer has these problems as well. I played this game on a gaming computer before and it still creates dump files. My Isle Of Wight DLC has some bugs. When I play on of the scenarios the scenario crashes.  5. Unpredictable  Let's say I want to drive a train. Sometimes wheel slips happens unexpectedly while i'm driving a train.  6. Requires gaming computer.  I don't have a gaming computer, here is my computer hardware information.  Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU B950 @ 2.10GHz 2 Core  4GB RAM  7.Worst Then EA  I did not think there could be a company worst then EA.

And, that's honestly where the value is.  + 2015 version has great UI + Fun to drive trains + Interesting tutorials + lots of workshop content + started with 2013 edition, free upgrade to 2015 + some free DLC (known as Classic Routes in the workshop) + career system seems interesting so far  - some tutorials need better explanations (ie: when breaking, explaining what wheel slippage is and why it happens would be nice.. or the right time to start slowing down when a speed limit is changed, etc) - even with beefy spec'ed machine I still lagged out in certain areas - graphics could be plenty better or at least better polish - riddled with bugs - insane base price - insane DLC prices  My positive and negative bullet points basically sum it all up. It's a neat game, and there's a lot of great stuff here. But is it worth $60CAD? Heck no, not compared to so many other titles out there. Why is that? Because for AAA prices, I don't want to see 'ID Not Found' when trying to create my profile. I don't want to see lag or framerate drops on my high-spec'ed machine every time I pass through a town - and all the other little bugs. This is further worsened by the DLC prices - when they are priced the same as full-version titles, and I can read about how they have the same craftsmanship (aka riddled with bugs), I'm just not going to take the chance at getting burned.   And that is disapointing, because I like sinking my teeth in detailed sims; and I'm not afraid of opening my wallet and investing considerable sums into a game to support it... But when the title is riddled with bugs, the content (such as the tutorials) need further ironing out and so on, you cannot justify these prices - no matter how niche-market the title is.  I guess I can conclude this all by saying that in the end, I am enjoying it. A) because I did get the base copy and some DLC for cheap, and B) because my base copy keeps getting updated for free; so it's hard to really feel ripped off. So I am enjoying it - but I'm disappointed because I feel like my replay value is going to be capped until I can get some more DLC for cheap; because I won't be paying their regular price that's for sure.   I wish I could say maybe on the reccomendation... but it has to come down to this: until they drop their base prices for the game and the dlc to something more fitting the quality of the game you're getting right now, my reccomendation has to be no.  tl;dr; Great Steam Sale buy if it's dirt cheap (60-70% off or more I'd say). Game is nice, but buggy. Insane DLC prices will likely hurt replay value.. but I'm still enjoying it (since I did get it cheap ages ago) so far.",

These do NOT react with lightning speed as it does in this game.  These two issues are to me game breaking and totally pulls me out of the immersion that the game would otherwise have. If the development team could focus on making the actual driving of the trains more realistic, and by extension fun, they could have a great game that I would probably immensly enjoy.

I am a massive train fanatic, I have always liked trains since I was a little kid, and have even had a few model train sets however my parents soon got fed up of derailing trains crashing their coffee all over the place so this game was the next best thing I could find.  At first sight this game is everything you could want, it comes with a few routes and each of these contain a decent amount of scenarios which are mostly interesting and vary in difficulty. The graphical fidelity of this game is decent but this is 2014 and using 2D trees which rotate to look 3D in this day and age is pretty awful, overall pretty good however soon enough you will have done everything in the base game... so what next?  Well one thing you have to praise is the workshop which lets you download additional routes, scenarios and some other bits and bobs from other owners of the game which are free, and to be honest if this basic feature was not in the game there is no way I would be so positive up till now, so you have to give credit to all the people who have worked hard and given up their time making free content just to make the game more enjoyable, because the developers are too busy making the next stunningly accurate DLC to sell on the store.  Eventually you will want some new routes / locomotives to play around with so you will inevitbale consider paying some hard earned money for some extra DLC which you would assume will be a reasonable price.......... Unfortunately the prices are extortionate and paying £12 just for a locomotive in my oppinion is far too expensive and this is where the game starts to go downhill for me, the DLC is far too expensive and some of the DLC I have taken the plunge on has been very dissapointing. The GEML London - Ipswich Add - On is missing popular stations such as Southend Victoria and Clacton yet I paid £25 near half the price of the game for one route.... for this reason I don't recommend their DLC as you may be surprised to see parts of the route you want are not there!!!  (P.s. the £12 class 90 add-on didn't even have a passanger view??? I am dissapointed by this as other DLCs do have the passanger view, and you don't clearly detail what is / is not included.)  Carrying on, the parts of the route it does include are pretty well done but the platforms on this particular DLC are too short at a majority of stations along the line and whilst I don't expect a 100% replica if your going to take the time to model each station atleast make the platforms the right length? my next issue is that whilst there are very good powerful features to create / edit routes and scenarios the tools are moderately good but very buggy and will crash often or create errors with little debugging information which is just rediculous and makes these tools somewhat obsolete. I assume this is why the DLC is so expensive?? Not to mention a lack of documentation on how to use these which is a shame, engine-driver is one of many places to find some tutorials however the next part of a tutorial usually never shows up.  To sum it all up, this game is not a bad game, I have played some awful games and as a rail fanatic this game has done a good job of keeping me satisfied, however DLC pricing is out of touch and extortionate, usually not 100% complete or lacking fearues I would consider mandatory personally, the tools they have added to let the average joe create scenarios and improve routes whilst promising and fairly decent are tarnished by their incompleteness and are sometimes at best rather tempermental and require extreme patience. It is for these very reasons I can't recommend this game and I won't be buying any more DLC unless it is dirt cheap.",

Once you look at the extremely pricey content, the lack of easily usable scenario creators, and iron fist control, you realize that they should be paying you to use this game. Lets start at the beginning, This simulator is not cheap, $20 for two locomotives and a set of passenger cars, that is absolutely free for trainz users. In fact, a peruse through the store finds that there is no free content besides user made scenarios that use the content that isnt free... you get the point. Its obvious that the creators did not want you building scenarios, because the process is daunting and more frustrating than the videos above make it sound. Mainly because you are unable to use any content not specifically slated for use on that route. For example, you wish to use a P42 and Phase IV superliners (that you paid $20 for) on Donner Pass to model the California Zephyr. Well, those P42's (While completely common on Donner) are only accessible on the $40 Marias Pass route, so you can forget about a Zephyr. Unless of course you wish to fight the scenario creator and go in via quick drive yada yada yada... The point? Dont buy this game. Seriously, dont.",

I only own the base content for this game and it is so full of bugs that leave you no option but to completely quit your efforts and start again in the hope that you don’t encounter those issues the next time you try to complete any given scenario.  The game is also very badly optimised. No other title on my computer makes my fans spin up to the torrent of noise that this game achieves only minutes after first launch.  As for the near €2500 worth of DLC, I have never purchased any. I’m just not that brave or stupid. I have read lots of issues still remain in the DLC also which has been reported by the real hardcore fans and the impression is that there is no plan to fix.  Had I not read any such bad DLC reviews, I still would not purchase, for the base game is enough to warn me off.  Such a shame, I would like to really get into this title, but it just doesn’t seem to be worth all the aggravation and lack of support.  Buy or don’t – well, I’m not recommending…",

It is not a bad game as many people would disagree because the price of DLC but you don't need all that DLC to play this. It is cheaper than buying a real model railroad set which is more expensive than the DLCs in this game. Some of the DLCs may sound terrible or the physics messed up. The controls are the same as MSTS (Microsoft Train Simulator) which is why I like this game.  Most of the DLC prices like for example that the locos would cost you a good $20 like the P42DC, Acela Express, and the Union Pacific Big Boy. Routes would cost you a good $40 like the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network, North Jersey Coast Line, Marias Pass, and Soldier Summit. There's a lot of DLCs to choose from that you may want to get like Steam engines, maybe you want to drive some freight American trains, or a drive a UK passenger train. The DLCs are mostly focused on UK, Germany, and USA but there's third party DLC on Steam that there's routes outside those 3 countries you could get. Steam hosts sales for this game from time to time so you could wait to buy a add-on if you're on budget and buying the DLCs like in bundles would help too.  PROS: Routes and locos are made from there actual aspects. Lots of add-ons to choose from. Good Visuals for an Old Game Engine Supports TrackIR and RailDriver Helpful Community A lot of things to do such as Rail Fanning, operate a Switcher, Freight Train, or a Passenger Train.  CONS: Lack of Bug Fixing Content with a lot of bugs, missing speed limits on the HUD on certain routes. Needs more advanced features while operating a loco. The DLC's are overpiced You could get into a #rekt stiulation where your loco can derail, game will end if on a passenger train and then you get thrown a game over message stating that the doors are still open after the loading is done, or running out of water on a steam loco when in a good amount. Most DLCs would only come with a few scenarios but there's scenarios you can download from the workshop to explore more of the particular route or loco.",

The devs need to make either a major update to it, or make sure TS2015 isn't anything like this game is (which I doubt, considering what I constantly read about this game)   -Long version: I bought the game on the summer sale, since I had kept an eye on it for quite some time, and even though I have ~60h of playtime at the time of writing this, I actually have more that 200h of playtime but not on my steam account. Anyway, I bought it mainly because of the editor - the whole google maps overlay, the SRTM terrain data you can use and the tools the editor has alow to make incredibly accurate routes with overall very good detail. That is if the game didn't crash randomly so often. I have lost hours of content due to it not being saved and the game crashing. To counter this I started saving my route every 20-40minutes, but today, after the 4th or 5th crash for the day of the game all my layout's track had disappeared, which made me absolutely mad. Hours of my work was gone! Now, before someone says I'm doing a 'rage review' or something I want to say that that was just the tip of the iceberg, which made me write this. The game is completely unstable and unoptimised and the lag spikes I get are even more often than the crashes. Yes, I could have done a backup file, but that is no excuse for a game to be this broken!!

Well the next day it worked for me and so far it's working fine. Which is good but they fall short on other things. For an example the in game tutorials to teach one how to drive a train and learn everything else that goes into driving the train. I have been noticing a lot of the tutorials seem to cut short and don't even give you a chance to finish doing the last step and it automatically congrats you and ends it. They could easilly add train chatter into the game making it even more realistic. Like you're heading into a yard and need to find which track the yardman wants you to dump off your cars instead of just having text or when you ask permission to let you through you could have a voice asking permission instead of having silence. The graphics are nice and the details and the physics of each train and their variables are good. They have major potential and I hope the developers do listen to the fans because the game does have strong potential. But so far it seems that the developers are really missing the point with the rail fans and if they continue to not listen it'll be like shooting themselves in their own foot.

The New York to New Haven route (one of the newest) is the worst in my opinion:   * Weird whooshing sounds make it sound like there's a 50 mph wind outside of a standing still train in Penn station.   * Weird camera jolting gimmickery to try and simulate the slack in the cars when accelerating and decelerating. It's only present on trains on this route and is highly annoying. I wish there was a way to turn it off.  * Speed changes stacked on top of each other so you can't read them Then there's the LA to San Diego route that shows land in the middle of what is possibly the worst reincarnation of an ocean I've seen period.   Point being, if you bought this during a steam sale and play this game only a couple of times a month you'll be able to look past its blemishes.

Before some updates the game was loading okay. No errors at all. This game is a joke, the developers won't do ♥♥♥♥ to fix the game even when they know there are errors. Instead they only make overpriced DLC and Re-Make games instead of creating them theirselfs.  Examples:   Train Simulator 2015  is a remake of Rail Simulator developed by Kuju Entertainment with only some basic updates to the engine, The routes that are in Train Simulator 2015 are old routes from the 2007 game Rail Simulator so they bascily screw you calling it 2015.   Flight Simulator X : Steam Edtion  is another bad remake, they fixed the multiplayer but still the ATC Voice Lags. They added some fixes to the FSX.CFG (config file). But if you ask me i don't see any improvement, they have not updated the graphics or changed the textures. The only thing they do now is creating over-priced DLC or selling 7 year old textures from an other developer. I had to buy for $300 of Mods &amp; Addons on Flight Sim Community sites to make Flight Simulator X : Steam Edition Realistic. Addons like ORBX and REX 4 Texture Direct.  I think there is plenty more to say about Dovetail Games, but when it comes to customer experience they suck at it.  The game is good if you ask me, but because of the game-crashes i say DONT BUY IT.

However, Dovetail Games seems to have forgotten about price in the marketing mix. £25 is what a DLC might well be worth to the devs, but it damn well isn't to most of us.  I have spent amounts of money and time with this game and come to the conclusion that it is pretty well made. It is a mostly working game. You get nicely modelled trains with pretty accurate routes, each uniquely made. I do find though, dovetail games disrespects its role for Rail Fans. Nothing comes close to the detail, but again, nothing comes close to the price. There are quite a few glitches, bugs and general annoyances with this game which could be easily spent time on and fixed, leading to an improved game and better product instead of churning DLC out at a phenomenal rate. I personally would really like to be able to get my hands on atleast a good chunk of the British Routes as i live in the UK.  I really don't like giving what could be such a promising game for every Rail Fan in this world a negative rating but the handling of this game by those who own it damages the experience that we should be getting.

I'm the kind of guy who learns the London underground map, who heads to the internet whenever I encountera new train, that sort of things :). I play train sims since about 7 years (i'm 15). About 4 years ago I bought rail simulator, then railworks 2 which became this game. I'ts the only real simulator out there so I'm kinda 'forced' to play it. Without further ado, the positive points: + The community, which produces magnificent quantities of free GOOD addons + The frequency of the dlc (steam) releases + Good graphics on certain trains and routes (but certainly not everything)  Now the bad things :  -The terrible optimisation. I own a decent custom pc ( I5 4570, 8GB RAM, SSD, AMD 7970 3GB GDDR5 GPU overclocked at 1150MHz) and with the game on ultra settings some routes have their fps drop at 27-30 fps ! For instance I run Watchdogs on ultra settings with sweetfx with no lag at all. -Most routes have poor graphics. Apart from london faversham, justtrains and some german routes it is almost unbelievable to have that lack of detail, low res buildings etc. -THE PRICE OF THE ADDONS! 30 euros for a FU**ING DLC! Seriously?! I understand that the game is not a huge thing like FSX but this is completely overpriced. The only way to have a correct value for money is to wait for sales and buy DLC packs at a correct price. -3 routes with the base game? Lol. See the preceding point. What are you supposed to do when you've played a few scenarios and free roam? Buy DLCs? Oh, wait, the complete collection cost 3000 euros (no joke). Does it mean that this is the price for the full game? I could almost afford someone to make my own sim with that amount of money ^^ -Last but not least, the game is a bit arcade so non train fans can enjoy the game, but this doesn't stick with the name train SIMULATOR. In the driver seat you can use -except for some trains- only like 5 things (including brake and throtle).  That's my review, and please be gentle with my rusty english I'm from France (:",

Despite many upgrades the has continued to be a constant drain on cash just to keep up with it. Poorly designed routes that are released with many bugs seem to be the norm, a constant grab for cash for rolling stock. The game has tremendous potential but never seems to quite get there. Boring runs from here to there. Lack of realistic work for trains, poor graphics for many earlier routes and so on. The main point here is Potential, it does have tremendous potential. One can only dream.  Updated:  I have left this review in place, but i have to be honest having a fresh and long look at the game i was wrong in many aspects. The game has been advanced in many ways and to be truthful i was quite wrong on many factors. I think good value for money, but like many others, some of the past routes are lacking in some respect or the other, but the past is the past and the new routes are quite exceptional. However i stick to my guns on rolling stock, needs to be addressed. Overall i like many others will be purchasing the new version and hopefuly many new versions to come.  Updated for 2016:  This review has been ongoing and with the release 2016 and having given it a fair bashing for a few days, my conlusions are most definately positive. For me the game has delivered and well worth the cost of purchasing it. I am sure with ongoing updates it will only improve. I have waffled on about potential well it is definately fulfilling a lot of that now. For me 7 or 8 out 10.",

Stil, for the $1 I paid on humble-bundle for TS2016, I guess the base game is still worth it and I can't say I didn't learn something about trains, but when the intro video advertising TS2017 stutters and every loading page is an ad for various addons, I would definitely advise caution.",

            "review_text": " This review will undergo changes and be updated throughout my experience of the game.   Train Simulator (2014 as of this review) is my guilty pleasure, most of my friends and colleagues always shake their heads and ask 'why?' when they discover that I play this game, but my answer is always the same, and that is 'I don't know why I like this game, I just do'. I like all kinds of game genres (if not all!), ranging from RTS to Adventure to FPS and recently, Simulators, so picking up the TS2014 Steam Edition during the last Steam Sale was, in my opinion, a good purchase.   The game itself is a very mixed bag. Is the game compelling?  Yes . Are the graphics impressive?  Yes . Is the game fun?  It can be . Is it worth it's money?  Not exactly .  Train Simulator  (RailSimulator.com)  has become very popular over the years for many different reasons, one of the main reasons is because it is the best at acheiving it's set goals, it is without question the best Rail Simulator available as of this day, unfortunately however the game is also very, very famous for how over-priced its content is, having a number of bugs (first game I ever played it crashed due-to an 'AI Error' which I was in no way responsible for, now I save frequently) and unresponsive / unhelpful developers (Dovetail Games). Please do note that I am a developer myself so I understand how much work, time and dedication it takes to put a product together and that there is always going to be a likelyhood of bugs and issues that have somehow been overlooked, but when people inform me of bugs in my products (even though they are free to download), I get right to the task of finding them and fixing them! These are some of the main things that drag this game down, on the review page you will have to scroll for a very, very long time before you come anywhere near a positive review and even then it's likely going to just be a negative review in disguise.   I am not a diehard train enthusiast, I never have been and I never will be, while I have always had my interests since I was younger I just simply don't care that much for trains like a lot of the people who play this game do; For example, I see people complaining that certain locomotives only use a one-tone horn rather than a two-tone horn like they do in reality, and that kind of thing simply doesn't bother me. While I imagine it is a very easy thing for the developers to change and update (they really should do just to please the die-hards) it is not something I will lose sleep over... ever... but if people have to pay disgustingly large prices for something, that something should at least be done properly, right? While I am not a big train enthusiast, I do have my interests, I have always liked the thought of taking up Freight Train Driving as a real-life career, which I believe was the main reason that drew my attention to Train Simulator. I do not regret buying this game, I actually really enjoy it, but for quite a number of reasons, I would not recommend it...  The main reason why I wouldn't recommend this game is because of how overpriced the DLC is. I am aware and as are most of the  intelligent  people that the DLC available isn't supposed to be something that you're meant to collect the entirety of, you're just meant to pick out the trains and the routes that you want for your collection, that's easy enough to understand, right? Well, even with that in mind, the DLC is  insultingly  overpriced. It has been stated hundreds if not thousands of times, but DTG just don't seem to listen. The overpriced DLC wouldn't be too much of a problem if the base game itself was a lot more than it is. A friend of mine contacted me when I wishlisted this game and told me something along the lines of  'It is a lot of fun, but the game itself is very much like a demo. Unless you have money for DLC, it will lose it's charm fast' , and she was absolutely right. The version I have is the Train Simulator 2014 Steam Edition, it comes with a reasonable amount of content, but for the set price they're asking for, it's simply not enough, with that note alone I suggest waiting till this game hits another sale before any of you even consider picking it up. One of the trains comes with some scenarios, but it requires a certain route to actually play said scenarios which, for some reason, doesn't come with the base game which is just ridiculous. You pay for a game, you get some game modes and tasks, but in order to play them with the specific vehicle, you need to buy the route for an outrageous cost. That is just a slap in the face.  In my case, this issue is with the ICE Trains, you need to download the Munich to Ausberg route in order to play the scenarios. This route should be included with the base game if the trains are!   Thankfully, I have a lot of self control, so even though there are some routes and packs that I would like to add to the game, I will not go out and buy them at their insultingly large price, but at least wait till a sale (a very generous sale!) before I even consider the posibility of buying the pack in question.  With that said however and overlooking some of the tedious bugs in the game (which by the way aren't  all  game breaking, just a minor annoyance in my opinion),  I do and will actually recommend this game overall . It is good at what it sets out to do, it feels real, the physics and simulation are excellent and even though some people complain about the graphics, I think they're excellent.  If you are not a die-hard train enthusiast and can overlook some small issues and incorrections like me but are interested in buying the game, you should, but don't buy it at it's full price under any circumstances until the developers take note of all the bugs (whether they are small or not!). Do not pay good money for something which is broken yet can be fixed, but simply won't be fixed. Unless you have a lot of money to burn, steer clear of the DLC content too until the sales hit or until the developers decide to stop trying to turn this game into a cash cow and show some long-overdue respect to their paying customers.",

I say 'unfortunately' because while there's loads of content (that's why it's the best imo) the developers, Dovetail Games, clearly prioritise quantity over quality and will happily overcharge you for unfinished or even unstable DLC. My advice for anyone interested in trains is buy one of the 'first class edition' collections during steam sales - these are great value for money.   Once you've bought the game you can however make it interesting and challenging as long as you get the right addons - avoid some of the standard DTG routes but look for the 'proffessional' locomotives. I only know about UK rail, so here are some examples of addons for the best British experience (there are others I may not know about): - London to Brighton line: comes with train sim UK edition and is a nice quality, stable(ish) interpretation of the UK's most congested railway, with some flexibility for scenario creation.  - WCML 'Over Shap' route by Krossrails, available from Steam: great quality route which provides a challenge and comes with the European assets pack in case you don't have it (you need it). Buying the class 390, Voyager 221 advanced and a commuter DMU such as the class 170 or 150 would mostly complete this route for modern day operations.  - Western Mainlines route from  JustTrains.net : the entire Great Western Mainline as far as Cardiff and Exeter, which is easily the best value for money of any UK route given the sheer length of track to play with, of pretty good quality. The 221 also fits here.   My general outlook on this sim is it's great thanks to its community. The only downside of the rich variety of realistic scenarios on the steam workshop is they often seem to require more DLC than you already have. The real opportunities for gameplay lie in the scenario editor and good third party developers, not just what you get with the game.",

Hands down this is the best train simulator out there. I am going to state that right now. If you are looking for the best, it's here. However, beware as this game can be very expensive. There is a ton of content, but almost all of it costs extra. You start out with only one or two routes, and a couple trains.   There are a few glitches in the game, mostly with the signal system on the tracks, however if your a train fan like I am, and don't mind the cost, I definitely recommend it to you. You can also build your own routes, however that can take a LOT of time, and I haven't really messed around with that.  It is also worth noting that some train interiors are more polished than others. I have around 20-25 locomotives, and some are very polished, others could use a few more buttons/features to interact with.  Rating:  Overall 7/10 Mechanics/Engine 10/10 for realism Graphics 10/10 Signaling System 6/10 (sometimes is great, other times not) Cost 6/10 (routes and trains are expensive, but they put a lot of work into them)  I recommend using an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller for easier controls. Alternativly you could buy the RailDriver train controller for $200 which I don't have, however it seems pretty cool.",

            "review_text": "Less than impressed.   Problems: 1)Runs choppy, constantly freezes in a 'Not Responding' lock up. It will eventually clear, but usually takes about 15-20 seconds.  2)CPU dependant. Running a 4 core 3.9GHz processor doesn't seem to matter to this game, it still won't run better than 'high' graphics setting (with the above mentioned choppiness). Not at all what I expect as I can run other (far more graphic intense games) at 'ultra' or max settings with ZERO frame skip and 'Not Responding' lock ups.  3)Base game includes so little content it's laughable. If you want anything remotely close to diversity in the Locomotive or rolling stock categories you will spend at least another $50 in add ons. If you want more routes than the base sets in each country region (you'll get maybe two or three routes in each region) you're looking to spend another $50-$75 in add ons. The software owners have gotten BEYOND greedy in their lust for profit on this one.  4)Load times. The game takes a fair amount of time to load each menu. Again, not what I'd expect running the rig I have.   If you are a diehard rail fan, maybe spending all the cash for a virtual rail setup is worth your time. If you have nothing but time to waste, letting menu screens, game screens, or mission complete screens load, maybe this is worth your time. For me, I was nothing but disappointed with my purchase. When I have the system resource monitor running on a seperate screen, as soon as I try to load the TS software, my core processing load jumps from ~2% to over 65%. If I try to design my own cargo manifest (god forbid, for a bit of variance to the three preset loadouts) the CPU processing load jumps to over 85%. . . . . that's a real high total load for the CPU I have. By comparison other games tend to max it out around 50%. I REALLY WISH the owners/designers/makers of this game would address the CPU dependency and try to incorporate a bit more GPU power. This seems this game/simulator/whatever they are shooting for has some solid potential to be an entertaining past time.   For reference, my computer set up: AMD Phenom II Quad Core 3.9GHz 16GB DDR3 2133 RAM 1TB Solid State HDD (6gb/s transfer speed, mobo matched transfer speeds) Windows7 (run on it's own, seperate 500GB HDD) NVIDIA GEforce Graphics Card 4GB (DDR3 RAM)  Again, most any other game I throw at it, to include Battlefront/COD/etc runs at max settings with no lag/skip/lock ups. To think this game does is laughable (and I'm being kind by saying that).    Until there are some solid improvements made, along with some realistic expectations as to what you can charge people for 'add ons', I don't think I'll invest anymore money into this franchise.   ",

Some routes you mostly sit back and watch the train go at full throttle the entire way while other routes you are constantly changing speeds, stopping at stations, etc.  I suggest you take a look at the DLC, research a route you might like, and buy one or two that fit how you would porefer to drive a train. Also do the same for locomotives. There are many fun locos for this game.  I suggest the horseshoe curve route DLC along with either the K4 steam locomotive, Sharknose diesel, or Baldwin Centipede loco.

The functions are great and there is a big selection of vanilla trains. With mods, you can get steam engines and maglevs and just about every train in beetween. Now for the gripes. This game does have its downsides. It crashes if you basically to anything to it and will crash randomly too. I open the game, then launch xsplit, and it crashes.

Train Simulator is somehow really captivating. Everything you do in a train has to be planned way in advance as trains need a lot of time to slow down and stop or get going. It's also super interesting to learn all the signs and what theys mean. I thought as trains drive on tracks, it could not be that hard. But when traffic gets denser, all the buttons you have to press and signs you have to really look out for, it's harder than driving a car in my opinion. And more lives depend on it. So in principal I'm enjoying this game. But the technology Train Simulator is built upon is so unexcusably outdated, it sucks out all the air of an otherwise nice game.  Tha graphics feel very outdated. For a game that is Train Simulator 2016, or Train Simulator 2017 and costs $40, this is unexcusable. It looks awful. Passengers and their walking animations look terrible. Every few seconds the game needs to reload assets like trees and houses. And every time an object pops up on the horizon, the game stutters. And objects pop up in great numbers every 30 seconds or so, so every 30 seconds you get a huge stutter party for about 5 seconds until all new objects on the horizon are loaded. This is especially nerve wrecking when you're in a tight situation and need to slow down because of a distant signal, as the game doesn't always accept inputs at that time.  I also disliked the tutorial. It's not been given any love. The tutorial explains what home signals, distant signals are and what they display, but you cannt try it out. The tutorial is over after the explanation text disappears. This I could also read in the manual, no need for a tutorial mission for that that takes a long time to load. And that's it! Tutorials do not show you how the PZB signalling system works, when you need to slow down, to what speed you need to slow down, and how you actually do it. You cannot practice. This is only described in the manual or I had to look some additional YouTube videos, that did a better job.  Then, you're driving. And you come to the first yellow distant light signal, where you're supposed to slow down. You make a tiny mistake as you're not familiar with the buttons you have to press and bang, emergency brake. And the game doesn't tell you what you did wrong. Did I forget to press SIFA? Was I too fast? What would have been the correct speed? Tell me, I don't know! The game just lets you alone with all those questions. Very bad for learning and I found it highly frustrating. So you start the mission from scratch, wait on the loading screen for 30 seconds or more (and I have quite a fast machine) and then you drive for 20 minutes, until you make the same error and need to start over.  So, however interesting and fun I think Train Simulator would be, the technical drawbacks, long loading times, stuttering all the time, old and unappealing graphics, and bad tutorials / help system / explanations make Train Simulator an unsatisfactory and frustrating game.",

The physics of the trains I have used so far ( only UK stuff ) have been surprisingly good and the various control and braking systems fitted to the different types do actually feel different. I have driven trains in real life ( only slowly on preserved lines ) and this Sim 'hits the spot' for me.  Stick to buying in the sales, avoid very early routes and stock unless they have been updated, and learn to use RWTools, an excellent donationware utility that gives you a lot more input into what and where you drive, keeping the DLC costs down by enabling stock to be substituted for stuff you already own.

This game has several large setbacks: 1) If you have a lower end computer, DON'T get this game. Even if your computer belongs in NASA, you will still experience large lag spikes due to the chunk based system this game uses for routes. The engine (the game engine, not the ones you operate) is really old and outdated. Thank god they're making a simulator that uses a better engine for this. 2) The DLC model is terrible. $40 for a route, $20 for a locomotive is the standard price for DLC in this game. Don't adjust your monitor; $40 a route, $20 a loco. Seriously. If you want to actually get your money's worth, WAIT FOR THE SALES. And 3) The simulations themselves. The quality in the DLC fluctuates more than Donald Trump's ideologies. THAT is an accomplishment in itself. As a rule of thumb, if DTG made it, don't expect a large amount of quality. If you want an actual simulation and not a toy, look to the Pro range thing they have. There are some good pieces in there. 'SMEAGOL!!', you may ask.

Almost all my DLCs were bought for half price and trust me, I don't have only few..;) Pros: - Still best physics on the market - Some DLCs have nice graphics and plenty of features - more and more routes, locos etc. - active and helpful community  Cons: - sounds!!!..:( the game still has that crappy old sounds in default (some DLC sounds much much better) - older DLCs veren't fixed or upgraded, I still own few years old BNSF SD70MAC without headlights and working cab!!! :( - why we are still forced to pay for same things twice? I own Sherman Hill, I'm interested mainly in US railroads, i don't like UK trains, so why the hell DTG forcing me to buy whole TS2016 when my game was upgraded for free? If I'm interested only in Gas Turbine and upadted SH route. I payed full price for SH route so it should be upgraded for free, and Gas Turbine DLC only simply can't cost 30 euros..:( This marketing strategy makes me really upset.:( It's not fair to force long time users to pay more.",

Seriously, this game has the most DLC out of every game I've ever seen, including Evolve.  The gameplay is still fun, even if it's a little sparse on world details sometimes. The graphics aren't good and the optimization is horrid. That said, it is still loads of fun. Free Roam can mean hours of lining up the biggest train ever and attaching four engines to it, only to plow into the buffers at the end of the line!  Through DLC you can even drive engines found in the Thomas the Tank Engine television series now known as Thomas &amp; Friends. I've managed to pick up Thomas and Oliver with James and Henry being standard with the base game. Duck, Diesel, Mavis, Salty, and the Scottish Twins are also available.  Pros:  - Casual simulator that is fun to play with.  - Thomas the Tank Engine character engines are available.  - Free Roam is a lot of fun.  - Driving through the European countryside, however poorly rendered, is pretty fantastic.  - Thomas Simulator!!!  - Updates to newest version for free annually.  Cons:  - Graphics are abysmal.  - Optimization is laughable.  - Even in Free Roam, you are limited to where you can go.  - Switching points is the buggiest aspect of the game. I hit the end of the line because I couldn't get the points to switch.  - Loading Screens are plentiful and jarring.  - DLC is overpriced for reskinned engines.  Regardless of the glaring flaws, I do recommend this game. Pick it up on Steam Sale.",

Each of career missions is an exercise in psychomasochism. If you go over the speed limit by so much as 1 MPH, you will be docked points. If you're not on time by a few minutes (probably because you were going slow so as not to go over the speed limit), you will be docked points. Even the shortest, easiest mission, has you driving a train that will automatically put on the emergency break (which, by the way docks you points if its used at all) if you go over not the speed limit listed on your HUD, but on the dashboard of the actual train. But, here's the kicker, the mission doesn't tell you that's how the train works. You're just supposed to somehow know. Either I'm just terrible at this game (more than likely), or this game is, as I said, unforgiving, cruel, and heartless.  At least the non-career quick drive mode is kind of fun. It's at least less stressful. Watching the poorly-rendered scenery run by while you try to keep your train from derailing is kind of nice. And you can build all sorts of consists and lengths with different locomotives. Which would be nice if most of the trains and routes weren't locked behind $20 paywalls.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game when its on sale if you want it that badly. Don't buy this game if you don't like trains or have no patience. Otherwise, I give this game a 10/10, harder than Dark Souls.",

I have tried so many others over the years, but this is the best. I just wish that the DLCs weren't so expensive... I love the freight DLCs but wished they covered more destinations and routes.

There are four seasons to choose from on each route and each season only has two possible weather themes: great, poor. And when you chose a train, there is only one or two routes you can drive that train on.  This is a fun game at first. But, for the reasons above, it gets very bland very fast.

Going back on the content, the developer's have the detail somewhat on point but i feel that they make the routes short to get it out quickly or because of frame rate issues, i just dont feel satified with recent purchases and i really hope they go back to the day's where they made the WCML because that felt complete. overall i enjoy this to pass the time and i hope the wait for trains in Australia being made happen's for the better of this simulation go outside the box, because what you are doing now wont cut it for the long term.   PS. Another problem i keep having is this save dump file jazz, like i am creating a free roam senario and then it finds a reason to crash. now i will put up with it because besides the issues i love the game, but the developer's should fix this as it seems to happen more recently then previously.   i cannot express more that this is a good game besides the crashes and overall content, i want to give it a good review but i dont see the community getting what they are asking for anytime soon.",

Now I got nothing against DLC as long as its priced well, But the total cost of £3,430.30 for all the DLC is just silly, Even more so considering it looks like a game from 10 years ago, Even maxed out it looks terrible, everything looks flat and lacks any sort of fine detail.

            "review_text": "I could sum this sim up in two words -- with many more to follow :) -- Amazing and Aggravating. It amazes me that devs who triumph on detailing trains (some more than others) and environments, are also derailing on vital areas.  E.g.... During 'Arrival of the Thunderheads' the speed limit drops *without warning* from 45 to 20, then shortly afterward posts a speed limit of 35 below the HUD, but the limit in the HUD remains at 20. The unsuspecting driver is then penalized for speeding for anything above 20.9 mph. Another example: in the Canadian Mountain scenarios, if I overshoot a switching point in a trainyard, my loco won't stop unless I reverse the engine while in forward motion, or apply the emergency brake (which requires an additional minute to recover from). Another time, the control tower radioed me that they were putting me on a siding to allow another train to pass, but when I got there the switch wasn't thrown.  This is incredibly aggravating for anal people like me who strive for gold star performances. So the key is... Save often! (But only your latest save is retained). Do this especially when approching signals or switches. However, when I resumed the Thunderheads scenario, the stormy weather I was experiencing vanished.  When the scenarios aren't broken, I enjoy Train Simulator 2015 VERY much. Driving the Challenger through Sherman Hill is incredible, as are many other trips. The mixed reviews are perfect. In my humble observations, the devs seem more focused on us spending great deals of money on new scenarios and locos than on fixing the faulty ones. Don't they play test these things?! But as you see, I still recommend it -- on sale.",

I run this program on pretty much a standard laptop so I have not been able to play the scenarios with high detail but I have loaded a scenario under these conditions and know that the overall display quality is good.  The biggest problem with this game is the cost of the DLC which is very overpriced. Some models are repackaged again and again and again with no real noticeable improvements . My opinion if you buy the base locomotive, things like sounds &amp; cabviews etc should all be common and upgradeable as new soundsets / features become available. Variation detail you want (i.e livery) should be available as a further add-on. This would improve the value of the game.   Personally i would not object to buying improved soundsets / cabviews or whatever up-rate was available as developments came along (some are well overdue as well in my opinion see deltic below), but you end up having to buy more than one route or locomotive to get the locos you want to create interesting scenarios. This has probably got to be a bit counterproductive to overall gameplay / CPU / graphics requirements. For example I own 2 versions of the 101DMU just to get the livery variations. There's more examples of this 'value' I could list...  To go a negative stage further.... Some repackaged versions of the models (eg class 45 originally produced from external developer) are better quality than the current downloadable versions which have obvious and serious errors in some instances.   Further locomotive example: Class 55 Deltic 1) Green Versions of the locomotive DID NOT HAVE PLATED HEADCODE BOXES (other the 55002 - but the livery is wrong for KOYLI - (Class 50 also appears in BR 2 tone green - a livery which the class never carried) 2) Soundset is awful - No lovely Napier noise here!! It drives like a bus until until 15 mph, you get a phase and then sound is heavy and only vaguely right - No where near as good a sound as I have heard from an external purchase (IHH which no longer exists) 3) Physics feel poor for this locomotive. If you open out the power handle to the Amp limit and she races away, amps fall away too quickly  I avoid driving scenarios with this Deltic (my favourite class) for these reasons....  A further problem with the loco is you can only get BR Blue lated headcode version as an undrivable model in yet another pack)   :(   I mean this is a classic locomotive that has not been improved since day 1. Sad, but true...    Moving onto writing your own scenarios (which I love) - Can be extremely frustrating and no where near as intuitive as you would hope (controlling the old microsoft train simulator was far easier for example). Some times your nicely planned scenario works as you develop it - save it and come back and somethings can have gone wrong... Its often something simple and sometime locomotives take odd routes for no obvious reason.... get ready for some intense frustration if you aim to replicate anything vaguely interesting!!  Despite ALL OF THIS this game is worth buying and the community provides lots of good scenarios but my advice is only buy downloadable content during sales, and try to stick to as few a routes as possible...

I don't have any dlc yet (Just trying it out) but I am considering playing this game more it has good graphics, good play style (not for everyone though) , smooth controls, also it has a learning curve which is fun imo to try and figure out. over all 8.5 out of 10 stars, because it has a frame rate issue I am running the game on max settings, but I have a gtx titan x water cooled and a I7 6 core processor at 4.1ghz and 16gb of ddr4 ram so it should be fine but sometimes I drop to 30 frames. :(",

On my i5 6600k @ 4.3 Ghz with GTX 980 TI I was only getting between 15-45 FPS. Constant up and down frame rates and stutters. And the scnerarios themselves were quite aweful. The biggest issue being impossible timeltables to keep. It was very frustrating.  But then I decided to give it another try and get one of the new DLC packs. It made all the difference in the world. The scenery, performance, and scenarios were all great. I get between 85-95 FPS.   The best way to think of Train Simulator is that it's just the software that runs the engine. The real simulator lies within the multitude of DLC's available. Do your research well because they vary in quality. Older scenarios tend to have poorer visuals and poorer performance. Whereas newer scenarios tend to look and perform better. At least as far as I can tell.",

Getting the New York- New Haven Route is pretty cool, the Amtrak Acela, ACS-64, HHP-8 or what ever it's called, the Metro North M8, and the P32 'Genesis', all those trains are compatible with the route.   I can not deny that when I first learned the controls, I would speed and attempt to derail the train...aside from fooling around it does help you understand how trains work...sort of. It's honestly not worth the retail price, but when it's on sale be sure to get a copy.   Pros: -Good game -somewhat educational -FUN??? -derailments...  Cons: -The scaling is literally too true to real life so you would probably sit there for hours if you choose a long route -DLC cost a $#!+ load (wait sales)  - Upgrades to computer maybe required  Overall great game, recommended on some levels...👍🏼",

You only have 6 trains and two locations to choose from with the Standard Edition.  4. No free roam. AT ALL.  5. No multiplayer.  6. All of the DLC is from $3,500.00 to $5,000.00  And to top it all off, one of my best friends bought this for me as a GIFT for me and of course, the trains are between $8.00 to $30.00, on average; $20.00!

            "review_text": "Early days but not so impressed with 'premium edition'.  The 'Academy' is quite poor - repetitive short scenarios which fail to properly explain controls, etc. The Academy contains only the most basic of instruction, no info that I saw on how to access various in-game menus etc., which I found later by pressing buttons to see what did what. The 4 included routes seem to conatin no tutorial missions. Nothing in the Academy, for example, explains how to properly use the dyamnic braking system. This is just one example; there are many things not explained. I've had several other rail sims in the past and even done some training as a fireman on real setam locos, so I'm not exactly a complete novice where it comes to trains - even so, finding it hard to control the trains reliably. There may be scope to adjust the control sensitivty, for example, which would no doubt help.   Career missions rated 'easy' are, notwithstanding the rating, annoyingly easy to fail completely. Examples include tight timing which has to be achieved or the mission fails - if you don't travel at or very near the maximum allowed speed you will be late and get penalties. No doubt that will improve with practice. It is possible to set up a 'quick drive' in which you have no goals, so one can learn to drive the trains like that, but better tutorial missions or a better 'Academy' which teaches more, rather being so reptitive, would give the novice player a better chance fo succeeding.   So far the game is tolerably reliable. The career screen, where you select route and scenario can be infuriating - I have yet to really determine how to reliably select the add-on package I want, it seems to reset them more or less at random. I've no doubt there's asome logic to it, but like the operation of the trains, it's not really explained. Nor did I find the 'manual' button did anything. I don't know if Steam installed manuals, but if it did the game doesn't open them.  I have experienced one crash to desktop, which I don't expect from such supposedly high end software - this was during a tutorial from the 'Sherman Hill' add-on; which does at least HAVE two tutorials, unlike the add-ons included in the 'premium' package. Of course, that add-on costs additional money, which doesn't bother me too much, but kind of makes me wish I'd gone for the basic game and then chosen add-ons I wanted.   With all that said, the actual graphics and simulation are pretty good. I have no real beef on that score, although the frame rate suffers a bit on my fairly high-end (Nvidia GTX960 4GB graphics, 8-core Athlon, 16GB main ram ) machine, when there is a lot of detail to draw, such as on the NJ lines with overhead wires and many tracks. I did have the graphics quality set to 'high', though. I couldn't see what the 'custom' graphics setting does - I was expecting a dialog to set individual parameters, but none appeared - so that I suppose is another issue.   Altogether, although the graphics and simulation seem decent, the game doesn't feel as good as I hoped it would, and in all honesty doesn't really feel like a polished, finished product. It's to be hoped that it will continue to be worked on and get better.  This review thing won't let me be non-committal on whether I recommend it. I suppose, if you like rail sims, I do: at least some of the issues will go away with further practice and more fiddlin' to see what does what. That said, if I were a complete novice at driving trains, I suspect I would by now be abandoning it. It would be better, rather than yes/no (or in addition to, maybe) if we coudl rate out of 5 or 10.",

Buy this game, and the routes, but be careful which trains you buy if you want to enjoy driving them. Some haven't been updated for many years and don't even have rain and lighting effects. If you're only buying trains to use as AI, the ones on steam are not a problem.  There are a few quality ones, but the best ones are sold on developer sites outside of steam.",

I passed out halfway through the install of 'Train Simulator 2013' and slipped into a deep sleep where I had dreams of being a train. It was a surreal experience, one that included driving forwards and occasionally backwards.   I found myself among a great number of other trains, it was a clan led by a single elder train. They accepted me, and after what felt like years, I had worked my way up through the clan and gained the trust of the Elder Locomotive. He visited me and asked if I would share in a dangerous adventure. Long story short, we rid the tracks of all the unruly cattle and reclaimed the holy junction. When it was over we had lost a great number of trains, but the elder granted me one wish. He said that I could ask for anything in return for my gracious devotion to the clan. I asked of him one thing, if I may return to the plane of mortals where I could forever live the rest of my days. He honked his horn and said one thing I will never forget, 'CHOO CHOO ♥♥♥♥♥'.  I immediately awoke from this beautiful experience, and found myself in front of my computer I returned to my steam library to notice that I had only played for 30 minutes while unconscious.   (Time in the mortal plane had slowed when I was in the locomotive plane... Kinda like Narnia).  So yeah... Pretty cool game, wouldn't pay full price for it, actually I probably wouldn't even recommend buying it unless you really like simulators... It's a pretty average... Not sure why I'm even recommending this game.  3/10 game - Would trip balls again",

Just show a sweet honey your Train Simulator purchase history and your in fur shur. You could buy a gaming PC for the price of all the DLC combined, but thats what a nerd would do. WAIT, whats that mods?

Shadows apply to some North American locomotives &amp; rolling stock, and to others it doesn't, which can be sort of annoying. Also there are often several lighting errors on some routes. It's a good game all in all, but physics are also kind of messed up. There are some positives, though. Most problems I find with it can be overlooked and ignored. But yeah, it's still a good game, in my opinion. Donner Pass is probably one of my favorite maps, it's well detailed. I'd love to see all the maps have as much detail and effort put into them as this map had put into it. This is just my opinions, but some of the maps are somewhat lacking. Also, the create a map option isn't all that user-friendly, it's hard to get switches working, even after you turn on all the right settings. And for me, switches are a HUGE part of map making. Overall, this may sound like a somewhat negative review, and to some extent it is. However, I still enjoy playing this game quite a bit. Probably because I've invested so much time into playing it. Like I said earlier, these are my opinions. This is my first review, so things are quite jumbled, I know. I'm trying to improve in that area. Hopefully this review was somewhat helpful.",

I bought the Cajon Pass route and took a Union Pacific SD60M up the pass on a quick drive scenario and guess what? My train didn't have enough power to get up the pass so it rolled down the hill and I failed.

The routes are amazingly detailed, and true to life. I would like to see more new features in later releases rather than just a rebranding (I'm looking at you, TS 2014), and perhaps an easier to use route builder would be handy (seriously, I've tried to make a route many times, I just cannot get my head around the builder).   If you're a railroad enthusiast this really is the simulator for you, it beats any competitor hands down on realism.

Ive worked for the transit system as a Bus operator in the past and I was told by Train operators on the job at the time that this was as close as you would get to a real thing. And in a word its true. In todays world if you have noticed even pc flight sims are almost invisible at the gaming stores for the same reason, there are those who would use this to do harm. That being said if its just because you would love to know what it would be like to be a Train operator, then you will love this sim. I love trains and this is a very calm and satisfying sim. If your a call of duty type of person dont buy this. But if you want a true to life sim like Euro truck simulator or DLS World flight sim then you will enjoy this sim.

The slightest distraction: text message, wife wanting you or a knock at the door, is often enough to ruin a good drive. Graphically it is fairly attractive but the games engine is not one of the most recent so don't expect Crysis levels of vegetation. The loco's are good to great depending on when the DLC was created. Obviously the more recent releases tend to have the greater detail. Sound: To me it all sounds great. To committed railway heads, apparently it isn't.  The game does have it's glitches. De-coupling and points can sometimes stick. In shunting scenario's this can be infuriating. As I downloaded this from steam there was no boxed manual. You can download it and I would recommend doing this. The standard drives tend to have the training built into them for the various loco's you meet, not that it tells you this and the official training is actually limited leaving you scratching your head quite often. Only later do you find the stuff you need in amongst the standards. Also beware of spending too much on the DLC. There is rather a lot and it is not cheap. Overall: If you put the effort into the game you will reap the rewards.",

The sim itself is already pretty expensive but to be expected to pay that price over and over and over just to pick up enough extra engines and stock to fill it out to where it ought to be is sad. The ONLY way to buy this is when it is on sale, otherwise you are going to pay around or over $200 just to get what should sell for $40 or so retail. What you get in the base package is not much at all.  That said, I am revising my review up a little because they have been fixing some of the glaring issues with some of the DLC so it is getting better, but it's still even worse than the flight simulator world where you have to buy scenery and airplanes separately to fill out the experience. But with those packages, they really do fill out the experience.  And now there is Train Simulator 2017 with still no mention of VR support. I suppose this title will continue to gather dust. It's OK, but not what it could be if VR support was added. I can only imagine what it would be like to look out over a freight yard in VR, see everything in full scale, have other trains pass within feet of your own, see the giant size and perspective of a 4-8-8-4 or any of the other big iron, etc. Yep, I can only imagine it because it's not available.  Trains are big and impressive and the cabs are just about perfect size for use with the HTC Vive. Not quite room scale but enough where you could set up a stool or tall chair, lean out the window, and hit the rails. Why is this not in Train Simulator 2017?  I'm qualified recommending this now thanks to the fixes but it still is expensive and really, really needs VR. Why watch a train when you can virtually drive one from the engineer's seat in full scale?",

Now I hear it's gotten worse and worse in quality and realism...not to mention more DLC. So just between you and me, if you want to drive trains I'd look elsewhere if I were you.  The 'EXTREME TRAIN OF DUTY' aesthetic they're going with for TS2016 is hilarious, at least. Still not worth a purchase.",

I do think dovetail have turned the game around. Also, great community and twitch live stream (Matt Peddlesden) with Trainsimlive and youtube.",
