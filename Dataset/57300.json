In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by... except Amnesia. Why? Because in this game, I am powerless. I cannot fight back. Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc.; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits. Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them. But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction. Those creepers waiting to pop-out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though... My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does. Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12.",

            "review_text": "The game that will make you crap your pants. At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.  The Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.  if you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by. Many people said this game set the bar for Horror Games to a new high, rightly so. If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.  There are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.  5/5, by any means. If you're a Horror fan and you haven't played/heard of this game yet, you shou-... MUST give this game a try.",

            "review_text": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that only comes around once all of the planets in our solar system align perfectly - which, is to say, never. But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first-person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first-person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit.   ... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia - there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.  It's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.",

The puzzle dynamics are a little quirky in places and can be misleading but overall they are straightforward and easy to solve. There’s no combat so all you can do when confronted with an adversary is to run and/or hide but it serves to heighten the effect of how helpless you are when subject to these supernatural forces beyond your grasp. The audio and art design are well suited to one another and deliver an excellent environment for feeling the dread of the unknown as you thread further into the depths where your destiny awaits. So fear or no fear… this game deserves mustering enough chutzpah, guts, gumption and whatever else you got to spare in order to play.",

No cutscenes though... -...except the flashbacks, which are total pain in the ♥♥♥ when you replay the main story ±Custom stories gave this game almost infinite amount of content (even though the quality of them is highly varied :P) -Has some tedious parts -The game loses a bit of its scariness every time you die -The AI doesn't exist: the monsters are programmed to patrol for short time somewhere for a couple of minutes before they vanish completely. If you are spotted, they will chase you for couple of seconds and lose their interest at the same second they don't see you anymore. If you get killed by one of them, the same monster will never respawn again. -Performance scales from very good to very bad. Most of the time I get solid 60fps, but in some large areas I get some very annoying drops. Mostly lag spikes fortunately, nothing gamebreaking  In conclusion this is a very solid horror game that has some truly freaky moments. The main story alone doesn't last for too many playthroughs, but fortunately there is still an active mod community. I'd recommend to download at least Study of insanity and Black forest castle. If you like this you should also try Penumbra series and AVOID amnesia a machine for pigs! Be sure to play in dark room with good headphones and low gamma settings :)",

Beside a haunted castle it is very unique in that respect. Although it isnt very scarry at all in my opinion, it is a good game for other reasons. Namly the story and the puzzles.  To adress the horror aspect: It was unnerving, i wouldent say scarry at the begining. The phantom screams and creaking could get to you, yet after a while you realized there was nothing there. So, imo it is a sespencful puzzle game with a very good story, that is not given to you directly. You slowly aquire it via voice acted notes, that let you come to your own conclutions about what really happened. Would recomend to anyone who enjoys puzzles and a spooky story.",

Just as I believe the creators of Amnesia wanted, the game was atmospheric and compelling from start to finish. What I have in high regard about this game is the use of wit to survive rather than fighting skills, alongside it's several small puzzles and memory trips that added to the game. As for the actual gameplay itself, the entirety of the game ran smoothly and was more than easy to get to grips with, although I was stupid and didn't actually realise you could sprint until over halfway through the game (its Shift + W by the way.) On the contrary, the only thing I'd personally alter about this game is the detail of the storyline and lack of interaction. I'm aware that the isolation of the games main character is what adds to the atmosphere, but some kind of interaction would've made the storyline a lot more interesting for me, rather than a dozen flashbacks and lengthy notes/diaries. As a person who enjoys progression in a game a lot more than having to read long-winded notes and excerpts, I feel as though this would've been what could of made the game for me, but that's a matter of opinion. Either way, the storyline is easy enough to understand without reading a single note anyways, which is a good plus to the game. I found that generally, Amnesia's story was somewhat fascinating and original, but the normal ending that I had experienced was a little disappointing after 11 hours of gameplay and not as intense as I'd of expected. Whilst a few things let me down within the game, these are all minor/opinions, and there is nothing legitimate at fault. I'd recommend this game as a must-play for any horror fan to try out at least once.",

There's never been a single player game I enjoyed as much as I have enjoyed Amnesia. The story is well done, the scares are placed and done thoughtfully, and the enviroment is so vast, even when the game takes place inside a single castle.   I love the heart that was put into the game, the voice acting is wonderful and the creatures are frightening. Even now, with 52 hours on record, I can still jump into the game and get chills and thrills from it.   And that was without including the in depth Custom Stories, where fans or developers can create their own wonderful horror story with the provided assets of Amnesia. So much creativity and scares, and even humor, has come from the community stories to where there is no end to the game. You can keep playing Amnesia, and experience a unique and creative take on the world a hundred times over.   I love this game. It has a place in my heart as one of my favorite games of all time, and I will never stop reccommending this game.",

            "review_text": "The infamous Amnesia. Driven by a dark and twisted storyline, backed by a soundtrack that is bound to give you the chills, Amnesia is everything you could ask for in a horror game.  Introduction: Amnesia is a first person survival horror game set in a dark and mysterious castle environment. The plot takes place in 1893 where a young man from London, Daniel, finds himself awakened in the great halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with no recollections of himself, his past or his current purpose. The only objects that guide Daniel in his journey are hand-written notes that he has written to himself, such as the one he finds in the beginning of the game.   Controls and Gameplay: The most powerful feature in the game is the absence of items, such as weapons and armor. You are alone and defenseless. Only equipped with a lantern, run by a limited supply of fuel, your goal is to explore and uncover the dark secrets of castle Brenneburg. This is a core feature of the game, as it makes your journey through the castle perilous and terrifying.  Aside from the traditional health bar, your character has a sanity meter. Sanity is reduced if you spend too much time in the dark, and loss of sanity will progressively make your screen indistinct and blurry.   Puzzles and other obstructions are also present in the game. They are, however, not difficult and are sometimes a more than welcome 'time-out' in the intense horror, while at other times they participate in making the game more hectic and intense.   In terms of control, they are working as intended and do not obstruct the player in his quest through the dark.  Graphics: The graphics in the game are slightly dated. This is not a huge minus, as the graphics actually enhance the intense sensation of dread that is omnipresent in the game.   Sound: The soundtrack subliminally emphasizes the mood of the game. It intensifies frightening moments and sooths you in safe zones. It sometimes disappears completely, leaving your character's frantically beating heart as the only sound...  Replayability: As a consequence of the game's linear storyline, multiple playthroughs are not of interest. Once you have played through the game once, you have seen most of the content there is.   Conclusion: Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a unique first person horror game driven by its compelling story and simple gameplay. Experience the intense and thrilling game equipped with only a lantern and your courage and uncover the dark secrets of Castle Brennenburg.   Recommendable: 10/10",

It's good for a free horror game, yet some people think it's the scariest game ever, but it doesn't come close to Amnesia. Anyway, Amnesia scares you in so many ways. Not only are the enemies chasing you incredibly disturbing, there are lots of kind of less obvious, but incredibly scary, moments. Once I went into a room, saw a cage with a dead body in it hanging from the ceiling, and later when I returned to the room it was gone... The story is also very creepy if you pay attention to the notes you find. If you don't use an online guide, like me, the game will take you somewhere from 8-10 hours, but if you do use a guide then it shouldn't take longer than 5 or so. I actually liked their previous games, The Penumbra series, better than Amnesia in terms of gameplay, but Amnesia is much scarier.",

            "review_text": "Amnesia is probably one of my favourite games of all time and cetainly my favourite horror title of all time. The game itself plays very well and provides a very good atmosphere and mood. The enemies are always dangerous and always pose a threat to the player since you only have the capacity to outrun them over short distances and long distances will result in you being caught and likely killed. The games scare factor varies based on the player I myself didn't find it scary however it was tense and immersive and I enjoyed the experiece a lot. The games visuals are rather dated however, the lighting could use some touching up and some of the textures look as if they are from a very old game. However this didn't seem to ruin the immersion for me as its possible to interact with almost every object within the game world such a levers, candles, torches, barrels, crates and books to name a few, even those objects that aren't relevant are able to be interected with. This adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay as it gets the player thinking about what is needed to complete certain sections and puzzles within the game.  I was also quite impressed with the storyline and the way it was told as the notes system and being able to read into it by picking them up throughout the game allows for various interpretations of the story and also allows players to connect with it at their own pace.  The average amount of play time it takes to complete the game I feel is also worth it for the price as it is a very enjoyable time and can potentially be played through again dependent on the players view of the game.  This game also incorporates a few good mechanics such as the depleting lantern oil and insanity. This adds to the difficultly and fits in with it being in the survival horror genre. It could also signficantly alter the way some players move through the game. Overall: Fantastic, 90/100",

            "review_text": "The infamous Amnesia. Driven by a dark and twisted storyline, backed by a soundtrack that is bound to give you the chills, Amnesia is everything you could ask for in a horror game.  Introduction: Amnesia is a first person survival horror game set in a dark and mysterious castle environment. The plot takes place in 1893 where a young man from London, Daniel, finds himself awakened in the great halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with no recollections of himself, his past or his current purpose. The only objects that guide Daniel in his journey are hand-written notes that he has written to himself, such as the one he finds in the beginning of the game.   Controls and Gameplay: The most powerful feature in the game is the absence of items, such as weapons and armor. You are alone and defenseless. Only equipped with a lantern, run by a limited supply of fuel, your goal is to explore and uncover the dark secrets of castle Brenneburg. This is a core feature of the game, as it makes your journey through the castle perilous and terrifying.  Aside from the traditional health bar, your character has a sanity meter. Sanity is reduced if you spend too much time in the dark, and loss of sanity will progressively make your screen indistinct and blurry.   Puzzles and other obstructions are also present in the game. They are, however, not difficult and are sometimes a more than welcome 'time-out' in the intense horror, while at other times they participate in making the game more hectic and intense.   In terms of control, they are working as intended and do not obstruct the player in his quest through the dark.  Graphics: The graphics in the game are slightly dated. This is not a huge minus, as the graphics actually enhance the intense sensation of dread that is omnipresent in the game.   Sound: The soundtrack subliminally emphasizes the mood of the game. It intensifies frightening moments and sooths you in safe zones. It sometimes disappears completely, leaving your character's frantically beating heart as the only sound...  Replayability: As a consequence of the game's linear storyline, multiple playthroughs are not of interest. Once you have played through the game once, you have seen most of the content there is.   Conclusion: Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a unique first person horror game driven by its compelling story and simple gameplay. Experience the intense and thrilling game equipped with only a lantern and your courage and uncover the dark secrets of Castle Brennenburg.   Recommendable: 10/10",

Well you just come to the right place if you want to either ♥♥♥♥ your pants or learn a fascinating yet gory story. You wake up as Daniel and have no recolation as to where or how you got to where you are when waking up. As the story progresses (and I will try not to have any spoilers) you pick up notes and random journal entries that you had written before passing out and waking up in the beginning. As your memory gets better, you realize you had been working for an evil mastermind named Alexander who kidnapps victims and tortures them to be 'experiments'. Once found out this, you do whatever you can to stop Alexander. The rest is up to you to find out, besides everyone likes suprises.   Now, when playing this game I was scared within 10 minutes of playing because of the creepy music, random voices and noises, and of course visuals which I will not spoil. If you turn your sound off completely though, it doesn't phase me one bit. So basically, if you are chicken ♥♥♥♥ then you should turn off your sound so you can focus on the main objective instead of focusing on what pair of underwear you need to wash from playing this.   In all seriousness though, I would only reccomend someone who has a strong stomach since most of the game is quite gory and if dissassembled body parts freak you out then you shouldn't even be playing this game. I would like to add is that this game is medium length which I don't mind. I wish it was slightly longer but you can only do so much with a story and a horror game.   Something to also add, this game has medium to hard difficulty puzzles which some had taken me days to figure out. So if you are one to rush and add cheats to the game well you are out of luck buddy because there are no cheats except for walkthroughs on the game online, and you must have patience.   I would rate this game a 8/10 and reccomend anyone 16+   ",

Overall, this game is an endless cycle, it gives me a sense of adventure of wanting to experience what the game has to offer, but i don't want to explore in fear of what the game has to offer, all it takes is some courage to delve into a fascinating and terrifying experience.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to write a review for Amnesia for such a long time...   I remember that I started playing it with my boyfriend (playing on separate computers but trying to complete the game at the same time). It's not a graphic explicit game; the blood and violence from recent horror games can't compete with the soundtrack and audio effects of Amnesia (the wind hitting the glass windows, the sound of the damn monster aproaching you and hearing your character heavily breathing while the sanity is getting low). These combined with the horror but rather exciting atmosphere made it hard for me to keep up with my boyfriend throughout the whole game. I found myself terrified from the very first minutes and scared to even move around.  'What did I just hear? Was that the sound of a monster? Oh God, is he coming? Don't look behind that damn corner!' I was too scared to play but too intrigued to quit + that if you have good headphones you get cold shivers down the spine.  There is also some sort of psychology behind the fear that this games spreads because you find yourself illustrated as Daniel, a guy who does not (and can not) carry a gun or fight the shadows that follow him. All you can do is run, hide, observe and eventually try to escape but even without wanting you will start being emotionally involved with every note and clue that you find. The story is beautiful and shocking, it becomes more than just a video game. The disturbing environment, the rooms and the darkness... it feels like you explore inside of the main character's soul.   It's a piece of art and probably the best horror game that I ever played, the only one that managed to keep me in front of the screen without jump scares and without too much blood. I strongly recommend it, it's something that everyone in love with video games has to play. I had difficulties sleeping a few weeks after finishing it, but that was because of the open ending that left me thinking and made me question stuff about humanity and life, because yes, it is more than just a horror game. It was made by people with brilliant minds and I consider it an inspiration as long as it makes you question yourself even after finishing the game.",

            "review_text": "'My name is...I am...Daniel'.  Just wanted to kick off this review using the generic technique of quoting the game.  After being surrounded by a group of passionate gamers for the majority of my ongoing teenage life, the one name that kept popping up was 'Amnesia'. Youtube; flooding with gameplay of this mysterious title began to draw my attention. Its a game that gets around and has made quite a name for itself, rightly so - Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the most gripping, puzzling and horrifying experiences I have ever confronted; and I say confront because this games needs to be confronted, not played. I'll get this out of the way now, this is a First-Person Horror Adventure game, with elements of puzzle and survival, I would say Horror-Survival, but this is an adventure, by far.  WARNING: This article DOES contain some mild spoilers.  TDD is set in 1799, you take on the role of Daniel, a young man who's found himself inside the belly of a ghostly castle. The moment you are brought into the game you are greeted by a brilliant atmosphere, which lasts throughout the entire game, complete with ambient sound effects, enough light to look around, and a few rooms to find your way around the controls. This allows newbies to get a feel for the game first, to play around with controls and to explore a little bit. The controls in this game are fairly simple, and there's nothing that isn't needed or not included.   There's the basic WASD movement, there's a lean feature, which helps peak around corners and explore creaks and crannies. But what truly felt authentic about this game is the how you control the mouse, and what part it plays in the game's mechanics. The majority of doors, objects and drawers can be opened, closed, pushed and pulled all at the movement of the mouse. Want to slowly pull a door open a millimeter without making any sound and hope that a lumbering gammon monster doesn't take a bite out of your face? Click on the door and gently pull your mouse in the same motion as you would slowly opening a door a millimeter without making any sound? Pull your mouse back in that careful motion, want to desperately drag a large crate in front of a suspicious door? Click on that crate, and pull with all your virtual might. This is a point for immersion, and there are many more to come.  As you progress through castle Brennenberg, you slowly begin to unfold the story and characters with help from the flashback-like narration, and several notes found around the castle, this is such a great way to unfold the story as you do it yourself. By entering special places, diaries will be found flashbacks will occur, hallucinations will taunt and sounds of your past self talking being to alert you of the darkness this castle has to reveal (not a pun on the incessant lack of light in this game, but that's one of the prime features). For the first few parts of this fairly short-ish game, it's mostly an exploration, puzzle point and click.   But, despite not having any direct horror, you're constantly on edge. The ambient sounds and vibe keep you frequently checking over your shoulder, you are never safe in this game. This leads me onto my next love of this game. You are defenseless. What's that? Defenseless? A horror-survival FPS with no weapons? Damn right. In this, you've got nothing but your handy lantern, which runs of scarce amounts of oil, scattered around the castle. Encounter a ghoulie? You've got to use your wits. You need to think fast, run as fast as your invisible legs can carry you, or hide in the next room, barricade the door and hide in the closet sucking your thumb. It's a thousand times more thrilling than blasting them away with a Plasma Cutter (I hope some people pick up on this reference).   And speaking of hiding, there's a lovely little system called sanity; Daniel being an insane, ill-mouthed, bumbling psychopath has a severe case of nyctophobia and a surprising dislike for monster with their jaws stapled to their nipples. The sanity meter is a good and bad thing about this game; it discourages you to look at the monsters and to try and solve puzzles, because if in the dark too long or staring at a monster's rear for too long causes visual and audible distortion. This can be scary or sometimes even annoying, there is a crackling, ringing sound when I'm trying to hide and when running around in the dark holding a bucket, it doesn't help when my screen decided to go into an itunes visualizer.  When it comes to horror, this game delivers. This isn't a game with cheap, pop-ups of scary faces, this is more of a tense, 'What's around this corner?' 'What was that noise?' and 'Oh my god I'm being chased by a skinny deformed human with a machete for an arm'. It covers every bit of horror in the different stages of the game, which also links into the perfect level design for TDD.   There's the exploration, carry one puzzle piece through a dark, hollow hallway to another while avoiding the patrolling monster. There's the platform like jumping level, where you have to stay out of the water, or have your feet nibbled off by the invisible ghoul who seems to have two working legs but can't reach up to claw at your toes. And then there's the stealthy, corner to corner, throw at hammer at the wall distraction type of level. There's lots of strategic thinking involved in this game, and how you execute an objective is purely up to you.  Pros: Disturbingly immersive, beautifully narrated and spine-chillingly creepy. Cons: Slightly goofy voice acting, and one or two bugs encountered with the physics engine.   All in all this is nothing short of a masterpiece. A scary-puzzle game at heart, wrapped together in a bow of interesting storytelling, interactive environment and fantastic ambiance.  Play this one with headphones on and lights off. You'll thank me later.  No overall score because why should a complex opinion be represented numerically, but some people came here only for the numbers, so, 9.5/10. Jackass.",

It is thoroughly scary, and I strongly suggest this game if you want a good scare and story line.  So, plot, pretty good. You play as Daniel, a man from 1839 who drank an amnesia potion because he wanted to forget the bad things he had done. You find a note to yourself, telling you what to do and why. I'm not even going to use spoiler text, I think you should just find out for yourself what the note says, because that note is ONE HUGE SPOILER! So anyways, as you continue the game, you find notes from your journal that tells you your past. By the way, the first hour of the game is just build-up to the scary parts. So give it a chance. There's creepy stuff that entertains you until you encounter the monster.  Gameplay is pretty good, too. You need to stay out of the dark, as it will cause your 'sanity' to drain. As you get more insane, your sight becomes more disoriented. The screen becomes blurry, in other words. So to stay out of the dark, you can light torches, candles, and lanterns in the environment with tinderboxes that you find on shelves or in other places. Or you can find oil to light your personal lantern, which eminates light all around yourself. But in enemy encounters, you must stay out of light, even if that means going insane, making it altering your vision, giving you extreme fear because you can't see and you know there's a monster nearby. That's the kind of fear you get in this game.  This game is a total 10/10. Amazing(ly scary)!",

But it is the removal of weapons and consequently combat that introduces a wholly new dynamic and therein lies Amnesia’s brilliance. What the game is capable is elevated to an entirely new level. It is undoubtedly creative, original and works flawlessly alongside Lovecraftian themes hinted at. It is a shining example of what the first-person genre, outside of shooting, can achieve on an experiential level.",

Sanity can be lost by standing in the darkness too long, looking at monsters or witnessing disturbing events. Health is lost my regualr means like attacks, touching dangerous objects or fall damage. I liked how the story was told through flashbacks and notes, it game the game a bit more of a personal feel in the sense that it felt that this was you in this situation, not the character you're playing as.

I would like to mention i have played A LOT more than steam says I have, it's just i play it on Desura instead. The game itself is an indie game made by frictional games, and i persionally think they should be more well known. The game is about Daniel. Daniel drinks a potion (I think that's what it was? i haven't played the main storyline in a while.) that causes amnesia, and that is where the game starts, For the first 45 minutes or so, the game just sets up the storyline and other characters, but after that, the game starts to pick up. One thing that Amnesia does better than any horror game, no debate, is pacing. everything is well thought out and well placed. Any way, at the 45 minute mark, you finally see the monster, and OH MY GOD IT'S HIDIOUS! Seriously, that thing is disturbing, and so is the other monster. The hands down scariest one is the one from the free Justine dlc, just because it talks. EWWWWWWWWWWWWW. And I won't spoil what's in the water. The game explores some pretty disturbing and controversial topics, such as nineteenth century torture. The game also features an inventory system and notebook system. The inventory system is used for keys, important objects, and potions, such as sanity potions and laduanadum. the notebook holds momentos, which are your objectives, notes which allow you to read (or hear, the game has some nice voice acting) moments in the psat or thoughts from your own character or other characters. I forgot another thing that is unique, and that is the sanity system. Your sanity level decreases as you look at monsters, witness or hear disturbing or creepy things, or if you stay in darkness. The story is good, the gameplay is the scariest thing i've played yet, and all the mechanics are put to good use. If you want more reviews like this, check out my group, Time For Horror.

How can i really immerse into the game when i dont need to hide from monsters, and the scenario is pretty much the same trought the game? its not scary, its pretty boring.  The good thing about this game? I think it would be the puzzles, some of them can be challenging if you dont pay attention to details.

The game is genuinely creepy in certain moments, especially the beginning. But, much else is poorly done in my opinion. It boils down to simply walking around doing tedious puzzles with the ocasional monster runin, where you resort to the same routine every single time: running away, briefly waiting for it to go away and then continuing pulling levers. It's also burdened by the tedious insanity mechanic where once the game decies 'you are now scared', you have to stare at a lamp for 10 seconds or the protagnist will start having asthma attacks. I don't like a game telling me I'm scared, it's annoying and takes me out of the experience.  The game has little challenge outside of these puzzles as you practically trip over tinderboxes and oil. Combine these two and there is little to no challenge, just tedium. Finishing the game, I had 101 tinderboxes and 26 oil refills. I definitely prefer when horror games are more restrictive in resources, I feel it adds more tension. There's also the problem of deaths being entirely meaningless. In fact, the enemy may even not appear upon respawn - in other words, the game rewards you for dying by taking away the enemy that killed you.  I loved the lore. Was very interesting, to the point where I would risk resources just to explore and learn more about the environment I found myself in.  I applaud the unique experience, but considering how it spawned the trend of boring horror games where you can't fight back I certainly coould've done without this one. The ending is anticlimactic and the 'good' ending I got moreso than any of the 'bad' ones. If you're itching to try it, I would suggest picking it up on a sale.   - Suspense climaxes at the very beginning of the game - very well done, but blows steam too fast - Far too liberal in handing out resources - Little/no challenge - Tedious at times  + Great atmosphere + Good Lore + No over-reliance on jumpscares + Unique concept (at the time)    Edit 12/23/16: I finally got around to trying a very similar game, outlast. This one is far better between the two famed horror titles, I'll give it that much.",

One of the game mechanics is you get 'insane' if you stay in the darkness too long, to stay sane, you have to find matches and oil for your lamp which ... I really hated, predictably, there aren't a lot of those around and you need to explore in the dark to find them. Is that how the game wants me to explore this world?

Thing is, if that was supposed to be scary, then I'm wasting my time, because I didn't care at all what happened.  The game wants me to be scared with audio hints and visual distortion and really annoying darkness ... i mean, what is so scary about staring at a really dark screen? If I die or whatever, I just go back to whatever save point right? Insanity?

The atmosphere is initially haunting but after awhile the background noises just becomes white noise and you find yourself spending a good deal of time wandering around in the dark which detracts from any oppurtunity to take in the games visuals.   As a result I found that the game was mainly trek through numerous, dark, brown tunnels; it was a relief to get to the sewers for a change of scenery. Perhaps though I was being overly conservative with my tinderboxes &amp; lantern oil.  In summary Amnesia is worth a play through, the puzzles are enjoyable and piecing together the storyline is interesting however I found the parts in between to be lack lustre with uninspiring visuals that made moving from point to point to be a chore. I do not envisage another play through of this game albeit I'm led to believe that the custom storylines and a wealth of user mods add significantly to the longevity of the game.

Duration wise the game was not worth my money. I got scared twice and they were both jumpscares. The atmosphere wasn't all that scary either I was smiling during the playtrough and laughing by swinging piggies from left to right.  The puzzles weren't always clear and the 'throw a rock at something' mechanic was just ridiculous. I mean seriously? I can throw a rock at something a small rock and it works but I can't just hit it with my fist or hang from the bridge to lower it?  The story was good and so was the narration. The narration was not Bastion level but it was pretty good. The way the side stories were told in diaries and those metal cans with an orb on top of it (don't know what they are called) was kind of awkward. I want to play a game and not read a book. For example: They could have narrated the torture machine text by simply using screams and the words of the victim instead of just a piece of text.  For people like me I do not recommend this game.

It's pretty to look at, and has some cool room designs, but that's about it. The game fails at storytelling hardcore. You find these notes/diary entries that supposedly hint to bits and pieces of what's going on along the way, but the reality is they often are a lot of yapping without providing any actual new, interesting information about the story. Oooh, mysterious artefact, like anyone gives a ♥♥♥♥. The 'sanity level' is nothing new. Eternal Darkness did it first, and I feel like the sanity level is a good-sized part of what made this Amnesia's reception above what it deserves.  The monster mechanics are both BS and incredibly stupid. Monsters will generally 'spawn' as triggered by discovering something or progressing a puzzle. When the game is feeling especially unfair, the monster will spawn practically right on top of you. I hope you have lightning fast reflexes and have memorized every single corner in this dungeon maze, because if not, have fun running to your doom. That's the BS part. The stupid part is that often the monster's spawn period is finite. Yes, you heard me. They don't stick around. Solve a puzzle, a monster spawns. Find your hiding spot or whatever, and wait for them to pass out of sight or leave the area. Once the coast is clear, congratulations you can wander freely because that monster is forever gone. Spooky atmosphere, my foot.  The two points I give this game are for being pretty, and for having a fairly compelling, and relatively creepy intro where you discover the note about Daniel's memories.

This is not a 'monsters jump out of closets and yell boo' experience, and it's about as far as you can get from the typical 'gross-looking monsters that you shoot with lots of big guns' games that somehow get labeled as 'Survival Horror'.  The folks at Frictional Games are huge fans of H.P. Lovecraft, and their games draw heavily from his works. They refined the true Horror game formula through the Penumbra series. Amnesia pulls together everything they did right, trims out the fat, and makes for a terrifying experience of nightmarish psychological horror. If you consider yourself a fan of Horror games, you must play this game and see how it redefines the genre.  And be sure to play it the right way: with headphones, in a dark room. You may never sleep again, but it will have been worth it.",

The lack of any and all contact with people lends to the game's sheer terrifying nature, and the cosmic horrors that stalk you throughout the game NEVER cease to terrify and haunt me. The survival mechanics make sense and are not too annoying, and make sure the game is difficult but fair. The story lends to the sheer terror, with the main character experiencing the tragic and terrible things that lead to his 'Amnesia', this realisation of his past deeds only adds to the game's solid atmosphere and terrifying H.P Lovecraft style cosmic and ghostly manifestations that plague you throughout this fantastic experience. I'd say this is the best, and finest example of both a survival horror game, and horror storytelling within a game.",

Undeniably terrifying, I will fully admit that my progress in this game has been slow and staggered, limited purely to times when I have friends over who also enjoy a bit of a jump.  From a technical standpoint, Amnesia is very pretty and the gameplay is admirably old school with a near complete lack of HUD and requiring the player to pause the game in order to get information on health and sanity. I do occasionally find it frustratingly unhelpful though, to the point where I have found myself lost (I have no map as of yet) and backtracking through corridors just to find the correct route.  That being said, it's a title clearly designed to frighten and offer some thrills, both of which it definitely does for me!",

I don't find this game scary, but rather stressful. The water servants and the parts of the game in which you have to flee from gatherers, hearing the doors getting smashed behind you, really made me stand on my toes.

            "review_text": "So, if you have been on the internet in the last decade, You've probably seen a guy named slenderman. Many proclaim that slender is the scariest game there ever is, was, and will be, but those people probably havn't played Amnesia: The Dark Descent. There are plenty other video games such as SCP: Containment Breach and Which that compete with this title (Horror wise), but this game is MUCH more interactive, and in most cases, fun. Slenderman is easy to outrun... probably because he doesnt 'Chase' you. The monsters in this game chase you, and there 2X faster than you, and can break doors down and kill you with just 2 hits. Not to mention that these monsters (the gatheres), are as creepy as mess. Just opening doors is fun, due to the fact that you have to make a litteral motion with your mouse to open it. The game has some unique properties most horror games dont. When you stay in the dark to long, your Sanity will drain. Sanity is pretty unique to the game, and will mess with your brain by fainting, seeing random things on your screen, bluring out, and randomly falling on the floor when it gets low. A lot of developers for horror games have found it to be more unnerving if you cant defend yourself against the enemies. Amnesia is a perfect example of this, as all you can carry is a lantern. You don't just wake up in a forest and go to find random pages scattered about, but the game has a plot. You play as daniel, the protagonist, who wakes up in a mansion of some sort, not knowing why the mess he's even there. Escaping is the main goal, but the developers warn you that the game should'nt be played to win. This is probably my favorite Horror title, due to its high amount of interactive controlls, jump scares, monsters and the abillity to download custom games and play offtrack of the story mode. As of I, I give this a 4.3. I recomend this to anyone who does'nt mind getting scared to death, otherwise, you'll waste your money on a game that you will never play.  TophMidna",

However, Amnesia truly shines in its story aspect, having a deep and well-written story that needs to be experienced first-hand. And for once, a game actually has pacing, unlike many 'Triple-A' games whose developers assume you'll fall asleep within five minutes if something hasn't already exploded. Instead, it builds up the tension, and by the time you even get to see a monster, you're an absolute nervous wreck. And that's good.

The immersive plot, haunting atmospere, terrifying ambiance, and unearthly enemies make Amnesia the globally known horror game it is. From Mr. TotalPenguin to Pewdiepie, Amnesia has been a solid (and often hilarious) foundation for YouTube letsplayers since its release. Though most of its players don't scream and hyperventilate into a camera during the game, all of them experience fear, tension, and (occasionally) relief at reaching that save point. While I will agree that Amnesia plays on that old cliché, 'Old mansion, crumbling hallways, grimy tables with rotting food, and massive 'earthquakes' that last for 4 seconds and oddly don't damage anything', it is still a game that will startle, scare, and intrigue you to the very end.

No other game manages to make me feel so helpless - you can't fight, you can only hide or run. The controls are refreshingly simple and work very well. The graphics and level design are a bit mediocre, and gameplay may lack a bit of variety, which prevents it from being truly great. Still, I can easily recommend this.

It is intense at many points, and the monsters will throw you for a loop when they do show up.  Also, atmosphere. Just pure atmosphere. You lose yourself in this game. It's amazing at that, without a doubt. The sounds, the lighting, the mechanics; it's all very well done, especially for a game that's over 4 years old. And, as I said before, when the monsters show up, it's pretty intense. You feel like you're being chased. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes horror or suvival-horror genres. It's a classic, and definitely worth it.",

I played this game at 12:00am in the middle of the night, recording it for my friend(+my reaction) and I nearly screamed because of my sanity dropping and me getting very nervous and it slightly scaring me. I would recommend this game if you like scary games that require skill and a good backdrop! Also, if anyone knows, how can you find mods for this game?

I'm someone who loves horror and all that is creepy, I'm someone who can calmly play any Resident Evil or Silent Hill game. But with Amnesia, I don't have that option.   See, with other horror games, you're given weapons, a way to defend yourself. In Amnesia, the only weapon you have is your mind. That's right, there's not a single weapon in the game, and this is a great thing. With no way to defend yourself, all you can do is run and hide and hope that monster walks past the room where you're hiding in. This captures nothing but pure terror.   Monsters don't just hear you and see you, they can find you based on your sanity level. Staying too long in the dark or looking at disturbing things will drain your sanity. To regain it, you must progress and stay in well lit areas, which are often hard to come by in Amnesia. It goes without saying that you should do everything in your power to keep your sanity level up, or else everything is harder to do, even to tell whether that noise you heard is a monster, or just a product of your imagination.   In addition to the terror aspect of Amnesia, there is also an interesting story and detailed areas to explore, that capture the dark feel of the game. Also, there are custom stories for this game, that are mods created by users that add to the playability to Amnesia. Even after you beat Amnesia, there is more to play with these custom stories.   So, the question is, should you buy this game? Yes, absolutly. At a sale? If you wanna wait and save a little money, sure, but I recommend getting this game even at full price. Whether you're familiar with horror, or this is your first horror game, it has something to offer you, an unforgettable experience.",

It just feels good and drags you into the deep atmosphere. + Atmosphere. You will ♥♥♥♥ your Pants... even without monsters, the atmosphere and the fear not knowing what awaits behind the next corner is enough. + Soundtrack deepens the Atmosphere. + Puzzles aren't really difficult, yet entertaining. + Closets, you will love em believe me. + Throwing Boxes (counts to gameplay, but it needs to be an own Point) + Tons of and really Tons of really good mods. Custom Storys, that feature the same lenght and depth as the main Story. (e.g. Abduction; Lost the Lights; Evil Infects (sadly dead I think); Gary Dark Secrets; Killings in Altstadt)  All in all: I love this Game, it gave me a lot of memories to laugh at. I played it with my Buddy (both played via Skype) and it was hilarious and scary at the same Time. The Atmosphere really does its Job, Gameplay works really good, but what really makes it this awesome are the custom stories. You will always find a good new story to keep you busy.",

DO NOT play if jumpscare games give you nightmares. This game makes FNAF look like a rated C game (you know, those children games). Also, you don't have to listen to the developers, but it makes it more fun.",

            "review_text": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent [Steam]: 7.7/10 Not my first choice for something to bust my Steam cherry, but it was free one day so you know I'm going to take advantage of it. It took quite some time to get this game to work. I don't want to have the app take up the entire screen so I wouldn't be able to see my messages and such, and if I dared to exit the game it would freeze the computer. Finally, after fixing the issue, I started the game. Immediately after starting the game, it told me that I should take every measure possible to immerse myself in the world it creates (turning off the lights, etc.), but I quickly learned that this was a pointless measure to take because of how immersive the game is despite the conditions that surround me. Immersion is important for Amnesia because it is a plot dependent horror game, and unlike Five Nights at Freddy's, this game doesn't just throw jumpscares at you expecting you to be satisfied. It's genuine horror, the kind that makes you expect something to be behind you whenever you turn around. I suppose evidence of the game's competence in this area can be proven simply by looking at the monsters. Look up a picture of 'The Gatherers' and tell me they don't look ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. No way would anyone be scared of it on its own. However, thanks to the musical score and the overall atmosphere of the world, these things will leave you terrified. There is a blatant 'issue' I suppose I'll address. You're supposed to hide from these things and wait until they leave you alone, but if you let them kill you, 9 times out of 10, they won't be there the next time you enter the area they were in before your death. Considering the fact that you don't have limited lives, you can cheat the system and basically just kill yourself and pass on through. I submit to you that this is a good thing, however. The game is not shy of telling you that it is trying to be more immersive than, for lack of a better word, 'fun', and eliminating some hardships certain people will have at certain points was a good move for them on that part, because it allows everyone, no matter the skill level, to experience the full length of the game. In the matter of exploiting this mechanic to pass through the game quicker, that's more about punishing yourself really. You'd have to deliberately make an honest attempt to get killed by these things to bypass them, and if you do that you're cheating yourself out of the terror and the strategy from hiding from them. There are quite a lot of puzzles in this game, and they're pretty great for the most part. Some of them are skill based, and others rely on intuition. There are some, however, that are not very clear as to what you need to do, in fact there was a audio glitch that screwed me up at one point. I've also heard a complaint that a puzzle won't let you proceed until you do the puzzle incorrectly, but I did not have the displeasure of that experience. The plot is somewhat interesting. I don't believe I've heard anything like it before, and I couldn't wait to see how it unraveled. The voice actors did a marvelous job for the most part. There were a couple of lines that actually made me laugh because there were so poorly done, but those were only few. This game does an exceptionally good job with what it was determined to do: be a terrifying and immersive experience. Horror games and movies don't really affect me easily, and while I didn't get too scared, I definitely was unnerved by being chased by the various monsters. It's no longer free, but I can safely say that it's worth the 20 dollar asking price. The game will run you to about 10 hours by the way.",

As far as survival horrors go, it isn't the scariest, but by no means is a game for the light hearted either. I felt the music was the main contributing factor to the terror this game creates, as it changes mood and builds suspense to suit the visuals very well. The story is particularly macabre, and that also helps the dread which tends to creep up now and then. The game keeps you sucked in, and I finished this in only a couple of sessions as a result, I do wish it went on for a bit longer though. Took roughly 8-10 hours to complete.    ",

            "review_text": " Amnesia: The Dark Descent  is arguably the best psychological horror game ever created.  The story begins as the protagonist, a young man named Daniel, awakens, bereft of memories, in what appears to be a gloomy medieval castle. The player will quickly discover a Memento-style note to self, exposing that Daniel himself has wiped his memories, giving him a mission to 'put things right' by finding someone called Alexander and killing him, and warning him that he is being followed by 'a living nightmare.'  Stage set, the player is set adrift to explore the vast, creepy, run-down castle. The game makes excellent use of darkness as a mechanism to balance tension: when the player remains in the dark for too long, Daniel begins to be frightened, which eventually damages his sanity àla Call of Cthulhu. However, the only two sources of illumination, tinderboxes for lighting stationary items such as candles and torches, and an oil-devouring lantern Daniel carries with him, both leave the player exposed and are only available in limited supply. Therefore, much of the game is a constant conflict between shivering in the murky blackness and taking brief refuge in temporary light.  Advancement is achieved via exploration, unveiling pieces of Daniel's forgotten past, and solving strongly thematic puzzles: repairing decrepit machinery or creating alchemical concoctions. These puzzles, while reinforcing the player's immersion, also force her to scrounge the darkest, most forlorn corners of the vast, decaying edifice for tools, parts, and ingredients, collecting mementos, letters, and fragments of journal entries along the way.  The visual and aural ambience blend perfectly to submerge the player in her surroundings: Daniel shakes, breathes heavily, and suffers from distorted vision when he's frightened; the building creaks and groans as Daniel traverses its dusty corridors; and nameless beings emit unspeakable utterances, hopefully in the distance.  There are a number of hostile beings lurking in the darkness - not many, but given that the only defenses available to Daniel are hiding in the gloom or running desperately for his life, the prospect of a horrifying demise looming suddenly out of the shadows is sufficient motivation to keep the player creeping nervously from room to room, afraid to make a noise or light a lamp.  The Dark Descent clearly draws inspiration, in terms of subject matter, psychological application of horrific elements, and malleability of the player's sanity and overall mental state, from the works of H.P. Lovecraft - in turn, it breathes new life into Lovecraft's concepts by exposing them to new generations via a new medium nearly a century later.  For fans of modern psychological horror, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a  must-play  - the epitome of the genre. For newcomers, it would be difficult to find a better starting point.  I nominated this game for the 'Test of Time' award in the 2016 Steam Awards.",

I quickly learned that Amnesia had not immunized me to horror. No longer did I dash through the night's pitch-black swamps on the edge of the Zone, my face firmly planted in my PDA and knife held for placebo speed. I found myself crouched in fear, huddled in the shadows just outside an enemy camp immensely relieved by the sound of their hostile Russian overlaying the campfire. The rustling of the leaves and reeds in the wind, once a well-accustomed to sound as I waited for my distant targets, now forced me to pull a double-one-eighty and tense my pinky over the SHIFT key.

            "review_text": "Great game! Reviewing with 3h gameplay.  Pros: 1) Character is really crazy. He has small allucinations that make it hard to distinguish what's real and not. I can feel he's in pain and struggling.  2) Walk movement is awesome, really makes me feel my body is heavy and I can't properly walk.  3) Light effects are even better! At begining I found it idiotic that the character had fear of dark. But indeed, there are places I can't see more than a few centimeters upfront, IDK what's there, if it's a corridor or a wall. With the lantern it gets way clearer, but in corridors I still can't see far enough. By not knowing what I will find, joined with hallucinations and sounds for somebody walking, scenario gets really creppy! And I haven't even found any monster yet!  4) Interaction with objects is original. Mouse movement reflects the hand movement to handle objects. I feel my hand opening and closing drawers and doors. Some objects are heavy and I can feel the trouble to carry them. Very very good!  5) Some puzzles were very interesting.  Cons:  1) The ♥♥♥♥♥ game keeps changing my keyboard layout ffs! My Win7 has been installed for years and NEVER an app messed with keyboard layout before!  2) I can pause and minimize the game, but mouse gets stuck. It's useless, only way to do stuff on PC is to completely close the game. Annoying.  3) Graph is a bit outdated and not good for immersion. This is definetely not an open world game. Well maybe I've been playing Oblivion for too long and got used to it.  4) I haven't stuck on any puzzle yet, but I think they will get harder. In my personal taste, I don't like to get stuck for a long time looking around for a unique item.",

Then the familiarity kicks in. Once the mechanics of the game start repeating, a lot of the scare factor wears off and you are left with a rather simple puzzle game. The story remains decent but drags on longer than it should for the mechanics and enemy variety that is available. Still worth playing for any fan of the horror genre, if only to experience the flooded section. I will say no more.",

I got that feeling for sure! Amnesia has pretty good graphics (really good actually for a small at the time studio), interesting puzzles, and things that stand out the most are: the physics (you can grab objects throw them around, rotate them, etc. Very fun!), the soundtrack (especially the terror music, man it is scary!), and the storyline. Without spoiling anything at all, the game has 4 endings. I of course got the good ending, and watched the other three on youtube. So therefore, I can confirm that at least the ending I got was absolutely badass! Also, I believe this was one of the first horror games to put you in a helpless role against monsters, with no weapons to defend yourself with, though you can throw chairs and boxes to stun the monsters for a few seconds. Even if I am wrong, this game is still a must-have for anyone who can handle themselves in absolutely terrifying situations! You should definitely try it out!",

The story is surprisingly very good, it reveals a lot of the main character's background story as he finds notes, has flashbacks and remembers what was going on before he lost his memory and what his intentions are. The main feature of the game are the tense survival moments, which are several, and the game continuously builds up tension and the scare factor, but unfortunately, the main strategy for survival gets a bit repetitive, the game could have invested in more variety.",

            "review_text": "A great game with a consistently well envisioned horror atmosphere, but occassionally let down by very 'gamey' moments.  Amensia gets major points for actually trying to embrace some of the best ways to actively try and scare you. Extended loneliness, the knowledge that you are weak to whatever foe may be out there, moreso that you have no real means of defending yourself apart from movement. The very same movement that can alert your foes to where you are and this pervasive sense that you are constantly in danger. Combined with limited supplies for lighting your dim environments it has all the right ingredients for leaving a lasting impression.  Its length manages to keep the game from feeling too long and not too short, but perhaps does start to wane its hook into you as it goes on. There are some great moments and set-pieces, aided with headphones and no lighting apart from the thin glare off your monitor, that will stick with you for some time, but these are punctuated by fairly simple puzzles. The 'but' comes from the fact that whilst they never really break the tense feeling established, as the game goes on you realise that the puzzles are essentially safe environments and no matter how long you spend in (most of) them, you're probably going to be safe from attack.  Similarly, the first time you get a game over, the scare factor immediately drops; the game reminds you that it's a game and takes you right out of the atmosphere it has carefully constructed. Generally dying once will allow you to piece together what you did wrong and move onto the next area, where the fear will be built back up again, but it really decreases the sense of dread from the imposing and grotesque things hunting for you when you realise that they're just common video game enemies with the advantage of you not being able to defend yourself.  That said, these moments are few and far between and safely overridden by those couple of minutes where you catch sight of an enemy who locks eyes on you and you hastily try to flee and find somewhere, anywhere, desperately to keep you safe. And as you wait in the darkness for the footsteps to get close, right on top of you even and then to fade away with distance, you turn your light back on and realise that you were lucky that time, but maybe the next...  It's those moments joined with some tight pacing and a great atmosphere that make this a really fun, really enjoyable experience, but perhaps only for the one playthrough.",

All I will say is that I am very glad to have played it when I did, trying to avoid as many videos and spoilers about the game as possible. It helped me get into the game much more having not been exposed to so many memes about the Servant Grunt (mostly PewDiePie-related I'm sure), videos on the more highly derivative custom stories, and so on. If you yourself are still someone lucky enough to know little about the game and are interested in checking it out, please, by all means, do so!  I did take a swipe there at custom stories but actually one of the best things about this game is the custom story community. The Frictional forums are a mostly friendly lot while still unafraid of offering criticism to the various people offering up their custom stories (and there are some now-overdone cliches that run through the lesser stories they, and anyone else with sense would have low tolerance for - read up on teleporting naked guy jumpscares to see what I mean). It's a good place to get feedback and also help on how to use the game's editors for models, levels, textures and so on for making custom stories. ModDB is also a good place to go to look for the better stories (from what I've seen of the most highly rated stories their user base has pretty good standards). It's great since once you're done with the main game there's a solid variety of other stuff, some full conversions, some games almost as long if not longer than the actual game itself, you'll get a good amount of hours from booting up this game. While not nearly as robust as say the Half-Life 2 / Source mod scene (then again what is?) this is up there. If you want to make your own stories you can download a lot of custom-created stuff to use for a custom story, including a flashlight to replace the lantern if you're putting your game in a modern setting, plus the importing of a ton of textures and models from the Penumbra games, and recently Frictional offering A Machine for Pigs stuff to import too, currently in testing stage.   Oh yeah and this version includes the extra side story Justine, which many of you may know, so that's a nice bonus too. I'm not personally fond of Justine, due to some annoying puzzles and the fact that there's no save function at all (it isn't a long game, no, but it's easy enough to die a few places and starting the whole thing all over is aggravating). It does though have its own unique music and creatures which are really good and creepy, AND, dun dun dun, can be used for your own custom story as well (though I haven't actually yet found the files that contain these, I'll have to ask around).",

Making use of the sanity and distortion, which has also been used in games like Call of Cthulhu and originally patented by Nintendo for Eternal Darkness, the claustrophobic effects adds more to the experience. As an added bonus, the Justine downloadable content also works as a separate story. The game is complete with a level editor, much like Valve's source engine, allowing gamers to create customizable levels. One of the best indie games to hit the market, it goes to show that even indie game developers may have more talent than the business game makers of today, whom generally stick to the boring formula.",

Also the fact that you will never be able to defend yourself and you can either run or hide was a very important part of it. Real horror happens in your head and this game screws with your head and only occasionally uses the cheap way of jumpscares. Ressource management and darkness as curse and blessing at the same time builds up the tension really well and adds a lot to the survival aspect. In my case, this game lead to a love-hate relationship. I love how well it is made, while I hate myself for playing it, since I was afraid of playing it most times, which is a good thing in the end I guess. And remember: Always shut the doors!",

You must run away and hide; but in darkness of course because the bad guys would see you otherwise. This increases your panic so decisions on which candle or torch to light could mean extra long chases to reach safety. I've currently played for 3 hours and am about half way. The story, mainly told via retrieving documents and torn diary pages, is intriguing enough for me to want to keep going. If you scare easily (and don't like it) then this is not the game for you.

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of really good ideas, and most of them work as intended. I found it to be rather scary, although some times not for the reason that might have been intended. Wandering a dark hallway, trying to find the item you need to solve a puzzle or to advance, might sound simple enough, but the fact that the darkness is your enemy, as well the Servants, really makes you have to think about what is the better idea. You can either run the risk of an enemy seeing you, or you can wander in the darkness and let your sanity drop, which may also lead to your death. It can be a hard choice at times, and you won't always make the right decision, but luckily there are enough checkpoints that you won't lose much progress if you lose all your sanity or health. The Servants themselves are freaky up close, although if you are seeing them up close, you are probably going to die anyway. And the fact that even looking at them drops your character's sanity means you mostly have to rely on hearing them, which is absolutely terrifying.  But of course, not everything works in this game. The puzzles are sometimes really tricky, as the game does next to nothing at times to give you a hint as to what you are supposed to be looking for, or what can be used on what and when. It usually is not a problem, but at times you might end up scratching your head, looking at your objective and inventory, trying to figure out how the items you have will get you to your objective. I had it happen a few times, but never enough that I got stuck for hours on end. Also, having health and health items on this game feels useless since you'll usually die in a hit or two anyway, so there really does not seem to be much point in having it. The biggest problem I found with the game is when it comes to escaping enemies. If I am spotted, even if I run and hide in the darkness three rooms away from where I was spotted, the Servants still seemed to be able to find me every time. They are faster than the character, so running can be hard if you are spotted and you're not near a doorway to run in to. I only ever managed to get away from any enemy once: I was killed every other time. Maybe I was just doing something wrong, but it was annoying nonetheless. Still, it only becomes a problem if you get spotted, so just be careful and it will never come up.",

Second thing, play in an empty or reasonably quiet house with dim lighting, because I did and it succeeded in making me invest in a new pair of boxers. Last thing, take time to enjoy how well the atmosphere is set, because it is absolutely perfect with the storyline.  Aside from all of this, the gameplay itself is fantastic. It constantly has you on the edge of your set and at un-ease and the environment of the castle/sanctum is so well-suited. My favourite part, personally, was being constantly chased by shadows and servants and hiding in some wardrobe like a little ♥♥♥♥♥, even though they will likely find you and molest you.

I'd first like to thank one of my best friends for forcing me to actually start this game, I'm not even sure how it and it's sequel ended up in my library as scary games are far from my typical tastes.  So, the meat and bones of this. This is horror at it's finest, darkness, disorientation, that feeling of helplessness as you really don't see what might kill you. As much as I suck at games, I was surprised I didn't die more often in this, but obviously my amazing ability for running like a scared bunny at the first sign of something grotesquelly disturbing seemed to have helped. This is less jumpscares and more methodic rhythmic chanting of wondering when the next freakshow psychopath will come at you while you're clutching your lantern for dear life and trying to solve the puzzle. Most of the time, your own imagination of how ♥♥♥♥ could go wrong is messing with you, but it's a great hair raiser.  This game is great, a bit nauseating with the blurred screen effects from low sanity, but nothing too major. The ending left a lot to be desired, but considering the game simply spirited itself into my library, I doubt that I can complain too much.  All-in-all: Great game. 10/10. Best Game Evah. This is a great game for people who like the story-telling/pre-WWI/H.P. Lovecraft style stories.",

I feel like I have to watch out with my real life insanity when playing this. The story is great and always leaves me at the edge of my seat wondering what's happening and what going to happen, as you have no idea why you're at this castle and you have to find out why this living nightmare is after you.

It relied more on atmosphere and a sense of dread (like any good horror game/movie should) to make it as creepy as possible. While there tends to be a good bit of back tracking, it doesn't get too boring because of the changing surroundings. The audio generally stayed consistent in volume, no sudden increase in sound or screaming (there is occasional screaming, but it’s often distant and you get use to that). Well, I found the overall game to be loud and volume not very easy to adjust (only had a scale from 1-10), but everything is loud to me. The graphics, while not horrible, are not the best. I found I had a consistent blurry line 1/3 up from the bottom of my screen when looking at walls through the whole game, and though it could be ignored, it was a bit distracting. A few finally things; the inventory felt a little clunky but never took away from the game, constant maintenance for your health and sanity are not overly difficult, storyline/plot was engaging and allowed for multiple endings based on final choices, and while there are ‘cut-scenes’ they seem to add more than they take away. I was able to complete the game and all its endings in 12.5 hours, split over two days. I highly recommend playing it at 4am.   This game offered an interesting (if not almost-accurate) depiction of the human psyche and its response to trauma, denial, and torture. When the description boasts that the game “pulls no punches when trying to immerse you”, I think they may have rather meant they ‘pull no punches’ when describing torture. While the act is never shown visually, the aftermath is very in-your-face and the audio is… chilling. I don’t recommend this for anyone who cannot handle sounds of bones breaking, flesh/bones grinding, what may have been chewing, or other fleshy, squishy noises. Written descriptions are also given occasionally, though only 4 are very notable for extreme physical harm.",

It made a great use of gothic architecture and Lovecraftian themes to fashion an experience that evokes one of the best kinds of horror in a game: being alone, defenseless, and never knowing around which corner a hideous unstoppable monster is waiting to ruin your day. But this is what Frictional Games does. It's their bread and butter, from Penumbra on.   If you like more action in your Lovecraft inspired horror, I'd recommend Call of Ctulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth (provided you have enough computer wizardry at your command to get the damned thing to work properly) over Amnesia. If you want a deeply viserceal horror experience that requires use of your wits and running the f*** away in order to survive past the start screen, you can't do much better than Amnesia.",

Amnesia: The Dark Descent doesn't fall short of it's goal, and from the beginning to the end, the game seems to wrap it's long, slender arms around you and envelop you in a dark, immersive atmosphere which is only haulted by the occasionaly annoying controls. The player is left helpless in a maze of bloodthirsty monsters, entertaining puzzles, and a story that keeps you enthralled as you discover the story of Daniel's madness leading up to the events of the game.

            "review_text": " Amnesia  — in which you play as an amnesiac named Daniel as he stumbles through a generic Prussian castle filled with generic horror-genre tropes — is one of the most boring and predictable games I’ve played in years.  I’m an absolute sh*tbag. I nearly  cried  playing through  Thief: Deadly Shadows ’ Shalebridge Cradle. I have screamed my lungs out playing  Resident Evil 4  for God’s sake. I thought  Amnesia  would be a game I would never be able to finish due to paralyzing fear. But, much to my disappointment, I never once felt anything close to fear, terror, or panic. When I wasn’t sighing with boredom, I was rolling my eyes at, frankly, childish attempts to frighten me.  The game follows a very basic pattern: You enter a new area and look for an object to take or puzzle to solve, at which point an enemy spawns in. You then hide for a minute or so, the enemy despawns, and you leave. The only time this pattern changes during the game’s 7–8 hour play-time is during one section in a flooded tunnel which is a simple platforming challenge. The game is not scary; it’s tedious.  The problem with this predictability is that you always know when you are safe and when you are less safe. There’s no sense of being stalked, no sense of lurking danger, no paranoia. You know when an enemy exists in the area and when they don’t, through design and the obvious leitmotif. There’s no tension, and, consequently, no atmosphere, without which there is no horror.  At first, the idea of not being able to fight back against the monsters seems like a good one, but the implementation is tragic. The disfigured creatures — which are genuinely freakish and creepy — can move faster than Daniel and drive him insane if he looks directly at them. The monsters only work when they are far away, giving you time to find a hiding place; the game  can’t  spawn one too close to you, because to do so would be an instant game over. Most areas in the game are long, narrow corridors leading to dead ends, so monster encounters involve hiding in a dark corner until the monster despawns once it’s out of sight.  That’s it. That’s the entire game. As long as you don’t run directly at the monsters, you are never in any danger, and every encounter plays out in the  exact same way . For eight hours.  The game tries its best to make this scary by using sanity effects, which manifest as screen-blur and a laggy mouse when Daniel is scared. These effects debilitate you in the most frustrating manner, since you can barely see or move, and are near constant. Being in the dark drives Daniel insane, as does looking at enemies. But the only way to hide from enemies is to crouch in the dark, so you go insane no matter what. You  can  light candles and torches to create sanity-giving light, but the monsters will find you more easily and you have fewer places to hide. So, basically, you’re going to play this game like you’re walking in a heatwave with dodgy controls. This is annoying, not scary.  It’s a shame, too, because the game is pretty when the screen is stable. Castle Brennenburg is interesting enough to walk around and could have been a good setting if there was any kind of atmosphere whatsoever. It’s also nice to have physics-based object manipulation. Small things, like opening a desk drawer and seeing a cylindrical tinderbox roll around, are simply satisfying, and it’s fun throwing chairs and rocks around, even if there is no reason to.  I was left with the impression that  Amnesia  would work better as a  Myst -esque puzzle game. If Daniel simply explored a creepy castle, reading creepy notes detailing creepy things that happened there, all the while solving puzzles that make use of those notes, as well as the object physics, I would have had a wonderful time. The mistake it makes is trying to be a horror game. Despite all the praise heaped on it for that exact reason,  Amnesia  is bad at being scary.  The game asks you to immerse yourself in the world rather than focus on ‘winning’, but everything is so obviously contrived that immersion is all but impossible. Being so bored, I found myself wondering why Daniel was afraid of the dark when it is the safest place to go, and whether Frictional know what a tinder box actually is.  Amnesia  strives for psychological horror, but all it does is say ‘Boo,’ exactly when you know it will.",

I was pleasently suprised to find one of the best stealth games i've ever played. Amnesia: the dark descent proves that if a game loses the combat that games do so well, It needs to replace that lost mechanic with something substantial. Amnesia replaces combat with a holy trinity of Darkness based stealth, sanity managment, and a great physics system. Amnesia is more akin to silent hill 2 than fnaf, specifically because the player has to manage an inventory and deal with problems proactively rather than shaking in their boots like a coward or collecting the notes. If you are sick of walking sims calling themselves 'survival horror' then amnesia the dark descent is for you.",

Instead of using normal 'horror game' tactics of having something just pop out from around the corner and making you shoot down grotesque monsters, Amnesia gets your heart racing by leaving you with the inability to defend yourself and enemies lurking in the shadows. Anyone who enjoys the horror genre will love this game. It's worth every penny.",
