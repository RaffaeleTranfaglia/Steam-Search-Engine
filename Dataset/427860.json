            "review_text": "This is a great game. Individually the story or the gameplay doesn't really shine - I guessed the plot from a mile away and the endings really aren't anything special; the characters aren't too fleshed out beyond the first real chat and does not have special events specifically tied to them; the enigmatic elements of the game never really play an actual role and many climatic events just fell short despite its initial buildup; and the gameplay gets really bare when you realize that you've exhausted all possible events you can find in just, well, 3 hours.  In a way this feels more like an Early Access Game or a poor man's King of Dragon Pass. However, overall the game is a fantastic experience. The writing is really solid and the sprites and background art matches each other and the game perfectly. I've seen too many VNs out there with clashing arts/color tones that just ruins the overall experience before the player even go through a few lines, and I'm glad this VN isn't suspect to that flaw. The survival gameplay reminds me a bit of Planetbase (and thankfully and obviously considerably less difficult) and if there are additions of more events in the future I am certain that it'll be enjoyable enough for me to have another go.  As for things that need to improve, I'll try and keep it simple: 1) More events in general. Exploring the planet gets boring real quick when you can count the number of events on two hands. 2) More character specific dialogues/events, I mean, I would really like to know everyone more and see how they act under pressure. Also would like to see more events relating to the (spoilers!) AI Janet and alien microprobes. 3) Linear events such as (spoilers!) the kids being infected by microprobes etc need more elaboration and impact, and I don't mean hey-did-you-notice-the-kids-are-getting-more-violent? kind of one glance mentions. Something like a scene where Michael or Shen's sister going super violent and beat the crap out of someone. It's old, but it works more than a scene where the kid's tearing apart his toy. 4) More effects! Sound effects (explosions, beepingpeople screaming, chaos, raiders talking to each other etc), visual effects (again, explosions! etc). 5) Minor UI issue I have but the mouse scroll-backlog is like a must feature on VNs. Also, your save screen is really un-user friendly. 6) Gallery feature please! What's the point of having cool CGs, when you can't just refer to a CG Gallery and relieve them easily?",

            "review_text": "The story in this game is great! The game in this game, not so much. It is a colony management simulation with the very real and apparently almost inevitable threat of your entire colony dying. The exact mechanics are unclear and your ability to win seems to be entirely based on chance. Seems like the developers should have stuck with a visual novel instead.",

            "review_text": "Idea is interesting and it's got potential for sure - but it lacks any core gameplay. Managing colony is very shallow, story is a bit silly, and you feel like you've got no impact on anything whatsoever. There are also hidden game mechanics that are impossible to understand for me - quarter rations seem to affect the colonists exactly the same way as the double rations. First few days are critical and if you don't know what you are doing (and you don't know) it's pure luck if you will salvage the right modules and materials to survive. It's easy to get stuck in a loop with no way out - if you start bad you will end bad. Also it's very short (3-3,5h tops). My verdict is 'almost but not quite' 4/10.  PS. music is really nice",

            "review_text": "Good little game. Story is not greaest but it holds up. Would be hard to prolong it with this type of setting anyway.  You have basic managment of your base, some random events and decisions to make. Some of them are moraly tough and = bad. Puts you ino the right mood.  If I have to find any minuses than it would be: -No skip option. You can use auto-forward on max speed but it doest always work as fast as it can.  - Game is short. 6 hours to finish as 1 of 2 characters and see half of the endings. Because game is short some of your choices do not get long term influence they could. Some characters got way less development than I wanted.  Game last for 60-70 turns total,   For its price on summer sale its worth it. I had my fun and probably will play as second character for total of 10-12 hours.",
