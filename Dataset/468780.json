            "review_text": "I\\'m not a big multi-player person, mostly because I suck at them. But this is addicting. It\\'s a competitive footracing game, with moving obstacles and randomized race tracks. There is no single player mode, but there\\'s also nothing here that would make it necessary. The visuals are neat, I really like the designs and colors they went for here. There\\'s a view for 1st or 3rd person, also which is nice, you don\\'t see options too often. I prefer 1st person myself. It\\'s fast paced and a bunch of fun.  You can get in and out of races really quick, so you\\'re not stuck wasting time not playing. You get different powers that you can use to trip up your opponents, which can sometimes change the outcome of the race entirely. I still suck at MP, but found myself winning a couple rounds here and there, just due to some well timed powers and luck. You get a freeze power which freezes you in your tracks, another power which reverses your controls, and also one that makes you slide everywhere like there\\'s oil slicks on your feet. You also have a shield that you can use to deflect attacks if you time it right.  All that with the randomized tracks and moving obstacles make this a fun challenge. It\\'s not contending for any GOTY awards, but it\\'s definitely worth the $10 and it\\'s a fun distraction that doesn\\'t require a lot of commitment. I\\'m looking forward to seeing what else they do with this. Get a group of your friends together so you can scream obscenities at each other over skype or whatever and it\\'s a blast.",
