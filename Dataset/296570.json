            "review_text": "I am mainly a strategy gamer coming from a background of playing Civ “X”, Gal Civ “X”, EUIV, M&amp;B Warband, Matrix/AGEOD games, X-Com, etc.. I was in between games &amp; looking for something different to play when I ran across this game in a thread about good RPG-Tactical Games. I am glad I gave Xulima a try. It has a nostalgic feel to it and that old fashioned D&amp;D appeal (I date back to the white box/3 booklet early D&amp;D Pen and Paper Days) that some of us old timers still remember. This feel though, is coupled with some very nice (albeit very basic) game mechanics that just simply work for the type game it was designed to be. At first glance, I thought that the combat mechanics were a little “hokey” but they work and they work elegantly. I look forward to the battles and they make you think and plan each combat turn. In addition to the combat and questing, there are some nice surprises in your exploration &amp; adventuring. For us old schoolers that enjoy some logistics, there are some simple but elegant food &amp; rest requirements that work without being tedious. To me, the best part of the game is the old school leveling up and making hard choices in your skill &amp; attribute allocations as you advance. If you are a “instant gratification / pew-pew” gamer that needs high end graphics and action, stay away. But if you can use your imagination a bit and want a nicely done, old school adventure game, Xulima is your ticket. I hope they follow with a sequel…The game is quite addicting....buy the Golot Treasure DLC...its worth it....  Pros Old School Nostalgic Feel Nicely Done Game and Combat Mechanics Immersion Elegant Logistics, basic but not tedious Nicely done advancement system Challenging (recommend the medium or hard settings, don’t play on “normal”) Overall game package just works – good feel, fit and finish Hours and Hours of RPG Adventure Fun  Cons Simple but elegant graphics – no huge explosions or 3D action here Is grindy at times Some might miss the “follow the green arrow” tips of other games ie., this is a thinking persons game… Combat system may be too quirky for some (again, no “pew-pew” here) Some may miss the “Monty Hall” feel of other titles…you work for your loot here… Some of the game can bog down w/ tedious puzzle like problems to solve You sometimes get stuck w/out any clear route to proceed, which can be tedious to figure out what to do next    ",

I want more however and there does not appear to be any coming.  Likes – the turn based system works well. Each class has true strengths and weaknesses. A fairly good storyline. Functional graphics. Variety of terrains and monsters.  Improvement Opportunities – would of liked more sub quests with substance. Store owners rarely sell anything worthy. I would like to see decent quests for better weapons or special items. More deeper and darker dungeons and caves. Some of the electric and fireball trap/puzzles are annoying. ",

            "review_text": "I'll keep this short, and to the point.  This is a decent, if not terribly inspired group based cRPG that is mostly bug free. It allows people to play both pregenerated and individually created characters in the party. Solid game, for a fairly cheap price.  The biggest negative for me was that compared to many other games of this type, it is VERY linear. There is basically one path to advance through the story and game. This is done through content being tied very closely to party levels, and ability. Sure, there is the illusion of 'sandbox' or non-linear questing, but in reality, you can go to the various places whenever you want, but the enounters there will wreck your party if they try to do things in the 'wrong' order.  Pros: - Few bugs - Decent UI - Reasonable graphics - Decent if fairly generic gameplay - Reasonable sales price  Cons:  - Very linear in playability - Some quests not explained well or have misleading instructions - Wide disparity in usefulness of character classes (some are very powerful, others nearly useless)   Overall it gets a positive rating, it is a good game for what it is and what it is sells for. But Pillars of Eternity it is not.",

            "review_text": "I watched Lords of Xulima for a few months before deciding to get in on the early access. In fact it was only 3-4 weeks before the v1.0 release. It was incredible how interested the dev was in user feedback and how quickly they worked in even major additions like the character quick-bar we now have or how they implemented weight info for shop items you intent to buy. All on user feedback and I have to say it again: amazingly fast.   Now on to the game itself: The game consists of an overland map where you move your group of 6 chars (5 of which you can design yourself out of 9 classes) and of a turn-based fighting screen which is best compared to Wizardry 8. Chars get turn depending on their speed. This means you can get more turns than other group members or enemies, if say... your thief is very quick on her feet. You have many tactical options in the form of spells, skills, moving chars around and using items. On the map you have to look out for your food consumption and remember to restock in time. This mechanic shouldn't be a big problem in the easy and medium difficulty, if you are not too much into such things. Different terrains have different food consumption rates (think desert, meadow, forest, road, snow). There are also skills which influence this.  This game is oriented on old-school RPGs like Wizardry and Ultima. This means that there is little hand-holding and you have to use your brain and pick your fights. The dungeons have hidden doors and other environmental puzzles. Some of which are hard nuts. This may turn off some people who have never played older RPGs. I recommend to give this game a try nevertheless since it is a real gem. If you want to have a little bit more help you can always get the add-on 'The Talisman of Golot' which has (among others) the option show you the right direction of your quest.  The world is full of little secrets and just wandering off and go exploring is great fun. The art of the game is very pleasing and more than sufficient for the game to work. You can even use custom portraits now. Just like back in the Baldur's Gate days.  Depending on how you play you can get 60 to 120h of game time out of one walkthrough. I have over 100h on the clock now and enjoyed every minute of it. For what you get this game is almost criminally cheap and the devs really deserve it. I can't wait to get more tales of the world of Xulima.  If you are interested in RPGs and liked the revived old-school gems that came out this year, you owe it to yourself to give this title a chance. I'm pretty sure you won't regret it! And there are always nice people on the steam forum to help you out with tips and clues if you are stuck ;-)  All thumbs up from me! ",

            "review_text": "Lords of Xulima (shoe-la-muh) is a 2D isometric post-modernist turn based fantasy RPG created by Numantian Games. The lands of Xulima are beautifully presented throughout impressive hand drawn backgrounds all covered in blood. I have not felt so satisfied since Ultima VII.   The core mechanics and combat are strikingly well implemented. Without respawning enemies of meaty experience, planning ahead is critical. The only way to progress is by becoming an armored armadillo rolling under / over / through every obstacle. This world is huge, but an unobservant party will miss a sprawling jungle behind one violently lonely rose.  Beatings received in Xulima scale well between game settings. I have found the most entertaining difficulty to be Hardcore mode with Ironman enabled. Characters in a party receive a fraction of leveling rewards while demonic cursed hounds might as well render themselves as earth moving ironclad tanks pounding out bolts of electric death.  Unfortunately, my Hardcore party hit an unstoppable spike in brutality after a solid thirty hours. I accepted their wonderful and savage defeat by transmigrationing them into a world filled with far less grim synergy. Veteran difficulty is the Goldilocks zone of Xulima and remains severely enjoyable. The difference being one is a world infested with flesh eating bears, while the other is merely plagued.",

It has definitely landed on my top ten RPG's of all time, along with titles like ES Oblivion, Fallout 3, Divinity Original Sin and Witcher 3 and it will remain there forever  Lords Of Xulima is a massive, meticulously crafted RPG that is worthy of a AAA title price, but can be purchased at a price which I felt was an absolute steal. You could buy 3 random AAA titles and fail to get 1/3 of the quality gameplay that Lords Of Xulima has in it.   The last RPG that took me this off guard (in a good way), was Divinity Original Sin and this games storyline and well polished nature, remind me of that instant classic. I really needed this after having just slogged my way through that crud bomb 'Balrum'  Pro's  - Amazing, beautiful, original and flat out epic storyline, that spares the player any of that cutesy JRPG crap - Supremely polished gameplay with seamless inventory management, character management and resource management. It is totally obvious that this game was developed by people who cared and people who get it !!! - Insanely fun turn based combat, think old school FF2 &amp; 3 with a modern makeover. - 100% polisdhed and glitch free gameplay I did not experience one single glitch, bug or even crash throughout the whole game. - The game is super challenging, even on medium setting you may have to start over once or twice before you find a good class combo that will allow you to play the game all the way through. - Well balanced, original enemies that are memorable to say the least. - Amazing class system and an amazing and deep character development tree for each class  Con's (I mean it when I say I am grasping at straws here)  - The game might be a little too challenging for the casual gamer. - The graphics are wonderful and functional, but they definitely took a back burner to polished combat, inventory and logistics mechanics.   In the end this game will make you smile from ear to ear and you will remember reading this review and say to yourself 'wow, he wasn't overstating how amazing this game was'. I would gladly pay 3x what they are asking for the game and I am already amped for LOX 2 which Numantian Games has already said will be developed !!! ",

            "review_text": "The short story here is that when I was a kid in the 80's some of the best games I played were Ultima, Final Fantasy,M&amp;M, and Dragon warrior. This game seems to have a little of each of these games in it and has its own flavor. My only problem with the game is the graphics. They seems a little too cartoonish for a game that has a serious story. On the other hand, maybe this is intentional because the best of the 80's was no different. In terms of the 80's, there is even a giant who talks like Macho Man. What really surprised me is that the first real big boss battle I had was with a Beholder from D&amp;D. I think their doing a great job of Old School appeal. As far as the story, its epic. You get that real sense of mission that a good story delivers. The gameplay is traditional and only challenging if your out leveled. It seems to be a great game and I know some of my friends have already sunk in 100hrs. FYI you might have to out in about 20hrs or more killing mobs for xp. We all hate the grind but thts just how the old school rolls.",

LOX is like a 90's style turn- based combat RPG; Wizardry, Baldurs Gate, Disciples and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick come to mind, but Lords of Xulima is its own thing-unique in many ways, Don't be to put off by the trailer video...You can toggle run, which is a good thing because there is a much to explore and many secrets to discover on the huge and colorfull maps. The graphics are not the trendy low res look-more like medium res, highly stylized and artfully done. The combat is simple, fun and highly tactical. Your party of 6 is represented by their portraits arranged in battle postions at the bottom of the screen, with the enemy troops arrayed above. Each combatant's turn is determined by their speed, or if they are stunned or frozen, etc. Chose your unit's spell or potion or by default their weapon and select an enemy unit that is within reach to attack. Resource management is crutial. Your gold, loot, food iand experience is hard earned. A few times during the game I thought I might actually lose, because I did not fully understand the ecomomy of the game so wasted too many resourses, thus was too weak to defeat powerfull enemies that blocked my progress. Struggle on and you wil be rewarded in the end.",

Guided by a dream sent by the gods of his world, Gaulen sails to a forgotten continent. During exploration, the game is very similar to classics like Baldur´s Gate, but once combat begins, it will look like a mixture of Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy 10 and the newer Etrian Odyssey series. It is also often compared to the Wizardry-series.   Major Features:   - A charming atmosphere, travel through a mystical world and explore secret graves, forsaken temples and more.  - Challenging and strategic combat. Very original due to the elaborate debuff system.  - Character skills and equipment management are rich and rewarding.  - Recaptures the feeling of oldschool rpg series like no other game   Possible weakpoints (depending on your taste):   - Story plays only a secondary role. Exploration, combat and character management take the main spotlight.  - Recaptures the feeling of oldschool rpg series like no other game. You wonder why this is repeated in the negatives list? Because nowadays we are so accustomed to arrows that point where we have to go and other such luxuries that the transition can be very rough.  - Hard to get going. You have to manage the party, food reserves and find your way in a huge non-linear world. (If you have troubles, try the easiest difficulty.

There is no doubt it pulls a lot of old school design and influence for the making of this game.  The answer is not always obvious, you have to read and think about what each quest is required. Brute force is not always the answer and the answer may not be all that obvious at first. Exploration, attention to detail and understanding solid group dynamics is the key to beating this game. This game takes me back to many old school games like Darklands, the Might and Magic original series and Wizardry.   It uses a top down view for moving around, with the team view for combat, being turn based it really makes you consider tactically what you should do for each fight. Lots of skills for each class to specialize into to make each character distenct with options. Riddles, deadly traps, puzzles and enormous creatures that can kill you with a single blow. It's not for the faint at heart.",

Even though it's polished and has some nice touches, the grind and repetitiveness of it all just got to me.  My advice, good value for money game but don't expect anything special.",

As fans of the Might and Magic or Ultima series can relate, there will be a lot of time spent trying to understand your characters, their skills, their uses, their scaling, their interactions/synergies, and learning a few other tips and concepts that would normally be outside the bounds of common sense(I’m looking at you herb skill). In this day and age that means wiki, guide, and forum reading, rather than the previous trial and error systems, to hammer out the workings of your characters.  But skipping over all the debates of sleeping off death but not disease, low drop rates, or finite xp, it boils down to seeing Lords of Xulima like this:  If you believe 'hardcore' means the game has a million ways to 100% screw you based off one decision you make, this game is for you. If you believe 'hardcore' means the game gives you a 1% chance of beating it and you have to figure out how you want to make that 1% happen, then this game isn't for you.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I did not finish the game, stopped at level 35.  I bought this game on a big sale (summer sale), after reading the reviews, knowing what I'm getting into. Like many others wrote, it was very fun for the first 20-30 hours. After that, the grind kicked in. The story is quite horrible for an old school isometric RPG (I expect a superb story of such games, always) and the combat is very repetitive, so there is very little making you want to keep playing after a certain point. Yes, the game is hard, but I knew that and really enjoyed the combat system/theorycrafting, playing on old-school difficulty.  Pros: +Nice and simple art style (I saw that many dislike it, watch some videos to decide) +Night and day cycle and dynamic weather +Atmosphere +Hard strategic combat +Music is good but a bit repetitive  Cons: -No auto combat like in many turn based JRPGS (would really help with the grind) -Story is horrid -Main character is the weakest class in the whole game, no matter how you build him -Most puzzles forced me to google for answers while alt-tabbed (I don't play isometric cRPGs for puzzles, sorry) -Big class inbalance, you have to do research before creating classes that look/feel good to not end up with a bad choice -Very easy to build any of the party members wrong/bad, making them horrible in combat in an already hard game -Some fights are still cheap even if your party is built perfectly  If you do decide to buy this game anyway, be advised that you will have to read a lot of guides and do lots of theorycrafting while creating your party, in addition to reading about many in-game mechanics, since you are given very little explanation in game about how things actually work. I feel bad for giving this game a negative review, I tried really hard to like it but would like to save other people the time.  I honestly think it's not worth it, there are much better isometric cRPGs out there.",

If you're looking for a throw-away fantasy RPG experience, I guess this'll do, but there really isn't anything at all here of any value beyond that. The game basically consists of finding the next fight that you can possibly survive, surviving it, and repeating that process hundreds of times. There's otherwise not a lot of thought that you can put into it. I don't think the game has a single multi-floored dungeon. It also has some really awful voice-acting, to where you'd be better off voicing things yourself.",

It's old school, I like old school, the old school ruins this game for me.   The game stresses customization and options. You have a party of 6 characters and there are 10 classes to choose from. You have to pick the explorer, but he can be a very different explorer depending on the other classes in the group. This is awesome. But the game is hardcore, very hardcore (old-school). Out of the thousands of possible combinations that should be somewhat viable formations, only a handful are actually survivable, even on easy mode. A couple of the classes are just bad.  Quick-save now, quick-save often. Did something just happen and I want to keep that? Quick-save. Didn't quick-save in the last 2 minutes since your last death, well you're dead again. Running from battles is actually makes up a huge portion of the game. That's why the explorer is MANDITORY. But even running doesn't always save you from certain death.  Read the guides here on Steam. They all explain the game as if every little desicion you make is extremely vital to your success with the game. And that's because it it. There's very little room for waste. There's a food mechanism, exploring is done by quick-saving the game everytime before leaving the main path. You many find nothing, or your may find death. Either way you will be loading the save file.  It's really too bad that the bad outweighs the good for me. This game is fun when it wants to be.",

I just doubt you care, so i give this game a very hard time. But i still gonna try to explain why. 1) The character development is very straightforward once you realize that combat system is based on various status-effects. And they stack. Yes. It was the dumbest idea they came up with, really, the wounds mean penalty for any action in the game and you can stack a hundreds of them on single target. Enemies cant heal the wounds, cant mend their bleedings. 2) The battles. There are a whole lot of them(literally hundreds of them, if not thousands if you willing to clear everything), with no autoresolving feature. You can evade them, but why would you wanna do this? The gameplay idea is that you farm hard untill you get strong enough to face group of enemies blocking the passage to the next location (By the way.. wanna know what you gonna do once you get there? Well.. take a wild guess). So you have to clear out anything getting in your way. Oh yes there are some encounters that you absolutely need to avoid in order to progress, like avoiding patrols while finding a secret passage to the castle but that not happens very often and you have to be brain-dead in order to not realize what you have to do. So it is a grind fest, generally speaking. 3) It is a grind fest that cant even reward you properly. No unique items, no armor sets, no kickass legendary loot. Just some RNG garbage with 30 tiers of materials and some bonus-effect if you get real lucky. Anyway you can always stock-up at stores with the same stuff. 4) Constant backtracking. 5) Idiot main hero, generic and completely linear story with no variety at all. Think 10 times before buying this at full price. Think twice even if you see 75% discount. This game is just not worth it.",

This game also gives you very little direction. I don't need my hand held but SOME indication of where I need to go would be helpful. I had to save, then just run around EVERYWHERE trying to find a new place to go that wasn't blocked off by an 'impossible' (the rating the game gave the monster) fight; or by a random encounter that just wipes my party or a NPC that won't let me pass.

There is dialogue and history told, but I'm unclear what the next step is or what my ultimate goal is. Coupled with the inability to move around the map or powerlevel up to defeat enemies, I'm pretty much at a standstill.   I might try and play now and again and review if anything changes, but honestly, this game is too expensive to recommend. Guess I'll continue looking for a game like this that's actually playable.
