            "review_text": "This game barely gets a thumbs up from be (mainly because its a new concept, nice art, nice music etc.). The biggest problem is that the game is 90% based on luck. No matter how good you are at the game, you always depend on luck to constantly find planets with enough fuel, iron and oxygen. Just be prepared to get frustrated a lot. For example even though you captured an amazing new ship, spent a lot of time discovering new technology, collecting the rare resources to build tech upgrades etc. etc. And then, bam, a random event makes you lose half of your fuel, and you end up in a solar system without any gas planets. Game over in two turns, and nothing you could do about it. This happens A LOT! Unfortunately, the devs don't wanna hear anything about it. check the forums, they wanna keep this game a game of chance, to somehow show you the 'thoughness' of space travel or whatever. I think its sad, the game could be so much better and more skill based... I hope modders will fix it, like it happened with FTL.",

            "review_text": "I expected a less combat oriented FTL. Instead I got 'probe for fuel simulator 2015'.  I really wanted to, and tried to like this game. It starts out promising. You warp around a semi-linear path of stars, exploring planets looking for resources to upgrade your ship and fuel to keep going. It's got text-base events like FTL, limited slots to make you pick and choose what upgrades and cargo you take, a nice soundtrack, and great hand-drawn art style that I really liked.  Unfortunately. The gameplay mostly consists of clicking 'probe' on gas giants to scoop up fuel until your ship is too damaged (orbiting a gas giant damages you), then wasting all the fuel you just mined landing on a rocky planet and pressing 'drill' to scoop up almost, but not quite, enough iron repair the damage you took from the gas giants. Then you fly to the next system to repeat the process in an endless loop of tedium that eventually ends with you running out of fuel with no gas giant in sight, or crashing into a gas giant in a desperate gamble to mine one more load of fuel so you can mine one more load of iron to repair your hull that was damaged the last time you mined fuel.  Meanwhile, the 'game' (such as it is) is also almost 100% pure RNG - significantly worse than FTL. The majority of maps feel like they are completely unwinnable no matter what you do due to bad random layouts, and spending 20 minutes grinding fuel and iron just to die because of something utterly out of your control such 2 bad random events in a row just feels so bad and offputting.  I can't recommend this game, unless you absolutely love tedious grinding and pure RNG combined in one.",

            "review_text": "This game suffers from some very serious flaws. The core gameplay loop of traveling from star to star and mining for fuel or ore is both incredibly tedious, and void of any kind of actual interesting choices.   The way new technologies are earned and used is both incredibly unintuitive and full of randomness, making it so that the player does not feel satisfied at any point during the game. Instead of having interesting gameplay, this game just basically throws random meaningless text at you every jump, with a dice roll for earning or losing some resources.   If you liked FTL, you should SKIP this game for sure.",

            "review_text": "Ever wonder what a crippling sense of hopelessness in the middle of nowhere, where any decison you make could potentially be as much of a boon as it could a crushing blow to your already dwindling chances of survival? Or maybe truely feeling alone; the last of your kind, stranded out in an unforgiving and uncaring universe? Ever wonder what it's like to be... Out There?  This game is best played in a dark, quiet, secluded space. The art in phenominal, and though it still does kind of feel like a mobile game, the changes they made to 'Out There: Ω Edition' are enough to give it an entirely different experience... as if every time you start a new game it isn't already entirely different.",

            "review_text": "Pure RNG if you do not like may not be your thing. The option to bump into your earlier failed runs ships helps along a bit. Playing the game for a few hours is the best advice on how to understand the game. The runs can be quick due to not understanding priorities and the limitations of your ships.  So bought it for half the price and was reading reviews of it being worse than ftl. Sure no combat to speak of but all other things and managing your cargo are important factors. Choosing the right options, getting better ships and finding technology sure make the game rely on luck. At least each playthrough so far has been totally different. To make things interesting you can find old ships you have crashed as well.   For the price the game seems to have a decent amount of replayability and so far i understand only a small part of it so I enjoy it as much as FTL. Getting to the end was easier with FTL =)",
