            "review_text": "Even though this game is over 9 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.  There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!  Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.  There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.  Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.  Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.",

            "review_text": "The successor to Left 4 Dead, this second game adds new maps, new weapons, new special infected with new attacks and even new characters. But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.  Without mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.  Left 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.  If you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.  HOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account. I have over 1500 my private account.",

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 is a hard game to review. The left 4 dead games 'both of them' are games that are unlike anything else I have ever played, they are games that quite literally changed my entire life. These games are the types of games that you can meet people on that will be friends for years to come and these games also have an unreal amount of replay value. you have campaign for the casual players with addon support so you have an almost endless amount of maps to play if you dont mind downloading more, you have versus which can be really fun, but sadly in both games unless you play with friends the community is either tryhards that care too much about winning or people that are so terrible that you wonder how they even got their computer running in the first place. Lastly there is survival, my personal favorite game mode. People in the survival community 'once you actually find the real survival players' are useually a nice bunch of people and its a game mode unlike the other two in a good way once you give it a chance. Honestly both of these games although they both are titled 'Left 4 Dead' are very different and many people i have run into tend to think of one game as simply better than the other, but objectively speaking this is simply not the case. Both games are too different to really make that kind of judgement. Both of these games are games that if you enjoy this type of gameplay, then you could waste thousands of hours on them.  But this brings up the biggest problem with these games, the people in them. Do enough searching and you will find people you can mingle with but the majority of public players in either game regardless of game mode are unbelieveably dumb. In vs also not just the really dumb people but you have the typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s found in any game based around pvp that seem to think that winning makes them more important somehow as a person and don't seem to realize that there is no reward for winning in a l4d games like there is in a competitive game like counter strike or dota with their tournaments.   Campaign is a really casual game mode compared to the other two but still there tends to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game mode too sometimes, people that find joy in joining pub games just to grief their teammates for some reason and then leave without a word. Thankfully this is rare and most people in campaign are either mute or friendly.  Then there is survival, a game mode that brings me more enjoyment but also more frustration than any other mode. In L4D2 it seems to be a collection of people that for some stupid reason refuse to play anything except for the mall map, people that are actually really terrible at it too and can run laps for 100+ min on mall sure but could not get a gold on any other map to save their life. There is l4d1 survival as well which is a dif style of play but the community is dying off because all of the players who have been around a long time have gotten tired of the game and pubs are beyond stupid. Always either people trying to glitch a time or people so bad/dumb you wonder if they were dropped on their head as a baby 5 times.  All in all, You will enjoy the l4d games, both of them if you enjoy co-op based shooters, but you will have to endure a very mixed crowd of people regardless of game, with the first game haveing a somewhat more friendly crowd cause of the smaller community. I would recommend both games if you have the patience to search for people worth talking to or have someone to go into the game with.",

I'm no professional critic, but I can say it's simple enough to understand. Shoot zombies, get inside safehouses, try not to die.  Oh and I love the voice talents.

If it isn't broken, don't fix it! If it's fun, don't change it.  That being said, I didn't feel the characters to be as likeable as the original foursome.

History repeats itself. In Valve didn't begin to invent any fancy plot, it here it is simple to anything. Survived again four, around again the zombie and to reach a quiet place, it is necessary to pass five levels, each of which to a limit is saturated with dangers of death.

As a start, the four survivors found themselves at an abandoned hotel roof by the rescue chopper. This is the start of Dead Center. So, they decided to reach the local mall where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. By their way after finishing correspondence with gun shop owner Whitaker, they discovered that the mall is overrun by infected. At such a situation Ellis helped the group to use a stock car and to travel towards New Orleans, probably the last standing city of America.  The Passing stands in between Dead Center and Dark Carnival just after The Sacrifice. The four of the L4D2 survivors when arrive at the bridge of Rayford they meet Francis, Louis and Zoey. Since they need to cross the bridge so they four found the other way. After fighting their way through a wedding reception of witch bride, the streets and under the river tour they meet up again with the original survivors who provided covering fire while filling up the generator or lowering the bridge.  Dark Carnival starts in a highway completely blocked by ditched vehicles. Starting from there survivors reached at an abandoned amusement park. At the park stadium Coach found a plan to use a large scale light show used by The Midnight Riders to signal the rescue chopper.  Yet bad luck… they found the chopper pilot is infected! Naturally, Nick killed him and it crashed so also Swamp Fever starts. So, crossing the swamps the group finally arrives at plantation mansion and makes radio contact with Virgil, a boat captain. But his boat starts to run low on diesel on the way to New Orleans. Hard rain starts, the survivors go to shore at Ducatel. Crossing a witch infested sugarcane mill finally they get gas from gas station and return back with fuels to signal Virgil.  Virgil drops the group at New Orleans where military is evacuating civilians across a bridge. But the four discovered that the city is completely overrun by infected and so the military is actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by air strike. However, survivors managed to reach the bridge and made contact with the military. Then crossing the bridge they were evacuated by chopper and the bridge was destroyed with the end of The Parish.  All the best so far but the day is important because we have night!!! :) I don’t mean this for zombie apocalypse though!! :) So, foxed? :-D Well, you may encounter various types of trolls (special infecteds? :d), ... ... etc. etc. in the community when you will want multiplayer but just don’t let them feel you down ever to enjoy the thrills of the game because I assure you they are never more than a few. :)  So, don’t you want to experience all these in more details playing the game by your own?

The concept of the game has been clearly very well thought-out and over 400 hours later, i am still drawn to play this game and it never gets old. The campaign missions are great to familiarize yourself with the maps, the settings, the gameplay, the different infected and their distinctive attacks. Everything balances itself out at every turn. But the real strength of this game is its multiplayer. You simply cannot experience the full force of Left 4 Dead, without having played its many multiplayer modes. There are so many different game possibilities and different objectives. It is one of the very few games that can keep me going for several hours, irrespective if i'm tired or sleepy - the adrenaline rush just keeps me awake and the feeling of satisfaction if you work well as a team is simply tremendous.  There are also private game servers which offer even more customizable game modes. The standard versus mode for the official game is 4 vs 4. But on third-party servers, you will encounter 10 vs 10, which changes the game by enabling more chaos and way more fun. I highly recommend that you try it if you ever get tired of the official game modes and want to try something new and even more exciting.",

Plus an add-on workshop to customize your game when it finally starts feeling stale. In terms of play hours per dollar spent, no other game I have EVER played comes close.  So if you're wondering whether to get this game? Get it, especially if you can get it on sale. Even if you only play it a bit and put it aside for other things, you'll probably be glad you have it in your library to play with friends occasionally.",

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 is a game where four survivors attempt to survive and escape the zombie horde. If they survive or not, is up to you, and how you play.  Left 4 Dead 2 manages to be fast-paced in a genre of slow zombie survivals, but it also still manages to retain the tense and stressful nature of the rest of the zombie games. There is no aim down sights in the game, unless you are using a sniper rifle, similar to the rest of Valve's games. Another thing in line with the rest of Valve's work is the lack of regenerating health. In Left 4 Dead 2, players must use first aid kits in order to heal themselves, with adrenaline shots and painkillers acting as 'temporary' health. Much of your survival depends on how well you utilize your first-aid...  Do you save it in case something goes wrong, do you use it on someone else, or do you use it like it's the last chance you'll ever get...? Will you ever find more down the road?   These are the questions you'll quickly ask yourself and the rest of your party as you try to make it through.  Other than the healing items, there are various other items to keep an eye out for as well. Pipe bombs, molotovs, and even a jar of bile. Pipe bombs draw standard zombies to them with a loud beeping sound and a bright red light. In Left 4 Dead, loud sounds will attract zombies, and the pipe bomb in particular will keep them away from you, and will eventually kill them when it explodes. The molotov is a simple but effective weapon in keeping the horde away, it puts down a field of fire and it burns enemies. The last item is the bile jar. It attracts the horde to anything you throw it at, and they'll stay on it for a while, killing whatever it happens to land on. Even other zombies.  The jar is filled with the insides of a boomer, one of the special infected of the game.  The special infected of Left 4 Dead 2 are zombies with unique abilities that will prove deadly to survivors, and will require cooperation or a skilled shot to take down. Perhaps both..  The Boomer is a large zombie that vomits on survivors. This attracts the horde of generic zombies to attack them. However, if the survivors are not careful in dispatching the boomer, it will explode on death and splatter on the survivors, turning a situation from bad to worse.  The Hunter is a fast and agile zombie with a normal body frame, making it slightly harder to distinguish than other special infected when running. However, when it gets into a crouching position, it pounces on survivors and claws them until they die. It can pounce from very high locations to do extra damage, or it can ambush survivors from unexpected places. The Hunter wears a hoodie, and growls when getting ready to attack, screaming loudly when pouncing.  The Smoker is a tall zombie that coughs a lot. That's why you don't smoke, because then you'll get lungs like this guy. Anyways, the smoker has long reach, allowing it to pull survivors around, and into dangerous positions. Smokers will try to pull you into a car alarm to draw the horde to you, or they will try to pull you to another special infected so they can try to pick off another survivor, or maybe they'll just pull a survivor off a ledge, either getting them stuck holding it for their life, or forcing the victim to run all the way back to their group.  The Tank is a large, massive, and powerful zombie that can kill the entire group if left unchecked. They have huge muscles, which makes them an easy target, but it also represents their strength. One punch from a tank, and you'll fly several feet away from the rest of the survivors, and, on high difficulties, it could even end you in one hit. They can even toss rubble at the survivors, giving them a range option, as well as already being lethal in close quarters.  The Jockey is a small zombie, he runs fairly quickly and jumps on survivors, 'riding' them away into danger.  The Spitter is a taller type of special infected that spits acid onto survivors, being an effective long range unit that can deny an area to the survivors, or flush them out. Spitters also drop a pool of acid when they die, making them a bit more dangerous to deal with, especially when you are being pressured by a large amount of zombies.  The Charger is a large zombie that literally charges survivors. They run at the survivors with full speed and once they pick up a target, they continue running for a while, or until they hit something. This makes them very dangerous in situations where they can thrust you off of a dangerous height, or if there's deep water, because they can sacrifice themselves and take you with them.  Now, we've covered all of the special infected, and there's also uncommon infected as well, but I won't go over them here in order to save some space, and they aren't too important anyways.  The gunplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is very easy to get used to. From assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, melee weapons, snipers, and even grenade launchers, players should find it simple to point and shoot at zombies. Headshots are obviously more rewarding, as it will kill them zombie faster, and you'll save some ammo too. There are different deployable ammo types as well, which have different properties. High explosive, for example, will explode!  In Left 4 Dead 2, there are events in the game where you have to do something very loud in order to progress, but they draw a LOT of attention. These are called 'Crescendo Events'. These actions cause a massive attack from the infected, and require the survivors to defend themselves until the action is completed. Some events are gauntlet styled, which require survivors to run, rather than wait. Zombies will keep spawning in these gauntlet styled events, so it's best to move quickly. Also, at the jukebox, there's a song that plays and it says 'All we wanna do is eat your brains', which will also spawn enemies.  When a survivor dies, you can rescue them in closets through the game, or revive them with a defibrillator. However, you can rescue them before that and revive them when they are down. Going down too often without using first aid will result in death, which can be noted when the screen turns grey. Some game modes disable spawning, so it may be suited for super serious players.  At the end of every campaign, there is a final chapter, a finale. In the end, survivors hold out until rescue arrives, and this is the last stand for the campaign. Whoever dies here, is dead at the end, and at least one survivor must escape. Being prepared is extremely important here, as it will require determination from all survivors. Occasionally, the finale will also require the survivors run through another 'gauntlet' styled attack, except the finales are far more dangerous than the standard events, featuring more enemies and lots of special infected.  I recommend getting the game for CO-OP, it's great at what it does, which is being a great CO-OP experience.  For the single players, I honestly have trouble with recommending this game because there simply isn't enough to justify getting it just to play with the AI. The AI is extremely dumb, and they have HORRIBLE reaction times, occasionally letting you take massive amounts of damage before they save you, and not bothering to shoot the special infected, but instead they try to melee them when they are on you, making them waste valuable seconds needed to save your life. There's also not really a real story, other than backstories about the survivors and backstories about the other stuff around you. While some people have grown into the characters of L4D, I personally have not cared about any one of them enough to feel connected with the game itself. The soundtrack is also not really worth mentioning, in my opinion. It has a nice attempt at trying to place a dark feeling, but it's simply average at best. Gameplay also becomes monotonous without friends and workshop content, but you'll get a lot of replayability.",

The introductions from the first game, such as new Special Infected, new weapons and campaigns makes this game a must buy to any gamer. The campaign has the standard maps, which in turn are great, but best played with friends, as the AI are dull in the sense to play with, as they will basically do most of the shooting for you. The Multiplayer aspect to the game, such as Versus will always have people playing and there are plently of servers to play with. A warning though, Versus does get extremly competitive at times and you will want to die inside if you are losing.  Pros: - Improved from the original Left 4 Dead - Extremly balanced gameplay - Great level design  - Guns and Special Infected improved - Fun for everyone. Single player is fun, Campaign with friends is fun and Multiplayer is fun.  Cons: - If you don't have friends then the game can be boring.  - AI on singleplayer will do everything for you. (Can be seen as a good thing, but not entirely) - Hard Rain will make you want to cry and die inside. (Like the witches) - Left 4 Dead was known for being dark and more tense with gameplay, which is completly lacking in Left 4 Dead 2. Only in a few areas is there darkness, but instead you walk down streets completly bright. Only in a minority of maps, such as the swamp maps and when it rains is there any kind of fear.   Overall, the game is a must buy for everyone. Now that is has been a few years, I do suggest only getting it when it is on sale. Playing the game just for the campaign will get you a few hours played, but if you do get into the versus and the competitive game modes, you will be guarenteed a ton of hours played.",

This makes communicating and strategizing much easier and can make the gaming session much mroe enjoyable.   Final thought  If you like zombie games, fast paced shooters or teamwork inspired gameplay, then you will love Left 4 Dead 2. This is a great successor to the first left for dead and does the series justice.",

But this game is worth your time and money.",

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 is a multiplayer zombie FPS game, completely based on teamwork. Let's put this quick and short. You know how in most multiplayer zombie games, you can just leave your team and be the hero? Well, in Left 4 Dead, if you try that stunt, you WILL die. Your team needs to work together to make it through countless hordes of zombies, Special Infected, obstacles, and hardest of all, Tanks. The Special Infected include all the S.I. from the old game, plus three new ones: The Charger, the Spitter, and the Jockey. Here is a list of all the Special Infected and their abilities:  Hunter: Pounces on you and doesn't let go unless killed or shoved.  Boomer: Vomits on you and attracts zombies to you. Explodes vomit everywhere when killed.  Smoker: Constricts you with a long tongue and doesn't let go unless killed or you are shoved. Releases a cloud of smoke when killed.  Spitter: Spits acid at you that cause damage. Releases a pool of acid when killed.  The Jockey: Rides on your head and drags you sometimes into danger or more zombies. Does not let go unless killed or shoved off.  The Charger: Charges at you from a distance and pummels you into the ground. Doesn't let go unless killed.  Two major Special Infected include the Witch and the Tank:  The Witch: a crying Infected woman who, when provoked by either loud sounds, light, or proximity of survivors, will attack the provoker and any other Survivors after her provoker is dead. She can incapacitate or even kill a Survivor in one hit. The Witch was in the first game as well, but Left 4 Dead 2 introduces a variant of the Witch that wanders aimlessly in the open.  The Tank: a gigantic, extremely muscular Infected male with the strength to punch Survivors off their feet some distance, as well as toss cars and concrete slabs. Unless the Survivors work as a team, they will be quickly incapacitated or even killed by the Tank's inhuman strength.  Other enemies include normal zombies, Clowns, Hazmat Suits, Construction Workers, Mudmen, etc. The Story goes like this (This is going to be a lot of information so sit tight and read it all if you want):   The Sacrifice DLC campaign takes place before the main events of Left 4 Dead 2; and after the events of The Sacrifice comic. The original survivors of Left 4 Dead—Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey—arrive at the portside town of Rayford, in order to search for a boat that can take them to the Florida Keys. After finding an adequate sailboat, the Survivors have to manually start up generators in order to lift a bridge for their boat to pass through. One Survivor (canonically Bill) sacrifices himself in order to kick-start a generator once it gives out, so that the others may reach safety. This is the end of Bill's story in the Left 4 Dead video game series.    Left 4 Dead 2 opens in Dead Center (set in Savannah, Georgia), where the four Survivors find themselves abandoned on a hotel roof by rescue helicopters. They decide to head for the local mall, where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. After a brief encounter with a gun store owner, Whitaker (voiced by Dayton Callie), the Survivors discover that the mall is overrun, with all CEDA agents having become either dead or infected as well. Ellis helps the group use a stock car to bust out of the mall and travel towards New Orleans, rumored to be the last standing city in America.   The Passing DLC campaign takes place between Dead Center and Dark Carnival, and after the events of The Sacrifice campaign. The Survivors of L4D2 arrive at the bridge in Rayford, where they meet Francis, Louis, and Zoey. As they need to cross the bridge to proceed, the Survivors need to find another way across to refill the generator with gas. After fighting their way through a wedding reception (complete with a Witch bride), the streets, and a historic under-the-river tour, they meet up again with the original Survivors, who help by covering for the group while they fill the generator and lowering the bridge once it's full.   At the start of the Dark Carnival campaign, the four Survivors find the highway ahead completely blocked by ditched vehicles, and are forced to travel on foot through an abandoned (but still-operating) amusement park. After navigating their way to the park stadium, Coach devises a plan to use a large-scale light show used by a rock band, The Midnight Riders, in order to signal a helicopter pilot for rescue.   After being rescued, they later discover that their pilot has been Infected. When the pilot starts attacking them, Nick is forced to kill him (echoing a similar situation in the first game), causing the chopper to crash into a bayou, the setting for Swamp Fever. Working their way through the swamps, the group comes across a crashed airplane, dead military paratroopers, and isolated swamp villages which had held out against the Infected but were eventually overrun. After spending the morning fighting through the swamp, the group arrives at a plantation mansion and make radio contact with Virgil, a Cajun boat captain who can assist them; however, his boat begins to run low on diesel fuel on the way to New Orleans. As a tumultuous rainstorm approaches (the titular Hard Rain of the subsequent campaign), the Survivors go ashore at Ducatel, Mississippi; make their way through an abandoned (and Witch-infested) sugarcane mill to a gas station to get diesel fuel, and return to signal Virgil with an improvised 'flare'.   In the final campaign, The Parish, Virgil drops the group off at New Orleans, where the military appears to be evacuating civilians across a bridge. On the way there, the four discover the city overrun with Infected, and that the military is actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by an air strike. The group manages to reach the bridge, where they make contact with the military. Judging from their dialogue, the military pilots suspect the Survivors to be 'carriers', similar to the original Survivors of Left 4 Dead. After securing their rescue helicopter, the Survivors lower and cross the bridge, escaping on the helicopter just as the bridge is destroyed. While the Survivors' fate is left unclear after this point, Chet Faliszek, the game's writer, said that the military is taking survivors to cruise ships in the Caribbean in an attempt to escape the infection.  Left 4 Dead 2 comes with multiple modes to choose from. These modes are: Single Player, Multiplayer, Realism, Versus, Scavenge, Survival, and Mutation.  Single Player is your basic finish the campaign and survive. Nothing much more to say.  Multiplayer is the same thing, only with other players instead of bots.  Realism mode makes things harder, like no regeneration and the actual time of helping people up in a horde of zombies.  Versus is one team is the infected and the other team is the Survivors. The survivors have to go through the campaign without getting killed by the zombie players. The teams alternate everytime a safehouse is reached or the Survivors die.  Scavenge is similar to the Dead Center finale, where you have to fill up a take with gas cans. Only in this mode, its not just Dead Center, it's all the other campaigns as well. Just fill the tank with gas. Nothing more.  Survival gives you all the weapons and items, and forces you to try and survive against waves upon waves of zombies. The only objective is to see how far you can get.  All in all, with a fantastic storyline, great multiplayer, unsettling atmosphere, and so much variety, Left 4 Dead 2 lives up to its predecesor, and is a game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys playing with friends and shooting zombies in the face.",

However I can say that I reallly do love this game, it is one of my favourite games to play. I mean I love it so much as soon as I couldn't play it on 360 anymore I got it again on PC. It is one of the best co-op games out there and the game came out in 2009.   The gameplay is incredible and really fun even if you're playing singleplayer. I wouldn't recommend getting the game if singleplayer is your preferable choice because sometimes it can be dull (not to mention how bad the A.I's are on this game). As long as you got some friends to play the game with then I seriously suggest picking up this game.   The only bad point I can think about on this game is the online commuinty. If you slip up once playing a co-op game with strangers you're gonna get kicked, no matter how small the slip up. I once took a medkit and got kicked for that.   Overall though I do suggest to pick this game up, even if the community does suck ♥♥♥♥ for crack money.   10/10",

            "review_text": " This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the  Results  and read from there.   Valve produces one of the most rigorous zombie games ever created. This fantastic first person shooter offers co-operative play which puts you right in the apocalypse that really keeps you on the run.    Story:  Left 4 Dead 2 places you as a character in a movie: Louis, Zoey, Francis, Bill, Coach, Ellis, Nick or Rochelle. Each level is suppose to be a part of a movie which combines into a single story. There are two stories which involve the first four characters or the latter. Eventually the characters from each movie integrate and intermingle joining the two movies together as one. There is a clear start and finish to the story, but as you play the maps online the story gets conveluded and lost. But if you play the campaign in order you will notice connections between all the maps that drive the characters to a set objective. Left 4 Dead 2 is a movie and as such the characters are unrealistically attributed with super human strength, unrealistic accuracy, and cheesy lines all of which are similar to most action movie stars.   Campaign:  Left 4 Dead 2 drops you right into a zombie apocalypse. The campaign consists of both Left 4 Dead 2 and remastered Left 4 Dead levels. The included campaigns are: No Mercy, Crash Course, Death Toll, Dead Air, Blood Harvest, The Sacrifice, Dead Center, The Passing, Dark Carnival, Swamp Fever, Hard Rain, The Parish, and Cold Stream. This can be expanded upon with hundreds of maps created using the editor which sometimes are better constructed than the originals. The brilliance behind this game is that due to a basic AI instructor the zombie placement changes every time you play a level which produces high replay value.   Modding:  Not only can you replay the included levels a plethora of times without being bored, but the workshop allows you to expand upon that and download new maps and mods that make the game better with every adjustment. You can even go to certain websites and download maps created by the community there. I personally prefer to download my maps from community websites as they are easier to install from the website. If you like fast paced zombie games and have some friends to play with this is the game for you.    Gameplay:  Left 4 Dead 2 is a fast paced Zombie first person shooter that involves running between areas to safe houses. Each level has chapters which you must run through, these chapters can either be incredibly long or ridiculously short. You have the choice to take it slow and work your way through the levels in time, or go as fast as you can. Typically teams that go slow do worst because as time progresses they must face more enemies than quicker teams. Hordes of fast moving zombies spawn in ways that can seem endless. Like most zombie games a headshot is much more effective than a chest shot, but enemies can still be taken down either way.    Multiplayer:  One of the epic features about this series is the online multiplayer. In this mode you are pitted as teams undead or survivors. The undead spawn as special zombies and must collaborate to kill off the survivors. Survivors on the other hand must complete objectives or finish chapters without all being perished. The multiplayer is brilliant, although it can be a little less fun if you don’t have someone to play with as this is a heavily team based game.    Results:  If you love zombie games, you like co-op experiences, you understand how to install mods, you just want to be an action hero, or even you just want to play by yourself Left 4 Dead 2 is the game for you. The amazing AI director makes the same map different every time. The bots although not the smartest can make a single player experience fun, and with some mods you can easily switch between players and control the bots if you accidently die. The game is an amazing action thriller that keeps you on your toes and constantly wanting more.   Pros: +Four player co-op campaigns that last at most one hour each +Good graphics and smooth animations +Fantastic zombie feel without seeming too mind-numbing (making zombies intelligent and tactful) +Fun campaigns that blow away realism and just create action packed fun. +Workshop compatible allowing for large amounts of mods and customization +Basic AI so you can play with a single friend without having to join a game online  Cons: -Mods are not perfect and can cause the game to crash (so remember what you installed before each play-through in order to remove defective files) -Bots are essentially mentally handicapped even with Bot Mods -Bots will not use the defibrillator unit -When playing single player the human player cannot switch between bots in order to continue enjoying the game despite their own demise -Some weapons seem excessive and worthless (two different types of pump shotguns) -Poor servers in comparison to the Xbox 360 (I miss mod free servers)",

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

Both the campaign and versus modes are a lot of fun and gameplay can last from around 45 mins to a good 2 hours depending on the map you play. That's plenty of time to have a laugh with your friends via T.S. or Skype (though I prefer TS if playing versus so that each team can have a separate channel)",

Of course, it is most recommended to play as single player or with friends when getting started. As I went through the game, it was neat picking on tips and tricks either learned by other players or things that worked best for me later on.   Special infected are as interesting as irritating, but it is all a part of the game and why it makes things fun.   The characters and plot are great. Everyone seems to have their favorite when playing these campaigns.  Some love and some hate these certain characters.   On the other hand, playing online is a completely different story. Some games go smoothly with little to no issues, while other times a single player can take down their own team or slow them down.  A con would have to be lagging depending on the internet/server.  Another con is that third party servers are irritating when going after achievements. If you're going for achievements, stay way from third party servers they make it harder depending on the group.  It is always important to keep in mind what your skill level as well as everyone else. Join a game/create a game that is best suited for you, joining a game that is out of your league or too easy may hinder your group.  Overall, the game is essentially about teamwork and how others bring out each other's strengths as well as weaknesses. It's a gamble everytime creating a lobby or joining someone's team to see if everyone will carry through to the end.   I highly recommend it, and I hope that this game is just as much fun for others as it has been for me. I apologize for any grammar errors, and thank you for taking the time to read it.",

Once you've played this game, you'll just never stop enjoying killing zombies. Also, this game is relatively cheap (only $19.99 for original price, can wait for discounts too and all the DLCs are included in this price; how convenient! XD) and it doesn't really need high specs. And don't forget that this game has tons of mods to try out to make your gaming experience even better than it is. Overall, a wonderful game that everyone should at least try once in their life. As to whether this is better than L4D1, I would say that the gameplay for this is a lot better but the seriousness and difficulty in L4D1 is higher.   So what are you waiting for? Let's go kill some zombies baby!",

            "review_text": "Ever since 2009 when the only gameplay platform I had was an Xbox 360, Left 4 Dead 2 has always been my favorite game to exist to this day. No game has ever captivated me in gameplay and atmosphere like Left 4 Dead as a series has. Left 4 Dead 2 holds so much signifigance, as it was my gateway into gaming itself. I do believe that without this game, I wouldn't be as into First-Person Shooters or Post-Apocalyptic games as I am now. It's amazing to see that a game I enjoyed back in 2009 is still going strong with a playerbase in 2016, and the game is certainly one of the best games Valve has ever created and Turtle Rock Studios has ever sparked.  Even though it is still going strong, it's a lie to say the game isn't dying. At it's prime, Left 4 Dead 2 had a 161,590 all-time peak (Not including console players), whereas games at it's time like Team Fortress 2 only reached a 110,000 all-time peak. It's very admirable and impressive, but Left 4 Dead 2's community is always steadily declining. However, the workshop has definitely kept a lot of players around, and me being an avid Versus player, I rarely ever run into the same person twice (probably 0.001% of games I've played have been with at most one person I've seen before, and that's only in the late-night hours).  Overall, the game is amazing. Even after 7 years, the game is still amazing and still impresses. If you currently don't own Left 4 Dead 2, you're missing out on gaming history.",

The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was 'The Perfect Game' but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Left 2 Die is a military shooter developed by Bethesda Games Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It's focused around a group of five highly trained military professionals and is known for its high degree of realism and gritty, immersive plot. Unfortunately, the game falls short of excellence for several reasons. First, the game does not let you use iron sights on any of the weapons. This detracts greatly from the realism of the game and makes complex tactics such as Run-And-Gun completely unviable. Second, there are no custom classes or leveling system. The lack of a ranking system, or 'Prestige,' means that there is no sense of fulfillment in the game. You cannot paint your guns different colours to make them distinct and realistic, nor can you unlock stronger weapons, forcing you to spend hours upon hours scavenging for supplies and usable equipment is a complete chore. Additionally, the game lacks prone and sprint mechanics. This is very unrealistic because you cannot lie on the ground and you cannot go fast enough to kill the baddies. Unfortunately, the game discourages teamwork, leaving players with almost no tactical options. This is suprising, considering that the developers at Treyarch have a long history of creating tactical masterpieces. The levels are poorly designed, with no objective other than to make it from staging room to staging room, it is disappointing that Square Enix decided to to develop a tactical modern military shooter with no other objective other than to survive against some deranged terrorist organisation. In spite of the games numerous flaws, the devs at Rovio have truly outdone themsleves in creating a modern masterpiece of storytelling. The narrative in Left 2 Die, the newest game from the renown developer Naughty Dog, is involving and profoundly emotional, moreso than their earlier titles such as 'littleBigPlanet' and the 'First of Them.' The five soldiers all have very unique personalities and the backstory is rich and enchanting. The ending is nothing short of sublime; without spoiling anything, Nintendo has managed to surpass the storytelling sucess seen in thir earlier title, 'Bioshock Infinite.'  The devs at NaVi have truly outdone themselves in their latest game, Left 2 Die. The title is sure to satisfy all types of gamers, from the casual to the hardcore trickshooters, and is literally flawless. Overall, i rate the latest DOTA 2 expansion pack, Left 2 Die, a 10/10, unforgettable.",

Then, in Christmas of 2013, they had the 'free download for a day' promotion. I waited literally hours for the store to stop having heavy traffic errors just so I could pick it back up. I eventually got it, installed it on my laptop, and played it a good bit before uninstalling it in early 2014.  Then, as of last October, I reinstalled it, and now I am back to playing it on a fairly regular basis like I did before 2011.  My point?  This game is a timeless classic. No matter how many times you play it, it is basically impossible for it to get old. Between the procedurally-generated waves of enemies, the countless amount of mods that are around that let you change the entire game into either a living nightmare or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ circus, and so much more, this game will always be an absolute joy to play, especially with friends.  I do not know why I kept trying to get rid of this game. I am fairly certain that I will not be uninstalling it from this point forward, seeing as how I keep coming back to it for more after all these years.  I would fully recommend this game to anyone who asked about it. The  one  problem with the game, though... is that the AI teammates are, more often than not, and for a lack of better words, completely ♥♥♥♥ing useless. You can play offline with bots, but be prepared to carry the ♥♥♥♥ out of your team, since the bots will usually be too lost and confused to be of any real use to you (besides being quality cannon fodder for whatever threats you may encounter along the way).",

Various game modes and mutations to keep the game interesting. Very competitive versus except when a cheater joins the game or when you're just playing with your buddies and getting drunk while playing.  Turn the game into a drinking game even; every time you die drink, every time there's a tank drink, every time you alert the witch drink, every time the map changes drink, every time you as the boomer pukes on all of the survivors drink, every time you spit and hit all of the survivors drink, every time you kill a survivor drink, every time you become the tank drink, every time you charge, jockey ride, or smoker pull a survivor into the witch drink.  As well, contrary to often scrutiny, the vote-kick system is great as it helps players keep trolls, cheaters, and verbally offensive users out of the game. In addition, it is all server-based and anyone can setup a server with ease so the game isn't going to go offline for any reason as nothing about it is centralized.  What I dislike about the game is the lack of developer interaction with the players of the game. I would like to see Valve make the game more accessible for modifications. For instance, a lot of the maps cannot be played on with the game mode set to survival; even if as an admin you do a map change to it, it will simply crash and recycle the server.  My overall rating for this game is 9/10.",

            "review_text": "How do I even start when talking about Left 4 Dead 2?  So. Many. Game. Modes. Too. Many. Things. To. Do. I have about 40-50 something hours on this, as I am writing this review, and I haven't even played all the game modes, and don't even get me on the many mutation modes there are. Although this game overwhelms me with too many game modes, I can assure you that the modes I have played are truly, astounding.   Okay first off, I would like to point out that I play this on really, really low settings. I basically have anything that makes the game look good, turned all the way down. It's because I get a lot of lag. Anyways, the game still looks great. Amazing. The models don't look as nice as on higher settings, obviously, but it still looks great. Especially for a 2009 game. I really couldn't tell that much of a difference on the lower settings. The only thing I notice is how my game runs amazingly, even when there's five explosions going off at the same time.  Yes. The AI is incredibly stupid. It literally takes them ten minutes to kill special infected. But when they're not in trouble, they just go around aimbot and all, and steal all your kills. This isn't as annoying now, but it's still pretty annoying, like Rebecca Black. Most of the time though, you're playing with your friends and all, but warning to those who wish to play single player, DON'T, unless you are testing something.  Campaign: So there's lots of campaigns to complete. Including campaigns from Left 4 Dead 1 (if you wanna call it that...). I'm pretty sure I haven't even completed all the campaigns yet. So you play as 4 survivors, Coach, Rochelle, Nick, and Ellis. According to the opening scene, the people who were 'supposed' to rescue them left without them. So in the very first campaign with the 'new' survivors, you basically just try to survive to get to the last chapter in which you get rescued. Kind of... And that's basically the story line for everything. Now, although that sounds incredibly blan and boring, it's not. Yes. The story line is pretty linear, but the story doesn't even matter. The only thing that matters is the gameplay, and the funny remarks the survivors make throughout the campaign. Great fun, especially with your friends.  Mutation: Okay. So mutation is kind of like a special mode where special rules are applied. For instance, there is a mutation where the only weapon you can use is a chainsaw. So you go around with a chainsaw with unlimited 'ammo' so to speak, and slice zombies into pieces left and right. There are many more mutations, and I've only played a handful of them.  Versus: There's eight people who play in one server, 4 play as the normal survivors, trying to get through a normal campaign, the rest play as the infected. This is equally fun and rage inducing. I play this mode often. I think it's harder for the survivors to complete the mission in this mode. Just a little unbalanced, but it doesn't matter who wins when you're playing with your friends.  Scavenge: Now, I've only played this once or twice. From what I've played, you need to collect gas tanks to fuel a generator. It works in rounds, and is kind of a spin-off of versus, if you want to put it that way. There are two teams, one plays as infected, the other as survivors. The survivors collect as many tanks as possible. And when the timer for that round runs out, the team who were infected, now play as the survivors, and try to get more tanks than the other team. This mode is pretty fun, but I think I prefer regular versus better.   There are more modes, but I have either not played them, and/or do not want to go into SO much detail about the game. This is one of my favorite games on Steam. An amazing game from top to bottom. Graphics look good for an older game, physics are good (even though the shotguns are a little OP). Got this for free on the Steam Christmas sale, if you didn't, I wouldn't hesitate to pick this game up for 20 bucks. Overall, amazing game, with realistic features.  ~Krystal~",

There are a lot more pros such as destroying people with your friends or very rarely unless your ♥♥♥♥ vice versa. Lmao. There are configs in l4d2. Which allow you to participate in 'promod' it's a style of vs that makes the game more challenging for survivors. Not just rush to saferoom deal. You are restricted to T1 only and pills. Mollies and pipe bombs and boomer biles are just more uncommon to find. It makes the game more intense the higher tiers you go up, steam groups are how you get into promod servers. Or you can join off of a friend that's in a good. All together if you see this game on sale. I highly reccomend it especially if you enjoy FPS that have some strategy especially if you play with friends or people that aren't as toxic as the community. 10/10 have bought this game twice.

So we all talk about 4K gaming, and all of this graphic intensive processing, faster machines, better performance, over-clocking and dinner at the local diner after a hard day at work. What most forget, however, are the emotions and experiences behind old video games, which don’t have all this fancy new technology being implemented into it, games that don’t have HD resolutions and frame buffering mechanics.   Now, Left for Dead 2. The predecessor of the original zombie first person shooter by valve, which caught the attention of millions of gamers worldwide. Left for Dead 2 is a zombie first person horror survival game. The game follows the story of four new hero’s, fighting their way through many infected human beings with the green flu. Unsure of how it started, but very obvious of the developing stages of “Zombies” such as the new special infected (Jockeys, Chargers, ect.)   The game itself is certainly an experience to have, with good physics, and even better zombie animations, you can shoot, smack and run away from the seemingly endless hordes of infected that come at you. Fight, survive, and help others who go down! But don’t let the whole team go down, or you’re in trouble!   Memories are certainly made with this game, and for a video game that is four and half years old, it’s impressive how much detail and effort has gone into this game.   Fight, survive, and get to the chopper!   I absolutely recommend this game. And if you don’t want to buy it, wait for the major holiday sale! It goes up for free!

And more new features such as: Melee weapons (to kill those zombies with one hit: that include: Baseball bats, frying pans and more). Sometimes players can find Defibrillators, with which which can help you revive killed Survivors, because once dead, a Survivor remains dead in Versus mode and Campaign Mode. (no more finding survivors behind locked doors!)  And in addition of the Boomers, Smoker and Hunters there are now 3 additional Special Infected: The Jockey, Spitter and the Tank's little brother, the Charger. And in Left 4 Dead 2, the Witch walks around and you'll have to avoid walking into her by accident...or through panick as you try to avoid the other Special Infected!

Also i quite often have to headshot common zombies several times before they die. Has anyone else had ths? It's confusing but all in all a really great game!

It is superior to its previous installment as it includes additional campaigns featuring said characters but otherwise gameplay wise is similar. The game is a first person shooter with co-op focus where the objective is to survive from point A to point B navigating creative levels and hordes of zombies. The game is best experienced in multiplayer format as the friendly AI is rather useless, and it adds much to the experience playing with players. There is a moderate variety of missions and gamemodes with some special modes and custom maps adding additional interest to the title once you grow tired of the core campaign. Versus mode is also a great treat, whereby two teams take turns playing as the survivors and the 'special infected' (strong specialized zombies), this mode is challenging and will keep players coming back for more. It has something for both single player and multiplayer gamers, although the experience is heavily multiplayer biased. Overall this game is a popular title with solid gameplay, it gets a full recommendation.",

Also, this game is relatively cheap (only $19.99 for original price, can wait for discounts too and all the DLCs are included in this price; how convenient! XD) and it doesn't really need high specs. And don't forget that this game has tons of mods to try out to make your gaming experience even better than it is. Overall, a wonderful game that everyone should at least try once in their life. As to whether this is better than L4D1, I would say that the gameplay for this is a lot better but the seriousness and difficulty in L4D1 is higher.   So what are you waiting for?

So enjoy all the gameplay chips in the form of excellent team work, it can only be together with other players.      2. Battle PVP.      In a multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential and the idea of the game. Talent Team infected heap, someone knows how to pour the survivors of vomiting, while others choke the language, well, someone just ♥♥♥♥ing shoot. All the fun in this lies. Under the bot can already tune, but under real players net.Oni can cheat, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes and act outside the box.       3. The atmosphere and realism.      Valve is well tried, the graphics in the game match for her elegant atmosphere. The dark and empty streets, ruined houses, abandoned hospitals and airports, it all looks very good. Immediately evident that the developers have worked all the details.       Minuses:      1.

I haven't played much scavenge but it's OK. Mutations would be cool if people actually played them. Realism is a good challenge, especially on Expert Realism. Realism versus is almost a rebalancing of versus but in my experience, it favours the infected. This game is best played with friends, as there is griefing and trash talking. You can turn off voice chat and all that, but that messes up communication, so you're best off kicking them or leaving (most of the time).  This game is seven years old and still has a pretty decent player base, take that as you will. It has had a few Free Weekends and even on one weekend, it was free to permanently keep. Just don't play versus when you start off. Play campaign and then you can apply that knowledge to versus. If you go straight into versus, expect trash talking and kicks A LOT; the L4D2 community is not forgiving to noobs. Even if you've played campaign a fair amount, you will still find versus quite difficult to get into, as you have to figure out and learn the chokepoints and metastrategy (general strategy - knowing how to adapt, when to attack etc.). L4D2 versus players, for the most part, won't hold your hand. Unfortunately there's no noob servers so you either have to just keep playing and deal with the (not THAT many) kicks or go on YouTube for help. Generally speaking, you're better off by starting to do do some campaign to nail down the basics and get some intermediate knowledge (which you can then apply to versus) and look up some YouTube videos about how the infected work.  I would recommend this to those looking for a fun, casual game that has (some) depth to it. It's a linear game so don't expect that much depth, but the teamwork and coordination required, in the higher difficulties and even against good versus teams, cannot be understated. The gameplay is satisfying, the game runs on a toaster and is very well optimized. It's cheap, on sales at least. If you still haven't played this game and you enjoy zombie games, you really shouldn't pass up on this one.",

The graphics are beautiful, made by pastels and look natural and supernatural, the game has it's certain humor with Ellis and Louis if you play the revamped L4D maps, remember, shots for Ellis and pills for Louis. As far as I'm concerned I haven't noticed many glitches except for the part in the survival map in which people grab the grenade launcher and shoot people from underneath, sending them flying up. Or that might be patched, but I still remember it from the days I played L4D2 back during my Console days. If you don't like working as a team, this game might prove to be difficult for you, because if you play normal to expert the game relies on your sole teammates to pick you up once you go down, trust me, tanks and hordes won't stop charging because you're shooting it. Yes though, buy this game, it's amazing, it's fun, even my mother played it with me and enjoyed it even though she didn't know how to do anything.",

Even there are new zombies and maps and mods the game still has its old fashioned shoot and shove strategies and gamemodes  The new survivors Nick,Coach,Ellis and Rochelle knows how to shoot like the old fashioned survivors and their personalities are very unique Nick, a gambler, a con artist, taking the role of the complainer he always finds fault in other people's plans  Ellis, a junior mechanic by trade in the city of Savannah hes presents himself as a gaming country guy who seems tobe fond one of Valve's games Team Fortress 2.Ellis is also easily distracted as they meet the 'Left 4 Dead' survivors he becomes fond of Zoey even while chainsawing through zombies.  Coach, is a High-School health teacher and coach of the freshman foorball team before the infection hit his hometown of Savannah, he is the motivator and finds enjoyment to motivating his fellow survivors.  Rochelle, is a employed associate producer on a television news station is which role she was sent on assignment to Savannah to cover The Infection's breaking story .   The new infected, Charger, Jockey, and Spitter have new methods able to use against survivors than the older zombies  The Charger, is a special infected that has a way to instantly kill survivors by charging at them and taking them down the ocean. The Charger was called a 'Mini-Tank' by some players because of its gigantic right arm and scratch damage.  The Jockey, is one of irritating special infected because of its ability to 'ride' survivors and lead them to another path. The Jockey can move one survivor away to lead the others to the same survivor and away from their objective.  The Spitter is one of the best special infected, because of its power to spit acid it is useful to infected that pins down survivors, for example: If a smoker was killing a survivor but the survivor's buddies are heading its way the spitter can spit its acid and do MASSIVE damage enough to kill the survivor quick before its buddies reach the corpse.  Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best sequels to video game history. Buy this game if you wish to eternally enjoy killing zombies with Chainsaws or Grenade Launchers",

You would be hard pressed to find another video game that will give you the entertainment value for the price.  Even though I have owned both of the games in the series for many years now, I still play them from time to time because they are still that FUN and satisfying. Alot of games have tried to copy the Left 4 Dead style, but none have captured it and got it right like Valve has.  This game is simple to learn and play for anyone in any age group, This is one of those games that transcends age groups and the whole family plays it together. Even my wife who hates video games likes playing together with the family to survive the Zombie Apocalypse as a family unit.",

The survivor characters are well fleshed out and have interesting, and sometimes funny interactions with one another. The random spawning of commom, uncommon common, and most importantly special infected provides a surprise around every corner.  I wouldn't recommend a purchase just for the versus modes.

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 is the sequel to Right 2 Alive, a game that no one asked for or liked. In this game, you and up to 3 friends/coworkers you feel pressured to do something with/random people on the internet (one of whom is probably a serial ♥♥♥♥♥♥) can experience all the fun of attempting teamwork for about five minutes, then having someone run ahead of everyone else the second more reanimated corpses (AKA Grateful Dead fans) than can be easily dealt with appear, leaving the rest of the team for dead.   Hence the name.   A former football coach who desperately yearns for cheeseburgers, a rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose fancy suit stays relatively clean throughout the game, a good ol' country boy who is slightly not smart, and the strangest of all, a girl, band together in an attempt to reach New Orleans, where an evac center is located, in the wake of a worldwide epidemic that turned many people dead and then undead. The base game is divided into 5 chapters, which are further split into around 5 sections, in which the goal is to get from safehouse to safehouse, which are enclosed spaces where the dead people can't eat your face.    Miraculously, all of the characters became expert marksmen the day that ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan, enabling them (which, by way of video game logic, enables you) to use a not incredibly wide variety of firearms that are handy for making the undead redead. They are also all able to bench press a formidable amount of weight, seeing as they/you can also use some melee weapons, ranging from baseball bats and axes to guitars and cricket bats, to detach formerly alive people's heads from their torsos. By killing a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of zombies, performing the occasional lever pull or button press, doing some assorted tasks, and not letting your squad get eated, you make it to the next safehouse. And your reward? More zombies, more levers and buttons, more assorted tasks, and more safehouses, along with more opportunities to get a leg up on your teammates and zip halfway across the map before getting bogged down by the infected, and then whine about how you weren't saved by your teammates when they were barely out of the safehouse door. Fun!   There are some special snowflakes amongst the reanimated crowd that make your team's lives far less pleasant. These include a midget that rides you like an epileptic horse, a fat guy who is in dire need of some Pepto Bismol, some girl with a really long neck that ejects acid from her mouth, a dude who has one disproportionately large arm on account of whacking it too hard who slams you into crap, and some guy with a really long tongue that smoked too much back when he was a regular person. There are also crying girls that flip out at your attempts to comfort them, and a cousin of the guy who whacked it too hard that is on an alarmingly large amount of performance-enhancing drugs (he was probably a former baseball player). If you spot them before they can do too much damage and take them out relatively quickly, they really aren't that big of a deal, but rest assured, at least one of your teammates will find a way to get killed by them and yell at you for not saving them.    Along with the main co-op campaign, there are also several other modes to play, the most interesting of which being Versus. In Versus, you either play as one of the dudes from the campaign or get put on a team of the aforementioned special snowflakes. As a dude from the campaign, you have to make it to the end of one of the campaign levels. As a special snowflake, your job is to simply be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the campaign dudes and see that they don't make it to the end of the level by using your special snowflake powers. It's a fun addition to a game that would already be great.   In conclusion, if you don't already have this game, it would be advisable to pony up the $20, grab some friends, and then scream at them for being dumb/ leaving you for dead. The zombie killing is fun and gory (though the zombies feel a little paper-thin) and working as a team feels great during the 1% of the time where everyone actually works as a team. This game also includes a sixth chapter, as well as all the chapters from the first game, rendering the first installment obsolete.    Lastly, if none of that convinced you to get this, there is a mod that turns the tank into Shrek.   9/10. Buy it, you weiner. ",

The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and, more bizarrely, Bristol City Council, provide advice with dealing with reanimated corpses.  Buy handcuffs and a stun gun  We don’t have guns in the UK, so Bristol City Council recommends improvising weapons to deal with both the infected and the undead.  Stock up on supplies  America’s Centres of Disease Control suggest zombie outbreaks are much like any other pandemic – so ‘waiting out’ periods of acute infection, with a big stock of supplies, is a good strategy.  Wait for the government to find a cure  According to CDC plans, they ‘would conduct an investigation much like any other disease outbreak’ if ‘zombies did start roaming the streets’.  Buy a protective suit  Buying an Ebola-style protective suit is a good idea, Bristol’s City Council suggests .  Isolate your family somewhere safe America’s Centre for Disease Control director Dr Ali Khan notes: “If you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse you will be prepared for a hurricane, pandemic, earthquake, or terrorist attack.”   ",

The Bad:   - The Versus community is full of kick-happy tryhards that will basically find any excuse to kick you within seconds of joining the game. I personally don't play Versus but see lots of complaints from other users about the same related issue. My advice: Stay away from Versus mode unless you're playing with friends. Stick to Campaign &amp; Survival for the most fun when playing alone. Of course always be careful though, some people can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not help you at all when you're pinned. (In campaign mode too!) - Most of the time Valve screws up private/friends-only servers when players are using their own skins/mods. - Can't shove Chargers, and they have 800 health. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it Valve. - Some map hitboxes suck and might accidentally lead to your death.    The Ugly:   - Realizing that the AI are more useful than other actual players who feel the need to rush every level than help others.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

It is a co-op focused game where 4 players have to run through waves of zombies in order to get to the safe zone located on the other end of the map and eventually escape the area. The game also has other multiplayer modes like Versus, Survival and a few others.  Every campaign in L4D2 can be played online or singleplayer with bots. These campaigns have multiple stages that can be played individualy. The story told throughout the campaigns is very simple and nothing worth bothering about. The game as plenty of weapons both firearms and melee weapons that are all very fun to use. The Source Engine once again creates a nice looking game with it's own slow-aging and pretty graphic style.  This being a Source game, it has a lot of community-created content that you can find in the Workshop. You can get anything from there: a Bin Laden skin for the Witch, Minecraft zombie skins, the Helm's Deep map, you name it!  Even though the game is focused on the online co-op, I played the whole thing with bots and I never felt like I was missing out on anything or like I had a disadvantage. The bots are actually great, they always revive you, they are very good at shooting, they will heal you when you need it, they can use any weapon, they call out special zombies... So you can play alone if you want. My favorite multiplayer mode is by far the Versus mode where a team of player-controlled special zombies tries to stop the survivor's team. The other modes are OK but nothing special. The biggest flaw of this game (in my opinion) is really the fact that the co-op is way too simple and can be played with bots. I much prefer a more complicated co-op game like Payday 2 where you really have to employ some teamwork if you want to survive. L4D2 is just run and gun and expect your teammates to not be super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...or play with bots, they never fail.  If you just want to kill some zombies, this is a great game. If you want to do that with friends, it's also a great experience. If you're looking for the best co-op game in the market, there are far better games that this one.

There's so much timeless fun and enjoyment to be found within the series, such a high replay value and intense, gripping action that begins right from the start, up until the bloody end. Very bloody. With a few limbs lying around. Some heads here and there as well.  One of the absolute best parts of Left 4 Dead 2 (and the first one too, really) is the community. Of course, as with any community, one is most certainly bound to encounter a bad apple or ten, but that's to be expected if they have experienced online gaming before. The good definitely outweighs the ugly, though, as the community is the very heartbeat which keeps this game alive to this day. With new, mostly superb mods coming out all the time, different fun ways to play and new, goofy things to mess around with, different character models, all-new weapons and so, incredibly much more, players are always finding amazing ways to keep our beloved franchise thriving. There is also a great deal of hilarity that will ensue at certain times which only makes the game that much better.  It's not often I can say this about a modern game- while I do enjoy a great deal of them - but this is a sheer instant classic that I urge everybody to try at least once, even if they wind up disliking it in the end.",

Games in Left 4 Dead 2 are never the same because the environment changes randomly (and it's very accentuated with the Versus Mode because all players play differently in each game). I recommend really this game to players who love games based on Survival Horror, FPS, Action &amp; Cooperation ! You will not regret this game for this price !

Plutôt accessible pour son prix, ça vaut la chandelle de l'acheter, mais je vous conseille d'avoir une carte graphique qui ne date pas de Jésus Christ avant de l'essayer quand même (même si ca va de soit ^^). La clef de réussite de ce jeu ? La coopération : attention aux personnes préférant les jeux multijoueurs où chacun fait ce qu'il doit faire, ici, l'entraide est primordiale, ce n'est pas du Resident Evil où vous faites votre nettoyage de zombies tout seul. Là pas question, vous jouez à quatres, vous restez à 4, sous peine de mort instantanée si vous n'êtes pas un joueur avancé. Enfin bref, pour résumer, mêlant Survival Horror, FPS, Action &amp; Coopération, ce merveilleux jeu plaira sûrement aux personnes qui aiment ces catégories.",

Best performance of the adventure can be achieved with a large screen and a headphone. The settings command also allows you to enhance the sound that is played throughout the game. This is way different the the first game, the scenario, the environment, and the plot. I am totally proud of the game makers, because of their capability of creating different version of each campaign, as they have successfully make each of them unique and difficult in each other's ways. I am very interested in the Hard Rain campaign, in which you can challenge yourself to a harder mode while darkening the screen, which can also be found in the options menu.

It's an excellent cooperative game that puts teamwork above all. There is a relatively vast array of weapons to choose from. (The chainsaw is very fun to use.) The characters each have their own unique personas and, by holding down X, you can choose emotions for them. It simply makes them say sassy things (don't even get me started about Rochelle). There is Versus mode, where you actually get to play as the zombies and the other team (Versus is 4v4) plays as the survivors, and it switches off. Survival mode is the classic and arguably most exciting mode. In this mode, you simply fight waves and waves of zombies until you die, and despite sometimes (no, often) getting frustrated, you will want to keep retrying and rethinking your strategy to effectively fight the zombies while keeping your teammates alive. The L4D1 maps are included and their characters are playable for those specific maps. Excellent game.",

It's a little twitchy and arcade-style, and the horde is sorta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But it is very much fun and can be a very social game.  This game defines cooperative multiplayer. DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME SINGLE-PLAYER. EVER. It is completely not worth it. This game is best played with three other friends, but you can also find good teammates in the wild. Playing with three complete strangers is preferrable to playing alone.  If you don't already have this game...well, you're probably not even on my friends list. But if you are, get L4D2. I'll play any time.",

L4D2's A.I. is pretty wonky and unreliable sometimes. This considers your co-op partners as A.I.'s, but also the monsters(/zombies). The A.I. of the Boomer, for example, could be a lot sneakier, making it more of a challenge towards players.  As for your 'partners', even though they don't do damage to you (or shouldn't), it too often occurs they hit you and you kind of flinch. Or they stand in your way (by accident?).  Besides all of that, the game is very fluent. The way you walk, the action, the storyline and even the surroundings. The environment throughout the storyline keeps changing, keeping the player's interest. The A.I.'s are pretty decent, the enemies have nice designs, every category has their own special abilities, making every zombie special in their own way. I especially like it that you have the ability to also hit enemies off of you when they're close, say when you need to reload or don't have the correct weapon/item selected yet. The hit pushes them back, giving you some time.  As for multiplayer the difficulty level seems to raise a bunch, because now you do have smart, thinking opponents, being able to be all sneaky. So if you want a challenge, a very difficult challenge at that, then I would suggest you start multiplayer immediately :)  Be it single player, Co-Op, multiplayer... Always try to stick together and have fun, because it is a very enjoyable, dynamic and fun game to play.  There is so much more I could say about this game, but I'll keep it at this. Hope you enjoy.",

This sequel brings new weapons, players, maps and undead to the table over ther first Left 4 Dead. The graphics took an upgrade with a Source Engine update and OpenGL support meant, Valve found ways to increase FPS on machines. There are a wide range of game modes, BUT sadly this game is let down by AI and its basically Left 4 Dead 1 with new content.  I just so happened to die and they crowded around me for 5 minutes doing nothing. I had to kill one to trigger the revival.   Another let down is the Steam Workshop. This holds loads of mods, and maps, but the official servers need to be running the map in order to enjoy custom maps with friends. And after a while, the same old maps just get boring.  Still, the added features give this game a Yes from me.",

The levels aren't as replayable as the ones from Left 4 Dead 1, which kind of defeats the purpous of the whole replayablility aspect L4D is built off of.  And the special infected are more annoying than challenging.   The Jockey just seems like a more aggravating rehash of the Hunter. The Spitter is supposedly a crowd control type class, stopping players from camping in one spot; but camping, at least from my experience, was never an issue in L4D. And the Charger; what a big tub of ♥♥♥♥. The most useless and annoying new special infected. Just a poor mans version of the tank, just designed to make players rage if he charges you and carries you off a high ledge. Normally, I wouldn't of even of installed it.

            "review_text": "Score: 9/10  Left 4 Dead 2 takes all of the aspects of the original Left 4 Dead that we all know and love and improves upon them. The singleplayer/co-op campaign mode is incredible, and you'll find yourself starting to get more and more into the story as the game progressess. There are many maps with multiple different subzones in each, giving the world quite a large feel. The AI is, for the most part, pretty damn good, and works well for both the infected and survivors. The combat is very simple and comfortable, and is a hell of a lot of fun. Other than the co-op, the main reason for playing L4D2 is the multiplayer. You play through the same maps as you do in the campaign, but with the twist of one team controlling the special infected. This may seem like a clunky idea at first, but in practice is one of the most enjoyable multiplayer modes I've ever played. It's so simple, but at the same time there can be a lot of strategy from both teams to try and secure the win. Playing as the survivors against infected controlled by other players gives you a feeling of being hunted, expecting them to be around every corner or lurking in the dark behind you at all times. At the same time, playing as the infected is my personal favorite aspect of the game. You feel like a hunter chasing your prey, and when you manage to pull off a good attack, it is very rewarding.   The amount of content in this game is huge, with both the maps from the original game as well as the new ones, in addition to user-created content on the Steam Workshop. There is just so much to do in this game, and I love every bit of it. There's just endless replayability, and age hasn't hurt this game in the least. If you want a zombie game that you can put a lot of hours into, and have a great time solo or with friends, this is the one for you.",

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 by Valve brings some new gameplay elements into the post-apocolyptic Infected slaying. Four new survivors: Coach, Nick, Ellis and Rochelle. And three new infected: The Charger, which charges into your team, capable of knocking them all down and grabbing one of the survivors, slamming it repeatedly into the ground. The Spitter, which spits acid goo from her deformed mouth, which, in the beginning is not that harmful, but is capable of decapicating survivors in mere seconds. When she dies, she leaves a puddle of her acid goo around her body. Also the Jockey, a small infected cackling like a madman and jumping onto a survivor's back and steering them into danger. It also includes a female model of the Boomer, a new version of the Witch, the Wandering Witch, which (no pun intended) is less dangerous than the sitting Witch, as she is easier to avoid. All new Uncommon Infected, CEDA workers, which wear hazmat suits, are immume to fire and potentially drop Boomer Biles (a new throwable, which send Common- and Uncommon Infected at a certain location and even other Infected). The Worker Infected, which isn't attracted by the pipe bombs. The fallen Survivor, which drops a molotov cocktail and a med-kit. The Clown Infected, which draws other Infected near him, with the noise of his squeaky shoes. The Mudmen, which can blur your vision with mud. And the Riot Infected, which can only be killed by an attack from the back.  Furthermore, it adds melee weapons, which are very handy for crowd control and brand-new Mutations. Which bring all new game modes to Left 4 Dead 2. And last, but not least, it's compatible with the Steam Workshop.",

So in short (and other stuff I forgot to mention)  Pros +Workshop support +Great variety of weapons +AWESOME characters and missions with random apperances of special infected and weapons so no 2 playthourghs  +Easy to understand gameplay and concepts  Cons -Most the communtiy has the heads stuck in story missions and versus mode so don,t expect many people in the other game modes BUT THAT DOSEN,T MATTER because those 2 modes are 2 awesome not to be ignored -I takes too long for my mods to load BUT THAT JUST ME -YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW AND NOT BUYING THIS GAME!

Never fear because this sequel greatly surpasses the quality of the first game in every way. If you are unfamiliar with the franchise you control 1 of 4 survivors in a zombie apocalypse fighting their way through hordes of the undead from safe room to safe room that all act as check points. The game gives you Health Packs, weapons, and even syringes full of adrenaline. The game also adds 5 brand new campaigns and even the campaigns from the first game as a DLC. another marked improvement over the previous title is the inclusion of melee weapons to help you kill the undead. That's basically what this game is, a zombie killer simulation. No one plays this game for the story they play it to kill zombies. The presentation is great too. The music makes you pumped to kill them zambies, and the facial scan technology makes the models facial movements look amazing. This game is a great find and proof sequels can be better than the original. After having not played this game for a week you will be itching to play it again. I can safely say this is a 8.2/10.",

            "review_text": "I wasn't used to zombies and fps in general (or maybe some cs from time to time) but Left 4 Dead 2 is something. The mechanisms are basic but yet this game has something special that other games don't.   As a survivor, you have a large panel of weapons to rip off your enemies, going for the Chrome Shotgun (&lt;3) to the almighty Grenade Launcher (&lt;3) and I'm not forgetting the Melee weapons which, in my opinion, are the infected's deadliest foes (beating a hunter with a Frying Pan is such an '♥♥♥♥♥♥'). You may also use consumables such as a Molotov to take care of hordes of zombies or to set a tank on fire, or an adrenaline shot to get some extra health and action speed. The most important thing in this side is the teamwork : you always need to know where your mates are and be ready to save them as soon as they are in trouble (so should they). Indeed, in versus, the infected also work together to deal you as much damages as possible in synchronized attacks.  In conclusion, the key to the survivor's success is : Team Spirit. If you don't have it, you won't win.  As an infected, you may play as different kind of specials : Hunter, Jockey, Charger, Smoker, Spitter, Boomer or Tank. Each of them have specificities but I won't go into details as it would require a lot of time to explain. Anyway, the infected share the same point of view as the survivor. Your goal ? Kill them. You must use your environments and the abilities of your mates together in order to deal damages to their team and ultimately, defeat them. A regular strategy is to get a lone survivor while other infected cover him by distracting the others. Another, more common to experimented players, is to set up a 2, 3 or 4man strat in order to INSTANTLY kill a survivor (death charge in No mercy's finale). Anyway, remember that the teamwork is the way to succeed. Think carefully, act decisively. The other team won't let you beat them that easely.  Due to some prices drop, more new players buy the game. That's a good thing. The problem is that they want to get straight into the really challenging content (which is versus). Please, listen. Even if you have been playing fps for years, even if you have beated Garrosh Hellscream in Heroic before the nerf (World of Warcraft), if you are new to this game then you should (= MUST) go to campaigns first. This way, you'll start being familiar with l4d2 : bashing, aiming, infected abilities, events, etc. I suggest playing at least 100 hours in campaigns, asking the more experimented players for advices, reading some guides. Versus isn't a playground. I, to be honest, hate being confronted with those newborn survivors who do not know the words 'Synchronized' or 'Team Spirit', who are just leaving their mates behind, who are attacking brainlessly. No. Please, Versus remains some serious business. Of course you can have fun in there, I do and I enjoy playing with different players, but you NEED some experience before going into that battlefield where the other team won't let you get a rest and rip you off like Peanut Butter Jelly bread.  *cough* I sounded kind of harsh there but back to the point. Left 4 Dead 2 is a really enjoyable game. You get to know new people. The mods are original (unlimited ammo on M60, yay !) and you may wander in the workshop for some cool stuff (such as having Ellie's model - The Last of Us - instead of Zoey or new weapons skin). I recommend this game to every player who likes the thrill of the fight. As a finisher, remember these words : Have fun, Have the Team Spirit.   See you in l4d2 !",

The game is a blast if you can get three other friends to play with you, especially when you have mods on! The only things I don't like about this game (which applies to any zombie game) is when you are just swarmed by like 30 zombies and if they hit you when you try to get away, you can hardly move. Also, if you're new to this game (like I sort of am), one thing you have to keep in mind is 'Don't be a hero.' Different kinds of zombies can pin you down, making you unable to use your weapons so it is essential to stay fairly close in a group. I give the game an 8/10 just because of the two issues I personally have with the game. It's well worth it if you got some friends who want to play it.",

It features new maps and a new cast, along with new specials and weapons; this all blends to make an incredible game to play with your friends. The campaigns are all well made, and the game is just a ton of fun to play with friends in campaign; however, be warned that the versus aspect of it may be very offputting. In versus you take control as survivors and infected, taking turns to make more points and win. Unfortunately many people who play this mode are bad, and as a result it can be frustrating to find a good match. Another problem is that actually learning versus. Naturally one should play the campaign to learn the maps, but this isn't enough. Learning good spots as infected, knowing the best pace, etc. Many of these tactics aren't necessary to beat campaign, and usually only help in versus. And when a player doesn't know these things the player will probably get kicked very quickly. Learning the game is hard enough with enemy teams that are usually stacked well with veterans, but when you're also watching for kicks it only makes it worse. However, if you can keep at it WITH FRIENDS, the versus can be enjoyable and good fun. Overall though, the strong and very enjoyable campaigns and survival make up for versus' varying degrees of enjoyability. It's only $20, and it will be well spent.",

I've never been a fan of the Source Engine crosshair at all and have become rather fond of the white dot that Rockstar tend to use in their games recently.

This game can be made twice the fun by browsing the mods and skin packs created by the L4D community, some of these will have you in stiches but others a little loud and tedious.

            "review_text": "Since I'm approaching the 1000 hours, something that's never happened to me with any other game, I thought i'd write a review.  Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the games with gameplay that is suprisingly simple, but can be very difficult to master. Fun for beginners and pros, but only when the teams are balanced. Since it's all about teamplay, there's little fun to be had if a team of pros combats a team of beginners. You will simply get ♥♥♥♥♥, no matter how good you think you are at FPS games. That's why i advise people to play with similarly experienced players. When L4d3 comes out Valve should definitely implement such a match making system.   Anyway, when you play this game long enough you'll find out that it's more about strategic positioning rather than skillful shooting. Stay close to your team as a survivor and look behind you from time to time. As an infected it's a MUST to know the qualities of your character and to work together with the other players. All of them have their specific strengths in certain situations. Typically, you want to start with disorienting the survivors with a boomer, then to charge in them and let the spitter and smoker finish it up. But since the combinations differ every spawn and the levels are varied there are not any written rules about how to play. The only thing that will help is to memorize the different parts in each level that provide good attacking opportunities and coordinate them with your team. It takes a lot of time and it is also the reason why you can still feel like a noob after spending 100 hours in this game.  Don't let this scare you away though. It is still a lot of fun regardless of your experience. The only annoyances you will face is that people tend to rage quickly once they get beaten too hard. And since there is no penalty for leaving a game, campaigns often end with completely different teams than the ones that they started with. Again something that should be looked into if they are going to make another sequel. On the other hand the way things are now prevent the game from becoming really serious, which is also something I like.",

The amount of different types of game can be staggering (single player, offline CO-OP, campaign, scavenge and survival) but there's enough in there so that if you don't like all of it, you'll still find enough to do to keep the interest.  The characters in the original L4D were all well and good, and I've heard some people moan about how they didn't like the way these new characters; Nick, Rochelle, Ellis and Coach, didn't seem to get on. This isn't exactly true - the more you play the game, the more new dialogue you're presented with showing the characters' relationships to one another. Nick has issues with Ellis, who occasionally takes a shot back at Nick, but Ellis gets on great with Coach, who treats Rochelle like a little sister, who is almost flirtatious with Nick. They're really interesting, funny characters with much better voice acting than the first, and I personally can't get enough of them.  The campaigns in the game are linked by a lightweight story of the four trying to get from A to B to be rescued. Do not hold any misconceptions about L4D2 - there's not meant to be a backstory. The goings on and character build up are cleverly presented to you in the world around you; all you have to do is simply look. Read the graffiti. Listen to the characters, it's all there. It's a zombie apocalypse, what more do you need?   I think the only problem I've had is the people online that I've come across. There are some real idiots on the versus/scavenge games who take things far, far too seriously. In this case, I would find friends to play with, or go on a forum where you can meet decent people before you add them.  Even if you haven't played the first, it's a fun, intense, gory, silly game that will make you laugh, jump, freak out and have a great time. Especially if you find a frying pan.",

            "review_text": "As of November 2015, this is the single greatest multiplayer team versus-style game on the market. Yes, its been years since it's release, and its still the best. It also has a really fun co-op mode but what keeps me coming back is the 4v4 infected versus humans mode.  The gameplay can be taken to varying levels of depth depending on what you and your friends want out of the game. If you want a more casual experience, the game can provide that. If you want a more competitive experience, the game can provide that too. The game can also be tweaked with mods or custom servers. I believe it is a bit of a necessity, as the game's default settings, while fine, are not optimal for either fun or competition. That is the one drawback of this game: in order for it to have the same staying power for you as it does for me you will need to tweak it to your desires. Fortunately the Steam Workshop integration makes this easy in a lot of ways, and there are thousands of cool mods for this game that are very simple to install. Setting up a custom server on the other hand can be difficult and that is really the only way to tweak the gameplay itself, but it is well worth the effort if you have a group of friends you consistently play with.   Let's talk about that gameplay for a second. This is a FPS game (though it can be easily modded to be a TPS) with a few important caveats. Firstly, most of the infected classes can grab you and will kill you unless you're saved by a team mate. Short of a couple rare ploys, there is no way to save yourself! This is a team game and you must stick together for the most part. Second, in addition to guns the humans are given a certain number of melee shoves that recharge over a short period of time. The shoves keep the infected players and the AI zombies at bay quite effectively. The gameplay can either be glossed over so you can just focus on having fun, or you can go as deep as you want, really. The moves of the humans and also the infected players can be optimized to an insane degree. The difference between watching two casual teams and two skilled competitive teams is like watching two entirely different video games. I cannot stress this enough that the learning curve can go as deep as you're capable of taking it. There are many competive communities (most of which boast their own slew of modifications and tweaks to gameplay) and all that I've seen are willing to accept new players.   There are tons of custom maps for this game too! A myriad of fan-made tributes to various other games and works of literature. Want to play through Dark Tower: Gunslinger in a zombie game? Theres a custom campaign for that. Want to play through Resident Evil Outbreak? Theres a custom campaign for that. Want to play through a zombified Legend of Zelda forest puzzle map, or an undead homage to the Portal series, or an amazingly well-made recreation of Shadow Moses from Metal Gear Solid 1? There are custom campaigns for that! The modding community for this game is massive and not to be overlooked.  This is one of the best games, maybe THE best game I've ever owned, in terms of replay value and entertainment. I paid ten dollars for it and got years of great fun (I gladly would have paid 100 dollars for this game). You need friends to play with though, so this game isn't for everyone, but if you have enough fun people to play with then this game is incredible. My hat is off to the developer and I also took some other people's hats off because mine alone was not enough.",

Your biggest help and biggest burden is usually your team. For this game to be fun you almost NEED a team of like minded players. Wether your just going through one of the campaign 'movies' for giggles and guts or youre attempting to play on the hardest difficulty, the expierience falls apart if you get someone who is too serious or not serious enough. Once an arguement breaks out your entire team has lost hope (usually). Thats why I only really play with my friends or computer players. So, if you can get a good team together this game is a blast.    Some campaigns can be a walkthrough, some an be a mile thorugh hell, and others still can have the wackiest stuff happen. With over 10 campaigns that change slighty(drop points, special infected spawns) with each playthrough it is going to be a while before you get bored with this title. The graphics are quite good as well and like with all source games, its heavily optimized and can be played on nearly any machine. Sometimes theres a little slowdown here and there on my laptop but it never drops below 20fps on the lowest settings. Crispy graphics make the blood and gore, and sometimes dismemberment, rather satisfying.   The number of wapons available to create such gore is nice and varied. Theres no two guns that do the exact same thing. You have your tier1 weapons and tier 2 weapons. I believe its at least 10+ guns available and a handful of meele weapons too, including a very shaun-of-the-dead cricket bat.    I must concede though after playing through the campaigns a few times it can get a little boring if you only play on the easiest difficulties. The randomness of friends and drops keeps things fresh for a bit, but between my career on the xbox and steam, I have trouble getting my friends to play L4D2 simply because of lack of campaigns. They do have the steam workshop for new campaigns, and it works 90% of the time, but the process of getting everyone in your party to find,download, and finding a server for the user created campaigns is somewhat daunting if you dont know what youre doing. Some of the Workshop maps are fun and inventive, others are just pandemonium. It really comes down to taste a that point. I prefer the official campaigns.    I Loved l4D2 and I still do. I just have it shelved at the moment because I guess I overplayed it. If you enjoy either FPS games or zombies at all this is a must play. If you like story-driven narritive, this is not for you. The narritive in the campaigns is weak, and not important at all to gameplay. This is good, bloody, mindless, zombie killin' fun.",

The Boomer, Hunter, Smoker, Spitter, Charger, Jockey, and if you're luckey enough, the TANK! The Witch isn't playable, witch (see what I did there? :3) is understandable, seeing as how powerful the Witch is during campaign mode. Then, the final 3. Realism/Realism Versus.

It has an incredible replay value, and lends itself towards making friends and networks of people who all enjoy a good time shooting at angry zombies who want you off their lawns.

Playing singleplayer is rather boring as this game has some of the worst AI for team mates. Many times you will be in trouble and the computer players will just look at you. Doesn't make a game fun. Along with some dodgy hit box detection, especially in multiplayer, this is why people change the games internal settings manually, still it isn't great. Still has bugs not fixed like zombies getting stuck in objects and not being hittable. A plus is the workshop with many great mods to keep you entertained. Other modes like survival and scavenge give it a twist. It has some of the largest audio collections for charcters I've seen in a game, you'll hear things you haven't heard from a character even after 1000hrs of play and the detail of characters and general elements is superb. If every game had this level quality graphics and audio content the bar would be raised a great deal as far as entertainment is concerned. Lastly it has one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest communities you will find making learning the game very difficult as there are no tutorials. If you're new, expect to get kicked out of VS games alot! Play some campaign, get familiar with the maps first. Overall, if you can find a group of friends to play this with, great. Otherwise it's not that noteworthy. #2016.Dec still playing",

Also, playing as the zombie is just as fun as playing as the survivor, sometimes even moreso, with a good collection of special infected you can play as, this game also requires a MASSIVE amount of cooperative communication, as either side, it really makes you plot out and think your next move, one bad move could mean death, and for the survivors it's permanent.

This is because unlike most zombie shooters, the game is not focused on blowing the heads off zombies 'for the lulz'. Behind the ordinary FPS-style gameplay you'd expect in the typical zombie massacre game, a great deal of cooperation and teamwork is required for survival. Chances are in a normal campaign map, you won't last 5 minutes on your own. You must work with and rely on your fellow teammates in order to survive. Besides gameplay, the story and characters play a big role in the overall experience. In L4D2, you become extremely involved with the survivors, perhaps even connected with them, not to mention the apocalyptic world around you. Even though there is not much backstory, The world around you literally speaks for itself. Along with the playable survivors, you learn of the struggles and fates of hundreds of unseen survivors fighting for their lives. In other words, the world around you is very believable for an apocalyptic pandemic. When government and society crumbles around the survivors, they are simply left to fend for themselves. To make this short and sweet, the high level of cooperation-based shooting, interesting and diverse group of survivors, and the compelling apocalyptic word around you, are just a few things that make this a unique and entertaining rollercoaster ride of a game.",

            "review_text": "This is a soley teamwork related game with many gamemods to choose from and an AI Director that keeps making random experences everytime and special infected that require a team to fend off this game couldn't get any better I could explain in detail all the gamemods but here are the basics  Campaign- This gamemode pits you against AI hordes and special infected with human controlled team mates which requires close teamwork to survive each finale from holding out to collecting gas to even running across a bridge thats being bombed by the military  Single player- Nothing much to say about this game mode its the normal campaign but instead of humans its offline bots  Versus- In Versus you are pitted against swarms of common infected while fending off human controlled specials each team takes turns playing as humans and infected with these playable infected and non playable infected: The Smoker- He will drag survivors with a long tounge towards him and will repeatidly bash them untill their team mates free them or they die if he can not directly drag them to him he will constrict them where they are stuck. The Boomer- Nothing much to explain about him he is a bloated infected who will throw up boomer bile on the survivors attracting a horde to attack them and attractting nearby infected if killed he will explode showering bile on nearby surfaces and survivors their is an item that allows the survivors to use his own bile against him. The Hunter- A hooded teenage looking infected who will leap great distances to catch lone survivors dealling massive damage untill killed or freed can leap from far and high places to deal damage pounces which range around 1 to 25 damage dealling instant damage and is the only infected that does not have to wait for his ability to recharge. The Charger- This infected has a large arm that will smash into survivors knocking other team mates into the air he cannot be bashed off his victim normally having to be killed a Charger may also ram survivors off high places incapping or killing instantly. The Jockey- The Jockey is the only infected that can move their victim around willingly instead of the Chargers ram which cannot be steered as well as the Smokers pull and Hunters pounce The Jockey can be fought against though if the survivor mashs their move buttons making it difficult for the Jockey to move them but they also deal damage much like the others clawing at their victims face untill downed and unable to ride like the Hunter it must pounce to capture someone. The Spitter- Purely a support infected like the Boomer the Spitter can split survivors with her acid spit or can spit on incapped or 'pinned' survivors spreading panic and killing the survivor quicker making it a valuable asset to the team if used correctly like the Boomer its death has a last act of revenge spreading its acid although smaller on the ground like its spit attack. The Tank- The Tanks the brute force and favorite of most players the Tanks only goal is to spread damage to kill or make a miserable mess of the survivors defences with 3 different attacks like its punch attack which knocks back survivors knocking them senseless for a short amount of time a rock throw attack taking out snipers who aren't willing to take any damage from the behemoth and knocking them down giving the Tank a chance to get close and a car/object punch which sends any car or object flying and immediatly incapping survivors or on rare chances stumbling them or killing them making it very effective at taking out close groups and clusters. The Witch- The Witch is one of the only infected thats avoidable only attacking when disturbed killing and incapping in one hit being startled by flashlights and close survivors.  Realism and Realism Versus- Realism is a gamemode of pure teamwork being unable to see someone through walls or being pinned also Witches will kill in one hit Realism Versus is purely the same as Versus defualt just with the added rules of Realism.  Survival- Much like the Call of Duty gamemode Zombies but with a twist the survivors are able to equip anything they like before they start the match and instead of rounds its random hordes and Tanks as well as a timer recording how long your team survived 2 alteritive Mutations( We will get to these) are Survival Versus which is Survival with Versus merged and one team sets the time while the other beats it and keeps going till one team does not beat the others time and Hold Out which is like a Hold Out finale but quicker to finish.  Scavenge- A quick version of Versus one team must collect gas cans and put them in the generator while the infected team must try and stop them from beating their score the first team to beat their score all added together wins the match.  Mutations- Weekly gamemodes like Hunting Party, Last Man On Earth and TAAAANK! that are available on the Steam Workshop along with other community made skins and Campaigns that are remixes of gamemodes or entirely new ones as earlier mentioned Survival Versus is one such gamemode.  Now for the conclusion this game has its ups and downs like its prequel but its worth buying the glitchier but funner version on P.C with the custom content and free DLC some players do not like the lack of weapons while most like it cause its simple and means your favorite weapons never too far from reach but what about the gamemodes? are some even worth playing? It is true that Survival and Scavenge are not played as much like Mutations mostly cause most players normally have enough time on their hands to play a full Campaign or Versus match and most of the Mutations that are fun require manual installation or having to be found in the wasteland of the Steam Workshop but this does not mean its not a bad game I rate it 9/10 Cause of its teamwork based gameplay which I have yet to see in many games and plus Valves style of simplicity with simple graphics and not overly complicated gameplayer (I am looking at you Battlefield and Call of Duty) this games a hit and miss some people will like it some will not but I absolutely love it as I have played the first since it came out and loved that even though I was missing alot such as weapons and items and lacking infected varity but its simplistic gameplay style contributes to it so thats my review and have a great day!

I was shooting up on 'Adrenaline Shots' (which I can only presume was speedball or something alike) when in the corner of my drugged up eye see a pink hulking mass flash by. I proceed to blame it on the speedball and continued to crush painkillers to snort them up.  Then, the most horrifying experience I have had to this date happened; I heard from the silent distance a mighty roar. 'THIS IS MY SWAMP!'  What seemed to be a zombified Shrek began screaming and was now sprinting towards me. And at that moment, I knew that if did not get on my feet and ran I would be subjected to his powerful will.  I scrambled to my feet as fast as my legs could, hearing the impending doom hungering for me. The smell of onions grew ever closer as I could hear him push everything between him and my behind aside with the slightest of ease. Then I saw it; a metal barricaded door, it was the only thing that could keep his force at bay. I mustered the last my energy in a final effort to remain out of his oniony clutches and slammed the door behind me.  One last groan could be heard; and just like that, it was ogre.",

But there is a more grievous point: no record of what you have done. For the solo campaign for example, I have to write down, using pencil and paper, what campaigns I finished ! That would be acceptable for retrogaming but this is lame for a modern video game.  After some research, I found out that Steam records your survival times. Okay, but outside the game ! Talk about a clumsy user-interface.  Outwardly, there are many game modes. In fact there are only two: * Player vs player. As there is no ranking, PvP is not attractive. Noobs are stomped by vets and this is not fun. (Granted, this is also true for TF2 or World of Tanks, but these games offer a more developed PvP experience.) Also the L4D2 community is the most toxic I have ever seen for a casual game. Stay away. * Solo or coop vs bot. Game experience is intense. Content is big. But game is highly repetitive. Diversity of weapons does not save the day.  So why a positive review ? Despite its big flaws, L4D2 offers a unique game experience. Creepy, gore, intense. It is so fun to explode zombies with a shotgun ! A worthy classical Valve game worth buying during Steam sales. ",

The game still requires players stick together inorder to avoid being pounced by legions of undead and it keeps the frantic fast paced atmosphere. Alongside that, the game's versus mode adds a great deal of strategy to the gameplay. And lastly it's survival mode allows players to test their skills and provide a nice healthy amount of competition amongst each other.   I'd go as far as to say L4D2 now is one of Valve's best attempts at multiplayer games on the Source engine. Harder, Faster, Better and Stronger in almost every way.10 of 10!",

EDIT: Over time playing, I have changed my mind about the game. I have become reluctant to play now, unless if I'm playing versus. And this game hasn't aged well. Now there are better zombie games, like Dying Light. I still reccommend buying this, but I reccommend buying while its on sale. Otherwise, wait for Left 4 Dead 3. It is coming. Come on Valve.  EDITARY EDIT: This game has SERIOUSLY NOT AGED WELL. The thing that keeps this corpse marching on, is not the green flu, its the modding community. Getting a couple mods can change the entire experience. I reccommend getting this game instead of the first, and playing everything unmodded in chronological order. Then Get some mods which make the game harder, because later on you just start crowning witches, and practically exploiting the game to win.",

You don't go around the map running away from the zombies, to get ammo or to get medikits to survive. In order to survive, you just have to shoot the zombies and know how to work in team. But when you play it, you feel like you are not playing a survival horror, but just a game where you have to kill zombies. You can play with 3 friends (or strangers) online. Or play solo with AI controlled friends. You can also have 8 player match, where 4 play as the survivors, and other 4 are the 'special infected' trying to kill the survivors. This game got an update where it lets you play with the Left 4 Dead 1 survivors and its campaigns. It also has items from Steam Workshop. I strongly recommend you to get this game. It's fun, and it's a very good game in the zombie themed games.",

We have CEDA workers, clowns, mudmen, hardhat workers, S.W.A.T cops and fallen survivors Some are invincible to shots form front or fire, some attract the horde of bloodthirsty zombies, some don't hear the pipebomb,some just leave splats of mud on your screen and some carry supplies which makes them very valuable. Oh well, they are infected. New special infected are Spitters who spit acid right at your feet, Chargers which will charge at you (DUH) and pound all living crap outta you (Don't try to shove them back, they are like tanks or witches), Jockeys who will ride you into fire, acid or other dangers. We have incendiary and explosive rounds. Incendiary ammo will light your target on fire (DUH) but this fire lasts just 4 seconds. Explosive rounds are like splash bullets which will damage the infected near place where the bullet hit, they also stun special infected. Boomer bile will work like a friendly pocket boomer, but it's his bile. It will attract the horde on the area where bile landed, and will cover the screens of special infected with boomer bile (It really does, i experienced that on Versus). Defibrillator is a very good tool for reviving your mates which were killed by infected. An adrenaline shot is a tool which should be used when you are doing long actions and you need a speed boost, also they heal you for a small amount of temporary health. We have Scavenge mode which is actually a gas can race, Survivors must fill a generator with random amount of gas cans and the Infected must stop the Survivors from filling a generator. Mutations make the game different, like the mutation 'Taaaank!!' it replaces ALL special infected with Tanks, which adds more challenge to the game. Well i recommend this game for everybody who loves violence and killing zombies... or playing as them.",

The feel that you need to work together with your friends and stick together as a team and watch each other's back to get the job done is very intense. For example when you 're wounded and you need to find medpaks to heal, you really 'live' it. This game makes you feel emotions.

You must stay together to survive or die alone in this zombie survival game, where you take on multiple different kinds of zombies like the boomer who will puke on you, attracting a large amout of regular zombies, or the smoker who constricts and chokes you with his tounge. There are at least 10 campaigns to play and each of them offers diverse gameplay experiences, allowing gamers to find one they like the most and play it a couple times, then go onto a different one and find even more fun to be had. Or if you're bored of campaign mode, simply jump into a versus game were you not only control survivors, but when that round ends you get to play as one of the zombies too! And if you get bored of everything like the mutations which allow for certain rule changes, and the realism mode you can go into the steam workshop and download some custom content like new skins, mutations, maps and even mods which allow almost anything!   Overall I give it an 8.5 on my Like-O-Meter.",

I've been kicked for healing a teammate, not using chat, killing a Witch on my own without it doing damage to anyone else, trying to kick a guy that intentionally attacked the team and not Infected, alerting a Crescendo Event when everyone was ready, using a Melee weapon, being female (I'm not even a feminist but ffs), and, my personal favourite, being Australian. If you want a humanised /pol/ then play online but otherwise just play with friends or play with bots. Offline I've found is much easier, as there's no lag, no rubberbanding, no elitists, people that will ACTUALLY HELP their teammates (gee!), etc.   And lastly, I'm no PC Master Race elitist, but the mods seriously make the gameplay so much better, because the serious aura this game tries to pull off isn't very fleshed, so it's better to just embrace the outlandish ♥♥♥♥.

CONS:  You see, people like a guy named ' otteman ( OR ottemen ) ' or people who you DON'T wanna play with.  -Otteman starts a vote kick for player Cuppajava - Cuppajava ' I don't see the point in doing that ' - Otteman ' Well i just wanna win ' - Cuppajava is kicked for ' ' He's basicly just a spoiled brat like any other troll in the community. The reason why most people don't MP in this game. Started the vote because i wasn't good at playing, basicly similer on how the trolls work on CS:GO and TF2.  My only improvment is to remove the vote kick system, and replace it with a system that kicks people for the use of profanities, and if they kill someone on purpose, that would make it more easy. Or simple blacklist words on the vote kick and simplely to NOT LEAVE THE REASON BLANK. Thank you.  PROS:  The classic gameplay of L4D is brought back into this game, with some enhancements. I honestly am wordless, all i can really say: This is a must-want game, buy it, even if its not on sale, its grate for playing with your friends.   CONCLUSION:  If you want to play this game, don't play on the MP community with random people, there will ALWAYS be people like otteman who come and ruin your game experiance, like he did, and he's not the first, and most likely not the last. I suggest playing with friends, its also real quick to start a server, very simple and plain.  10 / 9 ' Good job valve, your doing grate. '  ( EDIT: fixed a few mistakes )",

            "review_text": "Like a good sequel should, Call of Duty: Ghosts doesn’t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.  Despite sharing a name with one of Modern Warfare’s best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S.  The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten – not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It’s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.  Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you’ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and – in the case of the space and water missions – special consideration for verticality and physics.  Of course, it wouldn’t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation’s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.  But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It’s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.  It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling — it's more about dumb fun — and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he’s a member of the Ghosts. And then there’s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.  The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.  The Verdict Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula. Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes Ghosts one of the best Call of Duty games to date.",

I have never used mods, but I have heard that console users are missing out on an apparently huge part of the game.",

Can one group of four really stupid chainsaw wielding maniacs stand above them all? A game, like no other....... Going on steam market..... For only 4.00..... Is it worth it you ask....  THATS WHY IM WRITING THIS REVIEW!!!  Alright, enough dramatic movie trailers, so I'll get down to all of the subjects   Music:8/10 I'll say the music was ok, I didnt really seem to like all the hardcore rock and roll and weird crap, so I replaced it with mario and pokemon music from the workshop (thank goodness for workshop)  Gameplay: 10/10 You, and 3 other people are surrounded by infested (fill in the blank, really could be anything due to workshop, xD) we'll just go with teletubbies for now. Restarting: You and 3 other people are surrounded by intested teletubbies, and no other people seem to be around (for a majority of missions, some missions have other survivors too) to help you, so it is essential to have teamwork and stick with the team. If you don't stick with the team, things known as 'hunters' (I re-textured them as bowser JR.) get you. Hunters basically jump onto you and claw the CRAP out of you, if your alone you could go down in a few seconds! They wait until no team-mates are nearby you, and then strike. Anywho, with a huge variety of melee and ranged weapons, everything from a ninja katana to an m16 all the way to the famous ak-47 you'll never get bored!!! Most missions require a good mix of melee, running and gunning, and out-right hardcore teamwork for survival. Sometimes a teammate needs to stay behind, because some missions are 'one way trips' where only 3 teammates can make it out alive.  The gameplay has tons of fun, including environmental objects you can throw, chuck, and slam into some tele-tubbie's CRAMIUM and smash it real hard. (That was a very long paragraph, apoligies)  Workshop: 10/10, I dont think I should say more, I'd rather you check it out for yourself.  Multiplayer: 9.7/10 Sometimes the games you join have idiots who keep team-killing and smashing your head in with a sledge-hammer even though the zombies are right next to them. For pete's sake, we're not the enemy! Also would like to add that there IS a mode where you can play as the zombie, or special zombie depending on who you would rather pick. Other than a few team-killers multiplayer is a fun experience and very solid and enjoyable.  Graphics: They're kinda out-dated so I cant really judge them by comparing them to today's graphics, but for 2009 you gotta say those graphics were out-right crazy good comparing them to other 2009 games.  (I think thats all the categories)  Final Verdict: 9.5/10  'A Must Have'  This game is a great game for 4.00! I would recommend it to almost anyone who loves 1st person shooters, zombies, and basically beating the crap out of everything in sight, lol.  Would I recommend this to other gamers: HECK YES!!!  Also remember: You CAN disable blood and gore in the options if you don't feel comfrotable with headless teletubbies. Personally I currently have blood and gore ON, because it's headless teletubbies, which is freaking hillarious. But if I was playing with zombies, I would NOT have that on whatsoever.  Playing without workshop: Off MOST DEFINETELY!!! Playing with workshop: probably On. ",

Although the game is now three plus years old, it is still worth buying especially when on sale for $5-$10. The graphics are average but the gameplay, storyline, and humor make this very enjoyable. You get a lot of value for your money here... There are several campaigns to play either as single player or co-op. There are also other game modes such as Survivor Mode where you try to live as long as possible against endless hordes. Probably the most popular mode is Versus where you take turns against another team playing as both humans and the special infected zombies. Coordinate with your teammates for the best approach to gang up on the humans. Since this is a Valve game, it is no surprise that they were nice enough to eventually release the original Left 4 Dead (L4D) maps into L4D2. My opinion is that if you are new to this series, you can skip L4D and just get L4D2.",

After releasing this and the original back to back two years in a row the gameplay is starting to get boring and although the maps are a lot better you're still just shooting, juking and exploding zombies. Versus mode is better with the new Infected additions but I always found this mode really rage inducing because of the level's pickup randomization. New multiplayer modes are creative and there are mutators but the base gameplay has been done before and I didn't feel compelled to get into them.   There's pretty much no reason to buy the original now that this is out especially when you consider they ported the original campaign to the sequel.

I recommend this game, I would give it a 8 out of 10 - it loses a point for the zombie animations, they do have sudden stops from running to walking and it does get a bit akward watching a zombie attempt to climb up a wall to get you, reach the top, start walking and then start running. But the zombies look and behave realistically. The game's landscape is pretty awesome. I would also like to say teamwork is incredibly important. You can fall of a ledge and be hanging by one hand and you just stay there til your friend comes and saves you. Same with when you're down, the zombies will claw at you like crazy.  There is some gore though, sometimes the organs of dead zombies can be seen and the boomer very voilently explodes upon being shot.  The game has funny jokes and references, an example is Ellis referencing 'The Shining' upon obtaining an axe.  No nudity or sexual scenes, very clean. The voilence is intermediate and overly gory at points, but it's no Happy Wheels.",

            "review_text": "This game is about 4 players who attempt to survive and make it to a safe room. There are several different types of Special Infected who try to prevent you from making it into the safe room. The Smoker grabs you from a distance with his tongue, the Charger charges you and pounds you into the ground (he can sometimes charge you off cliffs which can insta kill you) and has high health and high damage from punching you, the Hunter does athletic jumps and pounces on you to rip you to shreds, the Jockey jumps on your back and tries to steer you off the map or into danger, the Boomer pukes on you and makes common infected attack you, makes you take increased damage, and obscures your vision, the Spitter spits goo which hurts you and blocks your path, the Tank punches you away, has extremely high health, can throw cars and other objects at you, can lob rocks at you, and the Witch sits around the map or wanders around crying and 1 hit incapicatates you if you startle it (or kills you depending on the difficulty), although she can be completely avoided most the time, especially if you turn off your flashlight. There's nothing more fun than blasting a bunch of zombies with your friends or competing against them in VS. Once you complete the campaign, you should really jump into VS., it is extremely fun, especially with friends. Sure, the game can get frustrating sometimes but it is my personal opinion that this is one of the greatest co-op games (if not THE greatest) on PC and it becomes twice as fun with friends. Community made maps and mods make this game twice as great, and they give the game much more replayability. Overall, if you don't own this game you should really get it, it is very cheap during sales and very worth the money.",

This time, Valve brought 4 new characters, and 3 new zombies: Spitter, Jockey and Charger. The game is just what you'd expect: a fun co-op game, where you shoot zombies and try to survive. But L4D2 is much more than that. In a matter of seconds, one team member can be up and fine, and the next he's dying, with a Hunter on top of him. L4D2 gives you a great survival experience, where you need to play as a team in order to win. It also has a good co-op experience with friends or strangers, and I belive it is so far, the best game to do so. A must buy! 9.5/10",

Sound is also important in a game like this, and that can only be described as chilling, hearing a zombie right behind you in the dark.  The gameplay is amazing, it really built on the first in my opinion. The best zombie apocalypse game of its kind (not hardcore survival like DayZ), and my favourite game for PvP and 4 players against an environment. Incase you don't know, you get a pistol with infinite reloads, and can get a primary weapon, and either get a second pistol, a better pistol or a melee weapon. There are several safe rooms, which you start and end each level in where you can restock, and you have an aim which is getting from one place to another, and there is usually a horde bit (turning on power so a helicopter can find you, but also alert zombies for example).   There is only one tiny problem with this game, which is the AI. Valve is normally ace at making AI, but here they failed to balance them between being a shooter character, and survival support character.  The icing on this cake of near perfection is workshop support. New campaigns, weapon mods, and my favourite: cosmetic mods. Ever wanted to make bottles of pills cans of duff? You can do that! Ever want to be chased by hordes of tellitubbies? YOU CAN! Ever wanted to play as master chief, with ghost rider, a my little pony character and iron man? Me neither, but you can all play as velociraptors!  This game does everything it was made to do perfectly, if you play with 3 friends.",

Both games have their personality, and it's fine like this.  The L4D2 community is both better and worse than the L4D1 community ; while it benefits from more friendly players, it truly lacks skilled players, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ for expert mode aficionados like me.  Anyway, I am a huge fan of the L4D gameplay, and the addition of the Workshop made me really happy, as I can now have the gun skins and sounds I like, Heineken Molotovs, Blue Laser Sights, Stormtrooper Common Infected, Donkey Kong Tanks, Diddy Kong Jockeys, Alien Xenomorph Hunters, Pulp Fiction Tank Music, Starbucks Coffee Pain Pills, TF2 Dispenser Plushie Medkits, Borderlands 2 Survivors, Benny Hill Jockey Music, Hitchcock's Psycho Murder Music for Witch Attacks and Christmas-decorated Vegetation.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings",

            "review_text": "Left 4 Go fix your own game Bugs 2!   That's right boys and girls, this is the new title for this great game that became a garbage can. I have almost 6,000 hours in this game, so without doubt I enjoyed it since the release date until the past few months when this game became a garbage can.   First, I want to talk about the good stuff about this game:  - Each game you play will always be different even if you played the same campaign over and over: Means when you start a campaign and you finish it, then you restart the same campaign you will have a totally different experience from the campaign you played earlier. This is because all the events that happens in the game are randomized. You cannot tell when or where a special infected will spawn and attack you. You cannot tell when a horde will attack you. This makes the game always different no matter how many times you play it. This is very important to some people because some people, like myself, gets bored fast from games that are not randomized. For example, I played 'The Last of Us' story. The story was so great, but it is repetitive. The enemies spawn in the same exact locations on the map every time I play the game. It is like watching the same movie everyday for years. On the other hand, I never got bored of playing Left 4 Dead 2 after all of these hours I spent playing it, mainly because of these reasons I mentioned earlier.  - The game can be modded: I have more than 100 mods. Many people when they visit my Twitch channel they ask me if this is Left 4 Dead 2 or not, because of the amount visiual changes I made to the game! You can change so many things in this game. You can change your guns, for example, you can replace the M16 rifle with an AKS 74u submachine gun mod, or you can replace it with an M4 rifle mod, or you can replace it with a better looking M16 rifle that was created by another user. You can download multiple mods for the same gun, such as the M16 rifle and use them, one at a time, depending on your mood! I You can change the main characters that you control, for example, you can change Nick from Left 4 Dead 2 with Leon from Resident Evil. You can change so many things in this game. This refreshes the game no matter how old it gets.  - The game is still alive: You will always find random people to play with no matter what time or day you play the game. When I play co-op campaign, I only play on Expert Difficulty (the highest difficulty), yet I always get 3 other players to play with no matter what campaign I play.  - The game is balanced: There are no overpowered enemies in this game, even the big giant tank is not overpowered. However, there are overpowered weapons in this game. For example, the sniper rifles in this game are overpowered because they barely have any recoil, they are powerful, and they have a lot of bullets in each magazine. You can use scope to aim at a target, and shoot so many bullets rapidly with very little recoil. But I am not complaining since this game is not a simulator game.  - Be the survivor or be the zombie: I personally love to be the survivor for multiple reasons. For example, I love to use guns. To me guns are like fruits, I love them. This is one of the main reason why I like FPS games, it is because I love to use guns.   - No one man army in this game: No matter how good a player is, he will always need all the support he can get from his teammates.   - Bots are decent and reliable: I finished all the campaigns on Expert Difficulty with 3 bots, except Cold Stream campaign because that campaign is so difficult on Expert Difficulty even for 4 good players playing it together. Once you play the game a lot and understand the game's mechanics you will be able to manage the bots more efficiently. Yes the bots act dumb, but if you manage them correctly they are very powerful.   - The enemy AI is decent: No matter how good you and your team are, the enemy AI is very challenging. You are going to constantly watch your back while playing against the AI, especially if you are playing on the highest difficulty where the AI does a lot of damage to you.   Let me now talk about why I do not recommend this game anymore to anyone!  - Lag: I have a lag issue that strikes the servers I connect to for the past few months. For the past few months, I get lag strikes after I spend 2 hours playing the game. The pings for me 'and for all other players who are connected to the server I am connected to' gets extremely high for too long until everyone decides to disconnect from the server. Once this lag starts it will strike almost every server I connect to as if someone is following me and is launching DDOS attacks against the servers I am connected to. I contacted Steam for help, but they told me they do not support server related issues and refused to help me out. I checked the forums about people having the same issues, but I could not find a solution. I even rented my own server for $16 a month from GameServers company, and I am still paying for it until this day, but I am still having the same problem.  - Game gets stuck in the loading screen when loading the next level within a co-op campaign: Almost every campaign I play, the game will stuck at the loading screen for one of the levels, and will not load the next level. I noticed that this a problem with a lot of people, and not just me. For example, a lot of time I play co-op with other players I see the bot's name with the word 'IDLE' next to it instead of seeing the player's name. This means the level was not loaded yet for that player. Then we keep moving forward until the player disconnects from the server without being able to join us in the current level we are playing. Again, this is a problem that I cannot find a solution for, and it is a common issue that a lot of players are experiencing.   - Bugs in the game slots: This is one of the problems that I see at least once every few days. While playing a co-op game, and one of the players leave the game, the game slot that this player left contnues to be reserved for that player as if he is still playing. This prevents anyone from joining the game and using the slot that was left off by the player who left the game. You might ask me 'How did I know that no one is able to join because of this bug? Maybe no one was playing the game during the time this happened to you'. Here is something that happned to me so many times in the past. A lot of times when I start the game with 3 other players in the lobby, I end up getting separated from everyone else. Meaning the game creates a new game for me that is separate from the game I was going to play with the other 3 players. For example, I might create a lobby to play Hard Rain campaign with 3 other players. But when I start the game the game creates a Hard Rain game for me only, and creates another Hard Rain game for the other 3 players who were with me in my lobby. When this happens, no one joins the new game I connected to because the 3 game slots are still reserved for the 3 players. I tested this with my friends before. This is a confirmed bug.  Left 4 Dead 2 is now a garbage can. I absolutely do not recommend this game until Valve fix these severe issues with it. I am very sad that Left 4 Dead 2 is my favorite game, but I am forced not to play it as much as I want because of these bugs that I cannot find any solution to because no one is helping me out. I put so many hours playing this game because I really loved it from all of my heart. Believe it or not I spent more hours playing Left 4 Dead 2 than the hours I spent after I got my Bachelor's degree in Science!   Even with all the bugs that this game has, I will continue to play it and stream it at my Twitch channel. I just can't stop playing this game. But it is because I got addicted to it. On the other hand, if these problems happens to you, you will simply remove this game from your game's library.            ",

            "review_text": "Repitive,shallow,life-less,corny. These are the words that perfectly describe this over rated shooter. Everything from gunplay, to voice acting is boring. I have never played a more horrible game and I will describe why I think it's just that in this review.  Campaigns / Maps : To start things off, lets go to what's important in a shooter, or almost anygame for that matter. The map(s). The game comes with a base of 5 campaigns, which will be extended to 7, and combined with the original Left 4 Dead maps. Pretty cool, except it makes the people who bought the original feel like a chump, also giving no point to see what the original was like. Not that you need too, it's the same drawn out boringness that's here. Back on topic, the maps are an absolute mess! Often making players lost, confused, or stuck. It doesn't help that each campaign has it's own 'theme' of colors, making finding a door a lot harder thanks to everything being a nice ugly pale yellow, or what ever campaign your doing. Dark Carnival is dark grey, Swamp fever dark green, The Rain one, dark brown, and so on. Not many nice colors. To sum this up, Horrible art direction, (not calling the graphics bad as its hard too when the game is so old) confusing and mindless map design. Fantastic, probably my least favorite part of the game.  Gunplay: Not a whole lot to say here, short selection of weapons bundled with *soft* shooting and high damage rates leaving you feeling like your in a broken game. Oh wait... On topic though, you have three assault rifles, two uzis, four shotguns, two sniper rifles (so useless when this is a run and gun type shooter, even players mock eachother for using them) and about 10 melee weapons which all have the same stats, one hit kill but the katana is faster. The difference between these weapons are so nonexistant that it's insulting! The pump shotguns are the same but ones shiny, the uzis are the same but one has a silencer which still alerts the zombies, auto shotguns have the same story and so on. Literally every weapon is a clone of eachother except the Scar-H rip off which has a 3 burst fire option, which doesn't help much... The sum of gunplay? Overkill with *soft* shooting and useless clones of eachother so you truly only get 4 guns (including the useless sniper) and 2 melee (katana and the rest).   Voice Acting / Story / Writing : There's almost none, this would be fine if the game embraced but no. They try to hamfist and force 'character' down your throat by making each character a cheap stereotype or exaggeration. There's no backstory to each character, no reason there their except the 5 seconds of them saying 'welp the chopper left us'. Sum of this is that there's no story, voice acting and writing is pointless, unfunny and boring.  Bugs,slip ups, etc. : I can finally say something decent about this and that's there not many bugs, atleast not gamebreaking or annoying bugs. You might see a zombie or too get caught in a wall maybe a few stand around like a fool but it's not common and this section is actually quiet clean. Good job (for once)  Overall : Simple done bad, it tries to be a simple fun zombie shooter but fails. It tries to rely on gameplay not story by cutting it all out but fails when the gameplay is so nonfluid and shallow, not to mention it's horrible *writing* of each character. This game has a major identity crisis and is truly one of the most over-rated games I've ever seen, seriously more hyped than No Mans Sky. I can't find ONE good thing about this game beside it not breaking. Do not buy!  *not going to give a number score on this one since it's so negative and anyone reading gets the point to NOT BUY*",

Easy or Normal is where you start, you're not ready for expert. Do it anyway? You're gonna get kicked. 2. DON'T PLAY DEAD CENTER SURVIVAL! You will get kicked. That's coming from someone with 35 minutes on Dead Center. We don't like fresh blood messing up laps. 3. DON'T TALK IF NOT NEEDED! Most people don't want to hear a newbie talk and complain over mic when their trying to play. 4. DON'T PLAY VERSUS! Versus has a cancerous, sweaty, and tryhard community. Just don't play it, you'll get kicked. 5. DOWNLOAD MODS! This game in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it's vanilla state, so you need to mod that ♥♥♥♥ up and make it awesome. There are tons of weapon, character, texture, sound, throwable, map, and campaign mods to download and tons of mods are uploaded everyday. 6. WATCH TUTORIAL VIDEOS! There are tons of tutorial videos on YouTube to help you get better at the game. 7. MOD THE GAME! The reason I have over 1,000 hours on this game is cause I love to mod the game and find new things to change texture and sound wise to change everyday. It makes playing the game more enjoyable. 8. DON'T COMPLAIN WHEN YOU'RE GETTING KICKED! It won't get you anywhere and you'll get kicked faster. 9. DON'T BE A ♥♥♥♥! Everyone's a ♥♥♥♥ in this community and the nice people usually help us better ourselves, so please be nice. 10. BUY THE DAMN GAME ALREADY",

            "review_text": "The chief difference between this and a standard FPS is that you cooperate or die. Some of your enemies have special abilities that *incapacitate* you, and thus a team mate is needed to rescue you.  If you like solo play, don't worry; the game provide bots to help you in your attempt to survive the zombie apocalypse.  Amazing game, even for those who don't like FPS (like me)!  Okay, so why the negative review?  1) I'm an achievement hunter, and some achievements are unobtainable (special events that happened in 2013 and 2012). That is a turn down. Developers should respect more achievement hunting.  2) Hostility. This is a game that screams for co-op, but your random internet buddy is pretty much an angry 12yo boy who does nothing but eat doritos and play L4D2 as a 'pro'. Nobody will help you to learn the game when you play online! Playing solo campaigns won't help you much with online gameplay practice, in spite of what the 'pros' think. Other than the regular aim-and-shot, the styles can be *very* different e.g.   - You don't need to care for the well-being of the bots (they save you and each other), but you need to when playing with humans  - Bots are always close, kissing range, because they shoot through you. They can save you rather quickly; real humans tend to spread more imho, probably because of friendly fire.   - A bot won't kick you out for a single friendly fire incident. Human players will curse your 7th generation, kick you, backtrace you and ♥♥♥♥♥slap you.  - Human players RUSH - maybe even too much sometimes - and they will leave you behind if they see a safehouse... but bots love you and will never do that! Spoiler: They will die with you instead &lt;3!   - Once again... bots will never call you... anything. Nor your mom.  If you insist in playing this game, go to forums and ask somebody to help you with learning the game and play some campaign together. Make it clear that you're not good (yet). That's the only way to actually practice, not solo. That being said, its not like its a skill you put in your curriculum, so save yourself some time and skip this game.",

With the sequel came about new guns and new zombies, the majority of which can be filled under the 'ZOMG BS JOCKEY WON'T DIE!!!!!' The melee weapons are a welcome addition as well as the SPAS combat shotgun (my favorite).  In my eyes, the only thing that make this game better than L4D1 is that it seems like more people are playing L4D2, and the mutations. Scavenge isn't all that great.  In the end, unless you get both L4D 1 &amp; 2 for the price of ~20, then you might as well just skip this version. Result: PASS",

Empty, boring, barely even textured maps, a completely indestructible environment, very poorly designed AI, about one eensy-weensy jump scare (and that's only because you're not expecting it if it's your first time), and besides that: IT'S NOT EVEN FUN!

The graphics look disgusting. The trees and grass in this game look horrible. The gun sounds are soooooo fake. Listen to the gun sounds in Battlefield 3, they were recorded in Swedish army training, that's why the gun sounds in Battlefield are realistic and NOT computer-generated at all.

The game can be challenging if the party perpetually chooses to work against each other, but very gratifying if performed well. Survival is a great mode that challenges your persistence with massive amounts of zombies, while you manage your supplies. This game can be very frustrating at times but then again when in a party that is result oriented, you can feel true accomplisment. I would give Left for Dead 2 an easy 8.8 out of 10.

Just recently, I joined a match and immediately got kicked for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  If anything, this game is worth the buy for the singleplayer only. Multiplayer isn't really fun unless you have friends. You just get kicked. Constantly. The singleplayer is really good though, except for the excessive amounts of special infected. They spawn way too frequently. Otherwise, it's a good game. 8/10.",

I know this is not entirely the developers fault and more so the Graphics card vendor's drivers. Though after being Windows free for almost a year, it would be nice to play Left 4 Dead 2 again. I've tested the game under Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Manjaro, Open Suse ect and got the same or almost the same results. The best results being under Arch Linux. I still recommend the game since it's very fun and probably runs fine under Linux with other hardware. I just hope things improve next year with AMD graphics drivers under Linux.",

You can't mix and match the survivors, however, campaigns use either one set or the other. There's a host of new weapons, including the amazing M60, a slew of awesome melees, and a Grenade Launcher. The game does stray away from the original's Survival Horror roots, and focus more on being fun and over-the-top, which might bug some dishard fans of the original, but I found it to be more fun than ever before. On top of all this content, there are survival maps, various mutations that alter the rules, and hundreds of fan-made skins, maps and musical cues, allowing players to customize the game their way.

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 Retrospective Review™  Left 4 Dead 2 is one of my all-time favorite games. I might as well be up-front about that.  The TL;DR review of L4D2 is, buy it. Buy it for you, and buy it for your friends.  The longer read:  Gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 started out with basically three options: Single Player, Co-Op and Versus.  Single Player does what it says on the tin - you can go through the campaigns to get to learn the maps before heading into Versus Mode.  Co-Op is your chance to try out L4D2 with other people - it's a nice way of experiencing the harder difficulty levels of the game.  Versus Mode is where the meat of the game is, in my opinion. Two teams of 4 players take turns playing either the Survivors or the Special Zombies. The two teams then compete for points, earned by getting the farthest in each stage of the campaign. The best scores are reserved for the full 4 Survivors making it through the maps, and without using the Defibrilator to resurrect fallen friends.  Since launching the game, Valve has added different 'Mutations' which fundamentally alter the gameplay. There are both Single Player and Multiplayer Mutations. You might play the Taaaaaaanks! mode, in which all Infected players control the deadliest Special Zombie: The Tank.  Furthermore since launching the game, Valve has added all the campaigns and Survivors from the original Left 4 Dead, so you can play with the updated mechanics, graphics and zombies for free. Valve has also added two campaigns which take place between Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.  The story of Left 4 Dead 2 is told - as it was in the first- more or less through random voice clips from the survivors, and from grafitti on the walls. It is, you might say, 'story lite'. You don't need to know much more than that you need to either get from Point A to Point B, or you need to keep the Survivors from getting to Point B.  Left 4 Dead 2, even in its 'vanilla' form had tons of replayability. With all the extra content Valve has added (including the custom campaign 'Cold Stream' by a community member), it has even more. Your money-to-playtime ratio is off the wall. At the time of posting, I have almost 280 hours in L4D2, and I still enjoy it immensely - it is, in fact, my go-to game when I feel like I have nothing to play.  Cons to Left 4 Dead 2:  Left 4 Dead 2 is best played with friends. 3 friends to fill up the Survivor team for Co-Op, and 7 friends to fill up both teams for Versus. If you happen to do particularly well in a 'pub-stomp' team (a team pre-made with friends), you might get an opposing team that ragequits before the game is over. That can be frustrating.  Playing with randoms is not always the best experience either - you get your typical:  'Kid who has the mic always on' 'kid who screams at you'  'Person speaking language other than English'   ...as well as people who will vote to kick you from the game - regardless of whether you've done something wrong, and sometimes if you're doing better than the rest of your team.  The graphics work, but are kinda dated (seeing as the game is from 2008).",

Multiplayer is a veteran's game, so you better know what you're doing before joining ( a lot of people are very rude to noobs, which is honestly the worst part of this game, so if you can get past that you're golden). I bought this on sale for $5, and would have gladly paid $20 for it. The biggest problem with the multiplayer is that gameplay ends up being one-sided. There are 2 teams, and players enjoy stacking a lot. You'll often find yourself with utter noobs or else with extreme experts, in which case the game becomes anti-competitive.

I bought this in the Valve Complete Pack during the summer sale and didn't really care for it, but I tried it and now I can't really stop playing. This is one of the best games I have played, ever. Awesome Co-Op experience, nice community, just an overall amazing game. 10/10 Would rush Tank with Fireaxe again",

It's not as fun when you get a griefer or someone who simply doesn't play well, but those people are relatively few and you can always vote-kick them. Most people just want to play and have a good time. Very well done Valve.",

The concept of setting up for an enemy team is far different, now with the understanding that it is more rare to have a full team of incapacitating infected. The maps are more set for a length setup, rather than an up and down system that L4D1 was known for. The added weapons created a new perspective of play, along with melee weapons, different types of ammunition, and even exhaustible weapons (grenade launcher, m60, and chainsaw).   The feeling of this game was much more abrupt. Whereas in Left 4 dead 1, where you would keep moving, while still a little slower, while being hit by zombies, you could continue motion. Whereas, here, it become a staunch, grabbing, feeling, which means that you must stop and encounter the enemies, or risk having your team run along, and someone be left for dead (pun intended) by the rest of the team not being stopped by the grabbing hands of the enemy infected.  All in all, it was a good game, and has given way to interest in the third installment. Looking forward to where they take this franchise, hopefully to some kind of town.   Wouldn't it be hilarious, if they made some kind of mmorpg based off of this franchise, with similar graphics and style of play, but with more expansive maps, or simply by making loop backs, not making maps bigger, but making a map system connecting all the maps.

In L4D 2, not much change other than: -of course new maps and characters -Additional weapons (e.g. three assault rifles instead of two) and temporary upgrades (like adrenaline to help you move and reload faster) -additional special enemy types (spitter, jockey, charger) which is nice  I guess the game, like the first L4D is kept fun if you can make time to play with friends on steam as with dealing with strangers there's a change they are complete idiots or a.s.s.h.o.l.e.s and that ruins the experience for both versus and campaign. Also I grew tired of versus especially as the sides are almost always uneven, which u can tell by the score of teams the instant u join depending on how far in the match it is.  I personally grew tired of this game as I grew more fond of story driven games as the series has characters with personalities to like, but there's no story essentially. It's BAM BAM BAM shooting zombies and special infected enemies from point A to B.   I'd recommend if u like this first L4D cuz I think the second IS better. 9/10",

Anyways, Left 4 Dead 2 is an incredible game from the Valve corporation. You play as one of four playable characters - with DLC, eight - Nick, Coach, Rochelle, or Ellis. After you choose your character, you will be taken through one of six campaigns. It's amazing! This concept works perfectly. It gets even better with co-op. That's right, co-op. Now, you can kill millions of zombies... with friends! Even after you finish the single-player mode, there's multiple multiplayer modes, as well. I won't get into details, but, all of these game modes continue to bring me back, day after day. I give Left 4 Dead 2 a 10/10 - not because I think it's the best game in the world, but, for what it has, it does it wonderfully well. Well done, Valve, you did it again.",

As with most any multiplayer romp, the quality of your experience is of course tethered to the investment/energy/skill of your teammates. L4D2 is notable, however, for the way the game ingeniously, surprisingly, and ruthlessly plays upon that dynamic. While the fabled 'Director' AI isn't like to become sentient anytime soon, it is rather effective at nipping your group in the collective butt to step up the teamwork, and savagely exploiting your vulnerabilities if you're not playing together.  Thus, it's still as uneven as the squad you end up in, but often more engrossing and rewarding as a social experience than you'd expect from a game with bottomless hordes of cannon fodder as a core mechanic.",

It never gets old to shoot zombies in the face with a shotgun :3 Valve made a great job on this game, graphics are awesome, the sound is very good, the gameplay is perfectly balanced in my opinion and soo is the weapons. There are only two complaints I have about this game is that there is no 'fps_max' command..... What the ♥♥♥♥ Valve?!! Was it soooooo important to remove it? No, I diden't think so. Sure, I get that I might get comments saying it does not matter or that it is useless to limit the FPS. but it does matter. I usaly limmit my games to 60 fps, why? Because most monitors have a fps limit from 60 to 120 (mine is 60), soo what is the point of 300 fps when you only can see 60? There is none, allso by limiting the FPS to 60 your computer has less to calculate and therefor can use some of it's power for something else. Limiting the FPS also makes the gameplay smooth and beatifull. Also, V-sync does limit the FPS to your monitor limit, however it causes mouse lagg... Not exsactly the thing you want in a fps game :/ I realy wish that valve adds this command back. The second thing that sucks in this game is that if ONE zombie hits you... then you can't ♥♥♥♥ING WALK!!! Yea that is right, if one zombie attacks you that means that you can't run anymore... This is BS. Good luck running ayaw from a tank, ow wait you can't! Why? Because ONE zombie is hitting you..................... F*** logic right there :P Else than that, this games gets the thumbs up from me, as stated there is ONLY two things that is bad about this game ;)",

            "review_text": "Please don't misunderstand this rating. I'm practically a Valve and Steam fanboy but this game release has me reassessing those sentiments. Let's start from the beginning while trying to make this brief. I've played hundreds of PC games .. no exaggeration. I've managed to make games like Crysis to run on a P4 .. no joke. Though I have a new screaming middle class £1000 computer, L4D2 still has it's hiccups in spite of optimization. Played the demo which convinced me to buy the game. Pre-loaded L4D2 on Steam like any good fanboy should and on release I could not connect reliably to the Steam servers to decrypt .. that last vital piece that should have finished in a couple minutes took me about 2 frustrating hours. When I first loaded the game it played brilliantly. Unfortunately some of the auto-Steam updates have created additional headaches. CTDs. Sputtering frame rates. Even a continuous loop of startup videos with the weekend release they did yesterday (11/21) from which there was no escape save rolling back my entire PC. Come on Valve .. your QA folks should be doing a better job than this! Like I said earlier .. the game is seriously fun to play .. when it runs. I have had tons of PC games running on my PCs over the years and this is one of the least stable out of the gate. If you can afford to wait until just before the New Year hopefully Valve will have some of this worked out .. including their Steam update issues. I wouldn't miss this one as it is one of the best first person shooters to date. But if Valve doesn't shape up this will definitely impact my future purchasing decisions from them. Coach turns me on, get mad. Where do I see myself in 5 years time? Up ur ♥♥♥ with 5000 more hours under my belt.",

But the community is really sh!t like everyone says. Getting trapped by like 50 zombies does get pretty annoying at times, the game is really fun besides that. single player or with friends is where you want to be in this game. easy 7/10 on my end. Sorry i have to count occcasional bugs an glitches along with AI being off at times. But i really enjoy it missions are fun and never feel like they are repeating (except for the fact every mission you have to get to a safe house) all levels are desgined differently, unlike Gmod mods can be used in any game with anyone and no giant error logos poping up everywhere. So the community is the only real major problem with the game.",

Great experience good multiplayer better score system then l4d1 Great new campaigns  Cons People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if you sound young, even if you're 20, people will be a ♥♥♥♥ to you. New special infected skins. There is a bad CI population problem, like if you go in l4d1 campaigns there will be l4d2 CI instead of l4d1 CI.

Left 4 Dead 2 is set in the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic of an infectious disease known as the 'Green Flu' Which transforms humans into zombies. The games protagonists Nick, Ellis, Coach, and Rochelle are immune to the infection and seek to escape from the outbreak.  The games antagonists Common Infected, Boomer, Hunter, Smoker. Charger, Jockey, Spitter, Witch, and Tank are all set out to kill the survivors and make sure they never escape.  Left 4 Dead 2's multiplayer is where the game shines, whether it's:   Versus, (4v4) based gamemode where you play through the campaign as usual however, human players are on both teams. The team that makes it the furthest as survivor gets more points and therefore wins that round.  Realism Versus (4v4) based gamemode, however it's more of a hardcore setting and makes the game more difficult. The team that makes it the furthest as survivor gets more points and therefore wins that round.  Scavenge (4v4) based gamemode where the goal is to collect up to 22 gas cans to fuel up a generator (or car) this is a timed gamemode and each time you fill an objective up you get extra time, and points.  Mutations are modified game modes, that add twists to the game for fun or extra challenges.  Survival (4vs infinite hordes) The longer you stay alive the better the score and medal you earn. This is a fun way to compete with friends and beat their highscores.  And that pretty much does it for the gamemodes, however another reason this game is so fun is the workshop where you can download mods in the game to make it more fun. You can fully customize the game, and change everything. You may also insert custom maps into your game and the workshop just all around keeps the game fresh and fun.  The game also features the Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns and their characters.   If you're thinking about buying it, do it. It's very worth it, and amazingly fun with friends.",

This is the game where I made my first friends on Steam, some of which still remain on my friends list to this day. This is the game where I met my sweetheart. How can I not recommend this game?   Left 4 Dead 2 is a zombie massacaring simulator where you play as one of eight badasses and shoot, slash, shoot, burn, shoot, explode, shoot, and shoot again... your way through hordes and hordes of zombies. Some special infected are thrown in the mix by the AI director to spice things up a bit, and if that  still  sounds boring, there are plenty of mutators to change the game up. Maybe that doesn't sound boring, but you're afraid of getting bored after you've played all the maps, to which I'll say: Never fear, the AI director helps keep the maps fresh time and time again, but if even that fails your picky gaming desires, there are plenty of custom campaigns to choose from in the workshop.  Not in to killing zombies? Join 'em! Left 4 Dead 2 also doubles as a survivor hunting simulator, where you play as one of seven decomposing badasses and bite, scratch, bite, vomit upon, bite, hump, bite, and bite again... four of the eight aforementioned surviving badasses as you try to prevent them from reaching the saferoom at the end of the level.",

            "review_text": "  Left 4 Dead 2 is a co-operative video game released by Valve Corporation in 2009 which requires 4 survivors to survive through a zombie outbreak in various maps. This game also includes various game modes such as Versus, Realism, Mutation, etc.  The replay value of this game is very high. Although players are playing on a same map over and over again, but the director will always spawn different infecteds and special infecteds to spice things up, making the round more strategic, requires more teamwork and the whole round just gets tougher. If playing on the original maps all over again aren't what you are fond of, there are tons of websites (Gamebanana, Gamemaps) which allows you to download and play custom campaign missions created by beloved Left 4 Dead 2 lovers! Oh, Steam Workshop works as well.  Besides that, this game requires more teamwork than skill for the most part. Even playing on Normal difficulty, if players don't stick together, special infecteds can take down a team of 4 easily. If the Normal difficulty is way too easy for you, try Advanced or Expert to spice things up.  In addition, this game runs really well on a stable engine called the Source engine. Although graphics might look dated compared to the present games these days but thats where mods come in handy. There are plenty of High Definition texture packs available in the Steam Workshop which are all created by the community and the best part is: It's completely free!  Finally, Left 4 Dead 1 maps are ported over to Left 4 Dead 2. This will help to ease up the decision in choosing which title to purchase but if Steam has sale going on, I suggest getting both as both are just a masterpiece.  Rating: 9/10",

Later on after meeting some really great people, and after following lots of new custom maps, and after the Sacrifice I ultimately moved on over to only this one. We have the L4D1 maps on here now and can even play as the L4D1 survivors in some. Plus, it's been said the add on system is more advanced, and you don't even need to edit game files for most add ons such as skins... everything's a vpk now. I even have help making a campaign for this one. And this one seems to go on sale quite a lot, really no reason to not have it by now. I've lost track how often it's gone on sale this year alone.

I missed gunning down zombies with friends, but now I don't think I'll ever be treated with some level of respect, most players see my low hours (and I guess ignore my many achievements) say some snide comments then vote to kick.

After all, these FPS games had sliced into Valve's dominance in the FPS market in the early to mid 2000s.  So where do Left 4 Dead and its sequel stand in the modern market?  Simplicity.  Simplicity is lacking in almost every FPS games whether it is developed by DICE or Activision. They are never made for the laid back casual non gamers who don't own a PC for games. Left 4 Dead is truely a game where anyone can pick up a gun, a Katana or duel wielding pistols and still complete the run from zombies. Still, there is a great level of mastery to pick up when playing online in competitive mode.  After the various incarnations of Zombie killing games on the market, Left 4 Dead (whether it is 1 or 2) is still the ideal zombie killing LAN party game to date.

Likewise, weapons and health packs may not be in the same place as in the previous play through. The graphics are good enough and run easily thanks to the Source Engine. Lots of replayability and there are additional online maps to download if you get tired fo the included ones. 9/10.",

There are mods for L4D that make it realistic, to the modders it's 'we are fixing' to gamers they are breaking it.  Well my point is, the charm of L4D is that it knows it's a game and plays like a game. Gives a very good one hour experience of fast pace, zombie action/survival. Players play 4 new survivors, and are required to stick together through various campaigns made up of 3-4 maps.

I love the Portal 2 character mods, as well as the resident evil mob looks and Survivors.   It's story you have to search for by looking at the walls and listening to the talk among the survivors. It's replay value is pretty good. If you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, it'll take you hours, probably over 60 if not more to get them all. Or maybe less. Depending on good you are.   It's also a pretty good stres releiver. If you don't like people, play solo. If you don't care if people join you, online. You can meet some nice people to help you out.

For any one new to the Left 4 Dead series who recieved this at Christmas, do yourself a favor and thank Steam for releasing a Zombie MASTERPIECE for free of charge.  For those of you on PC who did not take advantage of the game while it was free, buy it while it is on sale. It comes highly recommended by myself to anyone looking for a quality shooter or zombie thriller. It contains all of the maps of Left for Dead 1 and 2 though, so just buy this one, not the bundle deal! It is well worth 20$, but the price drops to 5$ fairly often so waiting may be a better option for you.",

Since it's release in 2009 LFD2 has still managed to hang on and maintain a steady playerbase, something that speaks for itself and something many games are unable to say. The game, although simple in premise, manages to pull you in and keep your attention, and even going on 5 years later still gives you an urge to play. The game retains a replay value, although due to the games simple premise of point and shoot and it's basic plot of 'just kill as many zombies as possible' the game can become tedious over time. Luckily the game has had many updates, content patches, and an active modding community. All in all, even though the whole Zombie Genre is sort of reaching it's peak, and in some people's opinions already played out, LFD2 still manages to captivate players.",

Their sole focus is kicking your head in, while yours is running through hundreds of like-minded head-kickers to rescue. Versus mode is easily the most fun. Two teams of four take turns acting as survivors or the 'special' infected, who are superhero versions of the infected with abilities of super-jumps, or super-spit, or super-barf, etc.  The problem with this game is also its greatest appeal. It requires strong teamwork. Much like a rather well fitting corset, fall out of the tight teamwork this game demands and you end up looking like a fool, embarrassingly exposed to the world, before getting the stuffing kicked out of you. But get it right, and you look and feel stunning. BTW, I've never worn a corset.",

There are many game modes to play. So when you get bored of trying to reach the end of each level, you can take on an endless wave of Zombies to the death. The games also keeps things interesting with an AI Director. The AI Director will change the game to keep you on your toes. If you are doing too well, you may get an extra tank to take on. If you are struggling, expect to see some health kits on the way. Also, there is many 'special zombies' which require you to be alert the whole game.  Cons: I can't think of any except it is definitely a multiplayer game. While you could play by yourself, it gets boring and repetitive without a good group of friends.",

But keep in mind some servers have plugins and mods not found in the workshop! Like more players than 4, you can play as a witch, choose what class of zombie you want to be, choose a gun in a menu, or just plain WTFs?!  This game has a lot of good on it, and has a little bad.  Pros: Graphics are good even for 2014  - Updated and looked at weekly or monthly  - Fun co op with your friends  - Addons to boost the fun  - More maps, and some maps that arent even based on the game that are just for fun  - Plugins for you and your server  - Gore is funny and awesome  - 30 weapons to choose from (Some of which secret)  - Melee and Guns  - Choose if you want a handgun or katana    Cons:   - This game dosen't have any potatoes in it   I give L4D2 a 9/10 because it dosen't have a potato.",

Left 4 Dead 2 has you making your way through zombie filled levels with 3 other players (or bots) that you have to work with to survive. The game really shines in its multiplayer, as it forces you to work with your team. Spliting up or going ahead can easily get you killed or trapped, and do the same to your team. Through most of the game you will be running and gunning through levels in an arcade style of play, and that's not a bad thing. It gives you an awesome feeling to rush through a crescendo event with a katana slicing through zombies on your way. Even though this game has a lot of content to offer, it gets old after a while, and I always find myself wanting more. They sort of fixed that with workshop compatibility, but nothing beats the original style levels carefully made by Valve.   When it's all said and done, I would give Left 4 Dead 2 a solid 8/10.",

There are meele weapons and new special infected, which introduced in the contained first part. The only thing that I miss is the loot system. This is a Valve game such as Counter Strike, Dota or Team Fortress. The enjoy of looting could make this game far more a time-killer. For this maybe we will need to wait for the next part.

Of course, there are other weapons available... Chainsaws, cricket bats, axes etc, plus a whole range of guns. But trust me, stick with the frying pan; nothing else gives the same level of satisfaction.

If you want some more mods and or can't find your dream mod on the workshop, then use the library of Left 4 Dead 2 Mods on  gamemaps.com  and you'll find it.  Also, campaign in this game is great. It includes a new storyline, new characters, new zombies, and more! Also, i'm not sure if you need l4d1 for this to happen, but mine came with not only l4d2 missions, but also the original l4d1 missions, but with the new features and graphics from l4d2 built in. I personally still haven't beaten the l4d2 campaign as of writing this, and am excited to find what happens to (be prepared for a mouthful) Bill, Francis, Louis, Zoey, and the new characters, Coach, Nick, Rochelle, and finally, Ellis!",

A first person shooter that's set during a Zombie apocalypse. This game may not be the top tier of shooters and maybe dated with graphics compared to the games that are out since this review, but it's fun, time and time again, especially with friends.  This game makes memories especially if you have your best friends playing with you, especially during the escape parts xD I say play it. Not to mention it's on sale very frequently as well because It's made by Valve, you just cannot go wrong with L4D2.  The only complaint I can think of having is that the maps may get repetitive and perhaps boring, but I like to switch up the maps and stuff, the special infected and area where the Tank shows up are always randomized, as well as the items on each map (with some exceptions). The mods in this game are cool because I didn't get to experience anything like that with the Xbox 360. It makes an already easily replayable game, even more replayable with new maps and such, and it's nice to have a change of characters every once in a while.   This game, in my opinion, is a must own, must play. It's fantastic and I say gather some friends up and have a fun night with this game. Enjoy!",

If you havent played or followed the release notes, alot of small changes that you realize when you play improved it alot, some they even added into L4D1. For example witch, tank, and item drops for both teams have been regulared, and the Tank Statis addition.

On top of that, there is the realism mode too, which removes the aura surrounding objects, making it generally harder.

Left 4 Dead's gameplay is basicly the same as it's previous game, Grab a weapon, and beat the crap out of everything that wants to kill you and get the hell out of there.   Most of the changes of this sequel is the addition of different weapons and special throwables, such as the bommer bile jar. With the addition of these, gameplay styles can be dramaticly changed and new techniques be applied when using them.   In the way guns were added, there isn't much to say. The new guns have different damages and styles to use them in.   Other new things include the ammopacks. Instead of the name implying a moveable ammo package, these have ammo that changes the bullet damage. These are the 'Incdiniary rounds' and the 'explosive rounds' and fill 1 clip each.   The original L4D was also included in this game, so you are able to use the new armoury you have at your disposal and try different way to clear the map.   New enemy types have also been introduced to try kill you in different ways!  Gameplay is still fun as always. Valve have stuck to what made L4D so popular and expanded on it to make it even better. Deffinatly a good buy.   Make sure you play with friends though! ",

Good length to the 2 campaigns.  Cons : Gets repetitive, Not a great experience alone better played with friends.  Not realistic whatsoever, Ammo is plentiful in the campaign, Tons of Common Infected that in the vanilla game pose little real challenge even in great number the difficulty comes from specials:Hunter, Jockey, The tank, Witches, Boomers.  I cant stand the Jockeys and Boomers they give the game a very Arcady feel I think it would be better with just Varied boss finales not always a tank and witches.

Pros:+ Fun maps  + Lots of special infected to be weary of   + 4-Player Co-op and multiplayer.  + Buying this gives you the maps from Left 4 Dead 1, rendering the first game useless.  + The Steam Workshop has much to offer.  + Such as: Shrek Tanks, Candy-cane shotguns, TeleTubby common infected.  + Large maps  + Doesn't require a beast computer to run at a constant 60 fps  + Difficulty settings: Easy, Normal.. so on, so forth.  Cons: - The game gets repetetive after failing so many times at the same level, normally the finale.         Overall: 9.5/10    Update: Now the game keeps telling me that I need to start Steam in order to play it, yet I already have Steam running. What the hell?",

That way they don't have to write any dialogue and can just loop footage of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lying unconscious in bed while playing lots of teary flashbacks. It could be worse I suppose, considering the alternative is more re-runs of Funniest Home Videos where some idiot gets kicked in the balls week after week.  In L4D2 there's new weapons and new special infected, but the core gameplay is still L4D. It's more of the same really, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Valve has also re-released old missions from L4D as 'new content' so fans can reminisce. In one of the missions, Bill bravely sacrifices himself to save the team, a tragic turn of events likely to evoke tears of grief from even the most stoic of gamers. Fortunately, this turned out to be a false alarm and Bill was later found alive, inebriated and stuck in a cupboard that he wandered into after consuming one too many Molotovs. Never give Bill Molotovs.",

The game also allows the player to play single player as a Survivor or on 'Versus' - an 8 player co-op where 4 play as Survivors and the other 4 play as 'Special Infected' and have to kill the opposing team. A good range of guns and melee weapons available (and even more brilliant mods available in the Steam Store).

I feel that the survival aspect of this game is removed in some ways due to the inclusion of melee attacks that can allow you to run through the level without shooting a gun (unless you are facing a special infected or something like that), but it is one of my favorite weapon types in the game because nothing feels as satisfying as beating an enemy with a bat!

However it's somewhat generic, whilst L4D2 and it's precursor were groundbreaking in terms of shooters and zombie games alike, they tend to stay well within the comfort zone, never really taking big leaps to push the genre to it's limits.  The game is simply run from one heavily barracaded room to another, stopping inbetween to maul a couple of undead hoardes with a chainsaw, which, tends to be what most games do recently. Whilst I can applaud valve for making such an entertaining and well-balanced game, I feel as though so much more could have been done with the game, which is why the workshop is brilliant, I'm very happy to go on the workshop and look at a couple of maps and weapons however a game shouldn't really rely on user content to keep it going, besides the obvious (Skyrim has a very active modding community that are constantly pumping out mods that you never knew you wanted)  The zombies are very well made, feeling squishy and, partly, stupid which is what they should be, they're undead, they shouldn't be running at you, avoiding every obsticle aside from the occaisonal monkey with cymbals *COUGH*CoD Nazi Zombies*COUGH* often hoardes can be taken down easily assuming you've got enough ammo in your gun, but you always have to be cautious moving forward because you can very easily be overwhelmed, which is as it should be. The special infected are all designed to suit special purposes; the Boomer to attract hoardes of infected to your location, the Charger to charge into you, often pushing you off ledges or out windows, the Tank to ♥♥♥♥ your day up, etc.  Overrall I'd reccomend it because it's a fun game to mess around in with your friends, however be warned, once you've seen it once or twice, you've seen it all.",

Though obviously somethings will be quite tediously boring and harder to do if you're just playing with bots since they just follow you, shoot zombies that get close and get you back up when you go down. They aren't capable of doing objects such as gathering gas tanks, or using the radio etc... or set up defenses like a human player would.  Overall gameplay is very simple and repetitive. Run away, hack and slash with melee weapons, or just mow down zombies with you gun till you to a safe room. Every mission is basically the same... just different aesthetic surroundings. The game is a straight up FPS game, no survival rpg elements in it at all.  My only gripe about this game is how inaccurate the guns are. Typical valve nonsense where guns have uber spread for no reason, and whether or not bullets hit seems to be based on RNG. Like for instance every zombie has like an invisible magnetic force field around it. Sometimes it deflects bullets, and sometimes its like a tractor beam. A zombie can be standing perfectly still, and you can be aiming at it perfect dead center at its head or chest, and the bullet will just randomly go completely astray for no reason 7/10 times. Other times you're not even aiming at the zombie and the bullet will just go astray from where you're aiming and just act like it was magnetically pulled towards the zombie.  Otherwise any other graphic issues, and minor problems I had like for instance if you pick up two of the basic pistols to dual wield... somehow magically the second Sig Sauser pistol turns into a glock!?

If they ever make a new left for dead game (# 3), i would not play it unless there was way more guns, way more zombies, way more maps and they should add the ability to customize the gun in safe rooms and be able to actually scope with the gun in stead of always hip firing it.",

The first version came out 1999 which means it's been out for quite some time and it's still growing t'ill this day. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the game series and also the most successful one so far. I believe that there are three reasons for it's main success. The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the gameplay even more. The third reason is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. The game gets regularly updates which usually feature new items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. You will have lots of fun and tense moments both casually and competitively and I highly recommend playing this game.",

The core gameplay remains the same with some new weapons (adding melee to the mix), new characters to replace the originals and new infected to supplement the first set. The game is fun, and all of the original's content has been ported over into this game, but if that weren't the case I would play the original over this one. The flaws are hard to pinpoint, but here are some of them:  - The new characters are hit and miss, and feel more like caricatures  - The game introduces connective narrative between episodes, but it is badly shoehorned into campaigns, and doesn't really add anything - The tone changes from the nihilistic horror of the original (its the end of the world, no help is coming, and you will die) to a camp, B-movie tone with much more humor. Whether you like this is personal preference, but it ruined the immersion for me and reminds I'm playing a game, and a cartoon game at that - The campaigns are set during the day. This sounds minor, but consider how many horror movies have their scary sequences happen during daylight, or how different Alien would feel if the interior looked like the Enterprise D - The level design isn't as tight as the original, and a lot of sequences seem to exist simply to pad the length of the campaign e.g. recovering coke, the Screaming Oak, fueling the car. In fairness, many of these were new features (such as fueling the car) that they tried to add to the game to improve the formula, I just don't think they were very succesful. - The finale of Swamp Fever represents a massive spike in difficulty  - Modding to this game is much more rampant than to the original, and with it many changes that detract from the experience. Many sessions have been modifed to include 8 or more surivors which, frankly, is a cluster and ruins the carefully thought out gameplay (like adding Optimus Prime to a game of chess).  - Finally, many players aren't fun people and create a toxic environement. You can expect to get kicked for being incapicited when you shouldn't have been (in someone's opinion). New players are criticized for not playing amazingly well immediately. Frustrated players will kill their team while still in the safe room, or chastize players for leaving the safe room. (This last one is the most puzzling to me - some teams just want to stay in the safe room. You can't win by staying there, guys, you have to go to the next saferoom).  Overall, a fun time, but L4D2 is much more an expansion pack to the original than a true numbered sequel (something it was flagged for at the time of release), and if the majority of the player base and all of the content weren't present, the original would be the only one worth investing serious time in.

            "review_text": "Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first person shooter game set in the apocalypse. Left 4 Dead 2 is set in the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic of an infectious disease known as the 'Green Flu' Which transforms humans into zombies. The games protagonists Nick, Ellis, Coach, and Rochelle are immune to the infection and seek to escape from the outbreak.  The games antagonists Common Infected, Boomer, Hunter, Smoker. Charger, Jockey, Spitter, Witch, and Tank are all set out to kill the survivors and make sure they never escape.  Left 4 Dead 2's multiplayer is where the game shines, whether it's:   Versus, (4v4) based gamemode where you play through the campaign as usual however, human players are on both teams. The team that makes it the furthest as survivor gets more points and therefore wins that round.  Realism Versus (4v4) based gamemode, however it's more of a hardcore setting and makes the game more difficult. The team that makes it the furthest as survivor gets more points and therefore wins that round.  Scavenge (4v4) based gamemode where the goal is to collect up to 22 gas cans to fuel up a generator (or car) this is a timed gamemode and each time you fill an objective up you get extra time, and points.  Mutations are modified game modes, that add twists to the game for fun or extra challenges.  Survival (4vs infinite hordes) The longer you stay alive the better the score and medal you earn. This is a fun way to compete with friends and beat their highscores.  And that pretty much does it for the gamemodes, however another reason this game is so fun is the workshop where you can download mods in the game to make it more fun. You can fully customize the game, and change everything. You may also insert custom maps into your game and the workshop just all around keeps the game fresh and fun.  The game also features the Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns and their characters.   If you're thinking about buying it, do it. It's very worth it, and amazingly fun with friends.",

This number is a hint to how successful this game is and has become and for good reason. The story follows a natural plotline that is usually found in the post apocalyptic/zombie survial horror genre. The Unreal Engine allows extremely low lag and fast reactionary combat that makes the zombie zerging even more explosive. Sometimes there is nothing more satisfying than using AK-47s and rocket launchers to blow the hordes away. The co-op gameplay is even more gruesome as the game scales the zombie count to appropriate the number of players.  Bottom Line: The reply of Left 4 Dead 2 is extremely high and never ceases to amaze me. The only thing that bothers me is having to wait for the third game in the series and I simply cannot imagine the wonders it brings. 85/100",

            "review_text": "*NEUTRAL REVIEW - UNABLE TO GIVE ONE OFFICIALLY, SO NOT TOUCHING THE RECOMMENDATION SETTINGS*  This is a largely uninteresting game. It isn't engaging, the gunplay isn't very good and weapons don't feel like they have any sort of individuality to them. The entire game's appeal seems to be based around the fact that it's a co-op experience. You might enjoy it to kill some time with friends, but it gets boring. A zombie game that would have been much more fun to play with other people is something like the first Dead Rising game. Playing DayZ and teaming up is also more enjoyable. Playing Nazi Zombies/Zombies depending on whatever CoD game you're playing it on is MUCH more enjoyable. It's not like L4D or L4D2 are terrible games, it's just that they're very mediocre in my opinion. Get to the end of x map, kill zombies, repeat. It gets old quickly.",

The game also allows the player to play single player as a Survivor or on 'Versus' - an 8 player co-op where 4 play as Survivors and the other 4 play as 'Special Infected' and have to kill the opposing team. A good range of guns and melee weapons available (and even more brilliant mods available in the Steam Store). Each Campaign lasts on average 30mins-1hr, depending on skill level and what difficulty you play on. One of my favourite games and it satisfies the need for Zombie-slasher gore and horror.",

Seriously the most fickle crowd of immature gamers I have encountered. Seriously; the game came out in 2009. Can you get a hold of yourself and enjoy the game? I could understand if it was on some level of mlg/e-sport competition where there is something on the line, but it's not. I genuinely feel like it's not worth the money I spent, since i literally can't play or enjoy the game. That is being taking out of my hands since I am not the best L4D player. The game itself is a hell of a good game, but I can't seem to enjoy it. Essentially that's why I can't recommend this game. I feel like I wasted my money because I can't play the game for what I bought it for.",

Like most other multiplayer games, it's best played with friends as the experience with unknown people in this game can be very random and frustrating.   The game puts an emphasis on coop, and actually does so well at this, that it almost forces players to play properly - i.e. to stick together somewhat (respecting spacing of course) and to work together.   It's generally a quality product, that contains very few bugs that actually affect the gaming experience. The campaign is slightly short-lived, but can be repeated numerous times without feeling too dull - the difference simply is, that now you know precisely where to go, but it's not like this game is sensitive to spoilers.   There's an array of community built maps that you can venture into as well. Varying in quality, some are great and even quirky in the sense that the gaming experience is completely changed. Others are frustrating bordering on unplayable.   I recommend getting the game - especially if you can convince a few friends to play it with you.",

There was no thought put into weapon damage and infected damage.  Basically, if you play online you will find that l4d2 is easy in many ways, in many of the wrong ways, and tries to challenge all the wrong places.  I can see that Valve worked without Turtlerock in this one, since it's basically l4d with better graphics and a bunch of random filler that dident have any thought put into it at all.   I can only recommend this game if you liked the first alot, and you just want a tiny bit better graphics and some stuff that seems like dlc could have been there instead.

This version however has a good addition of gamemodes! There's a few easter eggs, some of which interactive, new characters, and so on, making it quite a bit more interesting than Left 4 Dead.  What really struck me well though was the addition of addons to the game; now you can customize your game exactly as you want it! Want to shoot planes instead of grenades? Done. Want to chop a zombie down in just that different angle? Done. Sounds? We got 'em. And there's even more to find!  For short; I really like this game due to it's story, characters, gamemodes etc, and the customizability is my definite favourite part of it all. I'd certainly recommend you give it a try if you're into the zombie fps games.",

There are several game modes you can choose from, my favorite has to be versus. This game does have a single player mode but it is best played with friends, me and my friends have got a lot of enjoyment out of this game and it is so much fun with friends and can get really chaotic as well. This game also has great mod support where you can either install mods to custom your own l4d2 or you can use the l4d2 installation tools to make your own and it is super easy and user friendly to do so.

When i was a little older they would let me play now and then when someone had to use the bathroom or go somewhere for a bit and they didnt want to stop and wait, and when i played it was awesome, just blowing zombies heads of with a shotgun or frying pan, takeing down hords of zombies with an AK or M16 to only get a car flung at me from a tank and before you know it everybody is dead, i loved it to death and wanted more and more. Now i have my own comp, where i can play any darn game i want and i seeked to get L4D2 and luky for me i got it for free on chiristmas 2013 and couldnt wait to play it, it was awesome, felt just like it did 7 years ago and wanted to play more and more. I may only have 100 hours on it in 3 almost 4 years but without a doubt I will play it again, in 2 more years from know no matter what game comes out i will come back to it and play it again its that fun. In my opionion this is one of valves best games, if you want a co-op zombies shooter were you try to survive hordes of zombies while youve got someone spamming louis's pills here and his death cry and another trying to take on a tank by them selves and your self blowing up your whole team with a grenade launcher, then this game is for you.

Being able to play as the survivors from the first game is an amazing factor, as well as being the survivors introduced in this game.

Once you've finished all the campaigns and played on all the maps, there're hundreds of other user-created maps to play on, all possible with just a few clicks. The steam workshop feature also allows you to change how the infected look like, the kinds of weapons you use, and who your survivors are. If you're going to buy this game, I suggest having some friends to play it with. I've had the most fun on this game playing with my friends, whether it being us screwing around or fighting for dear life, it's always better than doing it alone.

This is the first steam game I have played and even up to now the game has this magnetic personality where everytime I want to play another game I end up playing this one. Known as the successor of L4D1, L4D2 has a lot more content to offer even being superior due to the many game modes and more OS support(playable natively on linux based systems) unlike its predecessor. I can say Valve has done a great job in trying to improve the game. Knowing that the gameplay has minimal differences with its previous iteration I can say this game is great. I love L4D2 and L4D1 its just that I find L4D2 more enjoyable since you can modify the game easily as compared to L4D1. It still receives stability fixes even up to now. The modding community is still active. If you don't have friends then don't fret! You always have those trusty bot modifications to handle the rear end of your team.  TL;DR:   You don't have enough money to buy both L4D1 &amp; L4D2?  Get L4D2  Is there a reason for me to buy L4D1 if I already have L4D2?  I'd say no. You can modify the gameplay as if you are playing L4D1.  Bugs?  Both L4D1 and L4D2 has bugs but L4D2 still has a lot more fixes including community fixes. It's sad that L4D1 doesn't have that much community fixes to the problems it already has ever since.  Larger playerbase?  L4D2  Isn't L4D1 superior?  I don't think so. I think TRS forgot or never cared to support linux based systems natively unlike Valve.  Which game has superior animations?  They're both equal its just that in L4D2 a number of animation sequences haven't been used. The devs of L4D1 were a lot more careful in linking the animation sequences.",

The sequel picks up one week after the events of the first game (four weeks after the first infection) where The Infection has spread to the southern United States. Left 4 Dead 2 introduces three new Special Infected, new weapons, melee weapons, new items, upgraded Infected, the Uncommon Common Infected, five new campaigns, and two new game modes: Scavenge Mode and Realism Mode. Realism Versus and Mutations were later released with the The Passing DLC, a new campaign which chronologically fits in as the second campaign out of six.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The four Survivors the players control are Nick, Ellis, Rochelle, and Coach.",

Its been out since 2009 and its still such a great game with alot of people still playing its a 20$ game but you wont be dissapointed if you buy this game, Try the game out you might enjoy it i know i enjoy this game its pretty fun theres also mutations in this game to mix it up a litle like where theres only pills and tanks as infected instead of the normal infected. Im writing an honest review theres alot of good stuff to this game. I fell inlove with this game because i played the xbox version of the game the xbox version wasnt that bad pretty buggy at times but i put like 1,000 hours into the xbox version pretty crazy right? So i recommend you try this game out for yourself this is the second left for dead the first one was good but didnt have the special infected we have on left for dead 2 on left for dead 1 there were only Hunters, Boomers and Smokers those came to the top of my head tell me if i missed one. Left for dead 2 has the Charger, Spitter, Jockey, Smoker, Hunter, Boomer and the spitter again correct me if i missed any.",

This sequel has more game modes to play and even more choice of weapons to use against the undead, but there are also new types of special infected too, so be prepared to be amazed, or dead. It seems that Valve finally decided to add Left 4 Dead campaign into this new game, but the feels are different as the new infected also present in the old campaign along with the new weapons and improved graphics, making the game even more replayable.  Left 4 Dead 2 also comes with Steam Workshop support so there are lots of user made custom content you can download to customize your game, like custom weapons, custom survivors, custom infected and special infected, custom maps and event some people made custom campaign with their own story. You can also make your own content and share it with public.  Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a really good sequel. I recommend this.    Rating 9/10",

            "review_text": "Many people love L4D2, following the incredible success of L4D.  Personally, I think  this game is a heap of ♥♥♥♥  - and I love just about every other Valve game. Technically and graphically, it is better than L4D, and unfortunately, that's the only part it is better. In everything else, it stinks.  Gone is the atmosphere, the friendly rivalry between Louis and Francis, the grainy 70's film effect ( seriously, wtf were you thinking ), dark brooding cityscapes, and the witty repartee between all four members. Instead, you get four unlikeable characters that spend more time whining and ♥♥♥♥♥ing at each other, bright sunny days in New Orleans, and near constant waves of zombies. In fact, that is the main thing that irks me about the sequel. In the first one, if you had a strong member of the team, there was a fair chance they could pull the the rest of the team through, which made for some hectic, but fun, gameplay. In L4D2, there is no chance of that. The waves are too relentless and the specials spawn far too frequently, so if the team is a little disorganised, you're ♥♥♥♥ed with a capital F. Once the game decides it is going to target you, that's it until you either run of medkits or the team gets tired of trying to protect you. More often that not, you're spawning back at the safehouse, because one player got boomed, jockeyed and then incapped in the spitter goo.  Cue ragequitting from less invested members of the team. The fun factor just shines through at that point (/sarcasm)  I've tried hard to like this game, really I have.  God knows I've put enough hours into it, but I just can't bring myself to like it in any way shape or form. In fact, I've gone from trying to like it to hating it, and have completely removed it off my PC. If I could delete it from my Steam library, I would.  L4D may have had it's flaws, but it certainly had atmosphere and characters you could warm to, and my final verdict is that L4D2 does not hold a candle to it. To sum it up - in the first game, you felt like you were all fighting against hordes of zombies.  In the second one, it feels like you are fighting everything in the game - zombies, weather, terrain - some maps are just a  slow grindingly weary slog  from start to finish.  It's cheap enough to pick up for a bit of fun, and you might like it, but I seriously can't recommend it when the preceding game was far  FAR  superior in gameplay.",

But when it's all said and done, I always go back to the original for what the game Left 4 Dead is REALLY all about.  The Main reason I do not reccomend playing this game is for three reasons: 1. Gameplay is fustrating in advanced multiplayer levels 2. Console customization and game hosting customization is difficult. 3. Lack of Ambiance for a Horror game.  The sequel might have game modes. It might look different. It might have more jokes. It might have more infected. It might have more weapons. But by golly, it's a totally different game. And it doesn't feel right. 700 Hours in both games has told me one thing: Left 4 Dead 2 has no respect for the Original Left 4 Dead. It was meant to replace and make obsolete it's parent.  There are a lot of irregularities in gameplay that make Left 4 Dead 2 feel fake, but I would have to say the greatest missing ingredient from this Horror game is Ambience.",

I dread the slog that is the finale, the Dead Center one most egregious of all, since it is so backtracky it hurts. The base levels drag on too long, and while the health system is certainly  very  inventive, the friendly-fire and starvation of healing items feel like a grasping attempt at something resembling 'difficulty'.

There are also plenty of griefers who will do such things as switch teams on teammate sload (slow-load) to autoshotty your other afk teammate's face right off too; or just simply suicide mid game calling for annoying restart votes. Expect harassment in the form of trash talk gone too far (profile comment section flooding), DDoS'ing, group invite spam (sometimes 30+ groups at a time)   even if you won fair and square  . Sales make the pub Versus mode completely unplayable due to terribad n00bs, so you end up avoiding pubs for half of each year. 90% of public lobby hosts are braindead morons who have gone AFK and forgot they were hosting, are utter garbage skill-wise, kick you to make room for their cunty friends (or just because you are good and they are bad and afraid), or don't know how to use CVars to stop you from ending up in a 200ms latency server based in the Republic of Djiboutee (this is probably the worst, I still see 3000+ hour n00bs who don't know how to do it).

WHAT A JOKE!! how very disappointing when it comes to games like this. 'realism' is a joke. how about they make this game more real, by adding a wide variety of other quirky characters. like, Ann Nocenti, Steven Pinker, or even Sir Robert Menzies?? game provides repitive dialogue from annoying characers, why not add animal noises into the mix too.  i might reduce the games rating from an it's-ok to a i'd-play-this-a-few-times-but-not-too-many, who knows what the TRUE rating will be.  i have to say, a CRYING woman?? that's something which is very unappealing in a video game, especially a ZOMBIE game. so please devs, heh.  ultimately unsatisfied by gameplay.. requires a few more... quirks.  kind regards, the review man (so manly)",

This is definitely not what I think of as a 'realistic' zombie survival game but it can be fun with the right team.  I really wish they hadn't re-done the original maps and made them way less fun (i.e. grindy). I found Dead Island in many ways to be much more 'realistic' and much more fun overall (but unfortunately, far less replayable).  Originally, I would have recommended this game as I have uncounted hours into it on the Xbox 360, following the changes that Valve has made, I simply cannot.  Please bring back the meaningful crescendo events, where I do not have to willingly submit myself to damage in an effort to 'push' my way through a unrealistic unending hord.

I get that you don't want people to camp in an area for long so I can see why they were included. I feel that these changes make the gameplay less appealing.  I do like the melee weapons, different guns, laser sight, ammo upgrades, defib, and boomer bile. Also the addition of a survivor that drops items is great.

It's more realistic is one reason, do you ever see policemen or soldiers shooting distant targets while holding guns by their ribs? Even somebody who has played paintball should know that this is a basic thing to do while shooting. I can forgive the old medal of honor games for this flaw, but not this one.

The randomness makes for a good replayability value but also means that sometimes, whether you're playing by yourself or with others, on any given difficulty setting, the game will simply screw your odds without hope of recovery. I dislike this aspect and after several hours of jumping that fine line between challenging and unreasonable I have decided that L4D2 gets a thumbs down.",
