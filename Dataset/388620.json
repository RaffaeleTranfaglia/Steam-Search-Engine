            "review_text": "First impression: Lite puzzle adventure dungeon crawler.  It's lite as an RPG, your stats are money, health, attack and defense, and there are sme magic items you can acquier and use; it's lite as a puzzle game, you mainly need to strategize your use of keys (unless you're on easy), and it's lite as an adventure since you can talk to some people who may give you clues about upcoming levels and bosses. Unfortunately, you do need those clues, and in my case, I missed one, and the ensuing death threw me back more than an hour of gaming. If it hadn't been for that, playing on the medium dififculty I'd have called the game suffciently challenging to be motivating, but I'm not exactly eager to replay all of that (even though the levels have been re-generated).  There's also a maze mode you can play, where you have limited resources and limited information because you're on a mega-level that you can only see parts of at a time (unlike story mode), which makes it quite tough.  Do I recommend this? Well, I do like the concept, and if someone had told me not to engage a boss I didn't know how to beat (and to consult a walk-through if in doubt), I'd still be playing. There's really nothing else wrong with it, and especially considering its price, I can't really thumb it down. So, recommended.",

What I enjoyed most about this game is that you don't need to think that much and put a lot of effort into it and still have fun and get challenged.  It's not a near-perfect game, but still enjoyable.",

I can't imagine myself playing any longer though, and I can't recommend it for its full price, but it gave me some nostalgic vibes due to its original, albeit rough concept and execution. There is something that makes you strive towards the completion, but there isn't much new to see here after you beat it. Sure, you can go for some ridiculous achievements which I have no idea how to do (in fact, beating the story mode is tricky in itself, you gotta do some unobvious stuff or scratch your head when you fail by pressing the wrong button some time ago), and there is Maze Mode, which is even more randomized than the story line, not to mention surprising inclusion of Steam Workshop support for such a tiny game. Well, I didn't do any of this stuff for more than 15 minutes at best. All things considered, if you like the trailer and screenshots - that's what you'll get if you buy it. A cute little puzzle-ish RPG-ish thingy.",

It's got depth, but by no means would I call it deep. The puzzle elements are simple but rewarding. The procedurally generated levels can be difficult, but that also keeps the game from getting overly repetitive. After a playthrouh or two, you can use Soulstones to find creative ways around certain challenges.  The game certainly has its flaws, but well worth the price. If it's on sale, buy it and try it. I think you'll be surprised.",

            "review_text": "Another great game but it´s not possible to win until you killed the first Boss. You have ways to less dmg, armor and hp. So even if u buy some stuff at the shrine (hp, damage or armor) you cant kill the enemys to obtain new items, since u have like 800 hp left but u need to kill 4 enemys which deal arround 150 dmg and 2 which deal 600 dmg (or infinite = dead).   Once i got the iron shield but they still made arround 400 dmg, instead of 600 and i had 54 hp left and now way to get more.   So if they could change it, it would be a great game with a nice story. Otherwise just some crap. ",
