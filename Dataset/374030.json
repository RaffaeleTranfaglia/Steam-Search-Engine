            "review_text": "When a game is as beautiful and full of potential as Virginia is, it's difficult to admit that its flaws outweigh its better aspects. I wanted to like this game, but I feel like I'd be lying if I were to recommend it.   The art and music work well together to fashion a stunning world from an aesthetic standpoint, but upon closer inspection that world falls apart. The lack of interactivity in the environments are more reminiscent than a sparse model home than the life-filled spaces of Gone Home or Firewatch. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same charm of other 'walking simulators' to carry it. The game's soundtrack is ambitious, but inadequately implemented (more on this in a moment). The game's scenes are jarringly short, which ends up as a bit of a paradox, as the game's pacing makes it feel like one long scene rather than a fulfilling narrative. At the length of a fairly short movie by today's standards, Virginia still dragged. The soundtrack tries to match the game's pacing, and succeeds for some of the quieter moments, but the tense scenes feel too thinly stretched, going on for far too long for the music's urgency to have the same impact.   From a gameplay standpoint, there isn't exactly much to talk about. Your control over the main character is criminally shallow, leaving a unsatisfying disconnect. Often in environments there's only one thing to interact with, and there's no feeling of exploration when you're being railroaded through the story with even less agency than similar titles. It's difficult to call Virginia a 'walking simulator' when you aren't even doing much of that, but 'clicking simulator' sounds too close to point-and-click adventures, so I suppose I must settle for 'watching simulator.' This brings an issue to mind: I'd much rather be watching this story as a movie than playing it as a game, especially given how little gameplay there actually is. Were this an animated film, perhaps it would have faired better, but as a game--even as a narrative experience--it's sorely lacking in giving any sense of fulfillment.   Much of the unfulfilled feeling this game leaves lies in the story. Now, I'm not dead set on narratives requiring traditional structures, and I love movies that incorporate strong visual storytelling (Upstream Color comes to mind), but Virginia's narrative has an indirectness that leads to confusion rather than good old fashioned min♥♥♥♥ery. The developers did, indeed, set out to make a confusing game, but rather than being a complex mystery Virginia ends up as a scattered, unfocused, vague mess. Trust me, I got the major points of the story. It isn't that hard to piece together. However, what the game presents is, again, unsatisfying. I believe a lot of this is due to the lack of voice acting. While the NPCs were characterized well, Anne herself feels criminally shallow for the weight attributed to her story. The player doesn't identify with her because her motivation's don't align with ours in the slightest. Were there some narration, perhaps this wouldn't have been so jarring, but as it stands this alienation doesn't add anything to the game.   I feel like this game could have been more. Had the player been given more agency, there would have been a better connection to the story rather than the unshakable feeling of being an outsider. The visual style doesn't make up for the lifeless environments, and the music is largely hit or miss, with more of the latter in the long run. The story felt rushed and the pacing dragged, and the game's world isn't fleshed out enough to feel its own.  To sum it up in a word, Virginia was unsatisfying. Perhaps I'm missing the point. But perhaps the game just needs to make its point better.",

I really wanted to like this game, the trailers made it look like it had an interesting story, but like many others I felt dizzy and sick after just a few minutes. The game recommends that you play on 30 fps which I get because the developer wanted a more cinematic feel to the game. The game allows you to push the frame rate to 60, or even unlocked but that doesn't solve the problem. The developer severely limited the graphic options for this game and as a result force us to deal with nauseating motion blur! on top of that there is no FOV slider, so you are forced to play through the game with a cramped FOV. I cannot suggest this game to anyone. Do yourself a favor and save your money.",

I think Virginia was a beautifully well told story but that's all it is. No puzzles, no dialogue options, no dialogue at all.  I personally love this genre. People have been asking why isn't this just a movie, if the player has zero input other than movement? But the appeal of these Walking Sims are that YOU are the main character. It's much easier to empathize and get invested in her story, because it's happening to YOU. Not some character on screen. And the lack of dialogue lets you implant your own conversations and reactions and thoughts from your character. That really get you inside her head.  The downside of the presentation, is that a few story elements were lost on me. Things I didn't realize or understand until reading up on it, but that's obviously going to vary per person. There's a lot of Lynch inspired surrealism here that's meant to be left to the player.  Final Thoughts: This was a great, beautiful little story. One that I'm very glad I bought. But it's 100% dependent on story. The fact that they're even able to tell such a understandable story without a single line of dialouge is hugely impressive",

Virginia is a game, however the creators have used the game medium to tell the story they wished to tell and they have done that marvelously. The enviroments are well designed and play off the art style while the pacing is clearly inspired by the works they credit.  In terms of a game there is little to do. You progress through scenes by interacting (moving the analogue stick and pressing A/X is the entirety of your input potential) with key elements. Going into Virigina it being a first person story driven game I expected a few gamified elements, and to satisfy these cravings there are collectable feathers and flowers. However, these only add a subtle cosmetic touch to some scenes and outside of the game they yeild nothing.  This is more a fact that an opinion. Virginia may be a game, but is one that makes use of the interaction by letting you move through the story, It knows it. It does it well, and you will finish the game with plenty of your own thoughts and ideas bubbling away.  It's and experience more than a game, and that isn't always a bad thing.

Nice graphics and fantastic soundtrack don't save this walking simulators silly, artsy-fartsy story that makes little to no sense towards the end.  I tried to understand the 'conclusion' of this game, but it falls into confusing cliche stereotypes of this kind of genre and overloads you with a bunch of literal nonsense. It felt like it was trying to be weird for the sake of it. Disappointed, as it had great potential.  FOV is really low too, no options to fix. Also, for some weird reason it tells you that 60fps mode is not the way it should be played, which made me worry that something was going to break, but it hardly elaborates on why it tries to guide you into a 30fps lock.

I wanted to watch something, to passively consume, but couldn't find a movie that would hold my fleeting attention. I considered picking up a controller and trying to engross myself in a game, but nothing took my fancy. Then I saw Virginia in my library, unplayed, and thought I'd see whether that would scratch both itches.  Long story short, it really did.  Takes as purely a game, it falls several hundred feet short of being noteworthy. There is no real gameplay of which to speak; if you're in a corridor, for example, there are no doors you can open just to see inside, no boxes you can check for clues or collectibles. You can walk around occasionally, but it's mostly just 'Press A to Continue'  As a story, it has some flaws too. I don't think the writers wanted to create a game like The Wolf Among Us, or anything similar. Rather, this is much more of an indie arthouse-style film, with liberal use of cinematography and tropes like the feared 'dream-sequence' to cast doubt on the factual events, even as the credits roll.   Why then did I enjoy it so much? Because despite all of these problems, it still delivered a beautiful-looking, novel and engrossing experience, with an interesting first and second act, and a score so cinematic you can't help but engage. Furthermore, the above-mentioned narrative choices leave a lasting impression, with doubts and questions about the outcome of the plot swirling. To my mind, that only adds to the enjoyment.  It's £7. Sit with a friend or a partner, and play this for the 1-2 hours it takes, rather than staring at Netflix (again). I guarantee, you'll want to talk about it after.",

'Virginia' tries way too hard to pay homage to David Lynch and forgets that funky visual metaphors aren't enough... engaging characters, an interesting plot, and effective pacing are what gives the funkiness punch. There's nothing 'deep' about this story unless you choose to infer a novel's worth of unjustified conjecture from psychoanalyzing the clichéd dream sequences.  Beyond the story, the 'interactive' portions of the narrative are merely annoyances and do nothing to engage the player or serve as dramatic edits/cuts. Maybe this could be effective as a VR movie experience that avoids 'gameplay' all together... but the story is so thin, emotion is so lacking, and the metaphors are so heavy handed that I doubt even VR could distract you long enough.  I’ll wrap up by saying that I might have enjoyed 'Virginia' more if I hadn't just been kicked in the gut by 'Firewatch’s' all emotion, minimal story approach... but probably not.

            "review_text": "Short review: Virginia is awful, truly awful.  Long review: Virginia is the newest in a long line of so-called 'walking simulators' - games that barely qualify as such. I'm going to assume that the reader is familiar with this emergent form of gameplay so that I can cut to the chase. Virginia does not make a single attempt to justify its choice of medium. Interaction is completely linear - the concept of choice does not exist. Other walking simulators, to use the infamous Gone Home as an example, often have supplementary material littered throughout the game to help flesh out the world and immerse the player. The player can either rush through the game, or take things slowly and examine their environment. Corridors in Virginia are completely empty, and thus all the player can do is walk from point A to point B (is this the truest form of walking simulator?). Without any interaction or exploration possible, there is no reason for Virginia to be a video game. I'll take it a step farther, it actively tries NOT to be a video game at times, completely preventing the player from moving the camera or heavily restricting its use.  If Virginia's not a game, we'll have to look at it as a film. Virginia never gives the viewer a reason to care about its characters or what is happening on-screen, but expects them to anyway. At one point the protagonist is flipping through archived documents and really exciting music is playing and it really feels like this is supposed to be some incredible earth-shattering revelation but it all feels so empty and that's just the way the whole thing feels. The lack of dialogue simply does not work in a setting like this, and it prevents any meaningful characterization from happening. It almost seems like this decision was an afterthought after the devs were unable to find any decent voice actors, but this is just speculation on my part. The empty rooms and silence by the characters create a powerful one-two punch of apathy in the viewer, and turn what should have been a relatively straightforward plot into one that can be hard to decipher at times.  The plot in Virginia is nothing special and in the end doesn't really have anything new or important to say. This isn't to say that every film needs to have some sort of message, but I cannot think of a single unifying theme present throughout Virginia. It's simply a series of events that happen without purpose, and purpose is the key word here because Virginia does not have one and no matter how long I think I cannot justify its existence. I cannot see the Twin Peaks comparison outside of the character that looks suspiciously like Agent Cooper - (at least the first part of) the series had a clear purpose, and the characters themselves were charming enough to care about. I cannot see this as a character study akin to Mulholland Drive - again, it's just so empty and the lack of dialogue does not work at all (maybe this is just a way of saying that the protagonist is mentally handicapped).  Technically, too, Virginia is a mess. This is of course subjective, but the art style is extremely ugly in its strange blockiness and simplistic lighting. Less subjective is how mechanical a lot of the movements appear - a character will suddenly start moving a hand without any sort of build-up, and sometimes they'll completely stop moving at all. Having such unrealistic movement in a work that already doesn't feel very immersive only further detracts from the experience.  As game or film, Virginia fails on all fronts. Whatever you do, do not buy this game, even ironically. If you are looking for a 'so bad it's good' experience I can point you to several similar games (personally out of 2016's releases I've enjoyed That Dragon, Cancer) that you and your friends may find entertaining. Games have the potential to hold serious artistic merit, but those like Virginia make no effort to carve out their own path, instead opting to take the lazy way out and attempting to copy film. The more I write about this game the more I hate it, and I hope that everyone involved in its creation got a good spanking when it was all over.  Taster’s score: C-",

The sheer breadth of the music is astonishing, it moves smoothly from touching to curious, to excitement, to shock… In fact, it is what I find to be the central piece in navigating through the somewhat chaotic narrative structure. It holds the central theme of each segment and paves the way for the movement ahead. For me, the music brought alive the story, especially when there is no speech to be found, it fills the void with something truly sublime.  Virginia is a courageous experiment, it is heavy-handed and linear, but compact and elegant. This is my personal preference, but I found a remarkable sensitivity from the creators of this game. Given the fractured structure and many surprising narrative jumps, I found myself swaying on the thin line between maddening frustration and curiosity. It somehow managed provide a solid footing while constantly knocking you off balance. Aside from the array of 1990s TV references, the skill and attention needed in crafting this story demands my applause.  It is very difficult to speak to the pros and cons for this game, if you can call it one. It is a mosaic of moving pieces, only to be vaguely made-out from afar. This is an entirely different animal. It is also the product of many rather interesting choices, for one, why make a video game if there is pretty much no interactivity? Really, what is the point of a game if you can get just as much out of it by watching someone else play? Player freedom seems to have been redirected to pointless movements such as looking at trees and flowers and bird feathers. Yet it provided a strange level of depth to this intricately crafted story, but maybe it is just my post hoc justification. No, I don't think they are commenting on the metaphysics of choice and folly of free-will. It seemed to me to be fundamentally artistic, meant for expression under the suspension of disbelief, not persuasion, and most definitely not meant for entertainment. My struggle with this work is that I found no catharsis or insight at the end, I really thought it was coming. To be frank, it made no sense to me. Its significance wholly capsulated in its own world, safely removed from the player. The compound of overlapping motifs and symbolisms was not granted the time nor the space to fuse and yield meaning. It is as if they piled up a bunch of fireworks for the finale, but just as it’s about to go off, instead you are handed a piece of paper which reads, “oh, and then the fireworks went off.” Bloody infuriating.  The immediate experience of Virginia is incomplete, the whole thing has the feel of a phenomenological experiment for a post-modern art study. But despite its faults, I found myself very much enjoying the artistry, the craftsmanship, and above all, the masterful music of Virginia. One last point, I feel this game deserves to be put into VR, it would mitigate much of the interactivity issue.",

This game looked interesting from the trailer and felt like a movie with what I played",
