            "review_text": "If there were any more snowflakes to collect, I'd still be playing right now.  This little gem is just pure magic. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a platformer this much in my entire life. The story itself is nothing to write home about; one of Marvin's mittens got stolen and he's looking for it every day. The execution however is top-notch. Everything from the simple but rewarding progression to the music score, voice acting, level design, you name it, were all very well done.  The only (minor) grip I had with the game was the automatic saving system that got in the way of snowflake-hunting more than once by throwing Marvin back home at more-or-less regular intervals. I think I would've liked a disable option for this but I have to admit that it added its own little charm. Moreover, as traveling from map to map got faster, it didn't really bother me.  Overall, I'd say the experience was worth every cent. Absolutely loved it. I can well imagine myself returning to this game in the future.",

            "review_text": "The concept of non-violent game is very good, but the game is too difficult for the kids in some parts. The game would be better if its difficulty would be manageable for for kids 5-7 years old. In its current state help of an adult is required to progress in it (and in some places the required jumps were unforgiving even for me).  Great idea, but the level designer forgot that he is making a game for kids.",

Marvin's Mittens was able to invoke an intense feeling of childlike wonder for me, and I get hit with feelings any time I hear the soundtrack. It is a marvelous game and I cannot recommend it enough.",

It's a bit magical, in an absolutely charming way, and goes by quickly. The controls are smooth and easy, and while the game isn't exactly challenging, it's a very pleasant and relaxing experience. I really liked it!",

            "review_text": "This is a game for children, or adults who want to touch base with their inner child. It is a 2D sidescrolling platformer, where the titular kid Marvin runs, jumps, and sleds around. The jumping is mostly pretty easy, but occasionally gets suddenly very hard. The aim is to explore the world, collect all the snowflakes, find all the animals, and, erm, track the mitten thief. (Yep that's it.) What joy to be had is in marvelling at the scenery and hearing Marvin's grunts and gleeful cries as he traverses the snowscape. The game is pretty short at 2-3 hours.",
