            "review_text": "This is the best WWII naval battle game so far: my path of great naval games has gone Dreadnoughts (on Amiga), Task Force 1942, Fighting Steel, and now Atlantic Fleet. The ship models are realistic, though lacking individual differences between class members and rebuilds, eg all county class cruisers are Berwick style with cut down aft deck and large deck house rear superstructure, London included; all QE class are as QE, Warspite has no faceted bows and Malaya and Barham have been modernised, similarly Repulse looks like Renown, etc. This would be nice to see, like the different placements of mainmast between Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. But that is beside the point - this game is a delight! It plays convincingly and really delivers some of the best battles I've played - looks splendid too.  What could be added - well, the extra models as I suggest, I would love a 'ship editor' so I could 'make or modify my own' - similarly a scenario editor. I have tried to get merchantmen to ram subs, but perhaps this isn't allowed? I would like more 'bridge info' - compass heading, the bearings at the top of screen are always relative to the ship. I would like to choose the order in which my ships move and act. Perhaps the armour penetration values need tweaking to make sinkings more difficult (more realistic) - in real world, most naval engagements were lengthy and far fewer ships were sunk (or even hit) - but in Atlantic Fleet some heavy armour is penetrated too easily - I guess it is a balance to find between realism and gameplay needs. Currently there are two difficulty settings - perhaps more settings for 'easy' (lots of sinkings), 'harder', 'difficult'. and 'realistic' (for die-hard naval enthusiasts like me!) could be given?  How about a Jutland WWI game with this engine? - I would certainly buy it. Armoured cruisers, protected cruisers, pre-dreadnoughts, battlecruisers (which really did blow up after a single salvo hit - at least British ones did), the emergeance of light cruiser and heavy, larger destroyers and the great dreadnought battlewagons  So how about French ships, Italian ships, Russian ships - this engine is worth it (we have Washington in the Atlantic, we should have New York too, and some US destroyers - Mediterranean campaign for both world wars (including Black Sea and Dardanelles?), and yes, integrate the Pacific in with it.  This calls out for a lot of expansion - because it is brilliant. Buy it, play it, enjoy it - this is the game I have been waiting for at least 10 years - splendidly executed - well done.

(Not as cold as the oily waters of the Atlantic mind you.) It's not too complicated and yet it's complicated enough to satisfy my realism needs.

Atlantic Fleet is somewhat simpler, but it also panders to my long-lasting love with turn based strategy games.   I'd really love some more ships, though. They put in some 'paper ships' like the Z-Plan H-class battleships for the Germans or the British Lion-class, but have omitted, for example, the Graf Zeppelin aircraft carrier that was in fact built but later scrapped, leading to a certain degree of disadvantage for the Germans who have NO naval air capabilities whatsoever now. This might be accurate for a historical campaign setting, but for the free-for-all games it really puts the German side on a certain disadvantage (which is somewhat mitigated by their superior submarines)  Still, it is a great game. Would love to see a Pacific theatre version.",

The graphics are excellent and will play on my machine which is not a gaming machine. The sound effects are pretty good too; I especially enjoy listening to the creaking of nearby sinking ships.  One complaint I have is that when you finish a campaign, there is no recognition for it. At all. I completed 19 scenarios and was disappointed that it doesn't have any sort of cut scene or even simple graphic to recognize that I had completed the campaign.   If you like turn-based naval warfare you will probably enjoy this game.",

            "review_text": "It's all it's simpleness, it's very enjoyable. There's quite a satisfaction attached to hit an enemy ship with a full broadside or to sneak up with your subs and sink that flag ship. The controls are quite easy to learn and it's not in the same spirit as the Navy sims out there. There are some 'mini games' within the game as well when you do torpedo runs with e.g. a Swordfish airplane. It's quite crude in it's implementation but still you can use it to your advantage when you are close enough to your own airsupport.   With that said, there are quite a few problems.  1. The enemy subs seems to be able to exit combat at will. Several times I've had them locked on by up to 4 destroyers and suddenly you just get the message 'U-96 exits combat'. This has to be fixed. I would understand if the sub was able to evade my fleet, but there's no way for it to escape once the sonars have located one. In real life, yes, but in the game no.  2. Air strikes. The problem with these is that you can't freely put a marker on the map to carry them out. They have to be locked onto a target. And if the target is a sub, well, then you have to click on the actual sub and not on the surface. This is quite an issue since the only ships that can target a sub are the destroyers, it means that it's a hit and miss click fest until you get lucky.   3. Targets are not shared among the rest of you fleet. It seems that the Captains wants to keep enemy ships to themselves. Not very realistic. If one ship spots an enemy, of course they would let the rest of the ships know the bearing and distance.   4. The end game is not clear. Not clear at all. I'm not saying that there should be missions as such since it's a sandbox, kind of, game but some things just doesn't make any sense. Take merchant ships for instance. Frequently you get messages that some Nazi sub has sunk some 30000 tons of loot near Greenland but it has no real impact on your game. It doesn't feel very necessary to protect them besides that it gives you an opportunity to sink some enemy ships. As an enemy sub Captain you don't earn any 'money' either for civilian ships, only military. Given that the whole Atlantic navy war was about sinking as much goods as possible, this makes no sense what so ever.   5. I've had several glitches with the aircraft carriers where they suddenly become invisible. Invinsible would be nice sometimes, but the camera bugs out and only shows a grey window. You can still command them, but it's pointless since you can't se what they are doing.   6. Ranging. This is also an issue since you have no tools to range an enemy ship. If you can visually see a target, apparently they have hired a flock of monkeys that sits below deck and gives you a guestimate of the range. Now, I know how it works in real life (the same as for artillery on land) that you shoot-correct-shoot, but they did have crude range finders (optical devices that when converged on a target would give a estimation). Luckily, most of the time, the enemy seems to share the same trained monkeys. It would also make sense if your more exprienced crews would give better rangings than a noob ship. It should pay off to keep a ship alive.   7. AA. There should be a way to fire on incoming aircraft. It seems that it's a pure 50/50 now if your ships will be able to hit them with their AA artillery/guns. Some aircrafts, the ME 110s in particular, never seem to miss either with their torpedoes.  There are probably more stuff that I can't think of at the moment, but these are some issues that leaps to mind.  Overall, yes, it's quite fun and enjoyable. You don't have to be a sim freak to figure it out and once you get to fight with your big Battle ships that fires shells the size of small buses, it's very fun. Beware though, it's more towards arcade so if you are looking for a sim you need to keep that in mind.",

            "review_text": "neat addictive, so far not too deep simulated, still not too abstract little WW2 naval action game. It has enough simulation aspects and accurate details to satisfy history freaks. At the same time your degree of interacting is limited enough to keep it simple.  Combined with turn based gameplay, you get sucked in to enjoy that 'one more turn' desire.  Basically you do 2 things. First move your vessel some distance, by adjusting rudder and speed settings. Thereafter you use the firepower by selecting a group of guns or torpedoes, adjust barrel elevation and/or direction to shoot, fire!  If you are interested in naval warfare, especially of WW2, if you are familiar with all the famous ships and classes of that time, you can enjoy pretty accurate and beautiful models of these in this game and even create customized matches.  There is also some fun with using aircraft carriers, aircraft attacks, Uboats, anti-sub-warfare and a few German Hilfskreuzer.  The simulation aspect is somewhat limited, still it is lots of fun even for simulation enthusiasts (which I also claim to be). So to be fair, I again have to say that mostly everything is heavily simplified. Yet the potential for further enhancement is visible all over the game.  The developers are very communicative and accessible in the steam forums. Currently they are getting shelled by tons of ideas and suggestions of the increasing player community. The devs already hinted that they totally intent to enhance the gameplay (probably not with this game though, due to limitations in the coding) and if you read how they reply to many discussions in the forum, they are obviously not new to naval stuff therefore my hopes are high that they might produce some decent naval simulation sometime in the future.  The built in 'Battle of the Atlantic' campaign mode offers a map of the Atlantic on which you can strategically put your available vessels on patrol. This reminds the veteran naval wargamer of the now vintage GNB series.  So this game could be the first step of a project leading to a modern GNB clone with all its former strategic gameplay aspects of managing a navy in WW2, adding tactical battles feauturing beautiful visualized ships.  This game is clearly worth a lot more than the 10 bucks I payed for it. Considering the little price tag, chances are high you won't regret a purchase, even if you are not that much into the genre.",

Some realistic tactics pay off, such as torpedo runs by Destroyers   Negatives:  Submarines too powerful verses escort ships, they can shoot off torpedoes too easily, they really should have to spend a turn doing nothing but lining up the attack. Large calibre guns can hit small ships too easily, therefore no reason to use secondary batteries. AI is pretty dumb, I had to turn off the choice for the enemy to withdraw from battle, as once they were damaged they tended to just make smoke until you destroyed them, lacking the speed to withdraw. Campaigns are just painful due to Submarines being way OP.  Though I was initially very dissapointing that a game about the Atlantic campaign should get the feel of escort verses submarine battle pretty much wrong. I found the surface action component of the game game quite fun. That said, playing verses submarines is dissapointing, the submarines are both too powerful, and conversly too easily sunk, possibly because the spend too much time at perescope depth.",

If you like WWII naval battles, turn based strategy then this is for you and at the price of £6.99 what's to complain about.  Plus side: -Dev's actually listen to you and respond -Nice looking graphics with individually tracked shells -Realistic shell impact hull damage, component damage and realistic flooding/control -AI can give you shock if you don't pay attention to it *** -Has multiple game modes: Single historical battles, custom single battles, campaign and battle of the Atlantic (for both sides) -Cheap one off cost! -Plenty of ships to choose from on both sides and very nicely modeled.  Down Side: -*** AI can have a slight Leeroy Jenkins aptitude and start charging you at times making them easy to pick off -While I love the follow view of the shells on my phone, I do find the same thing on the PC to be a tad cartoonish in comparison   I know people will look at my hours played on this in steam and probably stuff my review as being a 'rookie' review but trust when I say if I could have added the hours spent on my phone playing this game to my steam account you'd get one hell of a shock.
