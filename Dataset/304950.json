            "review_text": "I sat my girlfriend in front of the PC and she played for ten hours straight. 'Castaway Girlfriend Paradise,' should be the game name.  10/10, would distract girlfriend again.  In truth, she's made many comments while playing Castaway Paradise:  - She enjoys the 'Animal Crossing' style game play where you want to come back each day for a 'refresh of the world' and continue playing. Areas unlock as you collect Puzzle Pieces. You can decorate and expand your home. There's a Museum you can submit collectibles to.  - She has already collected everything the Museum needs in 20 hours playtime, which leads her to the impression that there's not a lot of content overall. Of course, with the game in EA state, this is expected to change.  - She does not overly enjoy the questing system. Most quests reward you with a pittance of currency and restoration projects to expand the city cost thousands. They are also repetitive and sadly necessary to make any progress (Growing crops take real-time hours and net little money, too; in addition collecting things from the shore or ground reset each real-life day, so there's no other way than questing to make your cash - at least this is her belief).  - She gets frustrated at the time barriers, but has come to accept them, as Animal Crossing does the same. The only difference here is that she can *cheat* in Animal Crossing by changing the date/time of her Wii or 3DS. Although we haven't tried changing the PC time and relaunching Castaway Paradise, such an action usually has far more consequences than doing that on a console.  At the end of the day, any complaints aside, she does keep launching it and playing it each day and that's good enough to get a positive review. If a game keeps drawing you back, then it's worth it.",

            "review_text": "This game is very similar to those Facebook/App style games where you plant a tree and either wait 2 months to harvest it or pay £10 to harvest it RIGHT NOW! That's not a bad thing, it's actually really awesome.  The only thing that made me close those Apps were the paywalls but now there isn't one and I haven't closed it for 4 hours. Not sure if I ever will, send help!  Really great game if you enjoyed Farm for your Life, Farmville etc. Typical Plant this/Grow this/Sell this/Fish for this game but very addictive and chilled out. Definitely worth the current sale price £2.49 not sure about full price, although considering how much Farmville type games make this is a bargain.",

            "review_text": "Very fun game with many similairitys to Animal Crossing. You get your own residence, you can chop down, plant or grow almost anything you want. You are assigned a small farm plot for crops and the residents will offer you different types of quests. Fishing is very easy to do although I never found a use for upgrading the fishing rod, its a slow process so I almost always had 7+ charges remaining and the fish are very scattered so its hard to use up all the charges before finding more fish. Items have a charge limit on them for example the water can starts off with 10/10 and when you use water it goes down but recharges overtime at 45 seconds per unit. This can be frustrating while trying to grow more than 2 tomatoes which can require 7 water units per tomato. I had my water can fully upgraded and everything required water, I was constantly waiting for it to refill as paying 3750 to refill it seemed too pricey especially since I built the TOWN WATER WELL!!! This is no longer an issue once your 15 so avoid farming things like tomatoes early and sve yourself the headache.  I do love this game though, I was always baffled that no one made anything like Animal Crossing for the PC. This game fills that niche and does so very well. Give it an hour and see for yourself, if you dislike it request a refund but you will probably end up staying like most everyone else :)",

            "review_text": "I really enjoy this game. I've never played Animal Crossing, but I have played Farmville and Castleville on fb. This is quite similar. I love games like this even if I do have to wait a few minutes for flowers to pop up or quests to be done. If you're like me though you just find other things to do while you're waiting. But you can do quest after quest for hours. There's always something to do.   Con about this game? The walking.... I've never spent so much time trying to walk around, finding people and accepting quests. Sure you can zoom out and see where they are, but it takes FOREVER going back and forth. I wish they would just have a feature where the quest explains itself right then and there, so you don't have to keep wandering to accept them.   A little tip for this game, when you pick up trash, find bugs, fish etc. Keep them for a while before selling them. You don't know how many times I've accidentally sold something and then find out I needed it for a quest. One quest asks for seven tires, and I've sold a lot already. So now I just have to run around and wait for some to respawn which could take days. Quests I could have finished early, I had to wait to finish because I was trying to make some extra gems &gt;.&gt;   Other than that, I do recommend this game. I'm not sure if it's worth the entire $14.99, I bought it for $10. If you want this game wait for it to go on sale, or don't if you just want it now XD",

            "review_text": "After 2 hours of gameplay I felt as if Castaway Paradise had taken a giant dump on my childhood.  If one was to remove RNG, item scarcity, and complexity from Animal Crossing then add in pay to win elements you'd have something similar to Castaway Paradise.  If you are looking for an Animal Crossing clone for PC you'll be disappointed.   Pros: - The building, environment and item art captures the essence of animal crossing 'cutesy'. (sadly I disliked the art for the characters which is very boxy and frankly kind of ugly.) - Has character levels which add an extra incentive to do things around the town.  - 'vip' (the ios/android 'Pay to Win' premium account status) is awarded for no cost at level 15.  Cons: - All the buildings and townsfolk are pre determined, gameplay is clunky and buggy. - Game play feels mindless, every townsfolk quest is spoonfed to you. Buildings are predeturmined and in shambles and visible until you finish building them. Farming currency is a game of waiting for your watering can to spawn more water. - The UI is still optimized for the phone and is thus needlessly large and clunky. - With the exception of wasd for walking you must use the mouse for everything.  - All items are available from your inventories 'catalog', rendering the town store pointless. Infinite numbers of items can be purchased removing any sense of 'item scarcity' and adding to the feeling of a spoon fed mindless game.",

            "review_text": "Honestly I got this game on a whim not knowing if I would like it or not. After starting out though I fell in love with the game. It's pretty much an Animal Crossing on PC type game, though the characters look a tad like Animal Crossing had a baby with Minecraft.  The game itself shares similar elements to Animal Crossing, you fish, collect shells, and catch bugs and turn those into the museum guy to complete your collections. Just like you would the fish, bugs and fossils of the former.  You get rid of weeds, can grow and harvest different fruit trees to sell just like in the former as well.  The main difference that makes me love this game though is the slow build up. You slowly do quests for the villagers, making money that in turn lets you unlock sections of the island one at a time. From there you also use the money to rebuild and furnish the island. The quest feature is really nice and it's an enjoyable change that gives the game a greater feeling of depth than what Animal Crossing did on its own.   I got this on sale and I can see some people maybe not liking the price, but if you love Animal Crossing and quest time features and tasks like some Facebook games have, then this is the game for you.",

There are a lot of little things to do to keep you occupied and I think the game is a great time killer and good to play if you just want a nice relaxing game.  It gets frequent updates and has great devs that listen to the community. If you're not sure you'll like the game enough to justify spending the money on it, I would suggest trying out the free version on Facebook or on a mobile device with the app. The paid version here on Steam has no microtransactions (the free version does have them) and has some nice free items packs and other content given out regularly!",

Castaway Paradise has a charming look, and in my opinion it's essential to a game like this and there are a lot of options regarding the customization of your character and the island, talking about the island customization there are various items you can buy to give your touch to the place. Each NPC's that inhabit the island has a different personality and the random dialogues make me smile mostly of the time because of how casual and silly they are.   The NPC's also gives quests to you rewarding with items, gems, puzzle pieces and xp. The quests are very simple, like growing crops, delivering things to another NPC's, catching specifics bugs/fishes and so on. So it's perfect for that time you want a more casual thing to play. The game incentive you to logging everyday to receive awards like more customization packs, items and etc I'm not fond on it but in the end it doesn't bother me because the developers keep adding more and more content in the game, like seasonal events and theme packs all for free.  In the end I'm having a positive experience with the game, it's fun, colorful and my young brother likes to play it with me so that's a huge plus for me. I recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Even if the game is still in constant evolution (bug fixes and addons), so far it's already a great, fun life sim.  It feels a lot like My Sims and Harvest Moon mainly, where you live in a determined scenery rather than a randomly generated one, with its set of characters instead of alternating villagers. Also, you have an experience meter that levels up by solving quests given by the characters or doing simple chores like pulling weeds, breaking rocks, planting flowers, trees or vegetable seeds; the more you level up the more you unlock goods and even other parts of the island. But there's also plenty of Animal Crossing 'touches' there, like anthro animal villagers, several themed clothing pieces and furnitures or a wide selection of bugs and fish to catch and sell, donate to a museum or use any other way you like.  But of course, the game has its own identity. The mouse + keyboard control is practical and works wonderfully. The game is filled with great humor, with lots of popular culture allusions too. One of the strongest points is the indoors and outdoors cutomizing freedom: the majority of the items and collectibles there are not limited for use only in a certain place. Too bad you can't interact with them (so far, maybe).  Bottomline, a worthy title for life sim or just casual gamers.",

The tasks you do in this game can actually be rather helpful to your progression and it is pretty fun to try to unlock new areas and entrances to said areas. Personally I feel the farming aspect is obsolete rather quickly and is really only there for task reasons but outside of that I think the game is splendid for the price.",
