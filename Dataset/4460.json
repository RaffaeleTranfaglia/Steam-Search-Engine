            "review_text": "This is really a tough review to write, because I really like a lot of what is going on here. But ultimately I just never found it engaging on the level of, say, SimCity. This has an awesome street view version that lets you walk around and actually FEEL like part of the city, and if you like that sort of thing then this game is definitely one you can have some fun with in that fashion.  In terms of the choices on how to build the city, it all feels a lot more abstract than SimCity, because of the way that there are these social groups and so on.  If you're looking for an entry into the city simulation genre, then probably SimCity 4 (despite its awkward controls by modern standards) is the way to go. If you're into citybuilders as a genre and are looking for another good one after having exhausted others, I can definitely tell you that I had fun with this one despite my gripes. But it's not one that held my attention for dozens of hours.  I was really on the fence as to whether to give this a positive or negative review. Ultimately I felt like I had fun and got my money's worth, though, so that's the main criteria that I guess I should use. The developer should be able to do better, and I hope they get a chance. I'd like to see this evolve in future sequels, but so far it was already fun for what it is.",

            "review_text": "Fun, and with some interesting concepts. I really like the idea of social classes occupying residential areas, being able to build per social class services, and different social classes not tolerating each other (meaning you may want to avoid mixing them up).  But this implementation of these ideas is very buggy -- it freezes up way too often just to display a bunch of errors on my screen. It also does not tolerate alttabbing (this is on 64bit Windows 8.1 and NVidia GTX 770). And I may be missing something, but I can't see autosave happening.  This means I've started off a couple of times already, but don't have any savegame to speak of.  I'd say you may want to try it out, but bugs mean I found it too painful to actually play the game -- especially in face of competition.",
