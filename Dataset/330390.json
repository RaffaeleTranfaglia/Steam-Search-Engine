            "review_text": "What is Grandia® II Anniversary Edition?  It is a port of Grandia II that has some technical issues but is as of the current patch 1.7 in a good state. The major issue, a desync of background music in cutscenes that only is really bothering in one or two of them, however will most likely not be fixed.  Grandia II was a Dreamcast RPG, featuring the Geohound - hand for hire - Ryudo in his quest to save the Songstress Elena when she visits a ceremony. Of course, the ceremony goes wrong and it soon is apparent that the whole world might be in danger.  Graphics: The graphics are for their time nicely done 3D maps with animated videos for spells. They fit in nicely into the battles, but have to be watched every single time, which can be around 20 seconds, depending on the spell. From today's perspective, the graphics don't hold up anymore, but a lot is done with mimics in speech boxes, which works very fine until today. However, in the 3D world the characters are without a proper face, it very much looks dated nowadays. Everything looks flat with some objects put on top of that, very unreal and in some cases even the textures can clearly be seen repeating.  Music and Sound: The sound still holds up, the music is excellent, but the voice acting only happens at certain points and then also partially inconsistent - not in quality which is very high, but in which scenes are acted and which are without voice. All in all, there could have been more, but what is there is very well done. The voice actors know how to express emotions.  Gameplay: Well, the gameplay is simple. You walk around, fight, etc. - standard RPG gameplay. The world is very linear, backtracking is quasi nil as every few levels or so the previous ones can't be accessed anymore. Still the levels are worth exploring because almost everywhere is another item to be found. Some of the puzzles are interesting, but usually they are just 'press button X to open door Y'. There are a two minigames but they exhaust themselves fast - you can do an arm wrestling and a nut catching which is both fun for a bit, but especially in the nut catching case gets boring fast. One can say the gameplay is mainly based on the story, and that is one that is well written, holds a few surprises, but may be predictable for people who know their RPG tropes. There are saving points where one can completely recover himself, and they are never too rare. At the least it has a lot of character development, and the characters grow to your heart - and each others...  Battle System: So the battle system is where the game will fall or stand. All battles are done on a 2D plane with a maximum of 4 vs. 6 characters (one boss has more than 6, but that is an exception). Every character, monster or player, advances on an IP scale in the UI that determines when he can attack. The clou is that you have a certain distance between command and attack, so if you time it right, you can attack while the enemy is in that distance. This slows the enemy for a moment or if you do certain attacks costs him quite some space there, canceling his attack as well. You find books and eggs during the game that give additional attributes to your character or magic. Good: Every character can equip every egg, skills in the books can be individually equipped. So do you want rather the egg with few attacks but a lot of healing to be used by Ryudo or Elena? And what egg should the other characters use? RPG typically there are some status effects and bonuses you can apply during the battle or granted by what you wear. For example, if you sleep or are paralyzed your character moves to the very back of the IP gauge and can't do anything until healed. A special status only for enemies is being spellbound. It is applied by only one special attack and it has pretty much only one use in the game - but that one is needed if you play on hard. What also must be noted is that characters that stand close together or in a line can be hit by spells with that range, others target the whole party or just a single character, so it has another tactical component there as well. In many cases you will just use the magic or move that kills all enemies at once, however, and it flattens to choosing the spell based on if it is the special range (read: circle around the enemy) or all enemies.  The hard mode is a new addition to the game, not seen in the original. It makes enemies tougher, adjusts their stats, etc. With this, the game becomes challenging at times, before it was just a breeze to go through and now it is mostly a breeze to go through, but gets tricky towards the end. Better don't waste your good irreplacable items, especially those that fill up your points for the special attacks, or you will find yourself in need of them eventually! Yes, this is pretty much one of the very few games where I had to use items in a battle to win.  So what do I think about the game? It is marvellous, a masterpiece, despite its flaws. When it comes to the actual gameplay, the story is paced good enough to keep one going, and only gets annoying when there is an overly long sequence without a saving point. The battle system is well done and motivating, the possibility to level up what you want to use instead of just being it granted by level or item does the game very good. All in all I can only recommend this game. I paid 15 Euro for it and I feel that it was worth the price, even though I had played it long long ago in the earlier PC release.  Since this is the only version with the hard mode, this version is the way to go. Alternatively you can try the earlier version and find a mod that makes it challenging, or just play through it as it originally was and don't expect a challenge.  Recommended? Yes! The game is around 30 hours long (hard mode), then you have all achievements and no replayability, but those 30 hours are great.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR Summary  This is one of the best jrpgs in the history of gaming, has an absolutely awesome soundtrack - great story and great characters, good voice acting. This port is also extremely well done, I highly recommend this to anyone, especially to people who have never played the original. Grandia II is one of the very best Dreamcast games and is worth your time and money.   This is a classic JRPG that even with its old age, this is still one of the very best in the genre and many current generation of gamers never got to experience the original back in the dreamcast days, if you're one of those who never got to experience the Grandia series then your in for one huge treat with Grandia II.   The story starts out with Ryudo, the geohound taking on oddjobs - think mercenary for hire and as the story progresses you will learn more about the battles between light and darkness long ago, add in a couple of plot twists and some endearing characters who join your party then its off to save the world from impending disaster.   Battles are pseudo-turn based with an active meter indicting who's turn is next, but with a flare of strategy as your turn can be delayed, or even cancelled if your not careful with your battle choices, however - you can do the very same to your opponents and learning these tricks is key to winning, especially during some tricky boss battles.   Each character who joins has their typical unique character skills, and magic can be shared by the use of mana eggs - like with most JRPGs, skill points are earned each battle and can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new skills/spells. Whilst there is a minor grind if you obviously want to get every spell/skill maximised but the pace is fairly fast so for the most part, any SP grinding isn't usually a problem.  The graphics are obviously dated, but this remaster honestly does a fairly good job in updating the graphics and provides more options than the previous windows version ever did, just remember though that this game is quite old so don't expect cutting edge graphics, or highly detailed cut scenes.   The soundtrack is legendary, some of the very best battle music ever created, awesome electronica style with hard rock edge. Even after your 1000th battle, the battle and boss music never gets old. The rest of the soundtrack is equally good. I'd like to say some bad things about the game, but honestly - there really isn't any per say. Okay, a couple of boss battles have somewhat 'cheap' mechanics but can easily be beaten with some perseverance.   + Good Battles + Good Story + Good Characters + Good Soundtrack + Good Skill/Magic System  +/- Outdated Graphics",

Pros :  - Great port (no bugs, good controller support, good japanese voice option, steady 60fps).  - Good story.  - Great turn-based battle system, maybe one of the best. - Good soundtrack.  - Good character development system by upgrading books and eggs.  - Memorable characters.  Cons : - I don't like the fact that I couldn't go back to the previous maps. You just basically follow the linear storyline with VERY RESTRICTED EXPLORATION.  - Maybe this is just my opinion, but even in its HD version, the visual still looks pretty ugly to me. - Some skills have annoying, ugly, unskippable animation that hurt my eyes. It's understandable because this game is basically a remastered version of an old game. It still uses the same animation from ages ago.  - This game doesn't support wide screen, but it's understandable.   Overall, Grandia 2 Anniversary Edition is a good JRPG. This game might be considered as one of the best on its era. What about now? It has aged well. But even so, it's still a good game with more improvements. The developer themselves have shown their care about the fans by fixing early glitches and bugs. It runs very well now.   I'll give this game an 8/10. A good addition for JRPG fans library.  ",

And this gets updated regulary and actually listens to the buyers, so it seems to me it keeps improving. It's still far off from the original Dreamcast version. But this game has SO much more to it.

But enough reminiscing, I didn't even know this game existed but remembered hearing exceptional things about it.

            "review_text": "Slightly Generic , but an experience thats actually well paced , a CLASSIC, and a battle system who's praise is well acknowledged.  Grandia II does things better than both its predecessor , and successor in the series ( my way of telling you that if you haven't even played the series , in my PERSONAL OPINION , this is easily the best one . ) in many ways . The original Grandia recieved high praise for introducing the ATB battle system - an RPG battle system where a meter is displayed at the bottom of your screen , leading characters up to their 'ACT' points , and then allowing you to command them . - to a genre that - at the time - lacked instinct and time management . Not only that , but the game also introduced the concept of movement and placement to its battle system - characters moved based on the actions you command them to do , including having an option to simply 'move' as an alternate to defending , this would allow players to have characters get out of range when anticipating enemy attacks , get into better position to use their own attack , or to just run really ... whatever . Point is , it added space and active time to turn based battles , making players feel MUCH more involved in their battles and making every move count . Players could also select enemies during battle and see their stats by default ( mind you these default stat menu's look really nice ... I mean not even just for it's time , I love em . ) , and also at times their upcoming moves allowing players to anticipate whats to come , and more importantly - in how much time .   This installment does a lot of things right , though the story SLIGHTLY generic ( Good vs, Evil , yada yada ) , the gameplay is fast with no random encounters ( as enemies are displayed on the field , allowing you to opt to fight them or not . ) , a simple and to the point level up system ( cause honestly , I hate it when developers try to be too creative . ) , a pretty generic but fun loving cast of characters , and SUPER , COOL , BOSSES .   In this game 'Valmar' is the dark antagonist of the game and essentially the literal god of Evil . Now while that's cool and all , the spawn of Valmar look like stuff straight out of your nightmares ( ever fought the organs of the F***ing devil ? It gets real pretty quick . ) , and fighting the bosses through the game as a kid led to countless ' Ohhhhh S*** ' moments , something ESSENTIAL for all RPGs . On the other hand , the party of Ryudo and friends ( your party ) , from their character design , and plot , come off as slightly generic . This ISN'T totally a bad thing though , I mean , they're lovable , as each of their characters fit into the story well , compliment each other in dialogue , and are all unique in terms of battle .   An RPG I like to play when I want to get away from RPGs , it is extremely simple in formula , but still different and unique in play . A game I personally feel has been overlooked over the years and am glad is available on steam , allowing gamers who missed this experience to get a hold of it , and for many like me to relive a fond classic .",

So I can say without rose tinted glasses that this is one damn good RPG, with neat if slightly forgettable music with unique instrumentation ( I can't recall the boss theme, but the dungeon theme and mook battle theme stick in there, but the town theme gets replaced with one of the themes from Tales of Hearts R for my recall for some strange reason), colourful texture work, 60fps battles that look pretty neat, and that old JRPG trope of flashy attacks that take too long. We Knights of the Round now. The voice work is pretty damn good, the VO Director was Kris Zimmerman which means you'll be hearing Colonel speaking sass in Liquid's ear, you'll be protecting Naomi Hunter from the forces of evil within her (foreshadowing too many years in the making? I think so), and you'll also witness the brotherly rivalry between Solidus and Liquid.  Entirely worth a full price purchase, and HIGHLY recommended at discount.",

Because of the amount of times i have played this game i bought this edition ,hoping that i would be able to finally put away my dreamcast for good. Its the only reason why i take it out to play it . So when i bought this edition i heard that it would contain a hard mode and so slightly better rendured models and some better looking shadows ,which it did no complains there. However i quickly started to notice how many sound bites were either cut off such as the save point recover sound or the appearence of ladder sounds/action icon sounds . When i finished my first random encounter i am familiar with Ryudo's signature 'You better practice if u wanna beat me!' but i couldnt hear it very well because the sound effects were muffling his speech which was very annoying and kills my excitement of winning a battle at the exp screen . I also noticed that they took out the sound u hear when you use a healing potion or 'heal' ,when the droplets fall on your character. I made it to my first major voice acted cutscene when u first meet millenia and i was dissapointed to see that the text was having trouble catching up with the voices which bogged down the sequences of the cutscene . This is a amazing game that unfortunately has been ported horribly on the ps2 and now steam . I will continue to play my dreamcast edition because it is in my opinion the best version out there to experience grandia 2.",

The game doesn't recognize the keyboard, it doesn't recognize the buttons of my controller. Once I'm in the game, I'm stuck.   I don't find it a very good port at all.

            "review_text": "I passed over Grandia II when I was growing up, but I remember it being highly regarded at the time. I went into this PC version with high expectations based on that and I was pretty underwhelmed.  First the good parts: - The translation is pretty decent - The PC port seems alright - Being a Grandia game, the battles can at times be engaging - Being a Grandia game, there's lots of dialogue and character interaction if you want it.  But now for the bad parts... - The story is mostly generic and stupid in a very JRPG way. It's typical of JRPGs of its era. It's the sort of plot that I might have thought was good when I was a 12-year-old, but most adults would be embarrassed by it. The characters are mostly annoying most of the time. Their behavior is juvenile and tedious, which makes it hard to care about them. The dialog is good when the characters are just chatting, but awful when they're talking about anything related to the plot, especially towards the end. I've heard enough JRPG monologues about how the power of the heart will overcome any obstacle, thanks. - The battle system had potential, but throws away nearly all of that potential by 1) making battles take too long by using any strategy except unleashing powerful AOE attacks over and over, and 2) making all the AOE attacks consist of 20-second-long low-budget CGI animations. Because there are save points where you can heal all over the place, the most rational course of action is to just use Sky Dragon Slash or 'Zap All' or whatever every single battle. This means you spend 80% of the time in battles watching the same crappy 320x240 animations over and over again. There's no option to skip these animations. Not fun. This is not a game that respects the value of its players' time.  To be honest, I'm a little confused by other reviews seeming to praise the story. Maybe I'm just getting to old to enjoy this sort of thing.  They should have taken their CGI budget and spent it on writing instead.",

The non-story related houses are not worth exploring since there is no one in there or someone with nothing interesting to say. - Even if you reach the next town, it never makes you feel 'Finally! I made it!'. The trips feels so short. The world is also extremely small. - You can see enemy hp so you always know when the enemy will die. Makes game less intense. - Bosses are too easy. Game is easy compared to lots of JRPGs in general. - The critical system in battle is cool, but everything else about the combat system is too basic and predictable due to the timer bar at bottom of screen. No situation where you will need to take some chances. - Camera is so zoomed up It's hard to see around you. - Don't get much sense of adventure since everywhere is just a short dungeon or a village. - Characters are boring and lifeless. There is also no way to speak to them or ask for help (Probably because you won't need help since you always know where to go next). They join you too easily too. - Dungeons/Maps are so linear. Its like walking in a straight line there is no feel of exploration and no way to get lost. - You don't feel much accomplishment from leveling up. - Weapons/Armors at shops are so cheap and provide only a small boost so carrying money feels useless. - Music is not catchy. Grandia 1 music sounds a lot better. - Very little variation in monsters and bosses - Story that feels like its some kind of epic story idea coming from a teenager. Tries to put in some unnecessary drama and ended up predictable and boring.  The only good part is that its an old rpg that got rereleased on pc and its cheap.  It doesn't make sense how some people can call this game the best jrpg unless this is the only jrpg they have played.",

            "review_text": "Grandia II 8.5/10 (spoiler-free and nostalgia-free review)  Gameplay: The Grandia series is by far my favorite approach to turn-based RPG’s. You battle in a circular arena with each encounter. Your party consists of up to 4 people. The idea is that normal attacks can be performed immediately, magic and specials take a bit to charge up, and critical hits can be performed to cancel an opponent’s action. Specials and magic can affect multiple targets based on where they are standing on the field in relation to you. This means that in a crowded field of 8 characters, you will be scanning over each one to see what they plan on doing for their next turn, then acting in accordance with what you predict will happen. It’s very involved and more fun than any other traditional RPG I’ve played. (but if you need a break, you can set the playable characters to AI.) -story took me 36 hours or so.  Story: Grandia II has a powerful story with some good heart wrenching emotional moments. I’ve heard reports of players crying over events, and I don’t dare spoil a single one of them. Through there are some less than graceful bits and I’ll admit to not having strong attachments to a couple of the characters. But once you get in a ways, it really does take your heart with it. Unlike most RPG’s i’ve played, it actually has a very personal and interesting take on the religion of the world. But by far the most gripping part for me is the influence of the game’s devil “Valmar” on the people’s lives: both widespread and on individuals.   Music: There are 46 songs on the soundtrack. Among them are touching sombre melodies. Some powerful and sad hymn sounding tunes. And there are a handful of exciting action tracks as well, none of which grate despite how much fighting you do. However, there are a couple strange upbeat tracks that do get a bit overplayed in the overworld. All in all though, the music has a lot to offer and enhances most moments in the game very, very nicely.  Art: Though it may not look like much today, there are vast texturing improvements over the original version. It doesn’t break your suspension of disbelief, but by today’s standards it isn’t anything spectacular.  Port: This may be a port, but fear not! The developers have been actively patching flaws found in the game. My game crashed once during my playthrough, but that issue has since been patched!  Tips:  This game was released in 2000, it’s really hard not to spoil yourself on story elements, so tread lightly.  Your party members change as the game progresses, but do not be afraid to spend skill points on characters that might not stay with you forever. The game has a way of making up for this.  You can adjust individual audio properties by running the setup before game launch. There are some really overpowered sounds, so I encourage you to play with that.   You will encounter a place called The Hut of Trials in the story. Be sure to return there as soon as you can. It’s a grind, but It unlocks some amazing items as well as an achievement. You will only have access to this place for a short time.  Summary: Grandia II May have a couple things wrong, but everything it gets right is a total bullseye. Easily worth full price and just maybe a little place in your heart.",

The story felt about the right length, had captivating dialogue and scenes, surprising twists, and characters that you can really get attached to (for better or worse).  My biggest complaint would have to be that even in Hard mode, the game is not very difficult. The bosses are the only cause for concern, and most of them aren't too hard either. The few that would defeat my party had mechanics that, once experienced the first time, were relatively simple to work around and otherwise fight like normal.

            "review_text": "Although Grandia 2 has aged and the graphics are dated it still plays as well as i remember.  For those of you not familiar with Grandia 2 it's an rpg one of many that are IMHO ground breaking during their day. Back during the Dreamcast and Playstaion 1 days there were a number of groundbreaking RPG's and each one brought their own evolution to the genre. They are all very different animals. Grandia 2 is definitely one of those games that were ground breaking for its time and surprisingly not many followed up on its formula. Due to this Grandia 2 is unique even today.  The first aspect i will review is combat. Combat is solid in this game and fun. It is in semi real time like much of its counterparts of its day. Where it is different is that it is semi 3d and position in battle is important. Sometimes you may even want to reposition or as they call it in this game 'evade'. You just don't spam attack like in most rpgs, you will actually need to defend in some situations. That is because of the IP bar (i Think that's its name). Basically during combat there are icons on the bar that slide down it indicating when their command and action phase are coming up. There are two basic attacks, which is also different from most rpgs of that day. One does more damage the combo because it does two hits, each hit is slightly less damage so that there is some thought required. However the critical hit when used when the target is in its action phase will put them way back down the IP bar interupting their turn. That said the same can happen to you. There is magic also, some AoE, some single target, buffs healing and CC last of which was missing from many games of its time. Unlike some rpgs of that day the CC could be very useful in some situations and give you a major advantage. It's not like every boss is immune to everything either. On a boss that had some serious magic power I manage to silence him. Problem was there were four of him each having different magic and i could not silence them all. This attention to the design in combat sets apart Grandia 2 from many rpgs even today. Combat is not only really fun but downright addictive.  I will review the storyline now without any spoliers whatsoever. The story is unique for a jrpg of its time. Dealing with the concept of evil and good in a unique way for its time. Yeah there are the inevitable Japanese Cliches but they are tastefully done. In comparison many american games have cliches of their own yet just like many japanese games are not thought out to how they will affect the main storyline. In the case of Grandia 2 these were thought out. Thankfully the main Character is not the typcial mold of hero. He's grumpy surly and sometimes down right nasty. He also changes over time. He is by no means evil though. In the beginning of the game he comes off as ammoral, by the end to use a dungeons and dragons term he is more chaotic good. Some of the villains in the game really have the best of intentions, in some cases it is misguided in others purely circumstatantial why it is evil. This attention to detail is what i like about the story in this game.  On to graphics. I really wish they would've updated the graphics to this game because even today this game would've been the rare 10/10. Yet they didn't. It is the exact same grahics from the dreamcast. The characters aren't as blocky as Final Fantasy Seven but unlike FF7 they have no mouth on the battle screen. In FF7 the combat graphics are ok even for today, Grandia 2 bleh. If not for the combat system and rpg power up and level up elements this game by today's standards would be too ugly to play.   In terms of role playing aspects. It does that a little differently too. The only game i could compare it too is Blackguards 1. It does not have a perk system except in perhaps the form of skill books. You can't even cast magic without a magic egg so that's different too. What makes these games even slightly similar is they have something akin to AP but even that's different than Blackguards. There are two type of points that can be distributed. Skill points and magic points. These can correspondingly upgrade skills, and the magic eggs that fuel magic. They can also upgrade skill and magic books which of course give stats to skills physical attributes and magic. Over all a very well thought out and fun system.  In summary the only point that even today is not a 10/10 is the grapics which is about a 3/10 but only in the combat screen and main map, the cut scenes are nice and the text pictures are nice to both a 6.5/10. Over all an 8/10. Even if you do not like jrpgs if you like any rpgs you will like this game. It also comes with the option for english or japanese vocals.",

Developers are being retro for the sake of being retro, so I feel like I'm playing Final Fantasy I's and II's again in another creator's eye, and that's not very exciting to me.  I judge the fun factor of a RPG based on almost every detail, but the big 4 are: Gameplay, Story, Characters, and Music  Gameplay: Grandia II attempts to do what Chrono Trigger attempted(and succeeded) to do with RPG's- and that is to spice up the formula. I really like the unique turn meter and combat system. Countering, dodging, attacking, and buff/debuff magic all receive their fair due attention instead of having one core strategy and using it to annihilate all enemies. Sure, magic is OP and you get enough MP refreshments via save points to spam your most powerful magic attack, but many enemies' resistances are so strong it is faster to know who to hit with and who to cast magic and what type instead of spamming one spell over and over.   This was my first play through and a I chose Hard- there were spots that were genuinely difficult where others seemed to breeze by, only one occurance did I grind to force the boss to be easier. The other time, I COULDN'T grind as the save point was in a 'point-of-no-return' area, and it took a lot of trial and error to realize one character's special move affects a lot more than the description lets on, so the translation or at least the descriptions could have done with more symbols showing exactly what it can cause the enemy to inhibit or at least better wording.  Story: I won't give much away here, but it is an enthralling adventure with a distinctive world with huge landmarks and many dangers that kept me interested in what was around the next corner for the protagonist.  Characters: Oh, did I say protagonist? Within the first 20 minutes of the game you'll see how much of a 'hero' this guy is. I had never played a JRPG before this one that followed such a realistic(or at least non-stereotypical), outspoken, and 'I'm done with your ****' type of 'hero.' It was definitely refreshing, and at times cringe-worthy to see how badly he insults a party member early on just because of their differences. The interactions between the characters were made better with Grandia's signature 'camp and chat' feature where certain parts of the story have you selecting different characters and reading their banter on water-cooler topics that don't necessarily effect the main story.  Music: It's actually ok, nothing great or forgettable. If anything, it isn't repetitive, or at least it never rubbed me the wrong way unlike many other JRPG's. I can't recall any outstanding pieces, but it serves its purpose.  My only complaint is there is no way to fast forward or skip the long magic cutscene animations. Of all JRPG's I've played I've never had a reason to use the fast forward feature that many are receiving with these anniversary and HD editions- but Grandia II sorely needed it.  I had a lot of fun with this one and look forward to coming back to it later on!",
