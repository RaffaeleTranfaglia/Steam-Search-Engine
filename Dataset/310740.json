            "review_text": "Pretty great so far, it feels similar to Deus Ex. The gameplay is like Eldritch in many ways, the movement feels exactly like it and it reuses a lot of the audio from the game too. The hacking is pretty cool, you play a Breakout minigame to unlock doors, hack alarms and cameras and to open containers. The stealth itself feels like it could use some work tho, the AI is very easily exploited if you jump on 1 block above the ground the guards will circle you, get bored and forget where you are, and seeing as stealth is what you're doing most of the time it kinda cheapens the game for me.  I've not played through the entire game and there might be something similar later on, but I feel like there should have been a close-range stun gun instead of holding f to knock out guards, or at least some karate chop animation. You have gadgets already at your disposal and holding f to knock someone out as your primary way of attacking feels off.  So far there seems to be a lot to this game, a great story, side objectives, hidden geocaches, rankings at the end of each level topped with awesome music and art style. It just need a little more polish.",

            "review_text": "It's a minimalist stealth game that pays respects to it's predecessors in some pretty clear ways.  The story is really basic goverment total surveillance conspiracy stuff, played as possibly not being an absolute evil towards the end.  The gameplay is a strange parody of Thief, techno-flashbangs that effect the HUD that you and all the enemies have, but you happen to be resistant to for some reason, the visibility gem (straight up), three kind of original items that aren't taken from the original Thief games, enemy behavior and animations, it's astounding really. But hey the hacking puzzle is breakout.  Graphically I'm down for the low poly look, but I wish it wasn't so blisteringly apparent they made a block based level editor. At the best of times it looks pretty good (which is about the first couple of levels and then the last actual gameplay level). All the buildings are made out of these plain white squares, sometimes they aren't plain white, but not often. (I mean I brick building wouldn't be that hard, right?) I distinctly remember the third floor of a trashed appartment building being one pure white room made out of plain white bricks, a couple supports, and a few windows, actually, you're going to be seeing that one a couple of times.  Over all, if you think you want to buy this game, buy Thief 2: The Metal Age. 's good.  Why do people keep comparing this to Deus Ex, anyway? It's like the barest bones cyberpunk. Like it's about to faint if someone other than the main character gets blasted away with one of those guns the baddies have.",

            "review_text": "I'm a huge fan of the developer's first game, Eldritch, so I was following the development of this one for ages. This game is conversant in the stealth genre-- you've got your Thief-style environmental effects, your Deus Ex grates and vents, and a mess of cool gadgets to play with. Despite that, it never feels derivative; rather, it feels firmly and intelligently situated in its context in a way that made its boundaries and expectations feel really clear to me. As far as I can tell you can’t engage in combat at all, and as such the stealth is a bit forgiving—most mistakes can be resolved by running away, and the guards are quick to forget you ever existed. I’ve seen other reviews pose this as a weakness, but I see it as a positive—instead of being punished for taking chances, your missteps are relatively easily remedied and give you a chance to try a different approach while at the same time introducing the new challenge of figuring out where you ran off to in a panic. There are tons of secrets to find, which is made more difficult and tempting by the sprawling, sparse environments and the complete lack of objective markers, causing you to have to rely on your own sense of direction and the dialogue to find your way. Again, I think this would be more frustrating in a game where detection=death, but the flexibility of the AI makes room for this approach to keep you on your toes without ever feeling unfair or unnecessarily frustrating. I’m a big fan of the sound design, which feels to me to be sort of omni-directional: I can tell that there’s an enemy somewhere, but not quite where, and that maintains the game’s tension, while not being intensely punished for stealth mistakes keeps it from being too tense or overwhelming. A solid cyberpunk plot, a unique art style, and playing a female protagonist are all bonuses to me, as well as a grading system that definitely tempts you to try each level again. Overall it feels like a new take on stealth built on classic stealth foundations; highly recommended.",

I started out taking it seriously, but once the illusion of challenge was broken I wanted to see how much it would take to actually fail. In my first run of the first level I: Confused a guard by slamming a door in their face Stood face to face with a guard for a second, and got away without a scratch Threw a body into the path of a guard and they didn't notice it Chucked coins at the guard directly which made him run around in circles Jumped on a railing while being chased by a guard, causing them to run around in circles trying to get to me  And a bunch of little stuff that I didn't think was worth mentioning Each time I did this stuff it would take no time at all to 'reset' the alarm and all guards act like nothing happened.  In the end, I never died, I finished the mission easily, and it gave me a 'D' rating. Oddly enough, that's the rating I'd like to give this game too.",

No joke, this game is trying to be a carbon copy of those games with a coat of cyberpunk paint slapped on it. And fewer gadgets, no ranged attacks, no voice acting, more linear level design, less enemy variety, worse AI and a shorter campaign.   As NS is from an indie developer, I'm probably being harsh but considering that the only thing this game does better than the games it's emulating are its graphics (which, 15 years on, isn't difficult), I can't see any reason to recommend it to anyone.",
