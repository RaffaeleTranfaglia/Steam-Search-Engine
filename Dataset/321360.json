            "review_text": "Being a huge fan of the original Primal Carnage, Primal Carnage: Extinction disappoints me. I spent almost 2,000 hours playing the original game, and I have to say that this game isn't fun to play at all. I thought during it's Early Access period that this game would get better, but it really didn't get too much better. The game has horrible balance, hit detection, hitboxes, and dinosaur movement.  The game is also mostly filled with Roleplayers. There is no competitive community for this game like the original game had. Being a competitve player of the original, it just disappoints me to see Primal Carnage: Extinction become the game it is currently. The game seems to mostly revolve around people sitting around in servers and waiting for loot to drop.  The whole game just seems to rely way too heavily on it's economy system. This game seems to be more about Quantity over Quality. Gameplay doesn't seem to be a priority for the developers which is saddening as that's what made the original game so great. The original game had excellent gameplay, and it was much more fun to play. If this game stopped being updated, it'd probably die quicker than the original would. Except for the Roleplayers, they would stay.  All in all, this game is simply not worth it. Even it's name 'Primal Carnage: Extinction' isn't right as the game simply has no carnage happening. If you want a game with carnage and action, go play the original Primal Carnage. It's cheaper and it's more fun than Primal Carnage: Extinction.",

I would only recommend it to make steam wallet as the crates are worth a lot when they are new, if you like trading in tf2 theres a great economy whilst it lasts. who knows how long? Otherwise, I wouldnt actually play it anymore without getting bored or frustrated.  Every update fixes some problems and creates more, the devs work very hard and i really wanted the game to be good but unfortunately, the devs have no concept of game balance what so ever. A real shame, there was a lot of potential for this game but its just not working.   The hoard mode is extremely simple, and boring, the Team deathmatch mode is just too unbalanced and every class can 1 shot the other, no-one really wants to play cod but in dino form. a good side is that the dinos look great, handle quite well in some updates, worse in others and theres no hackers. Finally, this game attracts a very young audience with no concept of sportsmanship, if theres a glitch of OP class, it will be exploited to hell.",

            "review_text": "The game and graphics are great. Fun Gameplay, HOWEVER, the first game was better than Extinction. Ya wanna know why? All these skins and ♥♥♥♥ you could ever obtain was like, actually obtainable. No drop crap. And hah, well, you see about these drops... it makes the community a wild place. Toxic.  People scamming, people begging, people goin' about and showing off whatever they got. Now, on the older game. All that crap was all DLC meterial. A little extra. And man, it was nice. Everyone was a lot nicer and less greedy because all that was accessable.  Now, let us get onto the subject of the community, eh? Alright, so the community is filled with a lotta greedy ♥♥♥♥-holes and a whole lotta trolls. Ya wanna become prey of trolls? Play this game. HOWEVER, if you wanna AVOID trolls, play something like Warframe. Yeah. the community there is a nice community. Now, not all the people who play Primal Carnage: Extinction are bad people, of course. A lotta nice people and nice friends play this. It just so happens this game is overrun with trolls. And is considered to be known for its acidic community. I have a few friends on XBOX ONE who NEVER even TOUCHED this game, but have had friends who have and say all but the same thing. Anyhow, I play it rarely these days and really gave up on caring about this game. The developers want money which, for the record, would probably get MORE if they made every skin and some maps DLC packs rather than makign a profit off of the cancerous market. That is just my opinion. So even those who run the game and all are not to tango with much. There are a few nice developers, of course, but only a few.  So yeah, there is my review. Other than that, the game has some amazing graphics, it is fun to play (when not facing the cancerous community), and yeah, kinda good.  But do I truly recommend it? Ehhh.. I would say no, which I am gonna, but it is all up to you guys whether or not ya think it is worth it. Because, as you may see, this game certainly has its ups and downs. Soooo yeaaah..",

            "review_text": "This game is okay, the gameplay is fun at times but it's really consistent. That's not exactly a good or a bad thing. The whole problem is that it's always that the human team spawn in a random place and the whole team is huddled up somewhere. But the spawns are random and you get separated from everyone if you die. Then there are the straggler dinosaurs that just kill you on the spot because there's no one to help you.  What I would like to see is being allowed to spawn on a teammate or spawn on like flares, mines, or health packs which can be dropped by your teammates. That would allow more teamwork involved and not just have pyros holding down m1 whenever a dinosaur shows up and you die anyways.   Playing as a dinosaur, it can be really frustrating. You are very limited but yet overpowered. It seems that it's always in one favor of a single team. The dinosaurs have their own possibilities but if the humans are actually compitent, you're done for. What you would normally do is just pick off straglers that just spawned. But that's no fun.   The last thing I want to see is having more dedicated servers. There are very little for this game and you can't play anything except for team deathmatch or dino deathmatch. It makes gameplay very limited and you don't have that much to do.  The good part of this game is that the gameplay is great and you can run this game on a lot of computers. You don't need a beast of a computer since you can just turn down your graphics to low. It helps a lot unlike all the games you see out there. The gameplay handles really nice but what I feel missing is a lot of variety. There are classes, sure but the dinos have so much more variety while the humans have only 5 classes.

But really there's no need for any of that, because it's really simple.    There is no game here.    9/10 servers are Free Roam where literally nothing ever happens. The other 1/10 are either A) an unfinished buggy gamemode called 'Dino Deathmatch' that takes 'bad netcode' and 'work in progress' to a whole new level or B) the actual Team Deathmatch or Get to the Chopper (objective gamemode) that you bought this game for but it will be empty or extremely laggy.  Your average server list in Primal Carnage: Extinction will look like this:        Server name   Gamemode   Players   Ping (in milliseconds)       Random Joe's Roleplay Server   Free Roam   20/20   14       Super Awesome Cool Kill Server   Free Roam   5/20   26       Official Something Something   Free Roam   7/20   40       Official Something Something #2   Team Deathmatch   0/20   50       Random kid's server (NO KILLING)   Free Roam   20/20   64       Yet another Free Roam server   Free Roam   10/20   82       24/7 Free Roam!!! xDDDDD   Free Roam   4/20   100       Official Something Something #3   Free Roam   0/20   148       Surprise surprise, yet  another  Free Roam server   Free Roam   6/20   174       I Stole My Mum's VISA To Buy A Server   Dino Deathmatch   19/20   190       Guess which gamemode?

We finally found an actual Team Deathmatch server with players in it. Oops, nevermind. 250ms ping. Trust me when I say that you  don't  want to play a game that already suffers from bad hitboxes and netcodes at over 200ms ping to boot.  There's really nothing left to say. I can rant on and on about expensive skins and unbalanced classes but really - the primary issue here is that this is not even a game. With the abysmally low playercount (90% of which is made up by skin fanboys anyway), Primal Carnage: Extinction is nothing more than a skin-showcase platform at its current state.  I cannot for the life of me recommend this game to anyone. You won't find any 'Humans VS Dinosaurs' action here that the game advertises itself to be about.",

Other bugs like spectating glitch when trying to avatar a class your spawned as admin, and crafting/skin/inventory errors, aren't so pleasant. The game is simple and truly beautiful in my opinion. There are many ways to customize your own dinosaurs/humans, too. The only thing I don't like about the skins, is how surprisingly high priced they are. 30+ USD? Wow. Also, dinosaurs are a little be too strong. Humans should be buffed a bit, but I guess with enough skill it is possible. It's a great game for Dinosaurs vs Humans if you want to hunt or be hunted as a dinosaur, or be killed constantly by them along with blowing them up. I do indeed recommend this.. I think.",

Let's not talk about that... Ever...  Now I mainly play the game because it has nice dinosaur models to look at and There are quite a few. And mess with people as usual. However that does not make this game good. The animations are so slow and lazy, along with the gameplay that is lackluster and far from balanced.  The original Primal Carnage is better than this in so many ways. The feeling of weakness as a human was great. We had to group together and try to survive as raptors and pteras dogged us the whole way. I can't understand what the developers had in mind when they made this. The original was very balanced.  Along with all that, Their additions of 'New' dinosaurs are just reskins of others. With SLIGHTLY different abilitys. The most creative they got was with Acrocanthosaurus, it has a nice skin and has deviated from the other tyrant classes. Faster with less health and AOE.  My final verdict is 6/10 due to the bad animations and the lazy addition of dinosaurs.  Edit: I feel that 7.5/10 is a better rating, since it is still relatively fun to play, and I usually find myself playing it.",

The autobalance in this game needs to be better or the team system goes back to the way it used to be because you have people that just sit at the team screen spamming dinosaur and never playing humans this caues fair players who actually play humans to rarely be able to play dinosaur because the human team has little to no players.  There are some bugs in this game especially with the pouncing. There have been instances where i have pounced on a human and its all going well but somehow the game says he shot me and that im dead. Another one is when you pounce on a traper there is a chance that you will get netted and the pounce will fail or you'll continue the pounce but once finished you will be stuck there netted.  If you can fix these faults you will have a good game but to make it great Lukewarm media will have to make a system in the game like leveling or something because the amount of players playing the game rises high at the release but after that it quickly drops soon losing all players.  With these faults the game is buggy but you will get occasional games that are very fun and because of these games i do recommend this game, especially to the people that are only in it for the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs are amazing!",

I love being able to hop in a game and play with people that I'm somewhat familiar with and have a good time. It's a good game for those who like deathmatches and being cooperative. It's a multiplayer game and you have to work together with your team. It teaches you good cooperation skills as well as how you should approach a situation in the game.  While the game's pretty fun when playing, the community is pretty forgiving and nice. I rarely see those who approach me with a hostile attitude. And not everyone is peachy keen though, because you always have to be stern in some situations. Many people around are pretty nice when it comes to approaching you about a problem. And I like how the community isn't that descriminated when it comes to types of players. Sure, a lot of people are often annoyed by newer and unexperienced players, but they aren't harsh about it.  And the game's updates are often interesting to me, I find it nice to see a new rare skin added, and if I think it looks interesting, it really motivates me to try hard and farm up crates / skins to trade for it. There's usually many things in this game that motivates me to play. And with the additional stat track skins added, I've been playing a lot once I got one to get a lot of kills on it. I enjoy being able to hold that kind of pride, that I'm an experienced player and that I have an interest in this game. In addition to that, the gameplay requires some effort. For you to be top class on your team, you have to work together and also figure out what you're going to do. It's not fully a puzzle or strategy game, but it's something that requires more than just sitting around and watching your team eliminate everyone.   In conclusion, I recommend this game for those who like being tactical in game. I also recommend this for those who like collectable games, but to a point where it's not the main idea. This game is fun for those who put effort into it, who actually like playing games for the fun of playing. If you're here for the realism, of the game, I don't recommend it, while the game has stunning graphics and skins, it isn't entirely natural. And it shouldn't have to be, it's entirely based around giving the player a good time. Thank you for reading.",

You will however notice how one sided most of the matches are, the dinosaurs in this game defintely have the upper hand with the strongest counter on the human side being the trapper. Also you can get awarded Dino or Human crates that contain cosmetic changes, unfortunately you have to buy two dollar keys to open each one of them. Overall I'd give it a solid 7/10.",

There are also many gamemodes such as Get to the Chopper, (Capture the Points) Freeroam, and Team or Dino Deathmatch. The graphics are extremely good, and the animation is smooth. If the game was $60, I would still buy it! The only thing that in my opinion I don't like as much as the rest is how long it takes to get items. I mean, it certainly adds some challenge to your gameplay and makes it so that you want to play a lot and get all of the skins! That is why I recommend Primal Carnage: Extinction",

Adding new skins, maps and dinos is perfectly fine, but PC:E has lots of stuff in it already. As a fellow Primal Carnage player, getting used to the new movements and attacks of every class is rather difficult. For example:  Humans in the original PC were very agile and fast moving, but now it feels like I'm controlling an overweight person (no offense pls). You can barely even dodge a carno.  The flying dinosaurs are extremely hard to controll now and the constant flapping of the wings is distracting. I keep on thinking that I am holding the sprint button (maybe adding an option to turn that off will be nice?). The raptors move weird and sloppy, thus making it hard to kill an opponent. Plus they have waaaaay too much stamina, but idk if that is a good or bad thing. The list goes on and on, but I still like this game (because dinosaurs) and would continue playing it. I hope that some of my requests will be noticed and maybe even implemented in the game. The biggest flaw PC:E has is the lack of attention to bugs and other distracting things. Overall, I'm happy I spent 6 euros n this game. :P",

From my point of view, this game is fairly interesting~ that's if you want to kill but... however, there is a problem... there's not many TDM matches nor DDM matches. It's mainly Freeroam, Freeroam, and more Freeroam. So if you want to try to find a good TDM or DDM Server. Good luck, also... there's a thing called dino hogging and human hogging, in which is quite annoying as the other player cannot have a chance to be a dino/human. From one round to the next, dino/human constantly~ non-stop, sadly. Then you get those players who are fairly quite rude, they'd love to insult people over the stupidest of reasons. Sorry... but it is true. When you try to RP you see those mate beggars, skin beggars, and literally... -mating- RP's. It's natural and all but... seriously, some kiddo's play this game and it's rather not good to teach them -too- early. Think about the generations. q3q Also... there's some people who would love to assume some people are hackers when people who cheat can most likely get VAC banned easily if the system detects something on your computer that gives an unfair advantage. Lots of kiddo's on here... so be safe. Don't expect a surprise if one of them rage at ya'. xD Anyhow... the loot system. Uhh... where to start? Darn! The loot system itself gives really crappy items time to times, but sometimes if you're lucky you'll get a good item that you don't have-- yet. Considering I'm a Server Owner and quite lazy to do more typing in this review. I'd say PC:E is overall good if you wish to chill or release your stress unless an ignorant person comes in... just saying.    EDITED @ 12 / 10 / 2016 ( 4:07 PM ) UPDATED REVIEW.",

            "review_text": "Primal Carnage: Extinction.... where do i begin, This game is basically a shooter game based on dinosaurs vs Humans. And oh boy is it fun, this game really can be quite fun and challenging with different classes on both teams both human and dinosaur, (personally i love being a raptor and slashing the hell out of people). and to add a sense of uniqueness to players there are many different wearable items and character skins to aquire, you get these from drops during a round, either in crates or you get the skin or weapons etc as is during the round. If you're lukcy enough to get a skin as is during a drop then good on ya! :D otherwise you get crates which can give you a number of things. Here's the catch with crates though... you gotta pay real money for keys to open these crates -_- oh joy! not.... especially considering the crates give random things so you may not get what you want even though you payed real money to get it.... ugh. And game wise i've found this was the second release to the original game Primal Carnage, apparently this was supposed to be an update to that game but instead they made it a seperate game and made us players re-pay for a different yet.. no so different version of the same bloody game we already had. WOAH cheeky much devs?! However aside from all that annoying stuff the gameplay itself is pretty decent and i get a satisfactable amount of enjoyment out of it. I think alot of gamers would like this game, however like many online games there are a few trolls or quite plainly rude idiots but we tend to shut them up or ignore them i mean just enjoy the game guys stop ruining it for us actual gamers who want to enjoy ourselves xD. Would i recommend this? well to people who like the idea of shooting dinosaurs or being a dinosaur and attacking people or things around those ideas lol then absolutely, if you are someone who doesn't like paying for little things that probably will cause more money spent on the transaction itself then.... probably no you wouldn't want this game. Oh but you can trade on steam so if you have generous friends then it probably will be easy for you to get the stuff you want. So pretty much all and all absolutely yes i recommend this to other players :D This game is incredibly fun for me and as time goes by it'll get better and better when the devs add more and more gameplay ideas and classes, etc. Lets hope they all won't cost stuff lol, i hope this review has helped interested and intrigued gamers about getting this or learning about the game.",

Besides the cringe, the game has a chance to give you expensive skins after awhile, which is how I afforded the new DOOM game.  The game literally gives you high tier items for nothing, albeit it has a small chance of happening, but it's still if you don't like the game you can always profit off it.  2/10- Community is cancer but the game gave me expensive items as an apology.

NOW they improved the game now its quite fair, not much lag and most glitches are fixed and i am sure that if these people gave the game another go i am sure they would like it. CONS: a lot of focus on skins (maybe too much) but i am happy they give us skins for free (as random drops). Drops need to be fair because i get a lot of drops but i know that there are people who are getting barely anything.  I really enjoyed this game and i would recomend it to anyone who likes action and dinosaur games. And i was not paid to say this i genuinely enjoy and love this game.  ",

            "review_text": "A really good game to be completely honest. This game is perfect if you like games like 'The Isle' and so on because its a human vs dino game where you can either play as one of the 5 human classes, Pathfinder (Shotgunner), Scientist (Sniper/Immobilizer), Commando (Assault Rifle Dude), Pyro (Flamwthrower Guy) and finally the Trapper (Nets Things). Or you can play as the dinos where there are 10 dinos, T-Rex, Spinosaurus, Acrocanthysaurus (hope i spelt that correctly xD), Novaraptor, Oviraptor, Dilophosaurus, Cryolophosaurus, Carnotaurus, Pteradon and finally the Tupandactylus (hope i spelt that correctly too xD).   Each dino is split into 5 groups, Tyrants (T-Rex, Spino, Acro), Predators (Nova, Ovi), Spittters (Dilo, Cryo), Bruisers (Carno) and finally, Flyers (Ptera, Tupa).  The game does have its issues like for example most games of freemode (when you can have unbalanced teams of the 2 factions with no time or score limit) which include about 23 people playing as dinos and 2 people playing as humans, TDM isn't all that great because you are not allowed to switch team and there is a time limit and it almost feels like a Call Of Duty but one team are dinos. However there are also 2 other gamemodes that are ok but aren't seen that often on the servers list and those are 'Hunt' and 'Dino Deathmatch'. Hunt is a Stalker/The Hidden gamemode from Gmod where one player is randomly selected as an almost invisible raptor who can pounce and attack and has about 1000 health (i think) which is the same as the carno. The other players must find and kill it while the 'Hunt Raptor' as it's called tries to hunt them down, whoever kills the raptor becomes is next round. Dino Deathmatch is basically TDM but no humans instead it's a gamemode where every dino can harm eathother, raptors can pounce other raptors and spitters (im not sure about the flyers), flyers can pick up raptors and spitters and so on.  Finally the maps are actually really good, there are a few safe zones for humans if they are eing chased by a tyrant and need to go into a tight space, raptors can feel like super predators hiding in long grass while waiting for some foolish human to walk by so that they can pounce them, Bruisers can charge and bash enemies sending them flying, flyers can pick up or bash enemies and drop them leaving them to fall to their death and finally tyrants can feel like kings while chasing down helpless prey that have hardly enough bullets left to take them down.  In my opinion this game is very good and would deserve an 8/10 in my opinion but does lack a few things such as new dinos added and so on.  In order to make this game better, the creators NEED to add more dinos because this game is slowly dying and i really want to keep playing it.  Abilities List:  DINOSAURS:  (All dino roars work in freemode and TDM ONLY)  T-REX:  3000 Health Medium Movement Speed Bite (Instant kill) Tail Swipe (Rear end attack that sends enemies flying and doing about 70 damage) Stomp (Passive ability that does damage to enemies if they stand by your feet while you walk) Roar (Increased melee damage for nearby dinos)  SPINOSAURUS:  3600 Health Slow Movement Speed Bite (Instant kill) Claw Swipe (Front attack that sends enemies flying while doing about 100 damage Stomp (Passive ability that does damage to enemies if they stand by your feet while you walk Roar (Gives nearby dinos more damage resistance)   ACROCANTHYSAURUS:  2500 Heath Fast Movement Speed Bite (Instant kill) Foot Stomp (Do a massive stomp that sends enemies flying while doing massive damage) Stomp (Passive ability that does damage to enemies if they stand by your feet while you walk) Roar (Health regeneration for nearby dinos)   NOVARAPTOR:  300 Health Really Fast Movement Speed Bite (Does about 30 something damage) Pounce (Special attack that does damage overtime while you have your target pinned to the floor) Roar (Super fast bite speed BUT drains your stamina)   OVIRAPTOR:  200 Health Super Fast Movement Speed Bite (Does about 30 something damage) Pounce (Special attack that does damage overtime while you have your target pinned to the floor) Roar (Reveal the location of nearby enemies)   DILOPHOSAURUS:  220 Health Pretty Fast Movement Speed Bite (Low damage but applies poison for a short time to the enemy) Blinding Spit (Low Damage and applies poison but direct hit on an enemy blinds them) Roar (Instantly regenerate all of your lost stamina)   CRYOLOPHOSAURUS:  200 Health Quite Fast Movement Speed Bite (Medium damage) Acidic Spit (Medium Damage and enemies stepping in the acid will be burned by it) Roar (Instantly regenerate all of your lost stamina)   PTERADON:  275 Health Fast Movement Speed Peck (Low Damage) Grab (Pick up enemies in order to drop them off cliffs or from high ledges) Roar (Reveal the location of nearby enemies)   TUPANDACTYLUS:  225 Health Really Fast Movement Speed Peck (Low Damage) Bash (While flying at high speeds you do high damage and knock the enemy back if you charge into them) Roar (Reveal the location of nearby enemies)  CARNOTAURUS:  1000 Health Really Fast Movement Speed (While charging) Bite (Medium Damage Attack) Swipe (Medium - Low Damage Attack that knocks enemies back) Charge (Medium - High Damage that knocks enemies back, Charging takes a few seconds to work after you start sprinting) Roar (Gain health for every piece of damage you deal BUT you deal less damage)   HUMANS:  (All humans have 150 Health) (All humans have Quite Fast Movement Speed) (All humans have a middle mouse click attack which is a knife that does Medium Damage - Good against Predators and Spitters)  PATHFINDER:  Primary: Shotgun (Longest Range With Medium Damage), Spas-12 (Fastest Fire Rate with 6 shots and Low Damage) or a Double-Barrel Shotgun (High Damage BUT only 2 shots)  Secondary: Machete (Better Melee Weapon than the knife), Deagle (Really High Damage pistol with 7 shots) or an M9 (Fast Firing pistol with Medium Damage and 15 shots)  Gadget: Flares (Blinds dinos) or a Hatchet (Throwable weapon)   SCIENTIST:  Primary: Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle (200 Damage Per Shot and has 6 rounds) or a Tranquiliser Rifle (Takes away Stamina BUT deals no damage)  Secondary: M9 (Fast Firing pistol with Medium Damage and 15 rounds) or a Tranquiliser Pistol (Same as Rifle BUT has super fast firing speed and 8 shots)  Gadget: Sensor Mine (Reveals enemies that walk past it) or a Medkit (Deployable medkit that heals you if you stand on it)   COMMANDO:  Primary: Assault Rifle w/ Underbarrel Grenade Launcher (Low Accuracy) or a Carbine Rifle (M16 with high accuracy)  Secondary: M9 or a Deagle  Gadget: Frag Grenades or an ammo box (Deployable ammo box that gives you ammo if you stand on it)   PYRO:  Primary: Flamesaw (Primary attack is a flamethrower - Secondary attack is a chainsaw)  Secondary: M9 or a Flare Gun (High bullet drop weapon with low damage and a single shot but acts as a long range flamethrower)  Gadget: Molotov Cocktail (Spreads fire once it hits something), Impact Grenade (Explodes once it hits something) or an Ornament Grenade (High Damage Grenade - Does at least 220 Damage)   TRAPPER:  Primary: Netgun (Immobilizes predators, flyers and spitters leaving them to be attacked for a few seconds, and stops bruisers and tyrants from biting) or a Taser (Same as the netgun but deals damage and only deals damage to tyrants and bruisers - doesn't stop them from biting)  Secondary: Dual Colt Revolvers (Low Damage pistols that fire Quite Fast)  Extra Weapon: Bowie Knife (Replaces the normal knife with a high damage bowie knife)  Gadget: Mine (Explodes when an enemy steps on it) or Dynamite (Explosive that takes a few seconds to detonate once thrown)",

If I could get my money back, I would, but it would be a waste of money to take the devs to small claims court. Not worth 13.50. The devs are lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and deserve to go bankrupt. This entirely new game was originally supposed to be a free update, then it became a new game promising better everything. Now it's a sack of ♥♥♥♥.",

Things that are good: + high variety of classes + Finally more than one mode and a dead one + Skins may be motivating to colect ( for some people at least)  Bad things: - freeroam servers are highly populated, problem is there is almost no fun to be had there - Animations and object alignment is not quite right yet, Dinosaurs and Humans levetate over ramps and non-plain objects, Human Animations look stiff and unnatural ( also cold dead eyes)  Conclusion: Its good but there is space for improvements Update 7.10.2015: I had to change the recommendation to not recommended, because the core gameplay of this game, the TDM and the other competitive modes are pretty much dead now. Almost the entire serverpopulation is on free-roam and RP servers, where there is nothing to do, nothing to achieve and no reason to do it what so ever. If you want an asymmetric Teambased Shooter you will have to look elsewhere because, while it does exsist in this game, noone plays it.",

If this game had more players it'd be much much better. The empty servers are always disheartening to see everytime I check in with this game. I still recommend the game because when playing with a large group of friends (I stress the key word 'large') it can be a really really fun expiriance. However, if you don't want to wait until the community gets on their feet, you should keep your money.",

            "review_text": "Well, this is gonna be a long one.   Primal Carnage Extinction was originally going places, looked like it could have been a pretty fun game. Now I can't say the same. Here's my review.  Gameplay and Bugs- PCE in its current state allows you to pick from a set of playable characters in two separate factions and is essentially Team Fortress meets Jurassic Park. There are several game-modes currently in the game, including team-deathmatch and get-to-the-chopper(similar to capture the flag) These are fairly fun games, if you can find anyone to play them. The combat system was a good idea that was not well executed. Currently there are lots of bugs and several exploits that allow people to dominate and destroy without ever being killed or even taking damage. Humans typically get mowed down by dinosaurs in every round and hit boxes can be a problem, with damage most of the time not even registering with a direct headshot. These bugs do occasionally get fixed, but it tends to take months for another patch to be released and then maybe that bug will be one of the few that gets fixed. Still, even with bugs and issues gameplay can be pretty fun.  Maps- There's several maps in the game now, and they all look pretty good and even add to the lore of the game. The graphics look pretty great even with settings turned down.  Developers and Community- I don't usually base a game's review off of the game's community, but I can't give a good review of the game with it's current community's state.  The developers do work hard with what they have, but I believe their biggest mistake and the down-turning point for this game was when the developers decided to add skins and character customization to the game.  This very quickly became all the community was interested in, and over time the gameplay servers were replaced by free-roam no-kill servers filled with roleplayers squealing about new skins in the workshop. Team-deathmatch is nearly unseen now, because any TDM server that does come up is almost instantly filled with more people who'll only sit around and try to make real gameplay impossible for those who try to play it. The game could have been good and if the community wasn't the way it was, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a fast-paced fps multiplayer. But there's no point in saying good things about a good game if the community doesn't let you play the game as it was intended to be played.  I do not recommend this game to anyone looking for any particular playstyle, unless perhaps you enjoy roleplaying and bartering with other people for game textures. If I had to give this game a number rating, it would be 7/10. But with this current state, I wouldn't rate it at all.",

            "review_text": "This is a good game. I've spent too much time on it... Great game for any dinosaur fan!  But......  Pros: -Skins, so no dinosaur is the same. -More dinos then other Primal Carnage Game -Fun games (If you can find one) -Dinosaurs! (Must I need to say more?)  Notes: -Good maps -Okay graphics -Does not need a perfect computer to run game well -Freeroam/RP: Yes, I like to RP occasionally, but to find decent people... Different Story. -Still fun to run around as a dino -Okay community (There are so many different kinds of people in this game, I cannot pick a side directly)   Cons: -Skins: (Yeah I know I noted this as a Pro) According to everyone in the community, ever, the better skin you have, then the more people should like you and respect you. Wtf? -Skins part 2: Sure the skins in this game are beautiful, but to get a nice one, you have to spend about $400+ on it. -Horrible human gameplay: the people have been incredibly nerfed, so you might as well be throwing rocks at the dinos.  So, if you enjoy just being a dinosaur, worshipping the player with the best skin, RPing (Sort of), or eating humans because they are pretty much always your dinner, this game COULD be for you.   EDIT: I wrote this review a long time ago. Since then, I have watched this game change for the worse. The humans became so overpowered on a couple of aspects what there was simply no point in fighting them. The game is broken, and it only seems to update once every six months. For these reasons, I am shifting my review from Positive to Negative.  ANOTHER EDIT: Humans overpowered?! What was I thinking? The dinos are forever OP. I'd shift this review to positive again, but the lag for this game is so bad that It is hard to play. I get 20 FPS on this when I get 40 FPS on Dishonored 2.",
