            "review_text": "Fantastic addition to the series. IF you like point and click horror games, Lost Souls is perfect. The more time you spend looking, the faster the game goes and the better it gets. This isn't a game for the impatient, but if you get frustrated you can always find a walkthrough.   Pros:   -Atmosphere is perfect, you're often wondering who put the poop in your pants. -Fun and challenging puzzles, you really have to use your brain.  -More versatile with angles compared to the first game.  Cons:   -A few bugs, mainly for me when I was piecing together a ripped up picture it would freeze.  -The lockpicking was irritating.",

            "review_text": "As a person who enjoyed what I managed to play of the old 'Dark Fall' (before it became incompatible with my operating system), it was a real novelty to go back to Dowerton Station and re-experience interaction with some of the more memorable characters from the first game -- and ultimately bring closure to the wandering ghosts.  The story is fairly mediocre and predictable this time (it also fails to explain what the 'Dark Fall' is, which will confuse any who hadn't played the first two games), but what was outstanding about the first 'Dark Fall' carries over into this one. The puzzles are clever, original and solvable. There is plenty of exploration and the environments are very well rendered (granted, it takes you forever to move from place to place). The game provides a few really effective scares (only 2-3 jump scares), and a tense atmosphere. There is also enough surrealism to make any survival horror veteran uneasy.  By far, the best part of this game is the sheer amount of time you spend scissoring things. I don't think I've ever used so many pairs of scissors so many times and so consistently in an adventure game. I personally feel the scissoring makes up for most of the very bad plot devices. Completely.  All in all: Don't play for the story. Play it for the puzzles. Stay for the scissoring.",

Controls are a bit hard to work with and could be frustrating for people who are not familiar with its mechanics. Puzzles vary from mildly easy to requiring a walkthrough of sorts. Good game, great atmosphere, decent story.",

The graphics look so good because they are just pictures that you have to click around on randomely with a cursor to progress. The clicking is not intuitive at all, you basically keep clicking all over the picture until something happens. I got frustrated pretty quickly and have no interest in ever playing it again. The game bio makes it sound great but I will never know becasue the gameplay iis terrible.",

Puzzels have various levels of challenge and the gameplay is pretty simplistic 'click here, goes there'.  Athmospheric sound and music track keeps the 'horror' in the air, not perhaps as much as Amnesia does, but does it´s job and the plot keeps the player going and wondering.  6/10",

I miss the ghost-hunting and the eerie historical Cornwall vibe I got from the previous games. Even though this takes place in the Station Hotel, it doesn't feel like the same setting as the first game.  Lost Souls relies way too heavily on boring, over-used tropes from the modern horror genre:  Creepy little girl? Check. Scribbles on the walls? Check. Old hospital paraphernalia? Check. Scary dolls and mannequins? Check. Random gore? Check. Nonsensical jump scares? Check, check, check, and check.  Definitely play the first two Dark Fall games (and the Lost Crown games from the same dev), but I say pass on this one unless you get it at a huge discount.",

It positively drips with atmosphere and it's got a pretty decent interface for a game of this sort. I would have loved to play it more, but a game-stopping bug froze my progress (the hat-box conundrum) and I couldn't move past it.    Negative points: The movement through the world is glacially, frustratingly slow.  : The voice acting for the protagonist is BRUTAL. Really super bad. The other characters have voice  acting that ranges from passable to good, but since 'your' voice (which needless to say, you hear   quite often) is so incredibly bad, it really takes away from the eerie atmosphere  : Puzzles range from quite intuitive and logical (YAY!!) to head-thumpingly obtuse....when you find  yourself consulting a walk-through literally every 15 minutes to have some clue as to what to do  next, then there may be some problem with gameplay.....or I'm stupid, one of the two.  So, even though I really, really wanted to like this game, and I was getting into somewhat of a groove, there are just too many negatives for me to recommend it at all.",

The game would definitely benefit from an Objectives concept to guide players, as well as making the game more 'dummy proof' (and maybe a couple glitch fixes). I had to restart 3 times due to getting stuck by encountering glitches, or being unable to progress further due to missing items that I had little to no knowledge of. (this is where an objective would help). As well, the movement was difficult to work with; Too little control over the character made gameplay dull, and the turns were frustrating due to the lack of speed in which the character made them. Very confusing map in my opinion.   This game definitely has potential, and I plan on picking away at it down the road. I haven't given up on it yet, but for now, I will have to give this game a lack of recommendation.",
