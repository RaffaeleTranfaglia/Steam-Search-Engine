            "review_text": "There is probably some joke or pun to be made about the 1001 spikes but I'm coming up empty. So I'll just say that it looks like the spike maker counted up the order wrong and ...  Ok I have nothing. Luckily Nicalis have something quite special in this platformer from the affectionately named '♥♥♥♥ing troll ♥♥♥ game' genre.  The gameplay is simple enough (with one oddity, which I will get to). You enter a level, you avoid traps and make some jumps while also shooting knives at the occasional enemy. You find the key and perhaps the hidden mask object and make your way to the exit. You then repeat this process through longer and more difficult stages until you run out of things to do. Along the way expect plenty of water, fire, snakes, scorpions, crushing blocks, spikes and even more spikey spikes. There isn't anything particularly original here if you have played similar games in the past (stretching a long way back) but what is here has been proven to work.  The controls are a little strange in that you have two jump buttons, one 'high' and one 'low'. This saves you having to judge how hard to press a button (high enough to clear a spike, but low enough to avoid the fire above?) but it can get a bit fiddly at times. Personally I always found myself using the high jump unless a situation specifically seemed to call for it. In these cases, such as jumping on a block without triggering an arrow trap it was handy, but I'm still not sold on the concept. Still, everything works and you can aim your jumps properly and it doesn't feel floaty. If anything, jumping and shooting fails a bit more often than it should, when trying to line up a small object like an arrow (when you are standing shots line up perfectly). This isn't a big deal though, so in this regard the controls get a solid pass.  To complement the tight controls, the level design is all important in a game like this and 1001 Spikes doesn't let you down. The levels all seem lengthy but not 'too long' and there is a good variety in the challenges. For example, one level will have you carefully negotiating spiked passages, waiting for just the right moment to advance forward. The next level will require you to make a series of fast paced jumps as everything falls down around you. Levels feel unique, despite reusing a lot of assets and the effort required to pass them should make them memorable long after.  That is, if you don't give up on it. The magic of '♥♥♥♥ing troll ♥♥♥ game' is in how much they troll you and how much of it you can take. Think you have finished the level? Well you forgot about that block, right at the end which will drop on your head without warning. This will kill you, forcing you to restart the level (no checkpoints here!) in an increasingly infuriating manner. So where does it sit on the troll meter? Above Super Meat Boy, some obstacles you just can't avoid. But it is also well below something like I want to Be The Boshy. Most traps give you a split second of warning, such as the tips of spikes showing before they impale you. Because of this, most deaths (but not all) feel like they are a result of you not paying close enough attention. The game does a good job of training you too. Chance are if you find a good place to rest while you evaluate the next section of a level? There are spikes on that block.  So you'll die, but you'll learn and progress always feels achievable (or you can skip levels, so it isn't a big drama). Note that you do technically have a life limit (x1000) but 1ups are easily farmable by redoing short stages and finding the bonus pick up. So 1001 Spikes is tough but just fair enough (think 1-5 deaths on an easy stage, 20-30 on a hard one), which will hopefully not put off too many people.  Having said that, one of the most difficult challenges the game offers is getting through the story parts without hitting 'skip'. They are long, stretching on forever and the text forwards far too slowly. I kind of enjoy the ironic tone to the writing, but little of importance is said and there doesn't seem to be any need for a story at all. Rest assured you can safely skip it and get back to the spikes.  To round out the package, the game offers other arcade style modes which can be played in 4 player local coop (sorry online fans). These include challenges such as climbing a high tower and competitive modes like holding an urn the longest, which remind me strongly of old NES or even C64 titles and other treats like an extra difficult tribute to a past game. Rest assured too that the coins you collect in those modes are not completely going to waste.   Now I'm not a big coop gamer (people who are will love playing through the main game with a friend), so these extras are not necessarily for me, but they do make an easy purchase decision even easier. Further the game provides a wide variety of unlockable characters, each with their own abilities (longer jumps, double jumps etc). This lets you tackles the levels again with different approaches and helps alleviate any concerns about the number of available levels (although there are enough anyway, without spoiling anything, probably a lot more than you think!).  In terms of presentation, 1001 is more functional than impressive, but everything does the job. The music is suitably excellent and the sound effects inoffensive. If anything the menu systems and cutscenes could use an extra coat of polish, but as mentioned before they are best skipped anyway, so perhaps skimping on them was the best approach after all.  I really like 1001 Spikes. I realise it will not be for everybody, given the brutal style. But it is just accessible enough that everybody should give it a go, just in case they get the right level of sadistic fun out of it.  Just keep an eye out for that 1001'th spike. That'll be the one that gets you or ... yeah still nothing.",

            "review_text": "1001 spike and is a classic 2D action platformer where you play as Aban Hawkins, basically indiana jones minus the whip, who sets out on an adventure to Ukampa to find not only his father but the treasure of the temple in order to prove he is better than him. The 1001 in the title is actually refering to the number of lives you start with. (Though it could mean the spikes because there is a damn lot of them).   You have 1001 lives to best your way through all '30' levels of the Ukampa tomb but don't let that discourage you or make you think that's all the lives you have. At the end of each section, you'll find an artifact which gives you a large chunk of lives. Along with those, there is a skull collectible in each level (including the room that's just a straight walk to the artifact) which I highly recommend collecting. Not only does it grant you a life every time you pick it up (It has to be recollected every time you die) but it also lets you unlock new, fun characters.  These unlockable characters really encourage replaying the game to see how much better you can do with them, the different ways they can clear the levels with their unique abilities (These characters are also characters from different games which helps to encourage unlocking them just to see who they are. See Super Meat Boy if you wonder what I mean by 'From different games') Lastly these characters also have a different collectible to the skull. In this case, a coin that gives you money from 100 to 1000 and beyond as you get to the later levels which allow you to buy even more lives.  For the price you're buying, you're definitely getting your money's worth. Not only is there the main game 1001 spikes but there is also side stories that unlock which take Aban to new dangerous adventures and *Bit of a spoiler* After beating the 'boss', a whole new set of levels open up.   It's definitely worth the buy.  I can understand that the idea of a rage game can turn some people off when they think of games like 'I wanna be the guy' or 'Eryi's action' on steam but erase those from your mind. This game is definitely designed to lead to a rage at some point depending on your patience, of course but it's not one big trap feast. Like you won't walk through trees just for an apple to shoot down and kill you like in IWBTG. It's not that kind.  You will stumble into some traps or do something wrong that requires you to kill yourself (Selecting retry in the menu takes a life) but as the game goes on, you will start to spot the signs like in Eryi's action where you can suspect which spots are trapped. Everything in 1001 spikes makes a distinct sound like the click of spikes to help you figure out the timing.   I can definitely recommend this game. If this helps you decide to buy it, then I wish you luck.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: If you inherently can’t stand timing-based platforming and a certain level of trial-and-error/memorization, this game is not for you.  Mario really changed platforming huh? I mean he pretty much created it with his appearance in Donkey Kong, but it was Super Mario Bros. that defined core platforming mechanics for years to come. Chief among these is the jumping itself: SMB added a momentum based system as well as variable jump lengths depending on how long you held down the button. Put these together and you had a game that just felt better than any other game at the time. Fast forward to today and we’re in a resurgence of the genre, with a new SMB, Super Meat Boy, taking its place as king with the most refined Mario controls to date.   How does 1001 Spikes fit into this? Well…  1001 Spikes scales back the jump mechanics to pre-Super Mario Bros.; there’s no momentum system or variable jump based on length of button press. Instead, there are just two jumps: a jump that clears 1 tile and a jump that clears 2 tiles.   What does this mean? Well as far as negatives go it means that you never get the same sense of great game feel as you do in Super Meat Boy. That’s not to say the game feels bad though; you can change the direction of your jumps in mid-air, so it’s not clunky like Castlevania or Ghosts n’ Goblins. It also means that it’s more accessible; you have to worry less about mastering a complex physics system and more about your timing and reflexes. With more reliable jumps you can also have more daunting challenges, without a lot of the error in the trial-and-error.  But the biggest thing it facilitates is puzzles. It’s not always advantageous to use the high jump, even with jump correction; the game makes you use both. You see, most of the game’s obstacles are traps, with slight visual clues of where they could be. This works synergistically with the jump system; you’ll have to constantly think on your feet about where traps could be located and how to handle them, but because of the rigid jumping you’ll also have to problem solve about what sequence of jumps and landings to use to get you to your goal. There are a lot of “puzzle platformers” out there but more often than not they’re puzzle games that just happen to be platformers. This game uses platforming as its puzzle mechanics; rarely do I see a game so multifaceted and yet so singular in its design. Even once you’ve carved out a path you’ll still have to think quickly to execute it; unlike platformers like Meat Boy there’s no clear break in between obstacles. Traps add an extra sense of cohesion to the levels as you have to keep moving and thinking on your feet with no time to catch your breath. It’s a really unique feeling for a platformer, and frankly it’s exhausting at first. But as you play more, you’ll get better at the game and at the quick thinking and memorization needed to complete each level. While the game doesn’t build in the sense of reward like Super Meat Boy does, it doesn’t really need it; by the time you beat each level, you’ll have gained the satisfaction of solving a puzzle and of executing tight platforming in one.   This is all reinforced by a smart lives system where you have to actually learn how to play the game, and not just muscle through it like Meat Boy, so that you can preserve your lives and prevent yourself from starting over from the beginning. It – oh wait, you don’t have to start over? You just get three more lives? …Then what’s the point?  This is the start of a few baffling decisions; why have a life system at all? Or a level skip option? Why is there a store anyway? I get that it creates a strong connection between the side modes and characters and the real gameplay as Aban but it ends up feeling grindy and “pay-to-win”.  Speaking of side modes and characters, this game has a lot of content! There’s a single screen Mario Bros. style fighting game, a Kid Icarus style climbing game with scroll locking, and The Lost Levels, which actually is the game I expected except in short form, with a reduced number of levels and only 101 lives, but a Game Over if you lose them all. It doesn’t introduce any new mechanics but it does put them together in new ways, and to be honest a shortened form probably works better for that Game Over concept anyway.  The best part of the game though is the level design. With rigid jumps and movement speeds there’s already a lot of potential for fine-tuned gauntlets to jump through, with a lot of pixel-perfect platforming that really matches the aesthetic and gives you the feeling that nothing about this experience should have been any different. But what’s great is how it layers it: every level has a teaching layer, a “get through the level the first time” layer, and a speedrunning multiple path layer, and everything in the game is created with these layers in mind, all without ever sacrificing internal logic. There are no scripted events here; everything is created using the tools given, and anticipation of how the player will tackle it. So let’s say there’s some spikes on a timer, and there seems to be a conveniently different colored block as a safe spot. Well that block is going to have logic to it; it’s not going to be just arbitrarily discolored, but discolored because, it has hidden spikes in it, or maybe it’s actually a cracked block and will break when you stand on it. When all of these layers and the logic within them come together it creates a world that feels like it existed before you and will continue to exist after you’re gone, rather than just a series of arbitrary obstacles. You create the timings yourself, there isn’t one set way you have to do it; a favorite mechanic of mine includes pushing a sliding ice block, that you can jump on and ride. Its velocity is set and firm, but it’s up to you to set it into motion, not the game. This is a damn fine platformer, and in my opinion, probably bests Super Meat Boy as my favorite to date.",

I had NO IDEA I would get hooked so fast on such an impulse purchase.  At first glance, this game seems like a simple platformer with retro graphics and unrelenting difficulty. But under the surface, there is SO much more to this game.  While the game is hard, and by hard, I mean INFURIATINGLY hard, it isn't hard because of broken controls, bad mechanics, or unfair elements. It is hard, because it puts YOUR skills and YOUR reflexes to the test. The controls are extremely tight, leaving every single mistake jump, or accidental shot up to you to make. Did you just land on a spike trap and die? It was your fault. Did you just throw your knife in the wrong direction to block an arrow trap that you almost didn't notice until it shot at you? Sucks to be you.  Every level is designed with traps, spikes, enemies, and lava for you to die from, and if you don't pay attention, you will miss something important. Observation is the key to survival. If you find a spot to take a breather, (which in the later levels is VERY rare I might add) you better use it to look around and plan your next move. It almost becomes a strategy-puzzle-platformer on certain levels due to the sheer depth of the mechanics.  But even in the most hellish pit the game has to offer, (I'm looking at you 4 - 5) it never feels unfair, or like the odds are against you. You can do this, and you KNOW you can do this. and after you fail, you only get that much stronger. And there is no comparison to the satisfaction you get from finally beating that one level that gave you SO much hell. The relief from the adrenaline alone is worth it.  In a nutshell, get this game. Just do it. Learn a thing or two about completing a game with true skill, and not because the developer gave you this pretty little path with rainbows to follow, and checkpoints around every corner, making sure that every failure feels as if it didn't even matter.  10/10",

It would be a fun Bossfight if there wouldnt be random Rocks falling down from the Sky killing you instantly without any warning. And the Fact that my Savegame broke and i had to do the Antarctic world twice to get the last achievement wasn't really fun either.

You do not have, like other platformers, options to react or anything.  The fact that this games keeps putting you into checkmate positions at all time make it not worth your time.

If you don't react fast enough to traps appearing or terrain falling, you will die. If you're unable to remember the path of the level, you will die. 1001 Spikes is a challenging game, so as the recent reviews show, it's not for everyone. But if you enjoyed Super Meat Boy or other similar games, you'll like this too.  The environments are detailed even with the pixel graphics, the soundtrack is excellent and the platforming is perfect. There are two seperate jump buttons to make sure you always nail the height you need to, and the movement isn't floaty or slippery at all. Every level has its own Golden Skull to collect, an optional extra objective. Upon pickup it grants you an extra life, so as long as you get to the Skull each time you can try endlessly without fear of running down your lives. These unlock a multitude of extra characters, each with their own abilities and music, and a few other game modes, which again completely change how the game plays. The amount of variety is great. If you find the prospect of dying near the end of a level just because you didn't notice a different wall tile you may want to pass.

Pros: -Tight, precise controls -Good amount of levels, extra content -Simple mechanics - quick to learn  Cons: -Worst complaint is some levels being too long with crazy difficult stuff at the end that requires a ton of trial and error. I've beaten every level in the game exactly once, but I feel like I've beaten the first 80% of most levels like 30 times each, to the point where there is zero challenge and fun for that section because every jump becomes memorized up to the point where I'm having trouble. As someone who also beat every level in Super Meat Boy, I think SMB handles level length much better.  -Many (perhaps most?) deaths are from trial and error. A major flaw of 1001 Spikes here is that there's no way to safely play a level the first time even if you're patient and alert like other platformers allow. Rushing through will kill you somewhere for sure, but equally often playing it safe after every jump will kill you because you're often standing on a spike trap or falling rock. Keeping one or the other type of death consistent throughout an entire level would be better design IMO.",

            "review_text": "I will be reviewing the graphics, music, controls, story, cinematic, content, game play, and giving you my honest opinion of the game.   Video Review    [Graphics] One thousand one spikes is a throwback to 8-bit platformers that uses a 2D minimalist pixel art style, with a parallax background that adds both atmosphere and depth to the world. It has a retro style that feels nostalgic, bringing me back to the NES days. However, 1001 Spikes choice of colors are limited. Using shades of black and gray through most of the game. Graphics 8/10    [Music] Though this game uses 1980s styled chip sounds, it still manages to please the ears, with the pacing of the music increasing as you progress through a level. The Music does however get repetitive after rerunning the level over and over again. Music 7/10.   [Story] In 1001 you play as Aban Hawkins, son of Jim Hawkins, who is lost in the frozen tundra of Antarctica. Aban and his sister Tina was left with a map to the forgotten ruins of South America. Together they explore the temple and try to retrieve their father's legacy. And that's about it, you get past the tutorial and a short cutscene later and you are in the game. I will have to say this was a disappointment. Using the mice at the beginning to help you along could've further the story in some way. Instead, the story stops there leaving you to complete challenging levels with no more than their father's legacy to fulfill. Story 4/10.   [Cinematics] 1001 Spikes brings you into the forgotten ruins of South America with no cut scenes till the tutorial is over. The cut scene look like the beginning animation from Pokemon. There is no voice acting, only text. The text animates in using a typewriter style that yet again reminds me of Pokemon. There are even references like “pocket monsters and Poko-mum” in the text itself. 1001s cutscenes match the art style of the game and add some fun to this sad story with its subtle references to other games. Cinematics 7/10.   [Content] While you spend your time gritting your teeth in frustration, there are gold skulls hidden in each level that unlock bonuses, like new character to play as and more lives. There is more to 1001 Spikes that is incredible difficult levels. They can all be played in co-op mode with a multiple friends. This makes for incredibly fun and frustrating times. You can choose to skip levels that may seem to hard at the time but you will have to beat them to unlock the last temple and to enter the second half of the game. Content 8/10   [Controls] The controls of 1001 are simple to use and unlike games from its time, controls beautifully. 1001 has a unique jumping mechanic which allows you to low jump and high jump, mapped to separate buttons. Movement is tight and accurate, making your character easy to handle. Controls 9/10.   [Gameplay] 1001’s levels are designed to be challenging, but not unbeatable. You enter the game with 1001 lives, but don't take that for granted. You will need all of them your first time through. You will need patience and persistence to beat each level. You will spend a significant amount of your time dying and repeating till you have all the traps memorized. Every level is designed to frustrate you but also teach you along the way. Gameplay 8/10.   1001 has a lot to offer in terms of level design and gameplay making up for its underwhelming story. The repetition can become a bit much, as you’re forced to run the same sections for extended periods of time until you perfect a jump or shot. This game is not for the casual player for the difficulty and time required to complete the game. If this sounds like your kind of game, I would definitely pick this game up on whatever you play on.   All in all 1001 Spikes Receives a 7/10",

Just as you think you've finally figured things out, that one block above you might just crush your skull, or maybe that seemingly safe platform will run you through with spikes, but it's so enjoyable that you'll come back for more.   As you progress through the game you will unlock characters from other indie games with special abilities that can change the way you play through some levels, maybe an air dash across that pit you couldn't get over before? Maybe hugging the walls to bide time so that you can drop down safe, some of these characters even come with their own stories as to why they're also in a death ridden temple from hell!   1,001 Spikes is a cruel friend who will punch you at the worst moments, but you'll have so much fun that you'll keep at it, waiting to see just what that next punch is going to be. 997...996...995...",

Audio: 9/10. Perfectly fitting. Lost 1 because in entrance levels where you get artifacts, the music is excessively simple and annoyingly high pitched. When I got to my first one I thought I had gone into a creepypasta. That's not good.  Story: 9/10. Very unique and interesting. Main character is a little arrogant.  Gameplay: 9/10. Very fun and addictive. Lost point with how it never says anything about how to unlock the third arcade mode or extra (Note, I'm starting the lava set, so it could be they unlock when I beat the game.), or even characters. I even looked up how to unlock some, and it said for Commander Video I need 6 golden skulls. Thing is, I already have 7 and did not receive the Commander.   TL;DR: I very much reccomend the game. Fun, pretty, audiogasm, and even more reccomend if you get the 33% discount for owning Cavestory+/nightsky.",
