Game is clunky, UI is sorely lacking features and the tutorial barely covers the basics.  With polish and some more work game can turn out to be decent enough, suprised this isn't early access because it sure plays like it.  Recommend to hold off for now until developer shows something more. Buy only at discount if curious.",
