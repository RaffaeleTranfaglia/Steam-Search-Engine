            "review_text": "I've always been saying to my friends: There needs to be more competitive/fighting puzzle games. Games like Tetris Attack, Super Puzzle Fighter, or Bust a Move have constantly been in my library or installed games list because they're so easy to pick up, but extremely difficult to master and dominate.   Heroes Never Lose definitely fills that gap that I've been asking for and with tasteful flair. The setting of a world where (almost reject) superheroes gives a quirky humorous tone that immediately welcomes the player. It plays very close to super puzzle fighter but with special abilities that each character possesses. The online works great, and is a welcome addition to this type of game as you'd typically play against someone sitting next to you [which is obviously the best way to play].   is good, get it ",

The characters have tons of personality, and the background stages are charming as well.   Aside from that, the gameplay is very fun. Although it's easy to pick up, it can get competitive real quick. It's a great game to play when friends are over.",

            "review_text": "I love puzzle games. I really do. I have a ton of time on Tetris, Puzzle Fighter, Puzzle League, and Puyo Puyo.  This one is just dissapointing in many respects. People say the controls feel 'tight', but I can't say I agree. The way held inputs are handled is strange (snapping to the side), and rotations can't be applied without interrupting the movement, making things seem sluggish.   It's hard to build chains due to the multicolored crash gem, which appears often.  Some of the characters, like Professor Puzzler, have specials that discourage going for big attacks. (His scrambles the field of the opponent!)  Many aspects of the game feel unfinished. There's no real story, but then once you beat the arcade mode you get a bunch of text on the screen talking about characters that weren't really introduced. After this, the credits rolled for me and the music stopped halfway through.  This isn't a design flaw, but it seems like nobody is really playing online. That is a shame, since I found even the hard AI trivial to beat. Compared to Puzzle Fighter, this game is a cakewalk.   Sad to say that I do not recommend this game.",
