            "review_text": "I have used many screen capture software apps. This one works far better then most of them and is a fraction of the cost.   It's easy to use and is fast at getting the captured data back to you so you can quickly edit it or post it to the net immediatly.   Any users that are complaining about this software are either not using it correctly, they have poor machines, or they are just ignorant.   For what this costs, versus what it does, it is a great product.  ",
