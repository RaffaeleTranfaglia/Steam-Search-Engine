Under the 'Processes' tab, find Riven and right click it 4. Select 'Go to details' on the right click menu 5. Right click Riven again 6. Select 'Set affinity' 7. Set it to run on only one core by unchecking all of the boxes except for one  This should solve the problem of it crashing after a few minutes of play, but you will have to do this every time you start up the game.  Besides that, there's not much else to say. Riven is a great game, there's a reason it's considered a classic.",

            "review_text": "This is a review of Riven (the sequel to MYST) Steam version. I say this first because i've already played the game originally in 1997 and certain things had changed for this review (alltough the game essentially is the same from 1997 just compiled to dowload online).  I loved the game when i first played it (almost 20 years ago by now). It was a very interesting sequel to Myst and added many things to the story (in fact, it had a story!) You meet ghen, catherine and again Atrus. There is something going on at least! that is the main thing i guess. The game came out in 5 cd rom discs wich was pretty notable for that time, lots of data and videos. More than 3gb of data for 1997 was a heavy thing. The puzzles are very hard, it is still hard now,but, even if you use a walkthrough it still is rewarding to find out how the world works, how the story of atrus and his family and the linking books unfolds.  The music is the best. Pretty much half of the experience in this game (the first one and this one in fact) is the music. Totally amazing, complements the graphics so well and what happens on screen at times. The graphics by the way, were so amazing in 97 that, still, to this day in some places, they still seem to be made last week. Of course, in general they've became old, but still, this is a 20 years old game!!! Is like watching a movie from 1996 and thinking that the special effects are not so bad...  Now, that was my review from the original game. Now to some things from actual steam/gog version i am reviewing and why i post a negative review.  While i was happy to be able to have a newer build of this classic game, wich i can download from steam and install in modern OS everytime i want. i did encountered certain problems, wich are not acceptable even if it is an old game. First, the game crashes in certain contexts, certain situations. Like for example clicking too fast when moving around (wich of course didn't happen in the original version) While i know that if i don't click too fast i will probably avoid these crashes, still is something that should be taken care of. Specially knowing that the creators and the company of this game (cyan) still exists and should be made aware of this and take care of the problem. Second, in certain situation when saving, your game can crash, during the saving screen... (if you don't use the save buttons). Also, third, and most catastrophic, there is a scene in game, where you have to turn on a light in a passage. When you do that, and you turn around, either the game crashes or takes you to a previous screen.... this is unavoidable. There is anyway, a way to continue through the passage after turning on the light (without crashing) so i finished the game luckily, but i already knew what to do there, i don't know what i could have done if it were my first time playing it, and didn't knew what to do there. This is something that happens at least in a win 7 64 environment and should be fixed, if not they are essentialy selling you a broken game. This is why i will not recommend this game, at least this version on steam and gog (the same). It is a shame, there was an interesting game...somewhere, there, but now it is too old, and its broken in someplaces so... (you could say that, ironically, the game, the same as the fifth age in riven, have become full of fissures everywhere....how sad...)",

            "review_text": "Because its current form is quite aged, Riven requires an open mind to enjoy.  Get this game because: puzzles (which are near perfectly built into environment and story); story; the most beautiful animated slideshow adventure there is.  Cons: 1997 display resolution; having to wait ~20sec for some journal pages to load (old, sequential scripting and filing); having to blip from the game to learn basic D'ni counting (which is base-25)  Btw, the Starry Expanse Project aims to remake this game in Unreal Engine 4.  Easy fix to bug: Before you get to the Moeity age called Tay, after activating the light at the end of the secret prison tunnel, repeat the path from the gallows UNTIL YOU FIRST SEE THE WATER, THEN TURN AROUND and continue lighting the tunnel, and finishing the game.  This brief review is biased because I played this game as an infant. I can play the entire thing now within three hours because I am familiar with the Myst / D'ni fictional world.",

You are not alone in this world, and you are not the only prisoner. There is no combat, there is no time limit or urgency, and there is no way to die in error. There are alternate endings.  This is an exploration puzzle game, and if you finish without any help you're a genius. The game had gorgeous graphics and animations for its time, but if you play it in its unstretched, native resolution now it's about the size of a 5x7 photo. Still, that didn't stop me from being able to complete the game and puzzles (with some help) and it still looks good. What little music the game has is great too, but most is ambient.  What makes the game so difficult is a combination of trial and error, clues being very cryptic or difficult to decipher, and many objects you interact with that feel like they may be related to solving a puzzle aren't. Crashed on me several times in Windows 7.",

I restarted thinking it was just a fluke, but it happened again, and kept happening. I've tried disabling desktop comp, visual themes, ran in compatibility mode, set the cpu core affinity in launch options, but it still crashes usually after a few minutes of play.  Reading through the forums it seems this is a very common problem. I honestly think I would love this game if I could play it.",
