It takes the concepts of both, and throws in a bit of Starsector (namely the fleet mechanics) for good measure to make a game I've poured hours into already. (As of writing, I've played it for 10.8 hours. I bought it yesterday.)  While some have also compared it to Gimbal, I'd say only at the very start. The comparison starts losing ground once you get the bigger ships.  Where this stands out is the.. well, game. BF and CF are both fun for a short play, but don't have many backing gameplay mechanics. Reassembly gives you economies, waring fations, fleet control and quite a bit of variety (Though I'd like to see mod support in the future for even more pieces/factions). Each faction also plays differently in various ways, for example, one can plant and grow their own resources, but seem to be lacking in firepower, another has literal nukes, but no shields, and so on, it forces a change in tactics when it comes to ship design that keeps things fresh. With all that in mind, it's still a sandbox, outside of the tutorial, what you do is purely up to you with zero guidance, I personally like that, some might not.  It should also be noted it seems to run superbly. I have a fairly powerful machine, but any game with 1000s of ships/particles will slow it down some. This doesn't, I've had fleets of hundreds of ships facing off against each other, and it has stayed at a stable 60fps.   All in all, one of the best games I've purchased in a very long time.  EDIT: Apparently mod support is already somewhat in the game. I got ahead of myself.",

The moment you leave to the next world, you'll be fighting random power varieties of fleets so be warned -Objectives don't need to be done right away, take your time, agents don't need to die immediately and if you lose, go somewhere else, gather and build and become stronger -To make REALLY GOOD SHIPS requires a lot of time building, to where I spend 50% of the time building and fine tuning and 50% of the time playing.

            "review_text": "Reassembly is both awesome, and not. If you enjoy ship builder games this game has a decent amount of options to do so. However, if you like in depth ship builders, Reassembly isn't a complex ship building simulator.  Essentially the game amounts to getting resources, selling resources, and building bigger ships. There is an 'Agent' mechanic which spawns other player made groups into your galaxy. Many of these squadrons will crush you until you can get to the very end game. These squadrons are really the only threat when you're powerful enough, so you either can leave them on and be demolished repeatedly until the end game, or turn them off and have a very boring end game.  It doesn't take long to get to the end game, and it's easy to run out of stuff to do. The best way to fight is to stack on piles of armor (it has no point value, so you can have as much as you'd like depending on how slow you don't mind your ship to be) and piling on a ton of a single effective weapon (most races have one or two weapons that are extremely effective, and a pile of flavor weapons which are functional against the standard ships, but not overly so against agents).  All in all it's a strangely balanced game, but I've had fun playing it. I'd say it's worth the price tag attached to it. If you need a ship builder simulator which has a lot of action but not a lot of depth, try Reassembly.",

            "review_text": "Reassembly is a decent sandbox shooter that has a relaxed atmosphere. The best part, obviously, is building your own ships and experimenting with designs. As you gather resources you can purchase better parts. Each of the factions have a unique theme and require different strategies to design. The ship building interface is very intuitive and easy to use, which is a big plus.   It's a nice, chill single player game but I think overall it lacks depth, which I will describe below. There's really no need for specialization against any particular foe. With such flexibility in ship design I was hoping this game could push this concept more. Once you have a decent ship it works against all factions almost universally. You can fiddle with designs for a while, but in the end, more expensive parts will make you better. With many factions it's quickest to destroy enemy ships for resources, so that becomes your sole focus. Once you max out your ship, basically nothing stands in your way. Unless you tried to get all the Steam achievements, like I did, there's not much of an end game to keep you playing. I spent most of my time on this game grinding out achievements.   In conclusion, it was fun but lack of depth put me on the fence on this one. After getting all of the achievements, I feel like I tapped out all of my reasons to keep playing. I would have liked to see the ship building aspect developed further. I'm leaning on the fence to recommend this game, but it was still fun for the time being. If you feel like this game might be something you'll be interested in then you'll probably enjoy it.",

The gameplay is simple, weapons can be bound to mouse buttons or auto-fire, every faction has its specialities and different blocks with different stats and forms, the game seems quite balanced at the moment, I played 6 factions to max and did not yet encounter problems with balancing.

            "review_text": "Reassembly is the game I never knew I wanted, but man, did I want it badly.  A 2D top-down shooter not unlike space invaders or asteroids in the sense that you fly around and shoot stuff. Reassembly takes it to a whole new level, allowing you complete customization of your ship. You can connect various parts, which snap together at points like legos, to create whatever your mind can come up with. At the beginning of a playthrough, your ships will be small and fairly weak, but as you advance you will be able to fly massive frigates followed by your very own custom fleet.  One of my favorite parts of ship creation is the physics of thruster placement. Where you put your thrusters actually matters a lot; your ship won't be able to turn very well if you only place them on the back. This also lets you build some funny creations such as ships that travel by spinning. It also means that if you are having trouble progressing, you can completely change the feel of your vehicle by moving or adding a thruster.  Creation aside, the game revolves around the aquisition of currency (called 'C') and resource (called 'R'). You get both of these basically by blowing up your enemies, the other ship factions. You use your C to buy upgrades and new parts for your fleet, allowing you to take on bigger enemies. If you manage to conquer your whole galaxy, no big deal, the game allows you to jump into a wormhole to enter a new galaxy with your fleet. You can also unlock new factions to play as; all of them utilize different base shapes for their ships, meaning you can create entirely new ideas playing one faction that you couldn't with another.  If you feel like you've peaked, you can upload your fleet, sending it to other players' games as a powerful opponent called an Agent. This is a really great part of the game, it keeps things challenging and fresh.  Overall, I put this game in the same circle as Spore. You create cool things and share it with others. The game is fun to look at, very colorful, and it has an awesome soundtrack. If you like building things, if you like space, or you like shooting the hell out of ships, just go buy Reassembly.",

Sandboxish, procedural generation, top-down arcade feel. I played the very early alpha version and was entertained for a few hours. I soon lost interest, and the game became stale to me.  Since then I've come back to the game again and again. It's one of those games you'll get pumped about and think about all day only to come home from work and play it till you drop. It's enjoyment for me comes in short bursts.  Recently I've made a discovery. The game does not play itself. People complain about how tedious it is to capture systems and hold them. They say something along the lines of 'Once you capture it there is no point. Your ships don't spawn there and you get no resources.' Now listen here, that is where you are wrong.  You can build space stations that bristle with defenses and hold their own agains enemy capital ships. Alternatively, that space station can be covered in solar arrays to slowly farm you resources. Recently one of my favorite things to do is populate enemy territory with little 'Outpost' stations via a factory on one of my ships. I then spend time fighting on the front line with my fleet to push the enemy out. This game is all about how you play it.  In summary, Reassembly is a great game. It's hard to find anything else out there even close to it (I think of S.P.A.Z. as the only other game that resembles it, another great by the way). Keep giving it a chance and you'll get a lot of replayability out of it. If you enter with a closed mind you'll get a closed off experiance. I highly recommend it.",

Something to keep you busy for a while, nothing more, nothing less.    I was COMPLETELY WRONG.   Reassembly is much deeper than you'd suspect, offering many hours of gameplay due to its well-executed procedural generation, plenty of weapons and a dozen factions. Although the game lets you roam free immediately after the short but very good tutorial (it teaches you all the basics while still letting you free to do as you please, and you'll have to learn the rest by playing), there is more than enough to do. You can build a sizeable fleet, design perfect ships, take over all space stations, wipe a faction off the map, destroy asteroid fortresses, take down strong fleets created by other players, or warp to an entire new map with your fleet.  Combine the simple, yet deep and very addictive gameplay with the amazing, trance electro music and the colourful, pleasing graphics, and you've got a great game for a great price.  I absolutely recommend it as long as you like top down / twin stick shooters and constantly tweaking your ship designs.",

Test designs by letting them autopilot versus random other designs. Center of gravity and healing rate are important. Some ships are practically a huge gun with a seat and thrusters strapped onto it!  I spent hours not even playing - just designing a ship and watching it play against other designs in the test phase.  Once you are happy with a design (or just want to shoot something yourself) go in and harvest resources where the bad guys are, which also allows building up a fleet to team up against opponents. Building a fleet is pretty cool - although they are something like a herd of cows... not too smart and they get stuck in the weeds sometimes. Playing the fleet dynamics is a whole game by itself!  The flight is very space-like where you have to oppose thrust to slow down, which makes it feel very swimmy (I think why they say welcome to the tide-pool). In that regard it feels a little like Spore's bacterial stage, only flying takes much more concentration.  Replay value is sky-high, as optimizing ship designs at all size allowances allows starting over and trying new ideas.  Also, the game feels very different than other games because you have complete control how your ship handles (although once it's damaged and your engines have fallen off it will handle very differently until it heals again over several seconds, relatively fast). Trying to control a damaged ship reminds me of Robocraft, though this game is much more twitchy.   TLDR:  If I had to pick a favorite game so far in 2015, this might be it. The gameplay is straightforward. There are always more things to want to try out, which takes time to get there and try them. And Space feels alive. This is more of a tadpole simulator than a space game.",

You might describe it as a mish-mash of SPAZ, Spore, and some other top-down space shooters, but the similarity ends there. The procedurally generated 'galaxy' is full of varied enemies and dangers, and if you run out of baddies, you can dive into a wormhole for a fresh world. Wormholes have another use, more on that below.  The main draw of the game though is the ability to build your own ships. The ship editor is easy to learn, and has enough geometric shapes to allow you to produce anything you want. The playable factions have different available hull and weapon choices, making each one it's own playstyle. There is a progression curve, you must spend money earned in the world to unlock new weapons and increase the power cap limiting how much goes on your ship. It doesn't take too long to max it out though, allowing for huge many-beweaponed designs. You can also build space stations, it's as simple as building something with no thrusters and at least one factory.  Once you have some custom ships you like, hit up a wormhole. Instead of following it to a new world, you can choose to upload a copy of your fleet roster while staying in your own world. This uploaded fleet will then start randomly appearing in other players worlds. These are called Agent fleets, and fighting other people's creations that appear in your world can be challenging and exciting. I've encountered ships that were nearly unbeatable, forcing me to change my ships and tactics in order to prevail.  You needn't fly solo in your world either, you can equip a factory block and spend resources you collect to spawn AI controlled ships from your collection. I'm not sure if there's a limit to how many ships you can have at once, I've gotten up to about 15 or so, plus a hundred or so drones if I'm in my Galactica carrier. Tearing around space with a dozen ships blasting anything you target is super effective.  A caveat to mention is that there isn't any actual multiplayer, which would be great if it were possible, I can see why it would be difficult with all the physics objects that can occur. Maybe a sequel could pull it off. Also there are situations that cause the game to slow down significantly, particularly in Spikey Plant sectors once they start firing projectiles all over the place.  Many games out there let you build things, which is fine, but this is one of the few that lets you use and enjoy the fruits of your labor in actual gameplay. The vector-style graphics are used to good effect and really get my nostalgia going. I've only owned the game a couple weeks and have dumped almost 50 hours into it. It's got good music too.

The 'agent' system just adds to the fun, as players can upload their ships to spawn in other players' games, and it's these agent fleets that will give you the most trouble, and possibly the most inspiration in designing your fleet, which you will undoubtedly send into a wormhole to bring hot death to others.

It stirred my gamer blood! The ship building freedom is top notch. You build any kind of ship you want particle by particle and there are lots of smart, handy features in the ship building editor to save time. You can hold down the mouse and drag it across an area to select multiple components or you can just double click one piece and everything attached to it will be selected.   A quick ship building tip is to just build one side of the ship, say a wing, select all the pieces then hit c to copy. Move the cursor to a blank part of the screen and hit v to paste, then hit m to mirror (to invert the selection). Now you can just attach that perfectly mirrored section onto the opposite side of the ship if you need symmetry like for wings. Symmetry is also important in placing your thrusters. You are in space so your ship isn't going to stop moving unless it crashes into something...or you put thrusters pointed in the opposite direction to the direction you're traveling in so you can break! Also each different playable faction has some unique pieces to build with. Sometimes the minor differences aren't obvious, like where pieces don't have as much mass as other factions or they have slightly higher armor, but when you stack all those pieces together into a ship then the net values really make a difference in speed, toughness, or resource carrying capacity. You'll want to look at the stats on the ship pieces closely if you're into ship building. If you're not into ship building there are premade ships available with each faction that you can use and just modify to your taste.  The game is beautiful to look at and very organic. To me it looks more like the world under a microscope filled with living, evolving organisms than it does a space frontier. Much like organisms, the ships actually create children. You can set a creation queue for yourself once you have a factory as part of your design. But you can also go into command mode by hitting tab and click on an allied vessel that has a factory and drag child designs into their queue so you begin to shape the future of your factions expansion without actually managing the execution. Just hit tab again to go back into pilot mode and go on your way. The allied ship you just programmed will now create what you set for it via the AI.   Once you've got your perfect fleet together you can find then fly into a wormhole. You will be given an option to follow it or stay. If you stay a parallel version of your fleet will upload to infect another player's galaxy through one of their wormholes while you remain where you're at with your original fleet. I just really wish there was some way of knowing how successful these invasions were, like a scoring system players could access to get some sense of how good your designs were.  The tournament mode doesn't pit you against other players. It just lets you test your own ships against your own designs and a small selection of premade designs. I would love to see a true tournament mode where you download player agents and test your ship against theirs with scoring. The game lacks true player interaction in real time but atleast we can see other player's creations as they come into our own galaxy as enemy agents controlled by the AI.  Unfortunately I do think there is a balance issue that needs to be addressed with faction 4. You will eventually find certain enemy agents that are typically oblong, travel at high speed, and shoot enormously long particle rays at you at range even from off of the screen! That's faction 4. They almost made me rage quit because they really get too many advantages, but I perservered and went back to the design editor. Their weakness is maneuverability. Their big bad weapon of choice is not turreted so the whole ship has to turn to target you with the death ray. This is not a huge disadvantage because their ships are inordinately fast but if you build a ship that can quickly side step their line of fire and either swarm them or ram them so that they can't turn into you then you can take them down...if you can catch them. Trapping them against asteroids is a typical ploy. Really though, no other faction gives nearly so much trouble...  The only other criticism I have is lag. No it's not really just a hardware issue. I play many other games where it's not an issue. The devs themselves have stated that they've worked really hard on the optimization but the fact is there comes a point where there are so many collisions going on in the galaxy that it can be taxing. I have an i5-4670, 8G ram, nvidia GTX 780 so my hardware is good. But I like faction 2 whose strength is cultivating resources and building up a fleet really quickly. Once I push out a bunch of ships that then create their own AI controlled child ships, the game has alot to track. The devs said to go into options and lower the physics updates per second value so I'll try tweaking that more. But it kind of makes me want to put the game aside now and come back later, maybe playing a different faction and not use a swarming strategy. If you get lag you can also follow a wormhole to a fresh universe, but that too can start to get repetitive.  The fresh content is really about fighting other player designs as enemy agents enter your galaxy. I hope the devs continue to work on the lag issue (maybe instancing parts of the playing field to lower the amount of AI activity needed as the game progresses). I'd also like to see them expand on player interaction by scoring invasions, and maybe add some simple tiered goals with rewards for flipping sections of your galaxy to your faction. I think those things would add alot to the game's longevity for me. Regardless, this is a really creative game. I love looking at it and playing it. It was worth every cent.",

The game is a simple and fun top-down space shooter with the ability to design and fly your own space ships, and even design an entire fleet with ships ranging from small shuttles and fighters to large destroyers and frigates.  There are several different races (some of which you can't play) that unlock while playing (and destroying stations from a race you haven't unlocked before), each with their own technological pro's and con's, but they are all (reasonably) evenly matched, and where one race falls short in say shield technology, it makes up for armor or speed.  The universe is generated in sectors each controlled by the majority of whatever ships are in that sector, so it can at times be hard to claim a sector completely when there is just 1 little core still floating about. The universe is limited in size, but thats alright since flying over one edge of the map puts you at the opposite side without a teleport or cheap backend trick. Watch out for pirate fleets though; These are, from what I gather, uploaded by other players and are randomly selected, which means that in one universe you may find ships you won't encounter in the next. This uploading is done through anomalies called wormholes that allow you to upload your fleet (designs) or fly to another universe. The latter will generate a new universe for you while you keep your resources, credits and ships.  The only downside I experienced so far is not being able to destroy core blocks from certain stations. Usually this happens after a few hours of playing and may be memory related, but other than that it plays like a dream. The thing about player created content worries me a bit though, but we'll see how well balanced the game is over time.  A definate recommendation and big thumbs up for this gem.",

Seven playable factions use different components and combat styles. Another interesting twist is that there are 'agents,' special ships that are player-designed that get shared over the net when you go through a wormhole. Beware the agents, for they are deadly!

Graphic style is simple but looks very good. It is colourful and trippy. I would describe it as a space Lego on acid.  Sound design is ok. Nothing mindblowing, nothing bad - it works and doesn't pull your attention too much.  Music is great. It helps you to immerse yourself into this space madness. It will get you into some kind of trance and then you realize, that this game managed to devour your whole evening :-D  If you need story and goals, this is not a game for you.

The building ship feature is very, very good (it could do with some fixs and some more variations), everything on the ship is down to you if it is too slow thats your faut (add more thrusters) or its just getting smashed against flagships and agents (add hull and shields) you can change it and upgrade it to fix these problems. Everytime you die there is something you can do to imporve the ship, you learn from every mistake and can adapt to it. There is something about this game that just brings me back to being a 5 year old playing with Lego and trying make HUGE planes and space ships. Really great little gem of a game.

You start with a simple small ship but you can unlock both more systems to build with and larger ships via combat and resource gathering and can unlock the other factions via battle so you can try their unique playstyles in future games. The best part of the game's factions is that while they all have some similiarities, they are quite diverse and not simply reskins of each other. Playing the starting Terran faction is quite different from the Reds which are different from the Sentinels and so on.  You eventually get to build ships from your ship and can keep them with you or release them and they'll defend areas as your control expands. Your AI allies will even build copies of your ship and you can use the interface to affect their production queues.  You also have a lot of control options and can even set how your weapons are keyed so you can fire every weapon via the LMB or put even big cumbersome weapons on point defense duty if you like.

The game is exactly the same as it was when it came out on Steam, with the only major addition being a 'tournament' mode where you plop a couple ships into a ladder to see which one wins out.  The aesthetic is interesting, but ultimately the actual game is shallow. Most of the gameplay comes from designing your ship and seeing how it fares in combat, but the combat is doesn't have strategic depth other than ramming or kiting. Your design slowly moves away from what you'd call an actual spaceship and more towards a geometric shape with internal engines. A basic square filled with as many weapons and shields as possible is simply better than trying to create anything that's actually interesting. Ship combat, therefore, devolves into a blob of shields mounted on a square careening through space and slamming into other blobs of shields in an orgy of lasers and missiles. It looks nice, but carefully designing a ship isn't worth the effort.  The design system is simple and easy to understand, but in practice it just falls flat.  The 'living world' is also not really what you'd expect. Capturing territory across the galaxy becomes an exercise in Exterminatus from Warhammer 40,000. You bring as many ships as possible and cleanse every single enemy ship from an area of the map, which then switches colour to your faction. That's it. You don't get any resources, your own ships don't start to spawn there, not even a message appears on screen. A part of the map changes colour, and you move on to the next area. Eventually this devolves into chasing one tiny little gnat of a ship that can't even hurt you across your territory because it keeps reclaiming tiles. It's tedious.  Don't get me wrong, I liked this game, but it is very shallow and the replayability just isn't there.",
