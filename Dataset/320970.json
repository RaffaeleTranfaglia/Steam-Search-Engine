            "review_text": "Who is IGT? IGT has been the leading company specializing in design, development, manufacturing, distribution, and sales of computerized gaming equipment, software, and network systems worldwide. You can read more about the company  here  [www.igt.com] .  IGT Slots Paradise Garden is named for the Paradise Garden slot machine present in the package. The package consists of a total of 15 IGT slot machines.  Functionally, the machines deliver a game of slots one would expect, especially those that have played these actual IGT slot machines. For most of the machines I did a youtube comparison and the machines look to be very accurate.  IGT Slots Paradise Garden has two modes from which you can choose. These modes are Career and Free Play. For each mode you create 4 profiles. For each profile you get a club card. The career club card is broken down into Career Points, Bank Roll and Time Played. The Free Play club card is broken down into Reward Points and Bank Roll.   The starting Bank Roll for Career is $1,000.00 and at first you are limited to penny denominations at each of the machines. Only when the game determines that your career bank roll has grown sufficiently will the denomination be increased. Denomination enumerations are 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, $1, $5 and $10. Playing career, it might be a while before you can bet and win big bucks, but then again, for that quick fix there is Free Play until you can elevate your career bank roll high enough to be able to activate the higher denominations. The starting bank roll for Free Play is $10,000 and you can quickly increase your bank roll playing denominations of $10.   The denomination is essentially the value of one credit. Credits you bet and win are displayed when you spin the reels. When you first sit down at the machine you will be awarded a maximum of 10,000 credits for that session if your bank roll is large enough. If you have a bank roll of $5000.00 and select a denomination of $10 the machine will display 500 credits. A selected denomination of a $1 will result in 5000 credits available for the session and so on. Credits are reset as you scroll through denominations.  Each machine as in real life has a Game Menu button and though I cannot vouch for it's authenticity the Game Menu button has a 'Rules and Pays' option that will illustrate how to play the machine. Oddly, each machine has a functionally duplicate button, sometimes renamed to Game Options that serves the exact same purpose.  From a functional view the IGT Slots Paradise Garden package delivers but like all video games there is the concept of immersion. In other words does IGT Slots Paradise Garden immerse you enough that you can believe that you are at the casino. Unfortunately this is where the package falls short.   There are two casino themes that are available but each looks to be rendered as low resolution FMV and this detracts from the immersiveness. The reels and icons on the reels are crisp enough to support the maximum 1080P resolution selectable from the game's options menu but the rest of the machine including many of the buttons are rendered in low resolution which also detracts from the immersion.   Immersive game-play is not just defined by video and by graphics but also by sound and music and while the reels are spinning the sounds and music are near authentic, based on my viewing of the machines on youtube. However, once the reels stop spinning and the payout animations finish the game goes silent. No casino ambience, no idle ambience, no visual or auditory feedback from the machines. Further the package does not convey the illusion of video slots. The reels do not look like they are spinning on a monitor.   Functionally IGT Slots Paradise Garden delivers authentic games of slots and on this alone the package can be recommended but I wish the developer had gone that 'extra mile' and delivered a more immersive package.",
