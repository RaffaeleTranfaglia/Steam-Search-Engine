            "review_text": "Some of the writing is clich√© and the odd bit of art looks wonky but those things don't detract too much from an overall positive experience. As with all otome games some routes will be less enjoyable than others depending on your tastes but what I liked best was the mystery-solving aspect, getting new scraps of information in every route to piece together the backstory and figure out what was going on. If anything the romance kinda sticks out considering that the protagonist barely knows any of the guys and the game takes place over just a few short days, though again that's handled better in some routes than others.  The protagonist is a positive point for me. She has a good design and personality rather than just being a blank slate, and like the plot bits of her backstory are revealed as you play the multiple routes, which was a really interesting idea.  The little puzzles for picking dialogue options weren't really bad, just pointless, and the game could stand to be slightly cheaper imo. More variation in the designs for the love interests would be good too, but sadly that's true of most entires in the genre. But if you like a bit of sci-fi/fantasy with your dating sim or just something a little different then this is more than just another paint-by-numbers otome.",

            "review_text": "A fun choose-your-own adventure dating game with tacked-on and oddly compelling Pipe Dream minigames.  The point-of-view protagonist, Janet, is stuck in a house for a number of days with a number of seemingly unattached ambiguously gendered men.  There's a bit of a sci-fi mystery going on. What you learn depends on who you choose to spend time with. You'll definitely need more than one playthrough to see the big picture. That's a really nice touch - not only do you have a new romance each time you play, but also a different and partly exclusive privileged point of view.  The art goes from mostly harmless to not bad. Despite not looking terribly professional, I found it endearing and never distracting.  My romance, at least, had plenty of juicy double-entendre, innuendo and a satisfying cli- uh... high point... without ever straying above a PG rating. I appreciated this classy approach, which was typical of the story as a whole.  The writing is very good. At no point did I feel compelled to stop reading or skip past dialogue, or roll my eyes at unbelievable speech. The characters were the usual suspects, but the stereotypes were fleshed out enough to be worth sticking around to watch and interact with.  Each choice you make comes with an untimed and easy pipe-matching minigame. I know it sounds gratuitous, but it helped me mull over the previous events while consciously making my decision.  The opening song (you'll have to play past the intro to hear it) is epic. PLEASE tell me it's on iTunes or will be in the near future...  In brief, easily worth full price. Replayability, good writing, fleshed out story and characters, interesting mystery and inoffensive art.",

            "review_text": "Oh this Game is great, Storyline, Artstyle, Music. Everything fits very well, I give it a 9/10. Could have been a bit longer to be perfect but that's just my opinion still an excellent game.  So for the details, before I hop onto them.  One or two sentences that someone like to know something about me or read this on my profile.  I got interested in Visual Novels(VN) because of an image board(4C), namely because of Katawa Shoujo (10/10 perfect Game, never would have touched VN's otherwise, enough advertising) I can clearly hear the stereotypes echo through my head, whatever, storybased Games have their appeal, too. This was clearly fascinating, after some browsing, I found VN's on Steam and decided to give it a try.  Just to inform anyone, your character is Janet, the girl. I was mistaken first and thought the game played around a guy again, which tricked me a bit into buying it, paired with the good reviews.  But to cut it short, that did not make me regret my purchase. I got hooked to the story nearly instantly, The characters have depth, they develop, they change. It is like a good puzzle, the backgrounds fit quite good together, not too good nor too bad. With a frame of circumstances that change, to a certain point where it get's resolved in one way or another. It's just compelling to know how your decisions play out in the end, hoping right into it, reaching one end of the 12 endings, reaching the climax, always with the elements of the unknown. It makes you question yourself, this is a talent many games lack: To think about what happend, what is similar to you, is their a lesson, can you apply that to yourself, what can you learn from it?. Can you feel it: the story ,the characters, the game?  The minigame for choices, sometimes a little offputting, sometimes it makes you think twice about the choice you make. It's not usual for VN's but I think it is a neet feauture for the overall scifi/magic type of novel.  But I didn't get tired of it, the atmosphere, the overall product is something that makes really sense in itself, I'd call it finished, it is complete in a story sense and everything get's wrapped up pretty good.  I can fully recommend this masterpiece.  PS: The perspective of a girl is very interesting, too.",

Interesting concept and different choices lead off to very different dialoge paths (as opposed to one different sentence in reply) so you're not constantly going through the same text with every single playthrough and when there is a repeat, you have the option to skip on.   Loved the story and a mix of unique endings (a few of which got me right in the feels)",

This and long live the queen, I really look forward to more of these :D Date Warp follows Janet and Bradly after their date takes some strange turns leading them to a house full of suspicious individuals. There are 11 endings (that im aware of) and all of them range in emotions. Some endings made me dance, some made me cry inside. I think Janet is a strong main character and all the choices are fun to play through :3",

It's absolutely incredible. 10/10. I definitely recommend it, though it is a short game, you can replay multiple times to get the ultimate, or true ending. and let me tell you, IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WORTH IT. very very satisfying as the final ending. I won't spoil anything, but definitely give it a go.     p.s: Linds is love, Linds is life.",

            "review_text": "I was able to finish the game within two days because this visual novel is awesome:) I just couldn't put the game down at all which was why I finished the game in two days in 10 hours.  As visual novels go u are on a date with Bradley driving in a car in the rain, Then the car breaks down. Janet was able to see a light and both followed the light that Janet saw. Janet and Bradley found out that the light was coming from a mansion. Once they both entered the mansion little did they know that the adventure begins in the mansion. Yup this game takes place on a mansion and I love that setting with mystery thrown into the mix. I always had a ton of fun reading the mansion cases in Detective Conan.  This game also has sci-fi thrown into the mix with romance too.   You have five guys you can romance. Each guy as two endings a good and bad ending plus one true end. Thankfully there is a guide in here so I recommend to use the guide here if you are stuck on achieving an end. There are 11 endings to get for this game.  As others have said below the character Janet is really a well developed character. I really did like her character a lot.  The art for the game could of been better but it's not as bad as it could of been. The music for the most part was enjoyable.  Other than that I enjoyed playing this visual novel a lot. I would give this a chance. Date Warp is made from the creators of Long Live The Queen which was another game that I loved playing a lot:D",

            "review_text": "It's a fun visual novel. The sci-fi story is intriguing; it's not really 'hard' sci-fi, but it's fun. It's actually more dramatic, even tragic than you might expect. The characters are well-written and three-dimensional; the protagonist, Janet, is especially believable. Incidentally, it's what you might call an 'otome' game, in that 'you' are female and you get to romance a number of young men. It's actually quite sweet at times.  The gameplay isn't much more than a Choose Your Own Adventure. When you come to a choice, you play a little pipe-rotation minigame; It's kind of a gimmick, but it doesn't come up enough to overstay its welcome. (If you've done a choice before, you can 'skip' it, though when you skip you can only choose choices you've chosen before!) The graphics are fine, though some of the portraits do occasionally seem a bit amateurish. The incidental music is fine; the theme song is actually pretty catchy. There are eleven endings; the 'true' ending is only available by first getting all the other endings. It's not TOO difficult to figure out how to get them. I went through over a week or so and enjoyed it all. ",
