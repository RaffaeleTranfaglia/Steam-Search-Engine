            "review_text": "This is a decent hidden object game, if you take a few things into consideration.  First of all, although the game has a Native American setting, it has no real resemblance to any real tribe. If you're a stickler for historical accuracy, you may want to skip this. The game is riddled with cliches and downright silliness at times, but if you're not too serious about realism, you'll be fine.  That said, the music and graphics are quite pretty. The game is almost exclusively hidden object scenes with an occasional minigame tossed in for variety. There is no inventory management or item-based puzzles as in most modern games of this genre. This doesn't make it bad, but if you're looking for a more complex game, this isn't it.  The hidden object scenes themselves are nicely done and aren't too easy. There are some naming conventions that might be bothersome to some people, such as using more formal names for animals and plants (I'm well aware of what a Calla lily looks like, but I might be a minority there). However, there is a handy hint button or the ever-present power of Google if anything is too weird. I feel that the quality of the scenes outweighs the sometimes-odd naming.  Lenth of the game is pretty comparable to others of this type, maybe slightly shorter. At the time of this review I believe I'm over halfway through at a little over an hour.  With these things in mind, and with there being no frills, extra content, achievements, or trading cards at this time, I would recommend this game on a half-price sale. Although the game is decent aside from its quirks, it's not $9.99 worth of decent. But I would still recommend it to genre fans, especially people like myself that tend to run out of titles to play!",
