The mechanics are old and trusted but still... I was affraid to see a soulless clone). Happily, this one brought me a crazy level of excitement and (even!) laughings!  The game is awesome and catchy. Once I laucnhed it to test for a while, I realised I have played like 80 minutes or something. And Contraption Maker didn't bore me at all. The missions are set in a very clever way, so each one is a bit harder then the previous, but not too much. You actually learn to play it step by step.  The puzzles are interesting and (the main thing!) really really different. I guess their puzzle designer is a nice guy with a good sense of humor. Besided, every puzzle has some kind of a plot, so you even start to sympathyse some characters (My fav is Waldo, what a gorgeous cat!). The game is simple and exciting, it is very light and kind, reminds me the most childish looney tunes cartoons. The music is awesome, and the controls are very intuitive. The only thing I noticed is a small little difference between designs of some elements and characters, but that's not a problem at all, just noticed. I've picked it for 0.99 on a sale and even recieved an extra copy to give some of my friends. I believe it would be an awesome present. Hardly recommended. If you are lucky to see it on a huge sale, take it without any doubt. I am not a fan of puzzle games, but this one is awesome even for people like me.",

The puzzles are the cascade type where by one action will trigger a chain of other reactions to achieve the final goal.

The game itself has quite user-friendly learning curve and puzzles get progressively harder. Even though many puzzles have repetitive elements the game is good for casual clicking and the harder levels make you think about applying for physics major or engineering studies (god forbid). I personally don't find (as a physics major, doh) patience to play harder levels for extended periods, but that might be just me. Luckily the levels ain't too bad so you will figure them out sooner or later.  This game (as it's predecessors) has it's value in teaching concept of the cause and the effect. In that sense the game has potential not only to give fun moments for a casual gamer, but to be utilized for teaching children common sense and predicting how systems work. There's a tip for you Steam-parents! Oh, and drop a copy for your the most bestest parent-friends so their younlings can argue about the best ways to turn on the toaster.  Tl;dr: Great old puzzle game from the past with hours fun (and agony) figuring out everyday problems. Great for kids! Wait for sale to buy it as it is now way too expensive.",

I have come to regret this choice after speaking with the developers and receiving a rather rude response in regards to the lack of a 32-bit Linux build. Long story short if you dont run a 64-bit build of Linux, 64 still being the minority in the Linux world due to it not being as necessary, nothing will be downloaded and the game will in turn not launch. They have no plans to fix this so if you have been screwed over get your steam refund while you still can. There have also been a number of launch issues on other platforms in which the team has no longer proactive in fixing.  Beyond this there are still a number of TIM gadgets from the newer games that are missing.  My best advice is track down a copy of TIM: Even More Contraptions instead, the team seams to have really bitten off more than they could chew with Contraption Maker.",
