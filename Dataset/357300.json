Personally, I almost never play more than 20 minutes at the time. I think this is an excellent game.  Pros: Reminiscent of classical puzzle games. Clever mechanics. Good mitigation of frustration (getting stuck) for a puzzle game: 2D map for level selection and undo in map. Cutesy graphics.  Cons: No tutorials for new mechanics (or any warning): 2D map allows to play game in wildly 'wrong' order (not playing easier puzzles first that have the easier mechanics.) I guess it's experimentation aspect for the game - I didn't find it fun or interesting.  Meh: Music and sounds. Both are cute, I guess. Both started to get on my nerves after a while. Full price.  Value on sale: Great. Value at full price: OK. Value for non-puzzlers: You will lose hair. ",

Snakebird adds to the sliding tile puzzle by adding the effect of gravity. So now, the complications have doubled. You have to plan for how the Snakebird can fall. I fear that this is too tough for me.",

Some of them almost appeared to be impossible (especially the rainbow ones!).  The core mechanic is really simple, but every time you think you know how it works and what can be done with it, there's more 'impossible' puzzles thrown at you that you now how to make 'possible'.  There were really no nonsense levels (like tedious ones that are just there to pad out the game). Each puzzle do something different from the other ones and have their own solution.  I got that 'switch' in your head flipped a whole lot from when you didn't know how to solve the puzle to then understanding what the solution is(or one of them?).  If you like puzzle games Snakebird is definitly worth your time, it has pure and well designed puzzles!     The only problems I had were minor and had mostly to do with the controls.  The feedback on wich snake I just took control over wasn't very clear. I often moved the wrong snakebird (and if they fell off screen or into spikes it could get annoying sometimes because there's a little delay and the focus could switch to another snakebird).  The undo was also a bit confusing, it sometimes switches focus to the previous snakebird when you undo instead of just undoing the move you made. An example: -- There is a green and a blue snakebird. The focus is on blue. &gt;Switch focus to green &gt;Move &gt;Undo It undid the move and also switched the focus to blue. --  Progress on a puzzle did not save when I exited to the map then returned to it.(it whould have been nice to have).",

And now enter Snakebird, a cute, nice-looking little game, which is really a ruthless killer of a puzzle game in candy-flavoured disguise. Snakebird wants you to collect all the fruits on a level and proceding to the exit with every one of your characters. Eating a fruit grows your snakebird with one unit, gravity works in the game, some levels provide you with simple items to help your progress, while the environment sometimes wants to kill you. There. That's it, really - and a collection of really, really tough levels, which manage to be hard without being unfair.  Snakebird is easily the best (non-construction) puzzle game I've played in a long while - I bow before the greatness of the people who designed its levels. For those who are looking for a serious brainy challenge - highly recommended. ",

The mechanics of the game may initially feel counterintuitive   (eg. snakebirds can stand on fruit floating in mid-air)  , but are consistent and fair. You start to develop the snakebird wiggling skills and techniques that give you an extra block or two you need, learn the proper positioning of snakebirds, and formulate the conditions required to achieve your goal. The puzzles are elegant, tight, and reduced to the essence of the concept they intend to teach you. Hypothesizing, testing, discovering, removing a patch of your own hair, and finally solving impossible-looking problems is so gratifying. As with the best puzzles you sometimes feel like you have discovered a loophole in the fabric of existence.  Graphical style and music also very appealing. A very polished work of genius.",

The art style &amp; theme are things you'd see on a mobile game not at all giving the impression that the game won't be at all difficult but as the Steam store page says it's deceptively challenging.  There are a total of 53 stages, including the tutorial &amp; extra stages, and more unlock as you keep completing stages. There's no particular order you have to do them in as the available stages are shown to you on a world map so you can basically go to another puzzle even if you've already started one. Stages don't necessarily get harder as you progress either so if say you've been stuck on one puzzle for a while you can hold that off for the time being and move on to another.  The gist of the gameplay is that you solve puzzles using a Snakebird thing with movements like in that old game, Snake. The tutorial stage will teach you how to play the game and the first few numbered stages after will basically teach you how the physics of the game work through your own experience. After all that the game will start to become noticeably difficult as the rest of the game expects you to basically be an expert in the mechanics and then some as the stages are designed to have you needing to do a a lot of figurative zigs and zags with the solutions to the puzzles. It can get incredibly frustrating with that case possibly encouraging more trial &amp; error scenarios than thought-out ones. There's even an 'Undo' option that lets you constantly undo the last move you just did all the way from when the puzzle started in case you made a mistake. Later stages will introduce a few new mechanics you'll have to work with.  It ain't bad for something with graphics that look like they're better off in the mobile market.",
