            "review_text": "I think the way this game works is that it assumes you know not a single word of the language you want to lear and then you have to complete all sections of level one before you move on. This is a bit extreme, so I can only recommend this to a complete beginner and when it is really cheap. So far, to me it has been a waste of money.",
