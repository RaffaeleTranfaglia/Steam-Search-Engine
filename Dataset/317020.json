            "review_text": "Games to Play on Any Day was the last spin-off game of the Pajama Sam franchise. While the other spin-off games dealt with a linear game format, this one is a choose your own mini game scenario. All of the games are basic board game style games with either Sam or one of the characters from the first three games hosting them. Some of the games are fun to try out while others are a little hard to beat depending on the difficulty level you choose. This is once again another spin-off game to help entertain anyone who's bored. And the only reason to play it is that its a Pajama Sam game and you can never go wrong with a game featuring him as the main protagnogist.",
