            "review_text": "i was a long time player in this game, the combat is great, its pretty much a hack n slash in mmo form, the dungeons are alright at the start but become better later on, there are SO MANY CLASSES, you start with about 6 that branch off to 3-5 different classes each that change the play style of the class tremendously, the difficulty is incredibly hard late game but simple early, BUT  i cant recommend this,   webzen is a horrendous website that will do ANYTHING to stop you from playing, if your a new player, it might not effect you but if your a returning player....good luck, the pvp is fantastic but full of people that will destroy you via great gear and its laggy most of the time, and finaly its P2W sadly its true, and not a small amount of P2W that might be tolerable, im talking full sets of INCREDIBLY difficult to aquire gear legit just dropped in your hands forever or for a limited time, upgrade stones (that make your gear incredibly powerful and is hard to find and harder to apply to gear, just given to you with a 100% succses chance if you buy it, pets that give you stats, titles that give you game breaking stats and so on, TL,DR great game horrible publishers wouldent reccomend it unless you dont care about P2W in pvp ( PVE is uneffected)  EDIT: alright il get a little bit more descriptive of this P2W problem that this game has, you pretty much cant progress the game properly without some sort of payment or a massive amount of play time(including a massive amount of luck),  Problem one : Luck  You might ask 'but why do i need luck?' well then buckle up because almost everything needs luck in this game, first thing being the upgrade system, that you must do every time you get new gear (granted you dont get new get that often), its a pretty basic system most games have it, upgrade material tier 1 can make weapon tier 1 stronger, giving it a basic damage bonus that ramps up to an astronomical level the more you upgrade, and give extra stats every 5 or so upgrades, but weapons can break if you upgrade em too much, sounds like a fair risk/reward thing going on right? well it isint, first off the chances of an upgrade working is fairly low, its a damn miricle getting gear to +9 (the reccomended tier, any higher will risk it breaking) topping the maximum to about +16 i think?, but you can make sure gear dosent break by using a special material that saves it if it fails, where do you get it you ask, a special daily event? no, a difficult to do team dungeon?, no, the cash shop? yep, its a cash item, an item thats needed to keep your incredibly hard to get weapon from not breaking...is a cash item, to make matters worse you can get stones that instantly level your gear to a specific number risk free, and by the way, it costs gold to upgrade them, and the cost ramps up the stronger the tier of upgrade, most of your gold WILL be spent on upgrading ♥♥♥♥.  and that cash shop comes with stuff like, buying pets, cosmetics that increase stats greatly,invintory slots (your guy has a handbag for an invintory by the way, its a mini space management game too!! how fun) that sort of stuff.  now lets continue about this amazing pay system they have shall we? but before we do let me tell you about the 'skill books', these skill books are end game items that you can use and find at lvl 50 and above, these books can only be used by a specific class, meaning there are about over 20 types of books for all the classes, these books can increase stats, give a special effect when using a skill ( when using skill A, book will activate making you do 50% more damage for 3 seconds) for example, and ADD ON to existing skills, makeing them much more powerfull and changeing the animation and visual look of the skill, dont worry you can find these game breaking books in dungeons. that is, the common ones, the white,green and sometimes blue rarity books that give minor bonuses, you see to get the good ones you need to be strong and luckey, how strong? well doing end game dungeons in maximum difficulty, how luckey? luckey enough to find a 'dimentional' boss, these ♥♥♥♥ers are much stronger then normal bosses, but drop fat loot, problem is, the show up once every 20 or more runs, but if your not up to impossible tasks you can always COMBINE books for a chance of a higher rarity book dropping, 6 books turn into one random book of your sacrificed book quality or higher, by random i mean literally can be any book from the 20+ classes, unless you sacrificed 6 of the same class books, but finding six of the same class books is difficult in itself, anyway blah blah blah how do i get these game breaking god items wihtout spending my life in the game? trade maybe? nah you cant trade em (have fun filling your invintory btw) cash shop, yeah thats the ticket, but thats also random, so you have to buy a chest with real money to maybe get something thats related to what you want, but hey its gonne be rare at least.  damn theres allot to write about, im just gonna stop it here for now, theres too much to say, might update this again later or when someone has a question, but damn, all that and its pretty much just cash shop problems, thats an achivement in itself.  EDIT: its been a good year since this review has been updated and looking back, i did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job at explaining the most important thing in this game, the Classes. specifically, ranged and melee difference.  i was about to log in once more to see how this game was doing, maybe they fixed some problems they had in the past, curious on how my old account was holding up, but the game wont let me log in due to account merging issues and PC switching conflicting, its a long and confusing story and i wont get into it, so instead il add another bump on the old review page.  so classes, the only thing thats this game is excellent at, giving you a large amount of varying classes to choose from that further along the lines become even more unique, but as much as il praise it, most of those classes are utter crap at the game, mainly due to the game mechanics later on.  lemee explain, early in the game lets say till level 40-50, you will probably have no trouble at all at beating anything this game has to offer, but around the 50+ mark a huge spike in enemy difficulty will be apparent, there will be larger numbers of enemies that fight you, they will have more health will deal more damage, more annoying skills to use on you and overall will be harder to deal with. even with those changes most classes will be able to deal with them, but some classes, like assasin and basic fighter classes wont be doing so hot against them due to them naturally needing to get up close and personal in large piles of enemies, they will get hit often, ranged classes will still be able to beat these normal mobs easily.  heres were fairness goes out the window - Bosses  up till level 50 most bosses will still be quite easy, most bosses have a damage treshold, meaning when you deal certain amounts of damage to them, they will stagger, smaller bosses that are human size, are more likely to stagger and get knocked up, while larger bosses are more ressistant to these effects, but as the game progresses, Bosses will get stronger and more resistant, as well as gain a nasty set of skills, but players will not be able to reach this damage treshold to stagger bosses anymore, meaning that you cant just use all your skills in a combo without getting hit...as a melee character, ranged classes will still have no problems playing ring around the rosie with bosses till they eventualy die, but melee characters need to get up close and personal, meaning unless you deal enough damage to stagger them, (and you wont) or have skills that will make you immune to damage,end game bosses will be impossible without a team for melee classes.  i had more to say, but i reached the character limit, guess i can answer questions if they pop up in comments.",

            "review_text": "This is hands down my favorite mmorpg mechanic wise. The combo based fighting game style combat and intrusion are probably the best things I have ever seen in a mmo. Unfortunately Webzen went full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and decided they should publish their own game internationally and severely ♥♥♥♥ed up the launch. I played mostly immediately before and shortly after the launch. The server was having either maintence or downtime literally every other day. As a result the game pretty much died. A shame really, because I don't think I will ever have another game where me and my buddy go on a 16 hour intrusion streak having the best gaming moments of my life",

            "review_text": "A nice game, but issues it has can prevent players from getting an enjoyable experience.  At the beginning the gameplay feels quite enjoyable, slashing monters is fun, even if it requires little tactics in most cases, some combos you can make are pretty amazing and there's surely some skill involved. Skill trees alows decent levels of customization, crafting is pretty good and easy to learn. Leveling is fast and you can make a few characters without dieing from boredom while grinding. Graphics and sound are also pretty good, nothing that special, but above average for sure.  BUT...  The game is instable and so are all its servers. All the fighting is done in instances, and every crash or disconnect make you lose your progress (it kicks you out of the instance). As you can expect to get both DCs and crashes a few times a day, the game can become unbearably frustrating. Most of instances are pretty short (max. 15 mins), but you have to be very patient, or very lucky to not get discouraged by the stability issues.   I had a lot of fun with this game thanks to enjoyable combat and fast progression, but becasue of those issues I pointed out I can't reallly recommend it to anyone.  PS Also, don't buy the starter pack here on Steam, it's pretty much worthless.",

As a result my account is taking up space on the database, but I am unable to log into the account due to an 'invalid email address' error, however I am also unable to register with my email address due to 'address is already in use error'. Upon further investigation this is a major error with the server company of Webzen, and you have to fill out a massive questionaire to get your account recovered and merged, that would certainly be helpful if I was an active player who was continiously playing. I am not, however, and returning after a hiatus from the game of months on end, which means any of that information is lost in the server database. After realizing I can't give the information on the accoutn due to how long it's been since I have played. Giving up on recovering my account, I resigned to creating a new on and starting over, only to receive a 'channeling partner information is not valid error' for a username and email that I have used for years and never used for MMO gaming. I have since uninstalled the game and felt I should leave this information with anyone who is attemptign to setup this game, you'll be lucky to get anything to work, and mercy upon you if you have to contact their support, some people have been waitign 2+ weeks since this announcement came out with the recovery information and no response from the C9 team either.",

Wow, this game really sexualizes females and though some are sexy, most, go so far it takes away from the actual game. The game itself, when looking past that, is really enjoyable. The combat is quick, the game is visually nice to the eye (whether it be environmental art style or… the girls), there is a good soundtrack and there is a story (even though it is a forgettable one).  The community is also still alive and there are frequent giveaways by MMOhut and MMObomb that you can get free cash shop items every once and a while. I highly just trying this game.

But this is another one of those RPGs that tend to get repetitive after a while. There is a lot to do and your character can be powerful if you do everything available. I wish there was a neutral button here. since there isn't, I'll give it a thumbs up. however my rating is 5/10.",
