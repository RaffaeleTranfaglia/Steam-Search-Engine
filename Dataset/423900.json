            "review_text": " Dinocide  is a platformer with an emphasis on eating food to keep your health bar up. It gradually diminishes as time ticks by, so you have to continue to eat to stay alive. Taking damage will decrease a portion of the meter, so making sure you find food while navigating the level is the key to survival. I like the style of the graphics, since the older games strike a chord with me. I grew up with Nintendo and such, so there is a reminiscent feeling that goes along with the pixelated style of game that I really enjoy much of the time. Here are my overall thoughts on initial gameplay:    Pros:",

Music is solid, controls are good but not perfect... definitely very short though, and not without a few flaws.  I bought this as part of a bundle without hearing about it and was actually baffled by the mixed/negative reviews, until I saw the price point. I completed the game in about an hour, and it doesn't do anything fantastically new or exciting.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty much Adventure Island, for better or worse. I have not played long but there is one big reason, for me at least, that is going to stop me from playing any more: the energy meter.  Like in the original Adventure Island, your energy meter constantly depletes, and not slowly. The pace of the depletion makes it clear that you are to always be going forward so that you can eat some food and replinish some energy. Touching or being attacked by enemies also depletes the meter.  This kind of harsh time limit being imposed on the player without choice has always bothered me. Every time I have ever encountered it in a game, I felt like it limited the player's ability to explore how the game works. You have unlimited lives, though I have not tried to see if you have unlimited powerups (between levels, you get to choose from powerups that you have collected) between deaths.  Because of the energy meter, every death I got felt cheap or not really my fault. It wasn't that I was bad at the platforming or fighting the enemies. It was because the game didn't want me to take my time. I feel like strict time limits work when the player chooses it, making it an optional challenge.  For this, I cannot recommend this game. It is seemingly well crafted and I like the aesthetics, but I cannot continue playing it because of the harshly restrictive energy meter.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. I like platformers, and don't mind the nostalgia look. Unfortunately bad design decisions and finnicky platforming ruin it. You go forward through stages and collect upgrade weapons to use, as well as mounts. The mounts give an extra health bar, which is greatly needed. The problem is you lose everything on you if you die or fall down. Which you will do a lot due to the poor game structure. For no apparent reason, you constantly lose health throughout the stage. This forces you to run forward at all times, meaning you can't really fight enemies well, and usually just have to try and rush through them. This is by far the worst of many bad design decisions and ruins the game. If enemies hurt you, and they do way too much damage coupled with constant health loss, you have to try and rush even more, forcing you to more likely get hurt by more enemies. Items also restore barely any heath, and less than even what 1 enemy hit does. It is this vicious cycle. If you are at half health rushing and a guy hits you you basically will die bc you'll be too low before next health. You are at mercy of game designers for next health. Also health placement is super hit and miss, some being way too far while others are close or decent.   With the mount, for some reason, if it dies, you remain, but only with half health, which makes no sense. The jumping isnt well down, when you jump, you go up super fast all of a sudden and go really high, but barely move horizontally at all, meaking some deaths from trying to reach the next platform, making you lose everything. Enemy design is also poorly done in some aspects. Enemies like vultures suddenly fly in from nowhere off screen, giving you no warning sign nor time to reach, leading to cheap damage. Enemies like the snake are also super fast and jump around, making them near impossible to dodge, and unable to run from. This is compounded by the fact there is no running, and your guy moves at .5 mph for some odd reason.   There is no backtracking or ability to get more upgrades, meaning if you lose with them, you have to replay the next level without them. This come to the head later on. In one level I kept dying because of poor health placement. Coupled that with vultures doing cheap damage, and this giant sand worm that comes out without warning and even hits you if you aren't close to it. You are unable to get past it and have to kill it, but it has way too much health and you constantly lose yours. So i kept dying and then i was left without items and pets, and just my weak normal attack. This basically means you're screwed and you can't do anything about it. This is where all the poor game design comes together in one terrible mess. I have no items, I have to fight this guy that I can't run or get past, who has way too much health, who I do no damage, to, as I constantly lose health. Because he's at the end of a section, I have little health already, so I just die and have to constantly repeat entire level, only to die as this poorly designed part again. As the game gets harder you are forced to use less items as you lose them, which is the opposite of how it should be. Thanks for nothing game.   3/10.",

            "review_text": " Status: Not Completed    Presentation   It looks and plays like a NES game...well, not really. Some effects are too advanced, sprites have too many colors and the controls menu shows a classic 3-button Genesis controller. Which is nice, because I'd choose it over NES controller anytime, but it also looks out of place. I guess that's because you need not two, but three buttons.   The art is amazing and animations are nice, everything looks clean, sharp, colourful and just speaks “high quality”.   Story   What story?   Sound / Music   The same high quality, they're authentic just like the graphics. They do their work and there's nothing wrong with them, but I can't say I remember any music from the game after playing it.   Gameplay   The game feels like a rehash of the old hits (Joe and Mac, Adventure Island, etc.), but it knows what it is and you shouldn't expect anything new here either.   It's a simple platform game. The healthbar you have depletes over time and depletes even more then an enemy hits you. You need to collect food on your way throughout the level to stay alive. If you die, you just return to the beginning of the level, there are no lives or continues. But the game gets really harder because of that meter and on later levels you don't even think about exploration, you just run to the end of the level, collecting all food you can get and trying to avoid enemies or anything else. If you were born to be a speedrunner, that would be great for you, but for everyone else (including me) that can be a major flaw.  Controls are simple and responsive – you have a button to jump (of course), a button for basic weapon and a button for special ability (useful while riding a dinosaur). The game stands by its name fully – you'll see a lot of dinos here which you can ride (and use their abilities). Not just dinos, but also a space mecha. But it's a secret, I didn't tell you that.  There are bosses, they look great and their patterns are easy to understand and learn. The first boss was perhaps too easy.  Occasionally, you get the chance to choose your path, which leads to different levels. You can't come back and there is no indication what to expect rather than image on the map, so trust your guts. By the way, the levels don't have any titles. It's kinda a problem, because you can't ask someone “hey, do you remember THAT level?”, the answer would be “ehhh, what level?”. The game really needs at least something like “A1, B1, A2, B2”.  Another major flaw it's the level design and cheap enemy hits which come with it. It's all simple and OK on the first levels, but later in the game you'll meet such “exciting” things like leaps of faith (jump down without seeing where you will land) or enemies which attack you out of nowhere and get about 50% of your health with just one hit (scavenger on desert levels is the reason why I stopped playing the game). There are also platforms which won't lead to anything and won't allow you to come back – you land on it and that's it, the only way is to jump into abyss, restarting the level by that (by the way, there's no option to restart it through the menu, only by dying).   Technical   There weren't any bugs during my walkthrough. The game feels well polished. You can rebind the controls and the game works with Xbox One controller.    Dinocide is a clone in an ocean of clones, but it stands out by its high quality of everything. That's the reason I chose to play it and it didn't disappoint. Still, depleting healthbar system is rather controversial and level design flaws cannot be ignored.   The review copy provided by the developer Sasha Darko for  Game Obscura  ",

Got it from the Yogscast bundle on Humble and as with many of the other games in that bundle it's ok and not entirely without merit. But the step from 'ok' to a remommendation is a long one. It's pretty much a blatant Adventure Island clone (it goes so far as the first weapon you come across is a stone hammer you throw in an arc...) with somewhat unresponsive controls and not that much value outside from trying to appeal to nostalgia.  The asking price is just way to much. If you get it during a steam sale at like 80% off or something and you really like Adventrue Island, sure you will get a few hours of enjoyment out of it, otherwise don't bother.",
