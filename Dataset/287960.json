You're someone who's probably trying to figure out if they should buy this game. Let's see what we can do about this.  Yomi will likely appeal to...   People who are put off of the dexterity requirements for competitive fighting games   Competitive gamers looking for a new strategic game to master   Game design fans looking for a new, interesting, well-balanced design   Players who want to master a game and learn how to outfox their opponent directly    What is Yomi?",

Currently the game is on sale for 10 bucks and it unlocks the first 10 decks, another 15 unlocks the other options, welcome to even grounds. Your opponent has no card advantage above you, so good luck and enjoy!",

            "review_text": "I really enjoy this game. I bought the physical version on Kickstarter last year, I have the iOS app and also have the characters bought in the browser client.   There seems to be 2 groups of people who enjoy this game, 1) people with a history of fighting games and 2) people with a history of card games. And it is interesting how the different takes on the game shows itself in the playstyle of each player.   It is also a very balanced game. In most competitive card games, there are decisive counter picks that just recks your opponents choice of decks. This is not the case in Yomi, every character stands a decent chance of winning against any other character in the game. This makes it a lot more diverse to play than a lot of the others.  Just be aware that this game only grants you access to the first 10 characters, and there is an ingame purchase for unlocking the 10 other characters as well.   Also, the chat implementation is not that great sadly. While you have a chat bar underneath where you hold your cards, it would be better to have it look like the browser client does. Lets hope they patch that ^^",

            "review_text": "Recently fell in love with this game. Yomi is equal parts strategy, skill and intuition. Knowing what your opponent is most likely to play goes a long way in this game. You can't just throw attacks one after the other. You must dodge, block and throw when the time is right. You'll get the hang of it after a few rounds. It's all it took me to learn. Then add in each character's special ability and card abilities and you've got another layer of strategy to look out for!  Overall this is a great game graphically, replayability and over all fun to boot! Get your fight on! Get Yomi!",

            "review_text": "It's rather pointless to nitpick every little details about the game. For example, I can start talking about the art works on the cards could use a lot of improvements, but that's rather meaningless because some people like it and some don't. Some poeple would complain about the pricing, but some people would have no problem with it. Some people would say it's unbalance and some would find this game made it just right. So it's just a little different perspectives.   Let's look at the big picture, this game is well designed and every character in the game feels different with their own unique styles of game play, and gets pretty complex with the aspect of learning the decks, counting cards, mind gaming, and etc. I imagine a lot of poker players would enjoy this. I would highly recommend it to everyone who would enjoy those aspects.",

They can be unlocked but the time required to do so is F2P tier.  If a regular fighting game had a roster of 50% DLC characters, it would be a joke. So, in reality, to appreciate this game you need to throw down $30 for the complete package.  Plus, RNG dictating whether or not you can poke, block, or grab is really lame.",
