            "review_text": "Absolution draws a hard line between itself and the previous 4 installments of the game without alienating die hard fans of this franchise. Absolution is far more cerebral than it's predecessors. The storyline is multifaceted and weaves together a plot that focuses on exposing 47's ambitions, strengths, and flaws without making him appear weak or whiny; he is still the ultimate badass, but much more human and believable. Absolution shows a more realistic and approachable 47; one I, and I assume others, can easily identify with. This game really develops Hitman's character on a much deeper level than previously attempted.  The movements of 47 are very swift and responsive. In fact, many of 47's movements can be compared to how Sam Fisher's movements are in the Splinter Cell games, which means players can now access cover and look around at a 360 angle. I would also compare the sneaking around to the Metal Gear games, as well. In this game, there are just SO many ways to go about taking out a primary target. On one level, I was given the option to take out a target in 12 different ways. That way could be by taking him out, wearing various disguises, taken him out quietly, poisoning his food, blowing his car up or taking him out with guns blazing. Not to mention, players can get reward for doing so, which enhances the replay value of this game.  The AI has been greatly improved. Characters interact with their environment, situations, and the actions of 47 in many fascinating ways now. Characters generally still have predetermined paths but they can now be interrupted, altered, redirected, and distracted to allow 47 to accomplish his objectives. This really makes a difference in the game play. You no longer have to memorize guards paths or actions, rather you can now change the course of events by affecting the characters in any given situation to gain access to your targets.  All in all this game is by far the best adaptation of Hitman yet. I highly recommend it. You can play this game and still feel comfortable without having ever played any previous versions.",

At the same time we can not ignore some design choices rather abnormal and tend to tarnish the feeling of enjoyment experienced by the player, such as artificial intelligence sometimes too deficient for stealth gameplay or atypical management bailouts. Nevertheless Hitman: Absolution is the worthy heir to a series that has always represented the best that the genre of stealth could offer and its beauty lies in the nonlinearity that distinguishes its gameplay: the ability to freely choose how and when to act, who kill, kill, where and how to do it is always anchored in the hands of the player. And this is obviously an element that can give great satisfaction.",

            "review_text": "As of 2016, it has been 10 years since the release of Hitman Blood money, the game defined the Hitman style of play and is regarded as one of the best stealth games of all time, to which I agree. 6 years later we now have Hitman Absolution developed by IO interactive and published by Square Enix, is it better than Blood money? or does it fall flat? Let's start with the plot.  Hitman Absolution kicks off right after the Hitman book: Hitman Damnation by author Raymond Benson, which took place after Blood money. Agent 47 (The main character of the Hitman Franchise) is told by the new head of the ICA: Benjamen Travis, to assasinate 47's former handler Diana Burnwood. When 47 shoots Diana, she tells 47 to save a girl by the name of Victoria as her last dying wish. I thought the plot was pretty well done   Let's get this out of the way first, the game is absolutely gorgeous with highly detailed locations, great lighting, sharp textures, great character models and animations. However, there is a bit too much bloom, especially 47's bald head.  The gameplay mostly consists of you having to get from one end of a level to the other while trying not to get spotted by enemies. Some missions have you killing a certain target within an area and these sections are by far the best parts of the game. You have a variety of ways to kill your target which goes from using electricity, blow up, grind, burn alive, blow up, stab, and yeah you get the idea. If you're not the sneaky type and want to shoot your way through the game's serveral chapers, that is also an option, the gunplay is perhaps one of the most tight I've played in a third person shooter. In each level there is a item you can find called evidence, which can be used to boost your score, and this takes me to the new feature for the Hitman franchise: the points system.  In almost every level, you will be scored on how you completed a level, such as losing points if you had to kill an NPC and didn't hide the body, killed the target in a creative way, lose points when spotted, etc. When you got enough points, you can learn assassin techniques which can be used to make 47 more efficient, such as reducing the time it takes to reload your gun, run faster, more health, and you get the picture. A returning feature is the much loved disguise system since the first Hitman game, although it works a bit different here.  If you find a disguise in a level, you can then wear it and move among the enemy, however it does not shield you fully from the enemy. If an enemy or civilian sees you while wearing their clothing, they will take longer to realize that you don't belong here and will investigate, however the other people in different clothing will not find you suspicious. This new system definitely works in my opinion, and if it was like blood money, the game would be almost impossible to fail.  A new mode to the series is contracts mode, you pick one of the many levels in the game, look around and then mark 3 targets, kill them how you want, and put it online to see who can do the same hit more efficiently. This mode is probably the closest you'll get to Blood Money gameplay and is definitely a mode that shouldn't be avoided. When you complete a contract in contracts mode you earn money which can be used to buy upgrades for your guns, buy disguises, and more guns.  The sound design of the game is top notch, the music is well done even without Jesper Kyd, and the voice acting is superb, especially David Bateson who voices 47 who does an exceptional job.  The A.I. in this game is also pretty good, they will actively search for you if you are hiding and know when to take cover during fire fights. Although there were still parts where they did act strange, such as ignoring dead bodies and shooting in the wrong direction.   In the end, Hitman Absolution is an excellent edition to the Hitman franchise and shouldn't be overlooked just because it's not that much like Blood money. I even think Absolution is just as good as Blood money.  Hitman Absolution is beautifully executed.",

            "review_text": "A 'meh' recommendation. Ever play a game that just drips with high production values and class, but you still don't like it? That's how I feel about Hitman: Absolution. I realize that it's something plenty of people will enjoy. I just didn't. Do I think it's worth picking up? Sure, if it's on sale. And you're bored.  If that sounds like I'm getting ready to drop some grade-A hate, I'm not. At least, I don't want to. There is so much about Hitman: Absolution that just reeks of care and attention. The graphics are amazing. Not necessarily a reason to buy a game, but they are. The voice acting is superb (Keith Carradine and Powers Boothe? Hell yes!). The soundtrack works incredibly well, giving an almost Bond-esque ambiance without ever getting too loud. While some levels are occasionally re-used, there are a lot of different locations and settings. And as far as the story goes, I felt incredibly close to Agent 47 (he's quite sympathetic, despite his stoicism). Sneaking from cover to cover feels fluid and natural. Weapons are deadly (headshots are a breeze with the Silverballers).   So what's my problem? Most of the levels are claustrophobic (the opening Chinatown level and the cornfield level are exceptions). The paths through the levels are restrictive. And some levels don't even bother to hide their linearity (final rooftop level, among many others). There's no way to level-up Agent 47. Upgrades are unlocked based upon how high of a score you received upon completing a mission. But the points system clearly favors a specific path – even penalizing for non-target knockouts. I was never a fan of the Assassin's Creed games' “full synchonization” mechanic either, but this just ticked me off. There is no loadout customization; you start every mission with choke-wire and (after you unlock them) the Silverballers. Other weapons are acquired by finding them or picking them up from dead enemies – but it doesn't matter, because you'll be back to the piano wire and Silverballers once the next mission starts.   Disguises are actually not a problem; there are plenty of them around. Using them is sometimes strange, though. If planning to ghost through a police station, DON'T try to use a police uniform as a disguise. Why? Because if a cop gets too close to you, he'll detect that you're not a real policeman. Makes sense, I suppose. But in a level crawling with police, disguising as a police officer becomes a questionable strategy – which seems counter-intuitive to me. Much better to knock out a homeless person and take his disguise, since the officers won't detect you. But then, dressed as a homeless person, you won't be able to enter restricted areas without attracting attention anyway. Several times I just lost patience and started taking innocent people out to facilitate progress – and several times got embroiled in a full-on gun battle. Which actually wasn't that bad. If you're careful, 47 has a ton of health, and headshots are 1-hit kills. Add in the deadly Instinct combat mode, which has elements of the VATS system from Fallout, and 47 becomes an absolute wrecking ball of death.  There were some great moments, though. Ghosting through the flaming warehouse while troopers searched the premises was a thrill. Heading deeper underground through a mining facility with guards everywhere was a delicate game of cat-and-mouse. And trying to take out three henchmen in Chinatown with throngs of people everywhere was easily the most enjoyment I had. Somehow I thought every level would feature that amount of variety and detail, and I'm disappointed that (to me) it didn't. Recommended because Hitman: Absolution is polished and does what it sets out to do, but ultimately it's only a mediocre game that is sprinkled with some great levels.",

There is no freedom here, the levels are carefully presented and split into brief and disjointed sections via checkpoints to ensure no exploration or creativity in approach is possible so your objectives.

            "review_text": "From the vacuum sealed mission area, to the awkward new instincs system. This game does not live up to as a Blood Money sucessor.  The new 'instincs' meter is an interesting concept, but implemented in the worst of ways. Specifically the costumes/disguises side of it. Back in BM (Blood Money), disguises would give you certain access to specific areas, within reason. Taking the opera house as an example, dressed as a cop you could access some backstage areas. As one of the target's priviate secuirty guard, you gained even more access, etc. The disguises had a certain limited usefulness based on where you were going to use it.  Now, I have no idea if the designers were having issues about 'how' to implement diguises in Absolution, but this whole 'skill meter' that goes down whenever someone even looks your way in disguise is a bit silly. In the very first mission, following the tutorial. You have to kill some guy in a tiny market, packed with people.  One of the ways to deal with the situation is to steal a poisonous fish to use it's poison against the target. Thing is, the fish is on a counter within a cooking stall. Even if you have a chef outfit, you need to hold down your 'instinc' ability so that you don't get spotted by the other cooks. Even though I was holding it down, seems when you pick up the fish that still triggers 'suspicion'. And then I had the cook chase me down until she called security...  The feeling of stealth and being 'mixed' in with the crowd is just completely ruined. The tutorial section gives out this sad mechanic when you have to use disguises a few times, but each time you still need to hold down the 'instincs' ability to not get your cover blown. And the AI's range for getting suspicious is ludicrous. If at least they would have kept it for 'face to face' encounters. IE, if you get to close to a guard he could call you up, and you'd have to use your instincs to come up with some BS answer/cover story or your cover would be blown. I mean the fact that 47's 'defense' is to lower his head and put his hand on his forehead... really? Doesn't that make you look even more suspicious... ugh.  As many others pointed out, the lack of mission 'preperation' is kind of annoying. You get dropped into a level, and most of the 'weapons' you need to find scattered around the location... I know that in BM you could spend money to get special weapons dropped for you within a mission area, but this one just feels totally wrong. Finding remote explosives in a crate of fruit for no specific reason, feels wrong.  And although there are numerous ways to 'kill your target', many of them end up causing level wide alarm. And you 'need to' clear all security forces, or so it seems, before leaving a mission area... Very entertaining... Not really. If you look on youtube, many peoplel who showcase killing alternatives, do so and end the video shortly after the level wide alarm is triggered. You still get the achievement though...  Blood money offered way more flexibility, and diversity of the way you disposed of your targets. And not all of them were on a razor's edge. In Absolution, maybe the later missions get better, but the first 'real' 'mission feals claustrophobic, extremely limited in actual stealh options (massively hindered by this new instinc system).  The overhaul experience feels too different to create any meaningful parralel with BM, a game that I love and have reinstalled and replayed numerous times. The level of freedom gives almost each playthrough a different feeling, and opportunity to explore different parts of the level of ways to accomplish your goal.  Absolution falls so flat on the countless aspects that made Blood money the success it is. I don't want to sound dismissive of the team, but it's almost like someone drew up a list of good and bads from BM, and instead of sending the good list to the dev team, they sent the list of bad things to them.  They promised a much more different experience in the upcoming new hitman game, but I'm going to be as weary as I was with this one, and wait for it to come on sale. And I'm not talking 15% off here, more like 75%+. ",

            "review_text": "Soooo...I already played this game, entirely. Just to be sure I wasn't missing something. I did this on PS3.Then a friend of mine decided: 'hey you should stream this game. Here's a key for the pc version'. And I never streamed it. Why? It sucks on so many levels, but especially in two areas.  -First:  In terms of mechanics, the game is not well designed at all. And I'm not talking about the linearity of the level-design, though that is a big step back compared to the perfect Blood Money (perfect on that point at least). No, the main idea is to resolve an incoherence of the series (the fact that when dressed as a cop, no cop will tell that you look suspicious) by creating this 47 'sense'. It is a bad bad bad decision. In theory, well balanced and polished, this would be an ok solution to a 'non'-problem. But in execution, this gauge means that you can't be dressed as the type of character that is the most seen in the level, because you'll be unmasked in seconds by these guys, except if you use that sense gauge that emptied itself way too quickly. In lower difficulty settings it can work okay, but when in pro mode, some missions are just stupidly difficult to perform a 'silent assassin' rank. Except if you play the game like a Conviction ripoff. That means that, in a HITMAN game, you spend 80% of your time crouching behind counters, taking down people that are not relevant to your objectives...when you should be proudly crossing entire rooms just walking, dressed as a clown, a priest or a bodyguard. The essence of Hitman is to be hidden in plain sight, and that mechanic f-ed it up.  The worst thing is: it is not even a good Conviction ripoff. The game doesn't know how to balance this modern predator stealth kind of gameplay, that we all played from Arkham Asylum to Human Revolution with the Hitman type of infiltration. And that gives us a level-design and NPC placement that satisfes no ends.  -Second:  ...and foremost should I say, Absolution is incredibly vulgar and idiotic. And I know, being a fan of this series since the second one, that there is some poor taste jokes in previous episodes. But overall, I think the tone of it all, the focus on the themes rather than the characters, and the fact that the story never really was a focus of the game, merely a way to introduce nice game-design ideas (that be cool to make a hit on a classy boat! let's find some story about drug dealers on the Mississippi river!) gave opportunities to take it as a juvenile way to contextualise the gameplay, and it kept intact the elegant nature of the main character. Absolution can't stop putting 'story' in the game. The cutscenes are longer, the game is more focused on that, rather than giving the player a good challenge, and by god why is there so much bad language in this game, and why all the childish sex elements? The Saints are the farther the series as ever been from good taste or even a bit of maturity. That doesn't make the game cool, or mature. It just looks like either an idiot who wants to tell a story with edgy characters, or a kid who wants to look like a bad*ss. Plus, I swear, the story makes no sense, and from beginning to end, you can pinpoint a major incoherence in each cutscene.   TL;DR: The game is poorly game-designed and doesn't know if it wants to be a predator-stealth game, like the Arkham series or Conviction (that were previously released) of if it wants to kinda stick to the Hitman formula. It satisfies non of these two game-designs and tries to resolve an incoherence by creating even more incohenrences. Plus the game talks to you like if you were a complete idiot and use bad language in place of good writting to tell a poorly put together story.   AVOID. Play Contracts, Blood Money or the 2016's Hitman for the real deal. This one is just pretty looking and insults your intelligence.",

            "review_text": "I've been a long-time fan of this series since the first installment by Eidos, Hitman: Codename 47. It's gotten a lot better with each subsequent installment, and this is no exception.  This game defines what it means to use stealth. Much like Splinter Cell, or Thief, this game rewards you for your patience, and puts it to the test with each stage. The game isn't particularly long either, with each mission area being fairly short, with minimal objectives to complete, but it's the time it takes to wait for that guard to finish his route, or the two civilians holding a conversation to move along that makes the game long and enjoyable.  The game's basic plot is you're given a mission to eliminate an Agency rat and through the act of actually getting to your target, you learn there's something bigger at play, and you defy your commanding officer, setting a string of events in motion that will put your will to the test. You're thrown into the game with a minimalistic prologue/tutorial that tells you the basics of sneaking around and causing distractions, killing, subduing, hiding bodies, etc... and then before the mission is over, you're introduced to the rating system. A system that awards points for positive actions (objectives, hiding bodies, evidence, silent kills, etc...) and penalizes you for naughty actions (getting spotted, killing/pacifying non targets, killing civilians, etc...). The goal is to maximize your score on each mission by completing challenges and completing your objectives in a multitude of (creative) ways. The best rating you can get on a mission is Silent Assassin, whereby you complete all your objectives only killing your intended target(s), and not getting spotted. This is the most difficult to pull off, but it makes it all that much more fun. The multiple challenges that you can complete are also presented in such a way that it requires multiple passes through a mission before you can claim them all (many are mutually exclusive), so the incentive is to keep thinking of new ways to win. The one downside to this system though, is that when you complete a challenge, it stays for good, so reloading a checkpoint is enough to give you the credit to complete the other challenges without a full playthrough.  The missions are tough and well scripted. The dialog and the musical score is top notch, though there are some lines that are pretty corny. The character cast is great and it can be sometimes hard to follow who's who, but they are all likeable (or dispicable). The game offers a wide spectrum of difficulty, whereby the harder you go, the tougher (and more plentiful) the enemies get, the more aware they are, and you get to use less of your 'instinct', a skill that allows you to see interactive objects and enemy trails, as well as the ability to blend in using a disguise. The hardest difficulty is the toughest enemies, highly reactive, and no interface. The only other game I've seen that done with is Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (another great game). Good luck 47!  It also sports a contract mode, which is sort of like on-line competition where you complete user-created contract missions for money to increase your stats. It's a pretty slick system.  Check this game out, you won't be disappointed.",

Had they created a new IP with an interesting world and story, this game might have been great. It's not a bad game in it of itself, but it is a bad Hitman game. The enviornments are small and limiting. You aren't even able to assissinate many of your targets--instead the game launches a cutscene where 47 either screws up the hit (WHAT!!?) or you get a cutscene where 47 barely is able to take out the target. Very dissapointing. Even worse are the levels. There's no trips to castles in Japan or various other interesting locales; no, we're stuck running around boring ♥♥♥ middle America. Ugh, just remebering the game gets me going. At least it looks really pretty, if you can ignore the ridiculous amounts of bloom that is. Anyway, do yourself a favor and get Blood Money instead.

            "review_text": "'Hide in plain sight' - thats what they said in the trailer.  Boy I was excited about the game - the very first game I preordered, because it looked gorgeous and the delevopers seemed like they knew what people expect from a hitman game.  Like a child I didn't get to bed just to play it the second it was released. And for the first few seconds I was overwhelmed. It look good, the story didn't seem particulary well but interesting enough.  And then it all went down... Lets go to the positives first: - Beatiful! You have to give them credit for that - Contracts seemed like a good idea - Shooting mechanics are quite good, covering works well  - Some nice ways to eliminate your targets - Kinda good stealth game - Very good level design (visually)  CONS: - An absolutely broken checkpoint system. It doesn't even save who you killed. Everything came back to live afterwards. Everything you tried to buid up to vanished.  - Disguise system is broken. Others have mentioned it. Hide in plain sight is only possible if the enemies are far away and you really really hurry up. Everyone wearing the same disguise can spot you. Like hundreds of cops would know each other on a personal level if they are hunting for a suspect. This was the point that killed it for me... Instead of thinking of clever ways of how to acquire a disguise that will get you through the next section they are utterly useless, you still have to hunker down in cover... Wait for painfully long periods of time until some NPC has finished the dialog to continue. Because, well, you wear the same clothes as him and the checkpoint is placed when they start talking, not when they are finished. Wonderful! Instinct lets you put your hand in front of your face for a short period of time because well... f***, thats why. Doesn't make any sense. - Very restricted areas. There are magic doors that you close behind you and no one will come through the door - ever. The level is divided in independent sections that share nothing between them. - The story gets really dumb and embarassing. They wanted to center it around our protagonist. And they could have made so much good with it, instead it turns quite obnoxious, weird and unbelievable... - Killing in cut scenes. You might have heard that. It doesn't happen often, but it is odd enough that they even think about that. Worse than the killing in cut scene is that the enemy is being killed IN FRONT OF DOZENDS OF BYSTANDERS which is exactly what Hitman is NOT about. Ridiculous  Bottom line is: If you expect a hitman like game, don't get this, not on sale, not ever. You are most likely going to be severly dissapointed. It is bad as a hitman game, they stripped it of almost everything that made it unique and interesting and not only dumbed down the gameplay to make it more accessible, but dumbed down the gameplay for no apparent reason because it actually makes it LESS accessible (other than perhaps lazyness when it comes to programming (I've been there)).  If you are looking for a stealth game where you can calmy time your next moves and know nothing about hitman, or hated the previous games, this might be a pleasant surprise for you. Then you should get it. It's a catch for 5€..    I get that things need to change to keep a series interesting. And the previous games had their flaws. But changing all the central gameplay elements is not the way to go. If it didn't say 'Hitman' on the box, I might recommend it for being an 'okay' stealth game... But this is no Hitman, don't be fooled by it's looks. It's by far the worst Hitman game ever made.  Summary: Hitman fans - Stay away Stealth game fans - Give it a go. When it's on sale",

Depending on the weather, one could opt to be professional and keep things quiet or go on a Sterling Archer-esque rampage.   Absolution, however, decides to take that agency away and puts you in the uncomfortably tighter suit of a restrictive narrative, much like your mother did when you were flower boy at your Uncle Gerald's wedding. Unfortunately, the aforementioned narrative is done in disappointingly poor taste, and Absolution's linear nature does not lend itself well to multiple replays.   Filled with ghoulish, hideous caricatures which are supposed to pass some semblance of human beings, Absolution catapults you into the grungy abyss of a metaphorical (and at one point literal) sex dungeon.   It remains a competent stealth-action game and there's certainly some fun to be had if you're truly, desperately bored...but try as you might, you can't wash the smell of grindhouse out long after you've left.",

Previous games were made from relatively standalone missions, with background plot. Now there is strong plot connecting all levels. This has many consequences. You cannot choose your gear. Some missions are just linear corridors. There are no contracts. Big disadvantage is missing save function. Yes, there are checkpoints, but they are scarce and repetition of some parts was so frustrating, that sometimes I rather finish the assignment by killing everyone.   So I was pretty upset, I spent more than 30 euro on game, which I didn't enjoy. Then I realized how to play it. It is no longer pure stealth game. For me, it is more like stealth game with action phases and it works. In linear parts works more aggressive style, while in big open spaces silent assassin style is my choice. Love it. Combat with guns (you can even use human shields) and overall cover system are great. Controls are excellent. 'Stealth' missions are nicely designed and joy to play. Maps were removed and replaced with instinct. I still miss them, but instinct is decent and makes sense.   Not a perfect game, but still recommended.",

Story: From your 1st fiber wire kill in the tutorial to your last sneaky sneak (Or guns blazing if thats your style which the game alllows for) This story will always have you on your edge of your seat. But more interestingly is HUMOR! All these little coversations happening around you can be absolutely hilarious! 'So you're telling me its not postate cancer!' *Proceeds to throw him off the cliff :P*  Gameplay: Solid 3rd person stealth action gameplay, wasd to move mouse to aim, nice simple but more importantly precise. Only gripe about it is there is a bit of button mashing when you try to subdue without killing, which makes sense but I don't see why you can't just press the button once for either a neck snap or subdue, just make it a longer animation, similar to the Batman: Arkham games.  Finally the overall look of the game is stunning, I won't say graphics make a game, but in this case, they look amazing and they are just made better with the overall look of the levels from the bright lights of chinatown to its dark and gritty cemetaries, the astetics of greenhouses and the pristene look of mansions and building interiors.

I finished the game before on Purist mode and I must say, the Instinct system they used in the game is amazing. I could've done without the precision shooting mechanic, but the sound indicator when you're about to be spotted is a great addition to the game. Notice that on harder difficulties you will not have a HUD that indicates who will see you or how close they are in spotting you. If you really want to enjoy the game, I'd suggest you push it on harder difficulties especially if you're a veteran of the previous games. It provides a cinematic experience and your movements will feel really organic - whether it's choking out someone or sneaking from cover to cover.  Absolution's story is lacklustre in comparison to the previous games. While the amazing locations and the voice actors are top notch in providing a great experience, the story's build up does not come close to ANY of the previous games. Though it is nice to see 47 exhibit his human side since Silent Assassin, they seriously wasted it here. Normally I would stop when the story get so horrendous, but they do such a great job of making you feel like a stealthy assassin that I don't mind it all.

Missions are generally broken down into two different types; being given targets to assassinate by any means necessary, and Metal Gear Solid-esque sneaking through larger levels to get to the exit. The former can be absolutely stellar; you have to plan takedowns of other targets to get disguises to get close enough to your target (preferably without getting caught, as the best laid plans will understandably get torn asunder if someone sees you moving a body), and are then given a variety of methods to take your mark out, ranging from doing it personally with a gun or garotte wire, or, my personal favourite, using various parts of the environment to set up 'accidental kills', like framing your target so he gets shot by police, setting a live wire to where they urinate in an alley in order to electrocute them, or less subtle methods like causing a crane's hook to come undone and crushing them with its contents.  Unfortunately, where the game falls apart is in the long stealth sections that make up the rest of the game. There's very few checkpoints, it's almost impossible to shake suspicion once you've lingered in an NPCs line of sight for too long, even while disguised, and with few exceptions (like one case where you can throw the police off your trail by dropping the body from someone else's murder into their line of sight), they feel very uninspired. Worse of all the AI is very buggy at times; I've been spotted through solid walls, had would-be victims magically turn around at random despite never going so in the previous dozen or so attempts, and on at least three occasions had to completely restart a level because an NPC spawned right in front of a checkpoint, facing me. Worst of all, checkpoints DON'T save progress between game sessions, meaning if you crash or have to exit for whatever reason, you have to start the entire section from the beginning.  There's a recipe for a truly unmatched stealth game here; if Hitman: Absolution had focused more on the actual 'hits' and less on the horrendous stealth sections, it could have been darn near perfect. Unfortunately, those are diamonds in the rough, and there's a heck of a lot of rough to sift through. Thankfully the game's multiplayer 'Contracts' mode, where players can set challenges for other players to beat by doing those actions in the in-game setting, provides a steady stream of decent diversions and while the stealth sections heavily bog down the early stages of the game, much of the later game brings the game back to form.  All told Absolution slips by with a recommendation, but with a lot of caveats. Sadly beyond Contracts mode you HAVE to endure the lousy stealth levels at least once to get to the good stuff, meaning those without a lot of patience for that sort of thing had best look elsewhere. The meat of the game is in replayability; thankfully replays break chapters up into sections that allow you to bypass the worst parts of them if you see fit.  I really, really hope that the next Hitman game learns from Absolutions' flaws and continues to polish its gems. For now, Absolution is fun-- just very flawed fun.",

            "review_text": "I picked this game up for 3.99 €, as several friends said they liked it.  At first, it felt very avarage. Clunky character animations with poor transitions, cheap sound effects, barely-interesting story, that feels disconnected from the gameplay itself. But I can handle that.  The game ran very poorly, despite the fact that the graphics lack detail and enviroments are small. Now I can handle playing a game on low graphics without complaining, it's okay. Gameplay is what matters, in the end.  It crashed twice during first mission, and I lost progress. Then it crashed later, somewhere around 2nd or 3rd mission. Iam okay with that though. Few crashes at beginning, and one rare in the middle, I can live with that. No problem.  I continue playing, Iam getting more and more bored. It became very mediocre. And as I played even more, I actually became frustrated because of certain game mechanics, I'll list them here:  1) Trespassing zones - most of the time, there's no way to tell that you're heading to an area that's restricted. Worse, once you enter the restricted zone, the people around start getting angry very quickly. Too quickly, and there's no time to turn around.  2) Disguise system - great concept in general, but very poorly executed. You've certainly seen tens of movies, or heard several stories, that involved a spy who masked himself as a guard/policeman/mercenary, and used this disguise to make his way through restricted areas. In this game? It doesn't work, because when you are under disguise, people with same clothes as you will get suspicious very quickly and will attack you. I find it ridiculous, because for example, when you silently snap the neck of a policeman, and take the police uniform and wear it, other cops will become agressive within seconds if you pass by. To get benefit from the disguise system, you actually have to do the  opposite , you need to find the rarest clothes possible - so the chance of meeting a person with same clothes is minimal.  3) Mission design - everything I mentioned above could be solved if this particular problem disappeared. The design of levels, placement of characters, their routes and view angles, and the placement of flank routes, is just wrong. It feels as if the levels were designed for a first-person shooter game. Did I mention first-person shooters? This Hitman game actually has a few Michael Bay scenes, and they are a complete miss. They don't match the pace of the game, they don't match the atmosphere, and they set a wrong type of mood for the upcoming mission.    In the end, I'd give this game 5/10, maybe even 4/10. For stealth, the Splinter Cell series feels better in every aspect. I feel bad for this negative review, because it seems like everyone loves this game, but if I wanted to post a positive review, I'd have to lie.  If you are reading this review, and still decide to purchase the game - and you will discover that you like it, Iam happy for you, and wish I could say the same.",

I enjoyed the film that released a few years ago, but couldn't get around to playing any of the games until recently. I'm to understand that Hitman: Absolution recieved mixed reviews for it's step away from the staples of previous games in the series. I'm also under the impression that this is the most 'casual' approach to the franchise to date. Many felt that the game is too easy when compared to literally every other installment. As for my experience, I found this game to be a very enjoyable mixture of stealth and action. I've played through the game on normal and felt challenged, but rewarded for my achievements. Virtually every kill felt gritty and impactful. The stealth elements are solid, and though not without flaw, usually reward patience and punish mistakes. Even though I never intended to complete any achievements, I found that I was challenging myself to stay hidden and avoid using disguises as much as possible. This ended up extending the time needed to complete the campaign on normal by a few hours. Also, while the campaign only clocks in at about 8 hours, there is a ton of replay value here. Each contract can be handled in a number of different ways, and there are a wealth of weapons to implement. I have yet to even explore the 'contracts' function that allows players to create and challenge others with custom missions. All in all, if you enjoy stealth games, replayability, cosplay, or are just looking for a gateway into the Hitman franchise, this is an excellent place to start.",

            "review_text": "Hitman: Absolution is a pretty fun game if you're into stealth, assassinations, using guns, choking people, etc. Sounds like an interesting Friday night, hmm? In Hitman: Absolution, you play Agent 47, an elite assassin. You play the game in a 3rd-person style, just over 47's shoulder. You can switch which side you want with a mere press of a key, however feels more comfortable, or as the situation dictates.  The game starts off with an opening mission which plays as a sort of tutorial or getting to know the basic mechanics, it's pretty straightforward, try to infiltrate without being seen, if you take anyone out, make sure you don't leave their bodies in plain sight for others to discover, you are given plenty of places to hide bodies, so it's not too cumbersome. Don't be seen, take people out, disguise yourself as a worker, blend in, and make your way to the target. Take out the target, make it look like an accident, hide the body, whatever the case, don't get caught, if you get caught, take out more people and then clean up even more :P  After the intro mission, you are given more targets, cutscenes, storyline, reasons, blah blah blah... It's not a deep story, basically, you are hired to assassinate an agent who has gone rogue, you find out they were protecting someone. You realise it is up to you to fulfill their work. You go rogue, you rescue the person, you protect them, but others are after them, you take them somewhere else, chaos ensues, in the midst of it all, they get taken. You have to get them back, target, target, target, one step closer, closer, etc...  Regardless of the not-so-deep story, it is still a very enjoyable experience playing. Assassinations are quite satisfying, I must say. And quite a variety of ways to reach your goal, as well as a very open world for a lot of the levels. Wearing disguises and obtaining weapons, whether they be guns, explosives, melee items, etc. is quite enjoyable...  The environments, especially on Ultra graphic settings, are quite spectacular, especially as this game is nearly 4 years old. Looking off into the distance, you really get a feel for the scale, and it often feels quite big and even expansive.  I've played about 35 hours, playing through the storyline 3 times, as well as side-contracts, and have gotten 100% achievements, yet there is still much more to do, there are nearly 300 challenges during the story, which I have only done about half of. There is so much more to do even after my goal of 100% achievements. I will probably go through it a couple more times yet, for it is very satisfying to play... 8.5/10  EDIT: Sept 18th, 10 days later, put in another 25 hours on top of the 100% achievement game... finished all the challenges, found every gun and melee weapon and random object in every level, also completing every level to 100% ...however, the game is not completely done 100%, as some items in the Safe House are locked and can only be purchased by playing contracts and earning money... and then upgrades are locked as well, so, we'll see, might do a bunch of contracts over and over and over until I have the millions of dollars required...",

            "review_text": "Apart from some obvious flaws, this is a nice addition to the Hitman franchise.  I'm just going to say right off the bat that this is a pretty fun Hitman game. As a franchise it should have died with the very first Hitman game. While the original game had fans, I have to say it is one of the worst games I have played. The premise is not particularly interesting. Subsequent Hitman games have improved a great deal on the original but have always had shortcomings, for example, the second Hitman game had some really bad AI bugs which meant that you could quetly walk behind someone who is asking for for ID and politely strangle them. Some of the levels were tedious or pointless etc. So when considering this Hitman game, it is no different.  There are some really interesting ideas in this game that could have been so great but were poorly implemented. For example, hand to hand combat is basically the same 2 animations repeated over and over. this is especially odd considering the H2H was put on display in one particular level that has you in a bar room brawl. It is obvious that 47 is proficient in Karate but the moves on display quickly become a bore. It is also difficult to randomly engage an enemy in H2H. I don't expect it to be on par with Batman: AC but a little effort in this area could have gone a long way.  The other interesting but badly implemented idea is the focus skill. It is basically a rip off from Max Payne with a slight difference, the game almost pauses and you can pick your targets, ready for execution, then push a button and 47 will quickly dispatch a large number of foes. This skill is also put on show in another level that has you doing target practice. However this skill lacks the flare and showmanship of Max Payne, making this 'skill' feel more like a cheat. It takes the enjoyment out of dispatching enemies, especially on the PC where aiming is done with precision on the mouse.  Aside from these issues I found the game enjoyable. The story was a little strange though. 47 seems conflicted about being a hitman, but his pysche doesn't lend itself to those feelings. He isn't haunted by the people he has killed, he also has no moral qualms about killing a friend, because those are his orders after all. Aside from this though, the story is logical, believeable and simple. 47's journey to the end of the game is also highly varied. *spoiler* I absolutely loved the corn field level.  Depending on how you play the game, 47's brutality is on show, a ruthless and lethal killer who is pretty much untouchable.  Graphics: Superb use of the Unreal engine with some nice tweaks like tessalation which brings a new level of realness to 47's dome.  Sound: Atmospheric and functional.  Overall I would say it is worth the asking price, but as with all Hitman games, expect flaws.",

            "review_text": "Hitman: Absolution is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix. Its the Fifth game in Hitman series. The game was released on 20 November 2012.  Story:- In the aftermath of Hitman: Blood Money, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47's handler with the International Contract Agency, suddenly goes rogue, carrying out a catastrophic sabotage that includes publicly exposing the Agency.The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency.rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.47 hides Victoria at a Catholic orphanage somewhere in Chicago and contacts an International Contracts Agency (ICA) informant named Birdie, who asks him to kill a wealthy gangster nicknamed The King of Chinatown before he'll play ball. After eliminating him, 47 meets with Birdie, who briefs him about Blake Dexter, the CEO of Dexter Industries, who may have more information on Victoria. As payment, 47 is forced to give his signature Silverballers to Birdie.  Plot twist:-  in other words I'll simply say that 47 was Betrayed by the agency. it was the agency who was using us.   you will find your answers when you play the game.  I recommend the game.   Game-play:- the game is played from a third-person perspective and takes place primarily in the United States, mainly around the city of Chicago, Illinois, and the fictional town of Hope in South Dakota. The player controls Agent 47, a master hitman. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipes, against enemies if opting for the action oriented approach, or avoid enemies all together, not being seen, using disguises, blending in the environment, and only attacking the set target, if using the stealth oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily.There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to spike coffee, pull switches to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story. The player journeys to a mansion, library, strip club, gun store, wrestling arena, courthouse, and hotel, during the story    The game introduces an on-line option to the series, 'Contracts', where players can create their own missions for other players to complete.Players choose one of the areas in the game and modify it to create a different level. Players change the location of items, remove items, or add items, choose an objective or add a target, add a time limit, or choose which areas of the location are inaccessible and vice versa. Challenge your Friends by Creating master mind missions.   If you are a stealth lover, you must try this game out if you haven't yet.  i rate it:-  10/10",

            "review_text": "Oh, Hitman Absolution..where do I start? After 43 hours of trying to get the 'perfect' score, according to the scoring system of course, I finally beat this.. (terribly) flawed 'masterpiece'. Hitman Absolution, could've been the best Hitman, as of previous Hitman game, IO fix some 'annoyance' in previous title, refining existing feature, and adding new one to keep it fresh and open up new feature. That's exactly what Absolution did, but along the way, they implementing some 'questionable' (and sometimes rather terrible) changes to the games, preventing it from becoming the best Hitman ever created, hell.. at some moment I feel like rating Absolution my 4th favorite Hitman game (my least favorite was the first one),   Well, just let's just go on with the actual review:   Graphic: 9/10      + Gorgeous! I love the attention in detail this game shows, I really like the atmosphere and tone. It looks really cinematic. And talking about cinematic, IO's presentation has gone up by 300% in Absolution. From the map detail and cinematic, it has a top notch presentation. Hitman Absolution is a downright nice game to look at. Oh, and the animation is pretty smooth. +/- I might like the overall feel of Absolution, but sometimes I think this kind of tone is a bit off for Hitman. Way too cinematic for me, everything's is just so shiny (especially 47's head), in oppose of the dark/gritty atmosphere of the first 4 (especially Contracts). The effects is a bit overdone at times.   Gameplay: 7/10    +The ability to take cover, and subduing enemy from cover, auto dragging after garroting someone, hiding a body in closet are some really welcomed addition. The UI is greatly improved, less obtrusive and more intuitive , though I never had a problem with the previous one, Absolution just modernized it in the right way. +/-: The disguise system. In a way, it's nice to see that 47 isn't completely safe when he's in disguise, when people question 'Is this a new guy? Have I seen him before?', it adds up the realism, but in quite many cases, it becomes an annoyance where you just can't concentric on observing the various possibility a map can offer, and it brings up the flaws on Hitman Absolution.. +/- Oh wait, the scoring system. It's an overhaul that no one asked for, OK, the leaderboard thing is cool, and brings up a nice competitive heat. And the obtrusive-ness depend on how 'perfectionist' the player is. As for me, it's a double edged sword, at one side, It pumps my inner 'Perfect Assassin' soul, but in the other side, I don't like my definition of a Perfect Assassin is dictated by a score. Like: 'OK, I'll shoot this guy with a Sniper Rifle, perfect spot, no one's looking' *shoot poor guy* *Gets 20,000 points* 'OH GOD I SHOULD USE THE GARROTE WIRE FOR THE EXTRA 7500!' *Spent extra 45 minutes to get past guards*.  - Linear map design. Absolution might have an amazing attention in detail on the map's texture, props, and all. But detail in term of gameplay and layout, it's rarely to be found here. Gone the blueprint, majestic, open-world playground, replaced by a map that is designed for the sake of the progression of the story. The less obvious pathway is actually obvious in comparison of previous title. There's an entrance, you can go by 2 way, front or side, there's a property, we make it stand out, it means it can be used to kill the victim, and there's an exit, guarded by annoyingly lots of some patrolling and stand-still guards. Of course, it's not true for all levels, Chinatown, Blackwater, and Street of Hope are the stand out there.  - - The checkpoint system, the biggest sin of Absolution. THAT AT TIMES-OBSCURELY-PLACED-DAMNED-CHECKPOINT. I hate it, with a passion. They replace the perfect traditional saving system, where I can save anytime-anywhere, when I want to experiment things, that I know it could go wrong, they replace it with this..thing... And everytime I reload a checkpoint the enemies that I previously subdued magically re-appear, is this secretly a resurrection tool or something? This thing..is just.. I'm speechless, for no good reason..at all..   Sound: 8.5/10   + The voice acting is a huge step up from previous title. The characters feels more alive, and adds up a bit of emotion, and overall the sounds / sound effects is fine for me. +/- Great, but didn't quite match up the previous title. Jesper Kyd departure does make a noticeable impact to the musical tone, though I'm not attentive enough when it comes to soundtrack, but I know the OST is pretty great when I come to YouTube just to listen to it. Absolution, doesn't give that feeling to me, or at least, not much.   Story: 7,5.10    + I like how the story is presented, in cinematic perspective. The progression, some twist, and clearer sense of plot and decent character development. A smoothly flowing and intriguing story.  - I like the story, I like the presentation, but I don't like the type of narrative, the way it's told. It's trying to be dramatic, and it becomes out of place most of the times. I like the 'Get in, assassinate, get out' kind of narrative, while the story is told through the briefing and short opening/middle/ending scene. It just feels like a more proper assassin story.    Overall/Enjoyment: 7.5/10     Hitman Absolution is an ambitious entry of the game, over-ambitious perhaps, and it's quite obvious. And ambition can result something like Absolution. A game with really high production value and very polished, yet tends to overdo everything, to the point that it forgot what it is in the first place, but it's awfully familiar in many elements. My review might seems harsh, especially in the gameplay section, but trust me.. it's still a fun game. A sneak-em-up action/adventure with a lot of decent, yet limited assassination, a, at times, way too strict sandbox game. A more 'methodical' Hitman, rather than the 'imaginative' one. But, it's still an awesome game, but it's a 'just good' Hitman game. It's still a fun and solid game, with a deep and rewarding stealth system, though IO's attempt to keep every Hitman entry fresh is riddled with few bad design choices this time.",

            "review_text": "I really like this game. It is challenging, and there is an optional stealth element. You get higher scores when doing stealth actions or 'accidental' kills on targets. Additionally, as a fan of duckies, this is an optimal game for duck sightings. You see duckies pop up all over (sadly, the amount of ducks decreases as you progress further in the game).   I noticed a lot of similarities to splinter cell: blacklist, but ultimately how the game works is different. Hitman: Absolution focuses on superhuman abilities (on easy and normal), which disappear at higher difficulties. Splinter cell has the technology readily available, and you can always opt to have a silent gun. Additionally, In splinter cell, you could eliminate everyone without being penalized wheras in Hitman you are penalized if you kill people (without headshotting) and hiding them.   Checkpoints are really bothersome in Hitman however; you cannot close the game or you restart a segment of the level (In the menu there is a 'restart level' option which restarts the entire mission, starting at the 1st part. To reset the part of the level, you would need to exit and then continue). The checkpoint system also does not do a proper check for enemies and can reinitialize enemies that you previously subdued (not sure if it's only an issue if you knock them out or not)- It would seem to me that you could theoretically kill every person (except targets) twice as long as there is nothing preventing you from backtracking. I also had some issues where I got stuck in the upstairs of a mission with nothing to throw, reset the checkpoint, and a guard stood at the entrace. I was able to get around this by shooting a bullet, then hiding in a closet until he passed (if the guard doesn't get alerted by a noise, he would stay there).   If you have the time to play this game, It's definitely worth it, it's a very challenging game. If you're going for perfection, keep in mind that there is minimal room for anything but - you generally have to make no errors and can't rely on checkpoints like in other games.",

Absolution is no exception, and feels smoother, more attractive, and more compelling than even 2006's superb Blood Money.  Players that see the Hitman series purely as a series of largely unconnected, discrete challenges always focused on assassination may be disappointed with the new approach, but for everyone else Absolution is probably the ultimate Hitman game yet. Agent 47 is as deadly as ever, but he is now both hunter and hunted, reliant on his wits and what he can scavenge from the environment to succeed. This time around it isn't just duty that drives 47, but a strong and coherent plot that makes every hair-raising infiltration and carefully-planned kill feel personal and important.  Gripping from start to finish and polished until it shines, Hitman: Absolution is a truly brilliant game and a must for any fan of stealth and third-person action games.",

            "review_text": "I've never played a Hitman game before but this is just one awful experience that isn't fun &amp; is overly frustrating.  One of the worst stealth system in any game I've ever played. There's so many people that you'll be constantly getting seen &amp; when you're in disguise it barely even helps. If you're disguised as a cook, somehow every cook in the world knows you're not a cook. Same goes for every disguise. Like there's some sort of inner circle for every profession in the game.   Once you get caught you might as well reload cause there's a good chance you're not getting out alive. There's so many NPC's roaming everywhere it's nearly impossible to do anything stealthy at all. Human shields do nothing to deter persuers. Cops &amp; whoever else just shoot them until they die then proceed to shoot you. Firefights in this game are not something you want to get caught up in. There are too many enemies to handle on your own &amp; you can easily be taken out in a small number of shots. You can try to run but even that's difficult because of how the game maps are so overpopulated. Someone will most likely see you if you try to hide &amp; when you do manage to avoid being seen it takes so long to get into your hiding spot they'll probably see you before you get halfway in.  Every mission is poorly designed where there's somehow always someone nearby to see you &amp; because of that it's just one giant frustration. It's hard to tell where guards are looking &amp; their line of sight is just wierd. It's supposed to be where they're head is facing but sometimes it just doesn't work that way. One moment you'll be spotted across the map &amp; another you'll be behind someone only to have them turn their head slightly &amp; see you. There's a minimap radar but there's so many enemies it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all &amp; the radar doesn't track their head movement. The end result is you being seen more often than you should. It also takes map memorization so you'll get turned around if you don't know exactly where you're going.  The instinct system is especially bad. It's an energy source that you use to avoid people while in disguise &amp; use a bullet time event that for some reason you have to hold CTRL+Q to activate. Why can't it be bound to one button? Then when you use it you have to watch a mini cutscene that's supposed to show how cool your kills are but it just makes them take so dang long to finish. I don't need to see a cutscene every time I kill someone with bullet time. It also drains much too quickly even on normal difficulty &amp; why does it cost instinct to 'Hold your hat infront of your face?'  The combat is a mixture of a terrible QTE system for everything that's melee where the text is so small you can't tell which buttons to push. Even worse is the 3rd person shooting system that is just the most outdated system I've ever had the misfortune of playing. Even worse is that you're an assassin &amp; you get punished score wise for killing people. You get punished for getting seen, punished for killing someone shooting at you, punished for nearly every thing you do because you're supposed to be some sort of perfect killing machine even though you just turned on the game. Then it constantly has pop up messages to tell you when it disconnects from the online scores. I don't need to be told every single time this happens!   Overall the game isn't bad but it isn't very good either. It tries too hard to seem realistic &amp; because of that the actual game part suffers. It ends up with a subpar stealth system, a bad QTE melee combat system, outdated shooting mechanics, an instinct system that makes very little sense, very bad level design, vastly overpopulated areas &amp; it's just a very frustrating experience.",

The lame story took it down the most for me, the weird cartoon cowboy crime boss as the main antagonist was particularly bad. the game doesn't show you anything new really (apart from the annoying storyline), plus its geared towards stealth and low profile, yet the only thing you constantly get provided with in your arsenal is massive huge loud guns and explosives that are only good for a massive blood bath.   Every single level I just went with no equipment, whats the point in bringing a huge rifle (that you can't conceal) that you got from preordering the game when it attracts every npc in the whole level towards you, leaving you with a piles of corpses, and no points?. You can see what they were going for....but if its not broken....",

Stealth is even less challenging.  Overall:  6/10",

            "review_text": "The Hitman series has continually challenged players with tracking and assassinating various targets across the world, while providing multiple routes in which to accomplish the particular tasks at hand. Absolution marks the first true entry in the current generation of games built upon its powerful, in-house built Glacier 2 graphics engine. In addition, the gameplay has been altered with the introduction of new features associated with the Instinct and Contracts modes.  Set directly after the events of the previous game, Hitman: Blood Money, Absolution tasks Agent 47 with tracking down his series handler Diana Burnwood after she goes rogue and reveals the agency's identity to the public. The new Agency director Benjamin Travis orders Agent 47 to kill Diana and capture a teenage girl by the name of Victoria that has been under her care. Upon reading a letter left from Diana, the narrative spirals into a chaotic set of events interwoven with Agent 47 being hunted by both the police and a cast of villains that aim to capture the mysterious Victoria from him. The majority of levels are set in various exterior and interior locales in Chicago and a small town in South Dakota.  A major contrast from past games in the series is the addition of entire level sequences that focus on evading the police while reaching a designated exit. In these particular sequences, players aren't even provided with particular targets to assassinate that results in the gameplay resembling a generic shooter versus a Hitman game. Some sections feel eerily similar to the gameplay of IO Interactive's past Kane and Lynch series of games. The levels that do offer particular targets to assassinate and multiple routes in which to accomplish that task are the most memorable of the narrative and beg for multiple playthroughs.  Each playthrough of a level is continually scored based on each action taken by the player from killing civilians to being detected by patrolling enemies. The game has a way in which it wants the player to complete each level and any deviations result in the loss of points. Compared with recent games in the Hitman series, Absolution includes far too many linear paths and evade the police scenarios that result in an overall more restrictive experience.  The major change in the Hitman gameplay formula in Absolution revolves around the addition of the Instinct mode. Instinct in the game is displayed through a meter that regenerates overtime through various actions taken. There are a variety of uses that involve Instinct mode from scanning the environment for enemies and their movement, which is similar to the detective mode in Batman Arkham Asylum, to a quick shot kill system, which is similar to the mark and execute feature in Splinter Cell: Conviction. While both are not original concepts, they work exceptionally well in surveying the environment and when in difficult situations that require a quick takedown of multiple enemies.  The major aspect of Instinct mode that will cause some frustration with players is how it handles disguises. NPCs in the game can detect that the player is lying about their identity if wearing the same disguise, with the example that other police officers would be able to spot someone new in their ranks. To counter this, Agent 47 can either wear disguises that aren't of the same group of NPCs or use Instinct mode to hide their true identity. Unfortunately, Instinct mode when used for disguises drains at an alarmingly quick rate that makes it useful for only brief scenarios. In later levels, disguises feel completely useless when nearly all of the NPCs are of the same group and can quickly discover Agent 47.  Aside from the new Instinct mode and cover system, nearly all of the Hitman series basics return with the infamous fiber wire and dual Silverballer pistols. Along with a host of other weaponry from pistols and shotguns to rifles and explosives, Agent 47 has the ability to utilize various weapons and staged accidents located throughout levels. Makeshift weapons appear in the form of small objects like knives, hammers, and even bongs. While some of them aren't the most practical to use in combat situations, they serve as great alternatives to when a more specialized approach is required for a certain situation.  Following with the tradition of past games in the series, Agent 47 has the ability to utilize conveniently-placed staged accidents around the level that range from a hoisted car on a lift to food items that are ripe for poisoning. While some staged accidents are simple to put in motion, others require carefully-planned timing and execution to perform the perfect assassination. Absolution stays true to the Hitman series by continually providing players with a near endless amount of options in assassinating targets from going completely Rambo style to a more subtle approach with a knife stab in the back.  Levels completed in the campaign mode can later be played through in the Contracts mode that has players setting their own targets and selecting loadouts of unlocked disguises/weapons. The points earned in the both modes can be used to unlock additional disguises, weapons, and gun modifications ranging from silencers to extended clips. Contracts mode introduces the Hitman series first online feature in that the scenarios that players devise can be uploaded online for others to download and play. When creating a custom contract, players walk through a level and assassinate whom they wish and with what disguise and weapon they feel is right for the particular task. When the target eliminated, players then rush to an exit point to complete the level. With the level complete and statistics tracked for the time taken for both assassinating the target and reaching the exit, players can then proceed with uploading the contract for other players to compete in beating their score. Players that use the particular disguise and weapon that the creator did in their original playthrough will earn additional points when completing the contract.  Contracts mode seems to be the developer's answer to the restrictive campaign levels and escape from the police sections. The Contracts mode is clearly not the perfect solution for fans that were looking for similar gameplay from the previous Hitman game, but it's a step in the right direction considering that players can select their own disguise and weapon loadout. Contracts mode will be interesting to watch as more players upload their specialized combination of levels, targets, disguises, and weapon loadouts.  IO Interactive's Glacier 2 engine can be summarized with 1 word: stunning. From the massively-rendered crowds to the detailed interior/exterior environments, Absolution never ceases to amaze with visuals that beg to be set to max. Absolution debuts as the first real entry of the Hitman series in the high-definition era of gaming and succeeds at trumping nearly all of the current game releases. The sound effects and most notably the music succeed at impressing with loud and bold gunfire and mesmerizing classical scores. The soundtrack composed by Thomas Bärtschi fits the atmosphere of Absolution perfectly whether it may be a hectic gun battle or silent takedown.  Absolution marks a bold new direction for the Hitman series that focuses less on player freedom and more on telling a defined narrative. While the levels and poorly-implemented Instinct mode are sure to anger and frustrate fans of the series, Absolution still succeeds at providing an entertaining and most importantly, engaging gameplay experience that is difficult to put down until the credits roll. Both the expansive Contracts mode and stunning graphical overhaul help in overcoming the issues associated with the restrictive campaign levels.  ",

            "review_text": "Ok. Hardcore fans will be disssapointed that some stuff present in previous games are missing and that this game is more 'casualized'. They may be true, but this game has improved on some of the stuff in Blood Money and previous games. For example, two bodies can be dumped in bins and places to dump bodies can be now used to hide bodies in. Also a cover system, though not good, is introduced to the series.  Instinct can be used to highlight enemies, targets and objects of interest and for point shooting. Point shooting and blending in with a disguise drains the meter. Hardcore gamers and Hitman fans say Instinct makes the game too easy but that's not true. It replaces the map of previous games, which displayed a map of the area and all people, points of interest and VIPs. Instinct is similar but actually displays less information so the game is more challenging. Hardcore fans keep saying casuals will keep relying on it but I didn't use to advance through the game. I only used for fun and then reloaded to the last checkpoint.  The disguise system is probably what I disliked the most about the game. It seems like IO Interactive has gone backwards in the system. It is like Hitman 2, probably worse. If people in the same outfit 47 has sees him, they'll be suspicious of his disguise and the only way to blend in is to use Instinct. The developers just wanted to show off the new feature. The change of the disguise system is good but it is unrealistic how every cop in Chigaco would know every of their fellow policemen and how people can see through masks. Strangely, if 47 hides behind an object while wearing a disguise, someone in his outfit will not recognize him. It's also more suspicious to scratch a head or tip a hat when walking past someone in the same outfit than just pass by them. I thought developers were smart.  I loved the infiltration missions. They are a nice change to the series. Hardcore Hitman fans will be dissapointed though but there were infiltration missions in the first two games.  The dialogues are funny and made me feel like I was in the world that Absolution was portraying.  This game is a must buy. People keep saying that they didn't care about getting the best rating possible for every level because the game is so hard and they just shot threw the level. That's not true. I lack brain power but I didn't find it hard. My first play through was on Normal and then I moved to Hard. This game requires more thinking and planning than the first 4. Oh yes and for a few missions, improvisation.",

            "review_text": "Hitman: Absolution is quite difficult to review in my usual less-than-200-words. Let me put up front that I've truly enjoyed most Hitman games and Blood Money might even be one of the better games ever made. Let's start with the good: Absolution is great fun. Much like before, many ways and many possibilities leading to that one perfect kill. Contracts mode is a welcome addition, the graphics are smooth, the story is decent, the controls are fluid and there's a ♥♥♥♥load to do. Someone with OCD could easily spend 300 hours completing every single challenge. Overall it's a very good game, just not 100% a Hitman game.  Which brings me to the bad. Now, I don't really mind the new direction. Most new gimmicks work well and add a certain level of fun or depth to the game. But adding a Superman-like X-Ray vision feels wrong, whereas peeking through keyholes is no longer possible. Disguises are fairly ineffective and it is also no longer possible to 'clear' the area and do your thing, as there are respawns... or 'backup', as they like to call it. This does bite the 'do it your way' theory in the ♥♥♥, for stealth is the only viable option.  Also the game is not flawless. The checkpoint system is utter crap, as it doesn't save your progress properly - dumping you in a fully respawned map every time you load a checkpoint. Civilians 'spotting' you (hurting your score and possible challenges) after you've just saved them from a certain death is also the perfect gratitude. I've also had my loading screen freeze a dozen times now.   I'd like to put this one under the 'Max Payne 3 effect'. The game is awesome, but tends to forget what made us love its predecessors.   Long story short, it looks like Hitman, but doesn't play like Hitman. Therefore the emphasis is too much on stealth gameplay, often better comparable to Splinter Cell. In essence this is not a bad thing. Only to the die-hard fans, which I am not. For that I am not, I can forgive the developers for this new direction. In conclusion all I can do is praise the game: its very daring and -almost- really good.   The only true murderers here, are expectations.    + Fun, fun, fun + Possibly hundreds of hours of gameplay + Overall, a great game – just not very Hitman-like   - Bugs involving challenges are infuriating - Terrible checkpoint system - Less freedom - Small maps don't work so well - … not very Hitman-like  8.5/10",

Why one police officer decides to spend 20 seconds shining his flashlight at a wall, hoping to find an enemy bug, obviously, is beyond me. Sound design, espically weapon sounds are really poor. Shootouts (yeah sometimes a sneaking mission doesn't go as planned) outside or even indoors sound way underpowered. Guns don't have a nice 'pop' sound. No echoing indoors, either. When I think of high-quality weapon firing sounds I think of BF4.   I'm not all the way through the game, but these issues are repeating and I'm sure will continue on 'til the end.   Maybe I would have liked this game better if I played it when it came out.   And why when an enemy AI finds a body I didn't hide quick enough, tells his pals, they search around for a little bit, then go about their business is strange, too. I would expect them to freak out and go on high alert and exert some serious force and attention into finding anyone near by. And a way to clean up blood pools would be sweet, maybe just finding a rag lying around you can soak up blood with would be innovative. I've been in the 'blood pool found' phase way too many times.   Yeah I'm asking for too much, but this is what I was thinking when it was happening, instead of enjoying the game.   Visuals aren't too bad. Crowd mechanics are on Assassin's Creed level--respectable, but not really impressive. Everyone is the same height and moves exactly in the same manner. It doesn't matter how big the crowds are, no characters (excluding targets) had any character, personality or original ways of wondering through the enviorment.   The good: ehhh.... I know I'm being a hard-♥♥♥ here, and I am probably offending hard-core Hitman fans, which I apologize for. Enemy conversations are pretty funny, cutscenes are nice, story is not too bad, overall feel and atmosphere is respectable, performance is decent, graphics options are good, AA is powerful, controls are easy, strip club level was fun, etc.  However this game gets a thumbs down from me due to how many times it has taken me out of immersion and has made me say 'wtf' when watching a guard/cop/bad guy figure things out.   Playing so many games I do find that AI and lip-syncing are two issues that you see in almost every single game out there. I understand it's very challenging to program realistic AI, I can't imagine how hard it must be to code, and I do realize this game is a few years old, but knowing all of that it still constantly killed the emmersion for me and had me glancing at my phone to check Facebook when that stuff happened. Never a good thing.  I'll prob. try the new Hitman when it comes along.    peace",

            "review_text": "There's so much wrong with this game that I don't even know where to start. I'm failing to think of a single good thing about it. It's an all around failure and I've decided to just cop out on trying to review it. What is normally organized is instead going to be a rant, as much as I can force myself to type before uninstalling this thing.  Firstly, when I played through this, I just shot my way through every level to get it over with faster... because the stealth is completely broken and doesn't work at all. And when the stealth in your stealth game doesn't work, it's not very fun. I don't suggest you even bother with it. It made me wish I was playing CoD, something I never thought I'd say. After getting no where with trying stealth level after level, I just gave up on it and started shooting everyone the second the level loaded. To hell with the magic score box plaguing the top left of my screen.(Why the hell is that thing even there!? Who thought that was a good idea?! On by default, no way to turn it off!) No matter what you try to do, you WILL get detected, and then it will turn into a shooter anyway, so you may as well go ahead and start shooting. You get plenty of bullets from the levels over bloated with enemies, and your health regenerates on its own. But they couldn't even get that right because when levels start, the game takes away the guns/ammo you JUST HAD on you 5 seconds ago before you walked through a door. Really? Is this not an ancient design mechanic that we've long since retired? You're going to do that? Your professional Hitman decides that, for some reason, it'll be a good idea to drop most of his stuff upon going deeper into enemy bases. Logic! He also drops disguises and magically changes back to his worthless suit. Why the hell does he even wear that outfit? How are you supposed to blend in wearing a tux with a bald head and a big bar code on the back of it? Why would you 'not' already be in disguise when you show up in the first place? Has he ever heard of wigs, btw? Why isn't that bar code in a more secretive location... aka ANYWHERE else. This is like the worst spy you could create. He may as well carry a sign that says 'Top secret assassin. Shhh' He may as well have that on the back of his head too.  The story is a$$. It's all about some special chick, ONCE AGAIN.(ugh) At least she's not annoying and I don't have to have her attached to my hip the entire game(Bioshock Infinite), but come on, is she really the ONE and ONLY prototype they bothered to create that the plot must revolve around? But if there were more than 1, then the game wouldn't revolve around her. It really is lazy. I'm tired of these lazy plot devices in child form, it's like a carrot on a stick. Except it looks like a chick. It's a chick on a stick. For the plot of your video game. And are we really going to do this 'We're sorry but the princess is in another castle' level conclusions? I can't tell you how many times these levels ended, only to find out the girl wasn't there, she's over here, so, go over here, wait, she's not here either, go over there. All it was missing was a guy with a mushroom hat. Bioshock 1 and Dead Space 1 didn't have objectives to go from A to B this repetitive or uninteresting.  When you aren't doing this, then you are going after targets that the game yanked out its tophat that your character couldn't have known anything about. Who are these targets? No one is paying me to go after them. I've went rogue. How do I know them? How do I know they are important? There are so many times in this game where everyone, including NPCs, enemies, 47 himself, and objectives, all apparently read a script because they just 'know' things they couldn't possibly know. It's like watching Daredevil. I'm going over there, because that's where the script says the next fight is going to be. Yup. That's the logic here. It's similar to how everyone knows who you are because they read the script that tells them the difference between regular NPCs and the bald player they should shoot.  They couldn't even get the camera right, oh no, it's another over the shoulder console port... in a stealth game. This is already enough of a plague in shooters, but why the hell would you do this for a stealth game? Your character is constantly in the way. You have to constantly switch it from left to right or back to see around corners because the developers were too damn stupid to do it properly in the middle. They're telling YOU to fix it by changing it infinitely because they couldn't be bothered to just fix it up front. Why not just put me in the center, permanently? Then I wouldn't have to keep switching it to a side? DID YA THINK OF THAT? This game is a god damn mess, in every way I could have imagined. Deus Ex, first person, did stealth so much better. And first person isn't even an ideal way to do stealth. But they allowed you to see around corners the way this game should have done... even though it wasn't third person. The first person game did third person BETTER than your third person game. That's a special kind of fail. They couldn't even give us the option of putting the camera where it should be. You don't have the option for it, it's either left or right. You will be so tired of constantly switching this thing between left and right because they couldn't be bothered to give you a center option or some kind of auto switch from using cover or corners. Why doesn't it just move on its own when I use cover and approach a cover? No no no just make the player manually do it every time on every thing.  And disguises... I don't even want to talk about the disguise system in this game. It's so broken and pointless that, as I've said, you'll just soon give up on trying to make it work as it should and just instead shoot your way through the game. Really, don't bother. Just shoot everyone. Enemies that regularly wouldn't see you at all now see you when you put on a disguise. Wtf kind of sense does that make? I'm MORE obvious wearing a disguise than I was before? And I have to use up an energy bar to make the disguise do its job, which eventually runs out? Wha? It's a suit of clothes, not a magic potion or spell or gun that has ammo! You put on a suit, that suit should work, infinitely until you're detected. Newsflash: Clothes do not have ammo bars! Oh, I put on this cop outfit, but when it runs out of fairy dust ammo, it'll no longer disguise me against other cops. Ya, that makes sense. It's all kinds of messed up. I eventually gave up on bothering, and just shot my way through the game. I turned Hitman into Shoot em Up. Cus it worked better. Ironically, you're much better at shooting everyone than... not shooting everyone... in this stealth game. The game has good aim assist, enemies aren't too smart, plenty of ammo, health regen, medkits, and there's slow motion instant kill chains for groups. I would typically pick out a nice camp spot where enemies drove in only from the front, and then play duck hunt until the area emptied out. That's how I beat this game.  One last thing I feel I should get out there. I've read that if you were a fan of previous Hitman games, you'd hate this one, while if you're new to the series, you'll like it. Well, I've never played any of them, this is my first, and I still think this game is pretty damn terrible. My recommendation is to not go near it. So this is the end of my rant. It's the best I could do to review this. It's all they deserve. Time for me to uninstall and shed a tear for the 4$ I spent on this that could have bought me some good skittles instead. But I chuckle at the thought of suckers having paid a lot more for this crap in the past. Time to go back to living under the rock I lived under before I played any Hitman games. I now look back on it as being a comfy place.  THE END.",

            "review_text": "I write this review with a heavy heart. I was very excited for H:A, I even shelled out extra to preorder it. But I just uninstalled it after only a couple hours of gameplay, because I found myself just.... not wanting to play it.  I've played through all of the other hitman games, without ever looking for help online. For a good hitman game, get Hitman Bood Money (HBM). It's this one's predecessor and is much, much better in just about every way.  Pros: Fantastic graphics, I like the scoring system, too.  Cons:  There are so many. Let's start with the controls.   The controls suffer from horrible feature bloat. They added all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ to the game that I wuold rather not have.   For example, cover-based combat: 'Sneak' and 'take cover' use the same button, but when you 'take cover' you can't really move around much. There were many, many times where I wanted to sneak around, but I ended up getting stuck to a wall or couch or whatever and unable to move away from it because I had taken cover behind it. This gets aggravating really, really fast.  In HBM, to climb over an obstacle, you walk towards it, and possibly hit 'use'. Simple enough. In HA, you instead walk up to the object, take cover behind it, hold forward, hit use, and you vault over it. Way more cumbersome, way more annoying.  Combat is especially bad. They replaced hand combat with this screwed up quicktime events sequence. In order to knock someone out you have to hit 3 fast quicktime events, otherwise you go back to the start of the combat and do it again. You can do a loop of the first two quicktime events for literally forever. It just keeps looping Furthermore, if you happened to go within a few feet of a hostile, it goes into this quicktime combat mode and there is NO WAY OUT OF IT except to hit all the quicktime events. You can't even turn and run.  Normally, in a shooter, you'll have a 'look down sights' button to improve your accuracy. In HA they have two buttons. There's a 'look down sights' button and a 'REALLY REALLY LOOK DOWN SIGHTS I MEAN IT THIS TIME' button that you push after you push the first button.  Saving is no longer possible. Instead, there are automatic checkpoints in certain places, and levels are split into smaller, atomic parts. No longer do you have a big building to explore. You have tiny individual sections with no consequences between them.  Bins are EVERYWHERE for easy body disposal. Too easy.  There are cutscenes galore with no way to skip them  Health regenerates. Also too easy.  No map. No closing doors. No closing doors! It used to be so important for hiding ♥♥♥♥ to keep it behind a closed door, but now you have to wait like an idiot for the door to swing shut on its own.  Disguises no longer really work at all. You have to use this 'instinct' 'feature' that some poor programmer wasted his time on and some game designer thought was a good idea.  It seems to me that every change in this game makes sneaking a PAIN IN THE ♥♥♥ and running and gunning the clear, obvious choice.   Usually, in HBM, a level takes about 20-40 minutes to scope out, and another 20 to execute perfectly, no kills, never getting spotted, not leaving any evidence. The levels in this are way too easy. Example: There's a Chinatown level. Before you go in, a guy says 'He's got a nice car'. You walk into the map, walk straight, you get to a nice car. Next to it? A bomb.. Set off the car alarm, wait for target to walk up, set off bomb, target dead level over. Took me 5 minutes. I had already beaten the level in 2 minutes beforehand by going in and shooting him in the head and running out.... H'es right there in the middle and you can do that.   It completely throws away everything that made the previous games so much fun. There's no need to practice, learn routines,. There's no emergent behavior. There's no puzzle. It's dumbed down and a disappointment.  1/5",

I've tried repeatedly to like Absolution. I download it and play a few missions a couple times a year trying to get that feeling to shake off eventually. It's just not a good game, nothing here grips me like the others.  Firstly, it looks absolutely terrible. At first glance it's passable, but the more you look at it the more the hideous level design catches your eye. The further you go into the game the worse the level design gets. It's not just about corridor style layout, the actual visual design is just brutally 4th wall breaking. Every set piece looks like one of those one sided spaghetti western props. You can't unsee it after you notice how static and fake all the set pieces look. Even the original game didn't do world building this badly and it came out over 15 years ago. Even if this wasn't a severe, glaring issue, the level design itself is 0/10 stuff. I could have planned out better mission layouts on a napkin during a ♥♥♥♥ at the Wafflehouse restroom, there's no excuse for how bad the world is in this game from every angle.   Secondly, the melee combat is a nightmare. If an alerted NPC walks near you it just auto initiates these long QTE sections. No matter what's going on around you, you have to go through with these drawn out QTE battles. Spam Q until E pops, tap E, spam Q until W comes up, tap W and they're knocked out. That's the melee combat in this game. You're absolutely locked into it. There's no backing out of a fight, you can't run, you can't dodge out. And due to the actor density, generally you get zerged down by trigger happy thugs and die as soon as the melee fight starts. This is the worst combat I've ever seen in a game, let alone in a Hitman game. This system alone I would give this game a 0/10 even if everything else was perfect. It limits your playstyle severely, so much so that you can't initiate a fight at all with a large group of enemies since getting caught a melee fight with more than two enemies in the area is instant death. It makes you feel so frail and useless.",

Gone are the day where you can get the 'perfect' disguise and complete the mission with little resistance. Now every action takes a little more thought.   Each target comes with multiple way to execute, with an in game achievement system giving slight hints. The story is rather compelling for a Hitman game, making you actually care about 47 and his mission.   One issue I had is the point system for each mission. It made it feel like there was a right and wrong way to go about things. Where I believe it should be more difficult/less difficult options, not right/wrong. Though I personally like to play the more stealthy way, I know some like the run and gun and to see your score go deep into the negatives may take away from the fun. Still, this game is totally worth getting for the stealth action fan and even a good place to start with the genre. ",

On expert or the new purist difficulty it's almost impossible cause higher difficulty means more enemies, less help or even the hud will dissapear.

The only problem I have with it is the points system. The game prides itself for allowing the player to play how they want: Through stealth or guns blazing. The points system, however, downgrades you for being a noisy player. It often detracts from your level of immersion.

The gunplay is good, you can do all the basics like shoot, aim, and take cover. The steatlh works pretty well, you can use disguises like the other games, but the disguises sometimes make the level even harder, because other people with the same disguise as you will get suspicious, for example, you will be disguised as a Chicago cop and all the other cops will be suspicious of you, do all the cops in a huge city really know each other? There are many ways to beat each level which adds a lot of replay value. You have a choice of whether you want to stealth the game or just go in and shoot every son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ in your way, but the game punishes you for using the latter, which is kinda annoying sometimes. They tried to make the game more story-based, but the story is basically, this guy is bad, kill everyone he knows and loves. One cool thing in this game is Contracts mode. In Contracts mode you can go in almost any single-player mission and make your own contract out of it. You can make the obvjective to be to kill whoever you want in whatever way you want. Once you make the contract you can publish it online for other people to play and they can all compete to get the highest score. Overall the game is very good worth the money, even though it is not as good as the previous games in the franchise, it is worth playing whether you're a Hitman fan or not. Also there is a ton of DLC for this game but it ONLY works in Contracts mode, there is no single-player DLC. The DLC in my opinion is not worth it because it just adds a few weapons into Contracts mode. People usually don't make contracts that use the DLC items, and if you do make contracts with the DLC items, not many people will play it. Another thing I forgot to add is that if you are going for all the achivements, you will need to write down or try to remember which levels you've done on hard difficulty, because the game won't tell you.",

I personally haven't played Hitman Blood Money ( an older version of this game, and I am mentioning this cause a lot of gamers support that that game was tha bomb when it came to Hitman), but I definately recommend this game.

My preferred method of clearing each level wasn't by obtaining the poison in the invisible laser alarm room and adding it to the target's food. I believe these were your signature kills- kills where it is impossible to tell it was an assassination. Something went wrong, food was bad, maybe a faulty chandelier fell, you know, those types of accidents. No, no... My preferred method of beating the level was scorched earth- I would blow up and kill every last combatant on the level. Hell, on the early China Town level I was blasting away chefs with a sniper rifle. IT WAS A BLAST. The only downside to going all shoot-em-up is there can be a lot of bad guys and they can put a lot of holes in you. Some levels I was able to literally run from the start to the finish and just ignore all the bad guys (Warehouse level with the Agency SWAT looking goons).  Overall fun game, I don't have the patience to sit there and wait for patrols and try to perfectionist every level, so yeah, guns a blazing!",

After jumping through graphics hoops to play, I see that Hitman Abs. has a terrible story, cringe-inducing character archetypes, and boring levels. Some elements were welcome like the improved blown cover reactions, but others like the suspicions made the game look dumb. Even when you're diguised people will catch you, so you still end up having to hide behind cover and sneak around. What's the point of a disguise if it can't disguise you? The levels are a huge step down from Blood Money: Where as BM had interesting locations like French opera anc Chilean jungle, Abs. only offers a dusty 50s town, some dark Chicago alleyways, and an orphanage where the bad guys massacre all the nuns and caretakers (Yeah, really dismayed me and I'm not easily fazed.) the levels are also more restricting than Blood Money in terms of choosing how to solve problems, and the constant scoring of your actions is very very annoying. Having levels so tied to the story made them uninteresting repetitions of each other and does a huge number on replayabaility.   I did my hardest to not compare this to Hitman: Blood Money because everyone does but I'm going to have to say it: Blood Money is easier for graphics to handle, the controls and AI are simpler, the levels are much more interesting, and despite being from 2006 it's graphics still look fine. It's stories are better and don't get in the way of the game, and it feels more like James Bond than... whatever the hell this was supposed to be, as bad as the Hitman movies?",

At least if you, like me, play for perfection. You can kill 1,000 guards with 1,000 headshots just as easily as in the old games.  The new engine really helps this game along. So much that it actually makes stealth play a lot more fun than in previous games.  Observing the situation and trying to determine what special costumes or special level events that could be used for what is almost never an option, and when they are, they complete the level super easy and way too quick. No thinking required, just find an object that highlights as something super obvious and could be named 'Click here to complete the level' instead of something so non-obvious as 'Fugu'.  Some levels are like the old games, you're the hunter and you have your prey. These missions sadly do not really fit into the storyline and feels like someone added them to not have the whole game being a remake of &lt;Insert any military stealth title here&gt;.

The stor is same as in all parts and exactl what a Hitmanfan like to get ! The gameplay is the best i ever sa in a Hitman game and if someone says some else, its his problem, for me its great.

What you will find is an intense, but fun, stealth focused game with sharp mechanics and gameplay. There is some fun to be had replaying the game by boosting the difficulty after your first play through. Be warned about the checkpoint system because it is brutal. Don't be surprised if you find yourself restarting a mission because you've made a minor mistake.",

(Blood Money was released in the early life of the 7th generation) As such you can probably guess what gameplay and graphics are like.  Graphics  do  improve if you have a higher spec graphics card (but won't be anything like 8th generation games). In fact, cutscenes rendered by your own machine will look much better than pre-rendered cutscenes.  Gameplay is rather intuitive, although AI can be a bit dopey at times. You must proceed along areas where the objective is mostly to pass through an area undetected, using disguises and distractions to aid you. When the game finally does get you to eliminate targets, things get interesting. You can make things look like an accident and watch as the NPCs are shocked and scared, or you can take firm action and garrot, stab, bludgeon, shoot or blow up your target either quietly or as loud as you can get. The game's focus on stealth does sometimes fail itself, as certain missions are next to impossibe to complete quietly and would require you to go loud to take out as many hostiles as possible.  As a third person shooter, it's relatively solid, but as I've said the stealth can sometimes fail and going loud won't be an option. NPCs can't see you at a cetain distance, but can see you if you're garroting a guard or otherwise. Certain actions will raise suspicion, others will not. Crouching is considered suspicious, as is running and so is pressing up against a wall.  The story of the game makes little sence and often involves elements which have probably been thought of by some deviant at IO Interactive (I am referencing the Agency BDSM nuns with one RPG to share, and other weird stuff), but that's not really why you're playing a  Hitman  game.  The contracts feature does bring the game back to its firm grounding where it's as simple as just eliminating a target in the best way possible.",

Soundtrack was epic and on point for building that level of tension and dread, scripting was humorous at times, and lackluster at others.

The things that truly make all of the Hitman series games great are the precision executed kills, the disguise abilty, and the art of the stealth assassin are all here, and the replay value not only in attempting all the ways you might achieve victory, but also with the incredibly fun Contracts mode, is there as well.",

Understandable, but it doesn't make this a bad game.  Gameplay: Forget sandboxes. If you're not too picky about body count, there are myriad ways to off the bad guys in any preferred path you take, but for those aspiring for zero non-target kills there's really just one road made out for yer that lets you through unnoticed.   Imagine a particularly difficult piece of music, where a bar of notes may take about an hour or so to moderately master. Once you do get it, you start with the next bar, equally difficult, but still practicing the first bar before you move on. THAT'S what getting through this game feels like. You'll practice again and again, often getting frustrated after awhile but once you mastered the parts it feels like a real expert sneaking in and out inches from peril. I counted 1265 enemy alerts by the end on the game statistics, but on record it's zero. Practice makes perfect.  What I found to be a con was the checkpoints system, but for different reasons than most of the negative reviews: Once you restart the checkpoint, your weapons cache is reset, and the non-targets that you've subdued(or killed) will be back. It's mostly a position checkpoint, not much more.  If you don't find learning and memorizing levels in the way of items placement and guard movement a fun challenge, skip this. Otherwise it's a very engaging title. I know coz my wife will start nagging on how much time I spend gaming.",

            "review_text": "Agent 47 doesn't begin Hitman: Absolution with amnesia, but the six years that have passed since we last took control of him in Blood Money do seem to have dulled his creators' recollections of what made him so popular in the first place. Hitman: Absolution is a slick, responsive and mechanically confident game - and on occasions it's one of the most satisfying stealth games in a year that already includes Dishonored - but a range of compromises to Hitman tradition mean it's still going to rub some people up the wrong way.  Hitman is a simple concept: someone gives you a target, or targets, and you take them out. The genius of it is the way the designers let you do that. It's not just about deciding whether to sneak past people or get into a gun-fight - it's about slowly tracking the movements of people through large environments and observing the ways you can manipulate them and their surroundings to bring about their downfall. Perhaps you place explosives where you know they'll wander, or maybe you arrive just in time to nudge them over a railing into a deserted alleyway, and often you do all this dressed in borrowed clothes that conceal your identity from all but the most detailed investigation.  Hitman: Absolution includes all of that stuff, and on the higher difficulty levels it leaves you to figure a lot of it out on your own. You sneak or roam in disguise through police stations, courthouses, dilapidated mob-run hotels, maize-covered farmland, factories and science labs, teasing out details about your target from overheard conversations and useful objects left on shelves or in poorly guarded rooms. Then you formulate a plan and try to pull it off. If you're new to the series or just a bit rusty, you might begin by simply trying to find a few moments alone with your target and your trusty fibre wire, but before long you're on the lookout for more elaborate and creative executions: self-immolation, industrial accidents, tainted drugs and the sudden, unexpected failure of previously reliable overhead rigging.  Feeling your way into these unusual scenarios is surprisingly comfortable thanks to robust controls and clear rules about how things work. Movement and cover systems match the fluent standards of modern third-person games, crowds and guards only find you suspicious if you're behaving that way, disguises don't work on people wearing the same get-up, and crates, cupboards and dumpsters can hold two bodies, one of which can be you. A new Instinct system (heavily regulated on higher difficulties) allows Agent 47 to see the movements of NPCs and targets through walls and highlights interactive objects in the environment, while allowing you to briefly evade detection by people who would otherwise see through your disguise. It refills when you perform actions that the game's scoring system considers admirable, like hiding bodies from sight.  The scoring system - how nice to play a big game in 2012 that gives you a score at the end of each level, by the way - encourages creative solutions and sort of discourages extracurricular murder, although it's a mischievous companion, and many of the optional objectives in your notebook hint at ways you might consider dispatching your target's entourage as well as him or her. It's impossible to complete all these tasks in a single play-through - you can't exactly wear every available disguise in a level and play through it only dressed in your agency suit, for example - and they can be ignored if you prefer to remain utterly undetected and only lay hands on your assigned victim.  There are plenty of times in Hitman: Absolution when all these systems come together in ghoulishly delicious harmony. Stalking through a cornfield dressed as a scarecrow, picking off machine-gun-toting goons and then stringing yourself up on a wooden frame to hide in plain sight; dropping a heavy piano lid on the head of a musically curious henchman without anyone noticing; distracting policemen by leaving a cash-filled safe open in a busted drug den; or turning the tools of several mad scientists' trade against them in gruesomely hilarious ways. Played as a kind of grimly amusing series of cautionary tales where you skulk through the shadows implementing the caution, Absolution is enormous fun.  ",

The gameplay and graphics are very good, even at Normal setting. Overall, Hitman: Absolution is a really good game.   So, I played it with a keyboard, and some of it with a controller (at least enough to get the feeling). The keyboard is, as you might expect, the best way to play it, but the controller isn't to just be ignored as if it's crap; it's not. It's a solid way to play the game, and if you prefer using controllers, go ahead and use it. Anyway, I got this game for Christmas from a friend who gave me about 18 other games.

I recommend this game if you liked the previous Hitman games, sneaking games, or action games (if you're like me and decided to play it the unintended way just because).

Better than Thief, Dishonored, Assassin's Creed even.  The replay value is very high for this game. Each level has numerous challenges to complete/unlock meaning good motivation to play them again and again. Add to that, there are numerous ways to carry out the tasks or assassinations. There is also a points system so if you like you can even challenge yourself again to get the high score. Finally there are 5 difficulty levels, the purist being the hardest. The name purist even suggesting that it is the best way to really play it.  If you are like me then you can happily spend 30 minutes just planning out each step perfectly before executing it. So the game allows you to plan and strategize like you want to. It doesn't feel like the design offers you just two set paths and try call that diverse options.

Its just getting to point B from point A in different ways unlike the previous Hitman games were you are given a map and objectives and you do it your own way.

When looked at in isolation it is a decent game and I beleive it is more friendly if you are new to the Hitman franchise than the other ones.

Its a great game, all the caracters are amazing, the gameplay is fun, graphics are very good. And its a pretty long game aswell with infinite ammounts of replay value in the form of player created contracts mode.   Its also a very frustrating game, the AI is pretty random wich is a very big point in stealth games. For example I throw a bottle to distract some guards that are standing next to eatchother. One guard hears the bottle breaking and goes to investigate while the other didnt notice a thing. The next time I do it both guards notice. Its very frustrating. When you try an plan your actions and the AI responds different every time. I can try for 30 minutes to get past a couple of guards before I snap and just shoot everyone. There is also A LOT of sexualisation in this game against women. Every woman has large breasts and pretty much gets treated bad by the strong male caracters who are pretty much doucebags all of them.  As far as I understand there are no alternative endings. I would be cool to see that as a reaction of how many people you killed etc. Just like the caos system in dishonored. It would also be cool if you could decide your targets fate instead of just killing them in a clever way. (Just like in dishonored)  Anyways its a great game if you want around 15-20 hours of stealthy action. If it goes on 50%-75% sale be sure to pick it up!

I thought the story was simple enough to follow and done well enough that it did not bother me to watch it. Infact, my favorite part of the game was a cutscene with Lenny and Hitman in the desert. I'll leave it at that but the way Hitman converses reassures his psychopathy, as well as his professionalism.  The missions were fun, and I'll admit some quite challenging for me. There were a few I had to ragequit and come back later to finish. While those can be annoying to encounter it was refreshing to see 'Normal' mode could even challenge me something a lot of games lack.  The point system I do not understand in this game. I got a lot of negatives for simply killing everything and while it didn't seem to prevent anything I noticed from happening like it seemed to be discouraging to constantly get negative points even when the game provides stuff (such as hide chests) to store multiple bodies in. Like I said though, luckily it doesn't hamper gameplay (except on the final mission).  While I enjoyed this game quite a bit to be honest and couldn't quit playing a few things did annoy me to no end. When getting to a next level and stopping you're forced to re-watch the cutscene without the ability to skip it (that I could find). This is irritating in any game. I was also not impressed with the inability to pick our weapons for missions. I would of liked to do some with the sniper rifle and what not and I thought it would of been more realistic if we got to pick our weapon for a job. Speaking of jobs -- the game had to much randmo junk and hardly enough actual assassinations. I enjoyed the missions but I expected a bit different.  The combat system is pretty great. I like the flexable nature of leaning against objects. And who doesn't love throwing a screwdriver or knife in to someones head or neck from afar. Although I would of liked more animations for stabbing people as the two (or three) it had were good but I am bloodthirsty.  Overall I was rather impressed with the game for what I paid. As always, price is a huge factor in ones expectations and what not so if this is on a decent sale IMO you won't go wrong, even if you never played the other games in the series. From what I read on the forums some don't like this game at all. I am unsure what game they were playing.",

I pre-ordered this game for $60 after playing through Hitman: Blood Money because I was so enthralled with the concept of being, well, the hitman! There's just something about being given a contract case, studying the contents within, memorizing the face of your target, studying maps, and choosing the right weapon for the job. I need to maneuver my way through a riverboat to get to my target? Better stick with an mp5 - silenced. Need to assassinate the bridegroom during a wedding? Better handle it at a distance with the W2000 - silenced.  None of those things that I mentioned I loved from the previous game were in Absolution, which is part of why I was so disappointed with the title. Sure, the graphics of this game are more than a few notches above blood money, but the feeling of being the contract killer just isn't there. It feels like a Max Payne title with more (or less, depending on your play style) sneaking.  Although I'm disappointed with this installment in what was otherwise an absolutely wonderful series, I can understand why the game is the way it is. Agent 47 is an old dude. He's been taking contracts for over 10 amazing years, and it can't be easy with age. I just recommend thinking about this game as about Agent 47, and the relationship he built with Diana. The game requires a little less thought than the previous ones, but it still makes for a decent playthrough.  I highly recommend playing the previous games first.",

If you want you can try to only take out the targets supplied. Doing so does make the game a lot more difficult, though, since most disguises are lifted off of people you kill/subdue. Having a disguise helps you sneak past enemies (granted that they aren't the same kind of person you're wearing the disguise of).  There are also quite a few environmental kills. If you watch an enemy you can notice patterns and the game will suggest ways to kill them so it looks like an accident. These are also a blast, but require more thought and time than just sniping the enemy.  All in all, though the game is very fun. A++",

Each way has its advantages and disavantages, as per usual. But the really strong point of this game, for me, is in it's replay value: each mission that you complete in a certain way, wether it be killing only your main mission targets and hiding the bodies, or bomb-rigging a car to blow up in the middle of the street, is rated and you're given points. These points, in turn, unlock new weapons and abilities for your Hitman character. You end up doing the 'same' mission, over and over, to try and explore all the ways that you can complete it. Even though it's the same map and objectives, the fact that you can have loads of utterly different aproaches, and that you want to unlock those really cool silencers for your favourite weapon, will have you mastering each map, without a feeling of repetition. Best Hitman I've played since Hitman 2 (mention of Hitman: Contracts is forbidden near my gaming rig, lest it crumble in tears due to it have run such an ill-delivered game.)    I still haven't explored the Contracts section of Hitman: Absolution, but it allows you to fulfill contracts made by other players all across the world, and make your own Contracts for other players to try and match your skill! For example: if you can cross a map without allerting anyone, dressed as a samurai and killing up to three targets that you designate with a katana, you can turn all of those instances into mission objectives for the Contract that you create, so that other players can match it. Sounds fun? Let's try it out!",

The game is all about being the silent assassin, you can simple start shooting people up, but that will discount a lot of your score. With that in mind the game is amazing, the possibilities, which are many, to kill the targets make the game fun and different every time you play. So about gameplay i will give a 9 of 10. Some minor glitches and stupid AI(Sometimes you can fool them very easily) took this point out.  The graphics, ambience and the feeling of 'wow' are mindblowing. When you enter chinatown and realize that all those people arent sprites you smile. So for graphics and cinematics an Easy 10.  Music in this game isnt SO noticeable, idk if its on purpose or not...but sometimes the lack or the 'common' music made me bored. So i will just give a 6 for this.  Storyline is cool, simple and sometimes vague, but isnt bad. Of course you cant expect from this non-rpg kind of game eons of tales and sidequests, but for the game purpose the story is a 8 of 10.

The game consists mostly of gritty environments and gives you various ways to kill your target and clean-up after yourself so it was good in that respect.  Graphics: This game has pretty nice graphics. I played it maxed on a GTX 780 and it ran very good.  Audio: The audio was done very well in this game. Proper 7.1 support -- I like.

Yes, I can enjoy the more linear levels, as opposed to the sandbox ones. Both have their advantages: the sandbox allows you to be more creative, but it can be very overwhelming, especially if you have to reset. Ah, there we go. Resetting. I have one problem with this game. Not the disguise recogtnition system - which is a very nice and realistic idea they unfortunately couldn't get around without the instinct system. Not the instinct itself: 47 covering his face with a cap might look stupid, but managing that resource bar is another layer of strategy, even if an exploitable one(it's easy to quickly tap into the instinct when you're about to get recognized and watch as your watcher's suspicion indicator resets); point shooting, on the other hand, seems unecessary - it's not the kind of game where I should be shooting a room full of people, which is a shame because 47's Silverballers look so cool they are begging to be used. - but it's there and it looks cool, if you want to use it; the highlighting key elements is useful in telling apart what's scenery and what's a potential deathtrap. No, my problem is with the scoring system. It's what turns this game from a fun, if slightly limited - would say, not entirely without reason, the Blood Money enthusiasts -, sadistic workshop into an exercise of trial-and-error frustration in search of one of the optimal methods the developers designed into the level. No more of the free approach 'I'll have that guard chase me into the garage, climb out by the roof and get into the door he was guarding' stuff. You get spotted, you mess up in a tiny way, and you have that negative score jeopardizing your whole run, regardless of how well or how brilliantly you manage to contain or even take profit from the situation. Instead, you reload your checkpoint and try to search for that one air duct the level designer put somewhere that will coincidentally end up somewhere the AI is programmed to trigger an event... say, lighting a cigarette near some convenient gas pump. It's less about creativity, more about finding the optimal solution, which, as far as I know, is not what this series was ever about. Maybe I want to use a silenced sniper to kill patrols, knocking their bodies off a bridge? Well, shame on me, 'cause my score will never reach my friend's, who preferred to go for the Silent Assassin bonus.Why should I be punished for using the many tools the game gave me to kill? Instead, it will slap my hand and make me shimmy from the edges around said bridge if I ever want to go for a good score. I don't even want to explore to find alternative methods(some of which are mind boggling, if funny. Rigging a power line so a guy gets shocked while ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Scattering a wrestler's guards by stealing his... teddy bear?), I just want to find the first solution that will get me through the level. As for the story... yeah, it isn't great. It's cliché, it's predictable in 95% of its run. I do, however, enjoy how it provided an opportunity for 47 to be portrayed as a more humane, relatable character, even if sometimes he would make me bang my head on my desk. Showing your face in front of a crowd before snapping the neck of your target? I thought we were going for the subtle and unnoticed approach.  It's not a bad game, don't get me wrong. I had fun with it. Getting through the levels is fun, especially when I could manage to explore without setting off some score penalty. But there was a whole lot of frustration about trying to figure out and execute a puzzle in its most perfect details, not about exploring and coming up with a plan I would adapt on the fly. Again, not a bad game, just one that went the opposite way of my expectations.",

The stealth aspects are fun and generally not frustrating. You can disguise as different people to get to certain places unnoticed, you can hide bodies, etc. Most levels have several different very creative ways to get through them. You could just shoot your mark, but maybe you'd like to poison their sushi? The graphics are good, the voice acting is great, the plot is fairly straightforward - it might have been better or worse if I knew some history of the Hitman games, but as a newcomer, it worked. It took me about 12 hrs to beat, but there is tons of replay value. Fist, every level has mutliple ways to beat it, with little mini awards for each. Then there are several difficulties which change the gameplay significantly - for example on easy you can go into 'super spy no one can see me' mode unlimited. Finally there are 'contracts' which are mini levels created by other players... Think 'HORSE' in basketball, but with assassinations. Great game, def worth checking out when on sale.",

Even more replayability is added by the challenges in each level, and then the online contracts made by your friends and other people that you can participate in. Aside from the occasional glitch here and there, and sometimes a bit of screen tearing, Hitman Absolution is a game that I can easily recommend to anyone who is a fan of the Hitman franchise and just stealth games in general 8.5/10",

In most previous Hitman games you had an open area to work with and the simple goal of killing the target with whatever approach you chose. In this game the focus is more on the set-up - getting past security and navigating ostacles between you and the target. It also cares about style, making the kill in different ways. It's like Dishonored, if Dishonored had less story and more restrictive levels, but those levels are short enough to encourage repeat playthroughs right away to try and get closer to 'full completion'.  Very pretty game and a rather generic story. The levels so far have felt very believable, with reasonably human-like behavior from NPCs and entertaining overheard conversations between guards. If you like the approach of 'let me try again, but this time poison his food instead of making him explode', you might enjoy this game. If you blast through levels to get to the end , the game's design will disappoint - the foes aren't generally challenging enough and the shorter level design means your game will end quickly (and probably be unsatisfying, since some levels end with the killing happening in a cutscene).",

The game plays into this well, giving you a wide array of disguises in each level that fit into the scene, bringing you closer to the hitman's world. Speaking of wide array, everything is a 'wide array' in this game. There are multiple ways to kill your target in each level, and some of them get really creative making this the most exciting Hitman game ever. Weapons aren't too shabby either: you get a nice selection that stays true to what you would want/expect in a Hitman game. There is a scoring system too if you are into that, or just want to challenge yourself or compare with friends.  The best part of this release, is how well it runs. I had this game on Xbox 360, and played it when it was free on PS3. The PC version runs great, silky smooth with great textures, lighting and controls.

If you've never played another one before, it'll probably feel awesome playing it.  It has a decent story and the graphics are nice, but coming from having spent years playing all the other games as they were released, I can't say I'm necessarily pleased with where Square Enix is taking the franchise.  Personal peeves: The ease with which people wearing the same type of outfit as you can see through your disguise. This makes even less sense when you're wearing a disguise that covers your entire body and about half of your head and face. 'Instinct' drains very, VERY quickly when being used to blend in, which made me feel like the game was promoting more of a stealth-based Splinter Cell or Metal Gear type of gameplay. In all of the other Hitman titles, guards could see through your disguise--provided you were acting like a lunatic, or carrying weapons not befitting your outfit. That said, they didn't have some preturnatural sixth sense to just say 'Hey, that guy's not one of us!'. When you're dealing with massive areas and dozens upon dozens of employees in a specific outfit, there's no real way that every single person could pinpoint you as being out of place that quickly. Wasn't a fan of the pretty much forced stealth based, take cover behind every object you can gameplay when that has traditionally not been how the games play out.  Aside from that, my only other real complaint is the level layouts. I can't really explain it without making it sound too confusing, but I found the level layouts to be really different from the other games in the series and didn't like the way that felt.  So that's it. I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥ing because it wasn't like the other games. It was good enough for me to give a full play-through of, and still a fun game besides that, so I recommend it despite my own issues. Enjoy!",

            "review_text": "This is a difficult review. I don't usually finish games, so generally to get to the end they must have something that grabs me.  I remember playing the first few Hitman games and enjoying them enough, so seeing an improved new version on Steam I bought it on an Eidos sale.  I finished the story mode for Hitman:Absolution and one of the core reasons was that there was something that drew me back. However overall it's not enough for me to recommend the game, or to want to play it again. Essentially I just ended up grinding it out.  Pros: 1. Graphics and audio. Reasoonably well done. A little too much bloom, and the cutscenes are jarringly sub-par compared to the in-game graphics but nonetheless it looks the Hitman part. For the record, I have a medium rig. 2. Some of the Gameplay. I think when it works, this was the games strongest point. When playing in crowds or having lots of easily accessible hiding spots Hitman was quite enjoyable. Not unlike watching a guilty pleasure B-grade action movie.  Cons: - When it doesn't work though. OMG then it's obvious; 1. Cutscene story inconsistency - what's the point of being a super-assassin (the story says you are), and playing like one (making sure not to make stupid mistakes), when the protaganist just throws it out the door at every cutscene? It was like a slap in the face whenever he kept making rookie mistakes and then you, have to get him out of the predicament. 2. Recon - Ugh. So I said that it had areas that worked. But overall, it was just bad. Instead of being able to survey the location, choose the best option(s) available and to prepare (with costumes, weapons etc) you were simply just dumped at the beginning of each location in full assassin uniform glory.  3. Disguises - So you can grab a disguise, that's great! Problem is that the second you do this, any NPC who have the same uniform are onto you. So you spend more time hiding from them. (also, can't he afford a wig or beard?). Which leads me to; 4. NPCs - The game makes you spend all of your time hiding out of the line of sight of any NPC. They just have a preset walking path (you can see that from your flames of hell vision) and all you end up doing is trying to walk between these paths. What's the point of disguises or stealth then? In addition any NPC that catches you, immediately notifies everyone else. How can that be? Wouldn't some NPC (like janitors) be slower to do that? Wouldn't they need to actually take the time to call someone (not just a generic soundbyte while you're strangling them).  5. Dumping bodies - So, you can hide bodies in lots of containers and boxes around the locations - but what ever happened to just being able to hide them in dark areas that NPC don't walk through? If you don't hide them in a box, then they're always found. In addition, if I'm an assassin and I make an NPC bleed, can't I mop up the blood instead of leaving evidence? 6. Control - The amount of times I pressed the wrong button or my character did the wrong thing was way too numerous. Hold Y for this, but press Y for that, Hold A for this, but press A for that. Why make it so convoluted? And when it's such a fine line in getting the timing right. This got really frustrating fast. 7. Agent 47's voice - OK not such a big one, but still I didn't like it. I never really liked his voice originally but now it really doesn't seem to match with what he looks like. No hate at the actor, more just the older articulate voice was mismatched with the bald angry so and so. Especially when I'm used to seeing Michael Chiklis, Jason Statham, and Bruce Willis where their voices actually match their looks.  So the whole game just feels like you're constantly waiting for an NPC to pull the trigger on you. What kind of stealth game is that? There should be an element of getting caught but not to that extent (and maybe only in more difficult levels). If I was a real assassin wouldn't I be good at this by now? My disguise solid enough not to draw any attention because I'm great at not standing out?   I'm really hoping that the next iteration will play more out like a proper recon game. Something like GTA V heists as the right way to pull a job. So you get to check the place out first and determine entry points. You then get to get (steal?) the devices and uniforms you need, and finally you then have to pull the job.",

I can still remeber playing Hitman: Codename 47 on my ancient CRT. Unfortunately, Absolution deviates from everything the prior installments did right. Your freedom is resricted (in comparison to the excelent Blood Money), and your range of options is limited. The story is half-baked, (but to be honest, Hitman has never had good stories), disguises seem to make you MORE conspicuous (at least to those wearing the same clothing as you, they all suddenly get Eagle Vision) and there is no save feature, aside from some scantily scattered checkpoints (causing a ton of repetition if you die). Each level basically gives you an exit and tells you to get there... so why the heck do I enjoy playing it? Maybe it's the crisp visuals, (the cutscenes are still horrible), or the decent shooting. Maybe it's the thrill of pulling off a clever disguise, sneaking past a group of guards by using some C4 you happened to find in a safe you cracked, or of silently non-leathally eliminating every guard in a room to get to your 'objective' (usually a door). The pre mission loadout system has been stripped away, so what you can do in a level is basically up to whatever the devs left lying around. But something about this makes it fun, such as figuring out a clever way to assassinate your target (assassination objectives are very rare, but always fun). I'm not sure. In any case, Hitman purists should steer clear, but if you have money burning a hole in your pocket and are looking for a decent ride, consider this.",

Gameplay is pale in comparison to the older games and the idea of 'Instinct' is just plain ridiculous. However, if you are a true fan of Agent 47 then it is your sworn duty to play the rest of the games.  But, if you have never played one of the Hitman games and are just looking for a fun game to play then I would recommend either waiting for Hitman 6 or playing one of the old ones.

You might be wondering how I got 90 hours of gameplay, well the thing is there are multiple ways of assassinating the targets, there are many possibilities of how you execute your targets from going in loud and dumb to going in undetected like a ghost. The story is okay, felt pretty plain to me, the story lacked something unique/unforgettable, but ITS OKAY. The stealth is GOOD. Gameplay is GOOD. Sounds and graphics are GREAT. Agent 47 is a BADASS. It is REPLAYABLE. I'd rate it a 7.5/10.",

However, like every game, it has its flaws (which may just be my own personal opinion) but here we go!  Pros: The ability to enter the area and slaughter everyone in interesting ways. With plenty of ways to start a mission, it makes the game very replayable. Killing guards and other enemies is also optional, leaving the game open to plenty of playstyles.   A large arangement of weapons to take out anyone in your path. From a simple switch blade to a high powered sniper rifle and everything in between, there are plenty of ways to clear out the mission area.   Vast amount of ways to complete the same objective. It adds to the replay value, since not only are there differnet ways to enter certain areas, theres also plenty of ways to do the same objective. Sure you could just shoot your target outright infront of everyone, but would you rather poision his cocaine and watch him snort up his own death?    Cons:  THE SCORING SYSTEM. Honestly, this thing gets my panties in a bunch. When I think of Hitman, I think of someone who is supposed to literally clean house discretly and professionally. Instead we have to march around constantly changing disguises and either NOT killing anyone who isnt our target, or just passifying them and then hiding their body. Sure this is where the opinion thing comes in, but there arent many games like Hitman where you can just kill everyone without consequesnces. Dishonored may seem that way, but it has one of those 'hidden endings until you beat the game' endings. Thief can be a little like hitman, with the stealth element. However killing is 100% optional and so is knocking out the guards. Assassins Creed could fufil my lust for an endless slaughter, however I like the professionalism of Hitman. I suppose Im just a hard to please person, but either way. The scoring system is just an annoyance in the long run as I feel like Im being watched. Judged for my playstyle, if I ended the level with a negative score I feel like I didnt do the game justice. If I end with the highest positive score I feel like ive played the game I shouldve played it.   Conclusion: I personally love this game, Ive played it roughly 4 times over from start to finish. However the scoring system seems to hustle me to do everything to the games liking, not to how I really truly want to play the game. With it being a review from a simple minded gamer I dont expect many to see this review as 'helpful' but to just see me rant a little.   All in all, Id give this game an 8/10.   ",

To start off, the gameplay is still similar to Blood Money's where you are mostly given multiple ways to take out your targets. It also has key features such as stealth, disguises, and body physics. Sadly the disguises is where the game falls the most. Disguises still act as disguises, but every guard seems to be able too see through the disguise after a few seconds, and the only way to walk in front of one is to use 'instinct' to blend in for a bit longer. The new instinct system is pretty interesting, but it forces you to spend waaay more time hiding. The game's story is a huge improvement from the rest of the series. The story is more in depth and I like how it focus the levels around it. Last would be the graphics which are stunning. There was a lot of work put into the graphics and every texture, model, and whatnot just look great. So all together I would defineatly recomend Hitman Absolution. It may not be as great as blood money, but that doesn't mean this is bad or not worth playing.",

Hitman: Absolution doesn't fail to meet those same expectations as Contracts; in fact, it exceeds those expectations by adding more key features.

            "review_text": "Hitman: Absolution (HA) looks pretty, but the gameplay is a bit different then previous Hitman games. If you played all the previous titles in the series as I have, you will begin to miss the open-sandbox effect of levels, as well as being able to choose your weapons before a mission. HA only has a few big levels, while others are quite small and seem more to me like filler rather than an actual level. HA tries to make it seem as if there are more levels to make up for this, but even bigger levels are cut up into different smaller areas. I also feel the need to mention that the levels are very linear. They are open-world to a point and the game pretty much holds your hand if you choose to use Instinct Mode (Think Eagle Vision from Assassin's Creed). A way around that is that you can either turn a lot of the features of Instinct Mode off. or just opt for the extremely hard Purist difficulty where all HUD elements are removed and all your are left with is a crosshair.  This game does have it's memorable moments as with the other games including a few funny accidents, but it just doesn't strike me as a proper Hitman game due to the more story driven approach. All in all, I still would recommend this to someone for what it is if they're looking for a stealth game to play. Overall, I would recommend just getting the newer 2016 Hitman game as it's more in line with previous games.",

            "review_text": "The best in the franchise, Hitman: Absolution brings Agent 47 into a streamlined, satisfying league of his own. Others may sing paeans to Blood Money's non-linearity and Silent Assassin's score (both series highs, respectively), but Absolution boasts the most responsive and satisfying gameplay. The cover-based stealth and multiple discrete mission paths recall the excellent Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and part of the fun of each level is following the breadcrumbs the designers left for players to find and act on - the gun shop level, Birdie's Gift, is an outstanding example. The story comprises the black ops pulp and stereotypes we've come to expect from the franchise, though it's all presented impeccably. Chuckle-worthy black humor abounds, even if it stoops to juvenile levels on occasion.  No, Absolution's not perfect. The score system can at times be infuriating: it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that you get a 'Spotted' malus while firing multiple bullets through an isolated guard's faceplate. And without getting into major spoilers, the game inexplicably reverses wodges of the plot in its last five seconds. It's an infuriating way to end the series' narrative high point.  Yet, all in all, the game plays very well, looks gorgeous, and sounds great. Buy if you at all giggle at the prospect of electrocuting a man through his urine stream.",

So the linearity is the thing that may get some fans disappointed by this game. But there is still a lot of good to say about Absolution. It has much better controls than the earlier games, not as stiff as it previously has been and it now works more like the usual 3rd person shooter game, with taking cover and everything. The plot is quite boring in my opinion. The disguise system has been nerfed a lot from the earlier games, because now it won't fool enemies that are the same class as you. Anyway, I will still recommend this game for all stealth fans and it's very much worth buying for all fans of the genre.",

            "review_text": "Shitman: Abortion was developed by IO Interactive and released by Square Enix in November 2012. It was the then-latest iteration in the Hitman franchise. For those unfamiliar with Hitman, all of the games in the series had centred upon the eponymous Hitman (Agent 47) being placed in a level with a wide variety of obstacles and enemies, with the player being tasked with taking control of 47 and eliminating the target. The games allowed for a wide variety of playstyles, but the most succesful and satisfying routes were usually found in learning the layout of the map, the behaviour of the NPCs, the hazards present, and eliminating the target through use of the environment. This formula was perfected in 2006's  Hitman: Blood Money .   Having loved Blood Money, and having felt IO had perfected the formula, a lot of the fanbase were eagerly anticipating Absolution. All IO needed to do was give us more of what they had did in Blood Money; more levels with a variety of solutions and an immense amount of complexity. What we got was a linear action game with a few obligatory assasination levels that were crippled by the inclusion of new mechanics designed to streamline the game but only succeeded in making it frustrating to impossible to play the game without them. The game was gorgeous - and still is - and ran on relatively modest hardware, but other than that we were given a vapid experience that bore no resemblence to prior Hitman titles. It failed as a Hitman game, and unless was willing to play on a lower difficulty with 'instinct mode', it failed as an enjoyable game.",
