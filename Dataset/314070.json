            "review_text": "10/10 would KO a batter again!  This game is one of the most surprising titles I have ever picked up on Steam. I got it under the assumption that this would probably be a super simplified game with the bare minimums by how it looked and hoped for the best...  What I ended up buying was not only an amazingly fun and addictive baseball game, but a game with one heck of a lot more depth to it than you would assume by judging this game by it's cover.  === Gird your loins ye who read the full review below ===     The batting in this game, completely on point. The physics feel super tight and even in higher difficulties you don't feel like you're getting cheesed when you ground out or pop the ball a mile high. If you swing on that pitch down in the strike zone and haven't reacted quick enough you know damn well you're going to ground out. Everything feels very organic and proper as far as how the ball reacts. There are two different types of swings (plus bunting) : power and contact. You are also able to check your swing with both styles.  For the most part the same can be said about the AI as far as their hitting goes; If you make your pitches and place them well you will get your outs and K's. Again, feels very realistic despite it's cartoony graphics and light-hearted attitude.  The pitching, my favorite part. You have a plethora of pitches (8) to choose from, which is way more than enough considering every pitcher has the same choices. The pitches available are: 4 seam fastball (so-called Meatball), Cut fastball, 2 seam fastball, Slider, Screwball, Curveball, Changeup and a Forkball which is like a split finger fastball or Sinker as far as the movement goes. You perform the pitch by first aiming for the spot you wish the ball to begin it's trajectory and then following the break of the ball. You attempt to come as close to the break point marker (which appears after you start your windup) with your aim marker. The closer to that spot you get the higher quality a pitch you perform. As with batting you have two different pitching styles available to you. Normal pitching and Power pitching. It is a very well done and fun system which I find more interesting than the common methods found in other baseball games like power sliders and such.  As much as I appreciate and love the pitching in this game, I also feel it is an area of the game that has a lot of potential to be made better. Not so with how you perform your pitches but that each pitcher should have their own set of pitches. Along with that system it would more easily open the doors to having upgradeable pitches for each of the pitchers as well.  If you're familiar with baseball games and the game of baseball itself there is not much to go over with baserunning and fielding so I will not say much here.  The fielding feels good but I can see people getting a little frustrated with how quickly (or slowly in this case) your fielders will move. It feels very laborious at first but it is something you get used to and everyone's on the same playing field in that regard for the most part. You can make awesome diving plays if you time it correctly as well as jump walls to reel in those homers you'd all but given up on. The baserunning, less to say here than the fielding. Pretty much your basic baseball game here except you cannot be picked off on base by the pitcher. The game uses an adaptive method, if it notices you are stealing a lot of bases it will start to give your runners less and less of a lead off. That is one point of the game where it is lacking and unfortunately simplistic.  The depth.  Yes, depth! In case you haven't been convinced so far that there is more to this game than meets the eye, hopefully this will make it a bit more evident.  As you play the game with your team in season mode you will be able to hire staff to help your team on their way. Each member of staff you hire will have 3 modifiers to offer your players in four different categories. Gear vendors, Trainers, Coaches and Stylists. Your players will start out with a few slots open and available to have modifiers placed in and their stats will improve according to the type of modifier you set. Each player can have up to a maximum of 7 slots for different types of modifiers that will be made available as you play through your seasons. Any extra slots and bonus modifications you have done will persist from season to season with that team and you will eventually be able to make your players superstars, for lack of a better term. There is a bit of strategy behind this feature and you will also see the opposing teams players' improving in the same way as well. In some cases even quicker than your own players if you did not approach the proper staff or applied your modifiers poorly. For this part of the game I would recommend looking at SMB websites forums for a more in-depth description of the system itself just for a better understanding.  There is also a decent amount of statistics in the game including (but not limited to ;) ) BABIP, AB/HR ratios, walk and XBH percentages, OPS/OBP/Slugging, Total Bases, etc. And if by chance you don't know what any of these actually mean it is described in game.  One more thing that adds to the depth of this game is the highly adjustable and customizable difficulty system, called 'Ego'. You can adjust the difficulty across the board, or you can go into what's called Ego mode and adjust the difficulty based on the positions you're playing. For example, you could have batting and pitching at 50 Ego, but fielding and baserunning at 80 Ego so the game doesn't hold your hand as much for those bits. It makes it very easy to find a difficulty which you feel comfortable playing at and that gives you a good run for your money sometimes. The difficulty goes all the way from 1 Ego, through to 99 Ego. Anything above 60-70 Ego (once you've gotten comfortable with how the pitches look and move) will give people who are familiar with baseball games a good challenge while at the same time feeling like it's a proper competition.  An unfortunate truth that has been a big disappointment to many about this game is that there is no online multiplayer, nor is there plans for there to be in this game. With any luck this game will have a sequel, which, from what I hear and have understood, online multiplayer will be one of the priorities for that as it has (quite understandably) been one of the most requested things by the community.  If by chance you happen to have friends within couch distance the game does have one of the most fun co-op playstyles I have seen for local multiplayer and a baseball game in general.   If you have stuck around to this sentence and read through the whole review I have written up, I commend you, and hope that this has given you a good idea to make a well informed decision. This game and the team behind it truly deserve all the support they can get for this game. It has amazing gameplay somewhat hidden behind it's cartoony facade.  Thanks for reading. :)",

            "review_text": "Super Mega Baseball strikes a strong balance between the action and presentation of an arcade game and the depth of a sim. The offensive side of things is pretty standard stuff, but it's the pitching that has a surprising amount of meat on its bones. Lots of pitch types, a twitch-based cursor-and-target system, needing to mix things up to keep the hitter guessing - it's a wonderful system once you get the hang of it. Fielding is somewhat CPU-assisted (less so at higher difficulty levels) although you can still take manual control of your fielders to chase down fly balls, leap for line drives and dive for ground balls. All of these mechanics are layed out via a helpful in-game tutorial system that works quite well.  I really like how the 'Ego' difficulty system is implemented. It allows you to ease yourself in and gradually increase or decrease the challenge until you find your sweet spot. And I'm very satisfied with the quality of the port - Runs smoothly on my 7870 and has settings for AA (up to 16x), AF and shadow quality as well as Windowed Fullscreen support.  SMB is lacking when it comes to varying modes, unfortunately. Exhibition and Season mode is it. Something like a HR Derby or the option to jump right into a playoff tournament would've been nice. There are also only six ballparks, though all six are well designed and full of life. Baserunning controls feel a little awkward at first but I'm certain it's something that will only require a bit of practice. And while there is local co-op, the absence of online multiplayer is disappointing.  Despite its shortcomings, SMB's finely-tuned gameplay and charming personality make it a joy to play. Easily the best non-OOTP baseball game on PC since MVP 05, and recommended for both casual and devoted fans of the sport.",

            "review_text": "This game is great. I'd recommend it even to hardcore baseball fans. It's like how Mario Kart is to racing games. Lighthearted but can get very serious. (I won on a 2 out, 9th inning walk-off home run and it was intense! Ego set to 50) SMB is very easy once you get a hang of the controls but you can easily adjust the difficulty even during the season.   You can hire coaches, gear dealers, and trainers to give your team a stat boost as you level up while playing season mode. It's a little confusing on how it works at first. There is no trading of players but you can customize each players look, name, and number if you wanted to attempt to make your favorite MLB team.   The gameplay is quick. A 9 inning game usually takes me around 30 minutes.  It has nice keyboard/mouse and controller support. No issues for me on Windows 10. I have not seen an option to unlock the framerate but it runs at an acceptable 60fps.",

            "review_text": "I have mixed emotions about this game. I will recommend it,because if you love baseball,its a great game. In itself it is an awesome baseball game. The physics off the bat and in the field of play are great. You can see the ball change directions on the lip of the grass or deflecting off the mound. The ball also plays very well off the fences.  I do wish it was a little deeper. A 10 season Franchise mode with star points of course,more teams/divisions,aging players, pick offs,pitcher warm ups,deeper rosters,track errors, because they are a problem. I would also like to see it keep your W/L records for different egos, and be able to save multiple seasons.It could also use a stadium for each team(or at least for each team in a division) and the ability to pick your home stadium. I would be willing to pay for these additions. They would make a very good game better.  It does have problems in my opinion.... I start at a certain ego to start the season (65),every time I win I add 2 ego,and everytime I lose I subtract 2 ego. I hold steady from 67 to 73 ego. I have never won a game at 73. I believe the game has issues at higher egos. At 73 ego I can generally predict how a game is going to go. I will score a few runs(2-4) early. I will hold them for till 7th or later. Then the AI will start hitting the ball in nearly perfect areas on the infield, where you have to dive,but wont catch it and the throw will not be in time, or my team will commit 2 to 3 errors in the inning. I wont have an error all game till the late inning with a lead. If I'm losing, errors are not an issue.Player errors grossly outweigh the AI errors. Also there are issues with fielder control. I was trying to field a ball with a left fielder ,charging the ball and suddenly I switch to the SS. The ball drops in front of the LF and the tying run scored. This is because its perfectly placed between the LF,3B and SS, and I have learned it is usually better to use the OF.  These issues are very frustrating. There is also times at high egos that if you throw a strike it gets hit hard. You can not throw a ball by the AI. This seems to be in big games vs. Division leader or a team ahead of you in the standings. Its generall early in the game...and doesnt last after a good lead.  Why you ask do I still recommend this game? Because even with these issues...this is a great game. The physics ( which are a big thing for me in a baseball game) are excellent. Its fun and challenging. If you enjoy a good baseball game its right here. Play/load times are fast. It could be a little deeper ,but its a good game.   Also I think the fooled/anticipated idea needs to go. Why would a guy anticipate a pitch out of the strike zone and swing at it. On the other hand a batter who is fooled will smack it to the fence.",

            "review_text": "I have tried a few baseball games over the past few years, and none of them can be actually titled a good baseball game. The only option available out there was OOTP, which isn't really my thing.  A good experience I remember having was back in 2007-2008, when Ulltimate Baseball Online (aka Real Baseball Online) was around, which then became inaccessible. Different attempts to bring it back by other parties also didn't go well.  Then I saw this game. I didn't expect much from it by simply looking at the pictures. Yet I gave it a try and playing the game is a whole different story. It's 'arcadey' and all but has everything covered.   I am not really that versed with rules of baseball, and can't really say what the game misses, therefore I think it's a nice game that anyone can pick up, even without having prior experience/knowledge about baseball as a sport.  Apart from being able to play a full baseball game, the game also offers ability for players to assign their team members with new skills and traits that can be applied in a game. Those skills are gained at the end of games based on performance which is calculated with points.   Players also have the freedom to set the difficulty of games using 'ego' which decides how much control a player needs to put on the team members. The higher the 'ego' the more attention a player needs to put into controls and depend less on the AI aspect.  In addition to that, the customisation of team members in terms of looks is also possible. It has a wide variety of funny looking faces and hair styles that don't really reduce the game quality but instead add to it a fun and less serious atmosphere. Don't let this stop you from enjoying the game.  Not to forget the funny remarks that the umpire throws in his voice.  So it doesn't matter if you're a baseball fan or simply wanting to start getting into the game, then this game isn't a bad choice.",

            "review_text": "OK, well into a season mode here, so I feel like I can review this game.  There's not many 'on the field' baseball games for PC right now, so this game is a very welcome appearance. Fortunately, this is extremely well done.  This game does have something of an arcadey-feel, especially at the lower 'Ego' levels, which is the game's fairly unique difficulty mechanic. From 1 to 100, the game's starting default is 15, good for most beginners. The more Ego you're playing at, the more points you can potentially earn in game, which levels you, the player, up. Leveling up opens up training and other ways to improve your players.   Gameplay is rock solid. In the field, jumping, diving, catching, and throwing are all inituitive, especially to those who have played other baseball games in the past. Pitchng and hitting are simple, easy to learn, but more difficult to master.   The visuals, especially on the players, are over the top, with exagerated features and even female players on every team. Don't be fooled by the aforementioned visuals; the physics are very realistic and for the most part, balanced very well. The only blip on the radar I've noticed is a bit too much of hard hit balls to the outfield ending in a runner on first being forced out at second. There is no MLB or MLBPA license, but I don't think this game particularly suffers for it. In season mode, you can also edit the appearance of your team, which is very cool.  Stat Tracking is also quite good. You can find just about any stat you'd want during a season.  As for things I wish was in the game, can we have some online? Please? I'm not a big online gamer myself, but even if this were just the co-op modes, it'd be better than nothing.   This is a very good first effort by developer Metalhead. Keep it up.   8.5/10",

Affordable, addictive game-play, easy to learn but hard to master, unique integration of 'ego' as the game's difficulty setting,... this game checks all the points that a gamer should want out of a game.  It also has excellent graphics, funny player / team names, team customization, friend leader-boards... a polished game that can only get better with future updates and added features. It has a small but active steam community so visit the steam forums and add friends to your leader-board and get tips on how to improve. Would be nice if it had online multi-player (currently has local multi-player) and MLB licensed teams, but I imagine this is the next logical step for this game. Regardless, if / when online multi-player or MLB licensed teams come to this game, the current version should be an 'insta-buy'.  Super Mega Baseball hits the nostalgia spot too! If you remember having hours of fun playing baseball games for NES and SNES (Baseball, Base Wars, Tecmo Baseball, Ken Griffey Jr) then you need to buy this game now! If you never played a baseball game before but enjoy the sport, buy this game cause it will keep you coming back for more!  It's the type of game where I come home after work and look forward to having some free time just so that I can play. So stop reading other reviews and buy this game now!

And, it supports mouse and keyboard or a controller equally well. While it doesn't have MLB teams, it is probably just as equal if not better than most baseball games that do.  Controlling individual base runners is a learning curve you will need to get over, it can be difficult at first. But, once you master it, you'll realize how well it works. The only draw back that I can see with the game is that you cannot pick-off runners as the pitcher. Also, you cannot individually steal bases without everyone who is on base being forced to steal.  These are minor things and don't interfere the gameplay, and I don't regret one cent of the purchase.  The only way this game can improve is if it had multiplayer and coop.  ",

Don't be discouraged from buying it due to the cartoon art, as it has real baseball mechanics, the controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is fun overall. I was quite surprised with the fact that you could even customize the players on your team. I was glad to be able to change my center fielder's name to Mike Trout and (try to) make him look like him. Of course, certain things can still be improved. On the first game I played, I somehow scored 10 runs and got a no hitter against the opposing team with no prior experience. I still have to experiment with whether raising the difficulty, called ego, will make a difference in making the game less easy. I won't hold this against the game, however, as in most baseball games you can score an impossible amount of points easily, but that doesn't make the game less fun. As for bugs, I've already ran into one where my game crashed at the end of the 9th inning, which I then used that time to come here and write this review. If you love baseball I would certainly recommend this game to you.",

Cons : No online play.  Stats and hiring can be a bit confusing, but it literally tells you who to fire eventually and can just look at quality of team personel.",

I started with R.B.I., but this I like far better, even though it doesn't have MLB license.  I'm fairly fresh to baseball and this game helped me to understand some of the strategies that include pitcher substitutions (starting, relief, closing), pinch runners, etc.  I highly recommend customizing your team and name them after friends or family, so they are easier to track.  Sirloins rule!",

Easy to get into and start a game with a friend. My only complaint is season mode isn't the same as exhibition, you can't play a season versus your friend.  But, if Metalhead Software releases more sports games that are just as good and easy to play as this, SIGN ME UP! I'd beat down your door if you come out with a football game that was done with this art style but in the mode of Tecmo Bowl. Other sports would be welcome too. Hell, do the Olympics with lots of different sports as mini-games and I'd buy that day and date.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic! I'm not really a fan of the actual sport but I enjoy some of the videogames (less so the more realistic simulations). This one has the nice arcadey quickness that I like while still providing enough control and player management others might be looking for. The individual difficulty adjusters for each aspect of the game (pitching, batting, etc.) is a great addition that allows you to enjoy the parts you like and breeze through what you don't feel comfortable with.  Some people might be turned off by the character designs but I like them, especially with their reactions when they get struck out. Plus the customization gives you more wackiness.  The only negatives have been repeated in other reviews and is the lack of a practice mode for pitching/batting, other than playing an actual game.  Definitely a must buy if you have even just a slight interest in baseball.",

Yet, I could not find any baseball games, which would provide the gameplay satisfaction I experience when I play the sport out in the field with my mates. I've tried out most baseball titles I could get my hands on, such as Out of the Park, Hardball, RBI, MLB, MVP, High Heat etc etc  As such, I was reluctant getting Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings but based on feedback I decided to do so. And it didn't disappoint. Despite it's cartoony demeanour, it is fun to play. SMB has customisation of players &amp; teams through a team editor, a good tutorial, adjustable difficulty levels, exhibition and season modes, with local co-op (handicapped). well most of everything that one would expect from a decent baseball game.  On the other hand, it doesn't come with real rosters (huge effort changing every player manually) or leagues (blame MLB licensee Sony?), which is acceptable for an arcade style casual session. In addition, it has no online or any type of multiplayer modes (besides local coop), which could have been the stepping stone to make SMB a great game.  Despite its few short-comings, Super Mage Baseball: Extra Innings is a good game to enjoy, in short bursts, baseball fan or not.",

I really wanted to like this game, because I remember the old Back Yard Baseball games from my youth that were so great, but I couldn't. It's probably fun if you have an xbox controller, but if you don't, SAVE YOUR MONEY. The mouse controlls are literally, the WORST I've ever come across for a PC game -- I would even call them non-functional. Backyard Baseball from 1997 had a far superior control setup.",
