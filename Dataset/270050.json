            "review_text": "This game is a rogue-like dungeon-crawler.  Firstly, you have to choose between four different classes (Warrior, Wizard, Assassin, Shaman) and four difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Hell).  Then the game starts, and you have to go through 7 floors killing monsters in order to get xp, money and items.  You will encounter bosses that are quite challenging to kill. Do not hesitate to escape, by closing the door that you opened a few seconds ago for instance, if you think that you will have a hard time killing a scary boss !  You will trigger quests (between 0-3 at each floor) that require to either kill a boss or find an item. You'll be rewarded with both money and xp. I think that you should clean an entire floor before triggering a quest (at least in Hard /Hell difficulties). The point I want to make is that if this is a boss quest, you might be in trouble if you have to fight a boss that you've just spawned plus some regular monsters.  Cleaning an entire floor will bring you everything you need : xp, money and items. You should get the best stuff you can and some potions before fighting the final boss. Regarding this final boss, I do not want to spoil people, but there is one thing I want to say : how is it possible to give him the ability to kill us with one skill and one shot ? If the skill 'Death' hits you, you will die 10 turns later, no matter what you do ... You have to hope that it will fail :s  Regarding the achievements, there are quite easy to unlock, except maybe for the one that needs you to beat the game in Hell mode. I might make a guide to give you some hints.   To put it in a nutshell, I think this game is quite good, especially for its price (5â‚¬ at the moment). I hope that there will be some updates in order to add more contents (more floors, maybe a 'survival' mode with infinite floors ? ...). If you like this kind of game, do not hesitate, buy it !",

            "review_text": "Quest of Dungeons is a very simple, generic rogue-like game, which turns out to be plenty of fun. There are 7 floors to explore, each taking around half an hour to finish, making a playthrough last 3-4 hours or so. There are four classes to choose from - Warrior, Shaman, Assassin and Mage. I played through the game on normal with the warrior and enjoyed the variety of skills I acquired for him. Not a ton, but enough to add some strategy and keep a ~3 hour game interesting. I'm assuming the other three classes have their own set of skills, which adds some potential replayability.   One thing to keep in mind before starting a game is that 'normal' difficulty was rather easy for me and I never had any shortage of money. If you are adept at rogue-likes, you may want to play on a higher difficulty.   This game isn't amazing, but it is a fun and simple rogue-like that is very accessible. It retails at $5 so it would be a very reasonable purchase on sale.",

            "review_text": "As a fairly big fan of Roguelikes and Roguelites, i really wanted to like this game. And when i started it, i did. It's repetitive, and the graphics are just generally unedited sprites from a Sprite Pack you can buy for use in your games, but it had a certain charm to it i suppose.   Ignoring the graphics because of the aforementioned reason, the sound design isn't great. The music is cute, but generic. The combat has almost no sounds to it, which is fine if that's what you're going for, but it doesn't seem like that's what they wanted. The sounds for eating and drinking (which you will be doing a LOT because of shoddy balance, more on that below) honestly sound like wet farts.   The controls are intutive enough i guess. Move around with WASD/Clicking with the Mouse and attack by clicking with the mouse. Oh and loot by clicking with the mouse. Starting to see a problem? This is most evident when playing as the Wizard/Assassin, characters designed more for a ranged approach. Nothing is more infuriating than trying to attack an enemy, only to misclick and just run right up next to them and stick your face out to get punched. Same problem with looting, half the time if you aren't paying perfect attention to where your mouse is, you'll run PAST your loot. While not as much of an issue in the early part of the game, in the later parts where enemies are EVERYWHERE, you'll often run straight into one due to this issue.   But honestly, as a fan of roguelikes, i could've overlooked that. The humor of the game is definitely what kept me somewhat charmed, with such items as 'Bottled Water' (Generic Brand) and the Moldy Cheese item questioning why you even have it in your pocket. And if those were the only issues, i could've ignored them. Honestly though, the balance is definitely the main problem with the game.   I kinda glossed over the combat earlier for a reason. As i said, it's fairly repetitive. You click on enemies and hit them, you damage them, they damage you, etc. You have skills you can use, but it's effectively selecting the skill and then... clicking on enemies. Or yourself if it's a buff. As far as i can tell from my best run, there are no party members. Sidequests are practically nonexistant, generally they're just randomly generated fluff, either of the 'go find this item that's randomly spawned in some room' or 'kill this slightly recolored enemy that either you'll kill in two hits, or vice versa' variety. There's no visual indicator of progress, your sprite stays the same. But again; this isn't the biggest issue. That... is definitely the balance.   Yeah. The balance, of all things, in a rather boiled down roguelike, is ironically the main problem. You know how in most roguelikes your chance to dodge can be affected by equipment? Or rings? Or SOMETHING? Yeah, not so much here. In fact, i still have no idea what affects dodging in this as there is no weight system, and the only items i've ever seen have secondary effects are weapons which *NEVER* have +Dodge Chance or anything similar. This generally means that dodging for you is just a gift from RNGesus. For the enemies, it's a COMMON occurance. For cannon fodder enemies, that's fine. You know when it's not fine? With bosses. Bosses that can dodge all of your attacks and oneshot you at full health when you're already above the needed level for the floor you're on and can consistently oneshot the aforementioned fodder. The recolored enemies are guilty of the same issue. Equipment doesn't make a big difference really, as i said, only weapons ever seem to have extra effects, and they're generally worthless, so it's just a matter of seeing which item has a better main stat. Same with armor. Hell, even rings, generally the only thing in some roguelikes that have other effects, are just more Defense fodder in this.   Honestly, i'd like to recommend this game. I can see a mobile port working well (which they're working on a 3DS port so that's probably closer than i think) but in it's current state, on a platform with so many better Roguelikes, i can't recommend it.   Oh and for you achievement â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s like myself, it commits a horrible, horrible sin; the difficulty achievements are difficulty locked. Beating the game on Hard for example, doesn't unlock the Normal and Easy achievements, just the Hard one. There's literally no reason for it, other than either the devs didn't think of it, or they were padding the game.   If you want a good example of a roguelike that's almost the complete opposite of this in every way, go play Elona. This probably seems like Needless shilling, but i'm serious. It's freeware, and has a large modding community.",

While I certainly give this game a thumbs up for its sound execution of a simple concept, the concept itself is somewhat flawed. It's an excellent purchase if you're able to pick it up for a dollar or so, but it's certainly not worth the default price tag of $5.",

Where you are sent by your party to adventure randomly generated dungeons and defeat the bosses that lye ahead. The game was designed by David Amador and released back in March, 2014.  Review  Quest of Dungeons is not for the hardcore rouge like player but, the simplistic and average player that wants something to do for a couple mins because you have time to spare. The game has many features such as:  Randomly Generated Dungeons Four playable classes Comical humor Many different items Chance to fight your own ghost Achievement system (Beta) Unlock-able content Large inventory system Replay Value The game lacks from a 'real' rouge like dungeon crawler when it comes to survival. In Quest of Dungeons David got rid of the food system so you no longer need to eat to survive, larger inventory so you do not have to make those drastic choices of keeping an item or not.  Although, Quest of Dungeons may not have everything a rouge like game would. It is fun none the less and would recommend this game to anybody looking for a fun dungeon crawler with much replay value. For $4.99 the game is worth the time and enjoyment you will get out of it.",

Simple gameplay, with simple graphics, and rules with basic rogue strategies. The downside right now as on release, is the GUI. It could benefit greatly from an overhaul, as there is a lacking of hotkeys, along with cluttered inventory management. Spell, and Skill selection consists of several mouseclicks to use, so setting up defenses, buffs, and attacks is a matter of 5 to 20 mouseclicks of manually selecting. Also, was the lacking of passing time by standing still, which from a strategic POV, hinders you in battle if there is 1 square difference between you and a foe. Even on Easy mode, there was a large gap in learning curve between dungeon levels. Almost as if it could use a tad bit more game balancing for one or two classes.  If you can get past some of the quirks, then it can lead to many hours of play. Be warned, its a true roguelike, with perma death, so it may not be everyones cup of tea. Its a simple battle of attrition to outlast each subsequent adventure.",

Sounds easy right? No. For some reason the 'easy' difficulty is harder than most games i find difficult to play. You get two-shotted by bosses on Normal mode and the only good character is the ranged one because they can't directly attack you from afar unless they are mages or archers themselves. You spend two hours on a regular run and you probably won't finish the game in this time because you die by the bosses since a crit does like 60% of your HP for some reason- and in higher difficulties a crit would end your run.  Do i reccomend this game? Yes, it's so much fun. But only if you don't mind having to start over again. Basic combat that everyone can understand sounds horrible, but it's actually not that bad as it looks on paper and fits the game very well. The graphics are very nice for a pixely game and the music really gives a nice ambience, even while it sounds so... stupid?  Trust me, you will spend an hour, die, probably not play the game again for a couple of hours or even a day and do another attempt on it the next day. You will try your *ss off so hard that you will ragequit over and over again, but you still want to see that booty when you finish the game. You will get really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when you open a door and a boss shoots at you or uses magic at you and crits you, making you lose the game. But you will come back.

That means that you each move (or preform one action such as attack, open door, drink potion, etc) per turn. The problem with this system is that when you are facing a fight you know, mathematically speaking, you cannot win, you may as well just restart the game then and there. Why? Because you aren't going to be able to out damage what you're fighting and you cannot run away either. Because everything else has the same movement speed, anything that you fight will follow one space behind you... forever. They will chase you through the entire dungeon, always one space behind you (did I mention there is no actual animation in this game either. Just sprites moving along in linear motions along a grid? Yeah. Even NES RPGs had some semblance of animation, but not this 'retro' release. But I digress) and when you stop, guess what? You're gonna get hit and die.   2. Health and Mana slowly regenerate on a per turn basis. What this means is that after you've cleared a room, you can just spam WASD (moving one space=one turn) and pace around for a little while, to get your health back. It will regenerate to full, if you are patient enough. It doesn't take long enough to be a great nuisance to do, but it's not so quick either that it's not annoying. The main issue with this though is that it completely makes the inventory system, complete with food, health and mana potions, totally useless. You don't need to drink or eat anything because you'll always just be able regain health and energy after you've completed a room. As for actually using the potions and such in combat? That too isn't really practical because anything that you're fighting that you'd need to drink a potion for is going to kick your â™¥â™¥â™¥ regaurdless of how much you drink. That's the biggest problem in this game. You're either gauranteed success or failure the moment you walk into a room. Either way it's just as boring.  3. The actual combat is really boring. For the wizard you're always going to be better off using your spells but your mana runs out. But, again, that doesn't really matter because you can just walk around for about a hundred turns (so about 20 seconds) to get all the mana and health you lost back. The knight is just awful. All you can do is hit stuff and then let it hit you, walk around, get back health, repeat.  I think I've made my points very clear. There are still a few bugbears though. For example, there are bear traps scattered throughout some of the rooms. Why? No reason. The player can easily avoid them, the enemies can't knock the player into them nor can the player use them to his advantage. Why are they there? No clue, but it's just a little aspect that really shows how little thought, effort, play testing, and just plain common sense went into this game.  This is an absolutely boring, cliched, uninspired game that still somehow thinks it has the right to mock the player on death (such as flashing 'Seriously?' and 'Let's just pretend this never happened' in red when the player dies) and ask 'leaving so soon' when trying to quit the game. Yes, I am leaving and I will not be returning. If this were just a little flash game on Newgrounds or whatever, I'd take it as a budding game maker spreading his wings and getting his barings in. But charging actual money, no matter how little, is rediculous. Take those couple of bucks this game costs, go to a McDonalds, and get something to eat off the dollar menu. Trust me, that alone will give you far more joy and satisfaction than this game ever could.  1/5, the only redeeming value is that the music is not totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.",

After playing for a short time, the only thing I would suggest to add more replayability is to add some sort of purpose for doing these dungeons. Maybe a store to spend your total points gained at the end of completing a level/dying in a level. This could be for extra attack damage or something during your next run. Or make specific class 'mastery' systems or something similar. As of right now, it just seems pointless to run dungeons and get nothing from it except a 'score' which is just to compare with friends. I, however, do not have many friends that play these types of games, so it's just for a personal best (of sorts). This, I am not a fan of.",
