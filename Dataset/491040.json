            "review_text": "Very fun and challenging arcade style, fast paced shooter, presented in a 90's SNES visual style. Bot Vice contains about 25 stages. Each level plays out on a single screen where you battle waves of robots until you reach the mini-boss battle at the end. Eventually leading up to the main story boss battles that progress the story line of the game. Some of the more hilarious bosses include parodies of Bebop and Rocksteady, as a bit of a TMNT fan tribute. The game also now features easy and hard mode. With the main difference being you receive health item drops while playing on easy difficulty.   The game can be a bit tough at times but with a bit of practice it's possible to overcome. You're not only trying to just complete each stage but also race to obtain the best time possible. In order to stop the plot you're only given a set amount of time to complete the game. It becomes fairly important to keep your level completion times as low as possible.  The voice acting and long winded villain speeches add a bit of charm, as a loving reference to all the awesome and silly arcade sounds of old. The music is not bad and it contains some decent sound effects and a few silly voice lines. Music wise nothing incredible. It works well for what it's meant to be at least.   The controls are very responsive, although the lock on system can be a little tricky at times. The power ups can also be a little tricky to cycle through.   Theoretically the game is fairly short. But it still took me about 3-4 hours of actual playtime on easy mode to finally complete the game. It also gives you alot of achievements to shoot for which adds some replay-ability. I would say you're probably looking at 3-6 hours of playtime if you're as bad as I am at shooters, plus maybe another 1-2 hours if you're going for all the achievements.   To sum it up, I really enjoyed playing this game and felt a real sense of accomplishment and excitement after finally kicking the final boss in his ♥♥♥♥! If you're looking for some classic arcade action that offers a good challenge at a fairly cheap price I'd highly recommend giving Bot Vice a try.",

            "review_text": "If this game had come out in the 90s, we'd be regarding it now as one of the classic shooters of the era. It's that good.  Other reviewers are saying this game is extremely difficult. It is, but you need to know that it's a very fair kind of difficulty. Deaths aren't cheap, and this game isn't frustrating. It's one of those games where you will die over and over but be very eager to hop back in and try again because it's so damned fun.  The game is divided into many short levels which you can retry as many times as you like, so the consequences for failure are minimal. Don't be intimidated by this game, the more you play it, the better at it you will get. When you master the roll-dodge and cover mechanics and learn how to read enemy patterns, you'll be on your way to victory.  What Bot Vice has over most other shooters is an absolutely insane level of gameplay diversity. I gotta give props to the incredible work ethic of these devs, this game is jam packed with different enemy types that have their own unique personality and attack patterns. This game is constantly throwing new enemies, new bosses and new stage hazards at you every time you play a new level. This is god-tier game design.  This is a modern classic. Get it now.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  Fun gameplay Good voice acting Feels very much like an arcade game  Cons:  The level design should introduce levels gradulally increasing their difficulty so the player can learn and improve early skills before needing to learn new skills, or master old ones. The second level of the game introduces: an enemy that can hit you in cover, a vehicle that gives enemies in it much more life and acts as a barrier after it's destroyed, and an enemy that catches you off gaurd and quickly fires at you when dashing onto screen. This is too much to handle on only level two (about 5-10 minutes into the game).  I do recommend the game because it still feels very good to play, and if you die, it's because you aren't good enough. But, even with easy mode, the game expects the player to know all of nuances in the controls and be able to handle several new enemy types at once.",
