            "review_text": "What the hell is this?   Spent 3 hours making a terrain and figuring it out how the hell to export to Unity only to find out that ....:  You can't import custom textures which HONESTLY should be a given considering this is labeled as 'software' for game developers. Do game developers not use original assets or what?    Yeah yeah I know, I read you could always just go and create a Unity3d package on Unity and then 'import' (more like use the explorer/finder to copy your files to the corresponding directory...) that into GeoVox.   Hell, I spent like 2 hours googling how the ♥♥♥♥ to pack a Unity3d package since EVERYTIME I try to create and export a package it'll be set to 'unityPackage' as opposed to 'Unity3d'.  How did i come to realize the absence of such a basic feature? Well... Cause I was trying to change the specular and normal maps of one of my voxel types and ended up realizing that EVERYTIME that I import a scene into Unity the materials loose the specular channel resulting in some horrible looks for the whole terrain.  I'm glad I got this discounted cause as of today, this is really still something I can't find myself using because of its severe professional features.",

There are many other reasons but these are my top 3   Also No one paid me to write this I am truly totally happy with this program I give it a 10",

It's a lot better than the ones I've used before over the years you can get up and running very quickly with a high quality terrain.  Once the updates which import into Unity 5 and Axis come out this will be the best ever.  I recommend it for now and await the promised updates.  'Just as I thought, the devs have listened and already released the Unity 5 import of the terrain'  Way to go guys ... nice",
