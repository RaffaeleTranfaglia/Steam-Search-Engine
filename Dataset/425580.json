            "review_text": "Tl;Dr: +Good environment +Storytelling, -clue design, ---puzzle design. 3/10 nearly punched screen after discovering most answers from poorly designed clues.   Huge fan of the first game. It had rich details, the puzzle mechanics clicked beautifully, and there were plenty of 'oh why didn't I think of that?' moments when I hit the clue button.   This game, unfortunately, only really nailed the rich environment. The puzzle mechanics moved away from 'figure this out' to 'figure out where this thing goes.' The idea to expand from a singular object of focus to multiple areas in a room gives it an 'escape the room' kind of feel to it, but detracts from the overall experience. Too much space to explore, and far too much detail. A player should never be left wondering 'Is this part of the puzzle? Or meaningless background detail?' The clue button in this game was less of 'why didn't I think of that' to 'I would never EVER see that connection' or 'I didn't even know that was supposed to be part of the puzzle, isn't that background?'  The puzzle design here feels like bottom-of-the-barrel. There were no moments where you had to figure out what path to take when multiple were presented. The first game had many puzzles where you had to navigate an object past obstacles or through paths, and you felt really good when you solved it, sometimes backtracking to find the correct path. This game only had one such puzzle, and the physics engine and the control scheme interfered pretty hard with executing the solution. Nearly every puzzle in this game was a case of 'I found an object, let's spend the next several minutes finding where it goes.'   Clue no. 1: 'You found object X. Where does it go?' Thanks, game. I hadn't figured that out &lt;/sarcasm&gt; Clue no. 2: 'I wonder if object X could be used to do &lt;thing&gt;?' Thanks, game, that was already obvious.  Clue no. 3: 'Use object X on thing Y.' Greaaaaaaaat.   Pursuing the whole 'find where this goes' mantra of design, I found myself just rapid-clicking on every thing of even remote interest in every room. I found it especially infuriating when I saw something that appeared to be part of the puzzle, and couldn't click on it to inspect it more closely. I would then discount the thing as 'not part of the puzzle because the game clearly won't let me look at it', only to find out later (from one of those brilliant clues) that I should have gone back to it, only to find out that the object is NOW more closely inpsectable, now that's it's important to the puzzle. That was a grave injustice in this game when compared to the last one. It was impossible in this game to make serious notes about what stuff to return to with new info, because the game literally wouldn't let you look at things until you needed them.   The use of the lens also felt really underwhelming in this game as well. There was little to no meaningful usage of it, and in one case, was used only briefly to notice the tiniest of features that could be easily missed, but was absolutely mandatory for a puzzle solution. The first game used the lens to help the player find things that would be obscure without it, but this game uses the lens mechanic poorly. Was this even the same design team? I finally just brute-forced the final puzzle answer in the last room, instead of waiting for the clue to tell me where to find the last piece of hidden information.   I got this game on sale for just under $3. I feel like it was wasted. The tutorial showed promise, with the potential for multiple simultaneous areas of investigation and the creepy vibes foreshadowing an interesting story, but quickly became nothing short of intense, repeated frustration from the puzzles of the first level onward. Save your money and take a pass on this game.",

Exceptional realistic graphics, lovely and gloomy (often leaving you guessing as to if you've missed something visually or perceptively) added to by the awesome atmospheric effects and music. A challenging puzzle game without being samey or too taxing, it's mostly observation and perception based, A game you can pick up and enjoy months later after forgetting the finer points!  An excellent PC version, not a hash up of an Android version. But you will not need a keyboard!",

Graphics are superbly detailed and does not give the impression that it was originally a tablet game.  where Myst was too hard for some. The Room has an simple but smart Hint System. where the first hint will always just slightly help guide you in right direction, without giving the player a full walkthrough. following by another hint that will tell you a bit more, if the first was too vague. and then the final hint will help you fully, incase you are completly lost.  Only thing that i was slightly dissapointed by was the length of the experience. but honestly at a default sales price of 5.00€ its a bargain and easily worth the price.  hopefully Fireproof will release 'The Room 3' pc version a bit fastere than they did this one. ^_^",

Took me 5 hours to complete with hints disabled (recommended, as it feels more rewarding) and just enjoying my time. In comparison to the first game, The Room Two seemed to be slightly more difficult, which I actually appreciated. The 6 chapters get increasingly more difficult (with the exception of chapter 5) and I got stuck a few times. However, getting stuck never felt tedious or annoying. You might miss a few small details initially, but it's not like they are hidden in unfair ways.  Best five bucks I've spent in a while. Highly recommended.",

        {
            "review_text": "Essentially the same as 'The Room' so I will copy my review of that game below.  The main difference is that now, not only have you got a different coloured lens to look through (that importantly is substantially more comfortable to look through), but you also have actual rooms instead of a box on a table in a room. Therefore you have a number of boxes within a room, sometimes there are puzzles which interact with each other across the room. It essentially means that you need to keep more in your head in case something you obtain in Box A works with cabinet C etc. The downside to this is that there is a lot of zooming out and zooming in to different things which means a lot of clicking - it can get a little annoying. What would have worked better in the port here are little buttons at the top of the screen for each 'Box' in the room so that you can quickly jump to and fro.  Personally I think therefore the first game is better as it is more focused and stream-lined.   Got it on sale for £0.99 - definitely worth that price. It is not an 'Escape locked room' puzzle game.  Basically a port of a mobile game with revamped graphics for PC, this is a little chilled puzzle game with some really elaborate boxes and contraptions that you will be tasked with opening, all while exploring the theme of alchemy.   The ending leaves much to be desired, and the puzzles are a little straight forward. Sometimes the controls are a little quirky (mouse guiding objects) but this is not really enough of a hindrance to deter a purchase while on sale for the aforementioned price.   For those who still feel the puzzles may be out of their league, the game gives you a few hints along the way if you want them to nudge you in the right direction. Each time you want a hint it will give you 3 'clicks'. The first of the 3 is a vague 'In case you didn't see what changed maybe looking here...', the second and third hints go more and more in detail relating to what is next to do. This way you can get just enough of a hint that you feel as though it is still 'you' who is solving the puzzles, depending on how much of a nudge you may need.  Makes me want to give The Room Two a look. ",

Similar to the first, the graphics are very nice and you have many more (and more intricate) puzzles to solve. As in the first you get hints if the game feels you need them, I think they may be time generated because if it is taking you a while to solve something, you get and indication by means of a '?' mark which tells you a hint is available.  Did I use them you bet I did. I would try my hardest to do things myself and I did get better at it for sure. Good thing is the hints don't solve it for you, they just suggest you need to look more closely at your surroundings.  There is an added creapy factor involved and expect to jump occasionally at certain noises and things that occur. This realy adds to the atmosphere of the game.  I recommend and rate at 8.5/10 and if you want a change from your normal run of the mill type game. give this serious a go.",

Unlike the first one you are doing multiple puzzles at once having to constantly switch back and fourth while navigating an entire room. I promise you will enjoy this game. There's a reason this game has a cult following lol. Now for the bad....it's IMO not as challenging as the first game till the end. At the end you feel kinda thown to the wolves, because you have no real clue what to do next. Other than that no complaints. My only suggestion for the devs is make things more elaborate and make the player use more of there own knowledge. So they can't just power through it. 10/10 would recommend till next time Fireproof I can't wait :)",

There are maybe one or two levels where it's bearable and where the chain of 'puzzles' still feels somewhat organic, but otherwise this is just a drag.   When you have to rely on the hint system to actually have a sense of flow and not hit a wall everytime you make progress, there's something wrong with your game design. But despite all these flaws, I might still give a shot to the 3rd one, if it ever get released, because I'd still like to see where this is going.",

It took me about 2ish hours total (I idled for a while for cards after) which is less time than I recall taking on the first. In the first game I was quite vexed by some of the puzzles but the puzzles on this one seemed easier to me. The ambiance was definitely better and kept with the whole creepy vibe. It seemed like this one was more focussed on looks and setting than the last and the puzzles were not as difficult/interesting.   I picked this up for $2.49, I don't think I would recommend it for any more than that though, especially following a dollar per hour content standard.  Perhaps my fault with this one was comparing it to the first, and not letting it stand on its own, but I bought it knowing how much I enjoyed the first, and it is a sequel. I suppose I was just a bit disappointed.  Pros:  - great hint system - nice polish/ambiance - decent puzzles - One of the best of it's kind that I can think of  Cons: - Not as good as The Room - Puzzles seemed easier than The Room - Shorter than The Room  Perhaps if the puzzles were just slightly harder, or there were just a few more chapters I would have been more satisfied, but it ended waaay earlier than I expected and I felt like I was left wanting more.

The game ends with the developers specifically asking the player to write good Steam reviews and promote the game in order to 'help them out', and that REALLY rubs me the wrong way. ...so that settles it: I'm not recommending this game.

I find this, in particular, to be a really bad choice by the Devs. In the first game, everything you need to do and know is in a single box full of different mechanisms, and it makes it easier to do stuff without seeking tips and help from other sources other than your own brain, since you're focused in the same place all the time, each chapter. In The Room 2, there are many things to focus and remember in a room, this kinda ovewhelms the player and forces him to focus more on memory than on puzzlesolving, plus the incountable clicks you make to drag the camera across different spots in the room each time you think you know something.  With that being said, The Room Two is still an excellent game with mind blowing puzzles and excellent atmosphere, and cryptic story. The only thing that keeps it from being a better puzzle game than the 1st is the new 'many objects' mechanic that adds many other things for the player to observe in the room. I can't wait for The Room 3, which, as far as I know, will be a prequel and a sequel to the story we've been seeing. And you better bet i will buy it as soon as it goes out on Steam.

The first part was a little bit more magical and impressing, I do not like the atmosphere of this one. Maybe because I am not a native English speaker I could not catch the plot line. Spoiler:    Where do these beasts, ghosts, woodoo, taro come from? I am not really a fan of solving puzzles with the help of black magic, burning dolls and inspecting the skelett :/ There is a lot if images that could be used instead.     The graphics are very impressive, but all the light peaces like windows and lamps gave me an impression as if I was looking them at 640x480, though I put the graphics at maximum. Charing the battery in the last scene I got a bug meassage clicking on the place where the broken resistor was.  Although I like the soundtrack, some new chords could have been better. When I hear the same soundtrack I expect to get the same game as in the Room 1. But this part is different, shorter and less impressive (for me of course). If I here a different soundtrack - I can expect the new one and will not compare it to the previous. That is the logic.  To be honest, I expected more from the game. It is definitly worth of buying it, but for me it was two times as short as the Room 1, also less impressive and even boring sometimes    Especially when you run three times to type the word into the typewriter. Even though the machine is cool, it was boring.   .  So, buy the game if you are a fan of Room 1 or have not played Room 1 yet. Hah. In every case you will find that one of the games is better, but they are both cool still.",

The only part that put me off a little bit is that much of the puzzles involve quite a bit of seek-and-find in order to find parts you need to continue on. Granted, it's not that bad, but I'm not your most observant sort so I had a bit of frustration about that. But, the hint system helped me through that so no real harm done.

            "review_text": "It's a killer puzzle box, designed to scare me to death, and I'm trapped inside it.   Must be Christmas!  Summary: Lots and lots of mechanical puzzles (like the original The Room), essentially no dialog. Hints are reasonably good, my biggest complaint is the pixel hunting to find the location that I need to double-click to zoom in on to use (like a small lever or knob). You don't need to have played the original since the storyline is less important, although there's no explanation of the diffraction glass in this game (i.e. the 'see through' lens) so I could see it being confusing to someone who didn't play the first.  'I'm following a trail of bread crumbs that have been left out for me'  Before you start on this game, set the screen brightness to 10 in the options menu (it's separate from the other graphics options). The settings are dark, and you might miss some subtle clues otherwise.  There's probably 5 hours of puzzles in the game, more or less depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles. I found it useful in the tougher puzzles to exit the game and set it aside for awhile instead of clicking through all the hints right away.  'Or maybe I'm in Hell. That's okay, I'm not scared of Hell. It's just Heaven for bad people.'  The majority of the puzzles are using hidden sliders/knobs/latches/etc so that you can get to the next hidden slider/knob/latch/etc. As such much of the game is linear. The hints system usually gives you a series of three clues, the first being what the next objective is ('it would be nice to get into that cabinet'), what the puzzle involves ('I wonder what the numbers on the table means') and finally a near-spolier for how to solve the puzzle. It doesn't actually give you a solution, but there's enough information to make a good attempt at the puzzle with the final hint. I had to use the hints for about 10% of the puzzles, most of that being when I didn't have an idea what I should do next.  'This is somebody's game and I can't stop playing a game that eveybody else has lost.'  One criticism is that the hot-spots for zooming into things are not always clear, and I had to use the hints when I needed to be certain that there was hot spot somewhere there.  Seriously, if you like puzzle games get both this and the original -- they are steals at a few bucks apiece. 10/10",

The hint system handles this elegantly and I would recommend anyone playing the game to keep it turned on, since you won't receive any hints unless you choose to, and it's a good way to allay frustration when you've been spinning around the room for ten minutes without finding the next step in the puzzle, which may turn out to be in an area you didn't know there was any interactivity in the first place.  Overall, I'd give The Room Two a 7.5/10 rating - sometimes it's a bit of a pixel hunt and there are unfotunately few if any truly intellectually-challenging puzzles, but it's still a beautiful trip through an interesting world, and even if the puzzles are more of the 'search-and-apply' variety, there's still a sense of accomplishment in progressing through the game.",

The downside to this is you don't get the same 'layers within layers' of the puzzle box like in Room 1. I sortof missed the delight when a new part of the box would open or change in a unique way. Like some other reviewer have mentioned, the puzzles have necessarily been more linear (well, sortof) as different things around the room are used or found or activated. I didn't really encounter many situations where I was looking for two or three solutions at once. There were a couple solutions that I had a hard time with because the physics engine made looking at the location difficult so I missed a clue. I liked that the hints started out vague but would get more specific if you kept using them, because sometimes all I needed was a nudge in a particular direction. Overall, definitely worth playing.
