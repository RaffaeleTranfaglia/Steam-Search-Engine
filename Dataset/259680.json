            "review_text": "I've never written a steam review before but TOME is so good that I have to chime in with my 2c. This is the first rogue-like game that I've ever played and I was extremely skeptical of the genre before giving TOME a try but I can honestly say that TOME is the best game that I've played in a very, very long time, and as a D&amp;D nerd who grew up in the 80's, this game hits so many of the right notes from an RPG perspective that I have simply not been able to put it down since the summer sale and I've only played 2 out of the like 30 classes.  The replay value is through the roof and the challenge is out of this world difficult, but like Dark Souls, it mostly feels very fair and does become more manageable as you get better at the game. I can't believe I only paid something like 2$ for this game as it is worth the price of a full AAA title easily. In fact, if I was a developer who had slaved away on a mediocre AAA title this game would make me seriously re-evaluate my life choices. As far as I can tell, this game was developed by one dude, and stands head and shoulders above so many titles that took 100+ people to create that it should serve as an inspiration to hobby game developers everywhere. I can't believe how good this game is, you have to buy it.",

            "review_text": "I had sort of low expectations for this game due to the cluttered, amateurish look of the screenshots (it honestly reminds me of some of the janky Arcen games), but it blew away those expectations.  This is a roguelike, turned-based RPG with classes, races, stats, and abilities. The loot system is similar to Diablo and other ARPGs, with randomly generated loot of various qualities and special effects, along with unique loot. The art style is similar to old-school western RPGs like the Spiderweb games. An overworld map contains various towns and dungeons, the latter of which unlock gradually as you progress and complete quests.  Now, the part where this game really defied my expectations is that it provides a very streamlined experience, without a lot of the typical drudgery that goes along with games like this.  - First of all, the game itself is very intuitive to pick up and start playing without needing a tutorial. The interface is mouse-driven, no need to memorize keybinds (although it does offer fully customizable keybinds as well).  - The game seem to understand that the appeal of games like this is both the satisfaction of level progression, as well as the hunt for rare loot. Early on, you get an item that can recycle junk loot into gold, as well as a item with unlimited charges that basically provides a Town Portal effect that teleports you out of the current dungeon. This eliminates the trap that Bethesda games, for example, typically fall into, where you want to be a packrat and collect every piece of loot you come across, but are severely limited in the amount of weight you can carry.  - The game offers several difficulty levels, from unlimited lives, to several lives, to permadeath.  - The game has an 'auto-explore' button, where your character will automatically move around the current dungeon floor until it finds an item of interest or an enemy. Movement can also be control via clicking on visible locations, and your character will move to the select square.",

            "review_text": "A very good introduction to classical roguelikes. TOME streamlines some things while keeping true to the formula of old school games like Nethack, ADOM, and Brogue. There's a free version that's basically the same as the paid version - you can download it from the TOME website if you're not sure you want to buy this yet.  TOME has automatic identification. You also get an item called a transmogrification chest, which basically cashes out your loot while you're still in the dungeon - reducing the risk of overencumbrance or loot saturation. TOME also has a modern engine and tileset, although the tileset is rather ugly. Most importantly for new players, there are five difficulty settings and three permadeath settings. The permadeath settings are especially useful, because they provide the option to 1) explore with unlimited lives, 2) play the game as intended, but with limited lives, and 3) play with permadeath like a true roguelike.  While it has convenience features, TOME is still an old school roguelike. Beating it without spoilers is a large undertaking, although not as difficult as Nethack. The different dungeons/areas are all different types of difficulty and as a level one character you might wander into a powerful monster's lair and get immediately annihilated. This is the kind of game where you'll need a wiki open most of the time if you're not a masochist.  TOME is also very feature-complete. Not only is there a standard story/open-world mode, but there is also an arena and endless dungeon. The Steam Workshop opens up modding opportunities. There is a huge amount of lore (my estimate so far is at least the length of a full book). There are lots of classes, many of which only become avaiable to you once you've reached a certain point in the game, which ensures there's always something fresh. It has over a thousand achievements, which is the highest out of any game on Steam (when it first came out Steam couldn't even handle it, the devs had to work with Valve for a few weeks to get them working properly).  One thing that really spices up the game for me is the ability to play as anti-magic. There's a faction in the world of TOME that is violently opposed to arcane magic. You can join them as long as you don't use any arcane magical items or cast spells. It's not as much of a challenge as it seems because there are non-arcane 'natural' enchantments too, so anti-magic is a valid choice for story, roleplaying, or gameplay variation. It makes melee classes quite a bit more interesting and immersive.  I highly recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal for people who are interested in getting into classic roguelikes, or old roguelike fans who want to play something newer.",

            "review_text": "There is little point in writing a review for this game and even less in reading one. A nearly full version of the game is freely available from the game developer's site at  te4.org . If you enjoy the game (which I'm sure that you will), then you can buy it to unlock the last few features. If it isn't your cup of tea (you monster), then you are none the poorer.  I'll go ahead and write my pointless review, though. I have nothing better to do with my life.  Tales of Maj'Eyal (TOME) is a quirky, old roguelike that has seen a few iterations. Once “Tales of Middle Earth” it has morphed, refined, and evolved over the years stripping out the Tolkien story elements and replacing them with quasi-World of Warcraft story elements. It's still changing and improving, new patches are always under development.  I am ambivalent about the story. I like that there are no REAL bad guys, nor faultless heroes, everyone is just looking out for themselves and their own. Even the demons have legitimate gripes and may in fact be right. On the other hand it's all rather shallow, and borrows a little too heavily from WoW. Elves toy with magic out of their league, blow up planet and shattering continents, some elves turn into naga, a group of humans are trapped on another continent hounded by orcs, where have I heard this before? Player motivation is limited to “Maybe there is treasure there?” and “I heard a rumor about this place, maybe there I can murder something?”  Honestly though, who plays a roguelike for the story? Gameplay is where TOME shines and why it is probably my favorite game right now. TOME is a self-declared “tactical roguelike”. You'll need to carefully manage cooldowns and move around the battlefield to survive. Some of the bosses can really tax your ability to juggle offensive and defensive spells.  There are many classes to try, no two of whom play the same. Some classes are great at jumping on opponents and soaking damage, others can dance around the battlefield dodging arrows and picking enemies off one at a time. Even the mages have a great variety, from the long range nuking elemental Archmage to the short range heal-and-shield celestial Anorithil.  This game also sports a massive amount of mods and player content. People have created new classes, races with unique starting areas, and additional quests. Check out the steam workshop but also the developer's site, as some people only post their mods there.  My biggest gripe is that the game is a little too random. There are too many stats and most of them are worthless to any given character. Multiple times I've gotten to mid-game without finding any useful gear, either from drops or shops. Rares, opponents with player abilities, and random bosses can be obscenely powerful, some can't even be killed and you have to run away from them.  As for the DLC they are both great additions and should be purchased. One warning, the new classes added to the game can make certain rares really tough if you don't know how to handle them. The Embers of Rage campaign is a sequel to the base game and might spoil some of the story for you. I recommend buying the base game first and purchasing the DLC once you have beaten the game at least once.",

You might've tried some but have been put off by their sheer complexity and extremely steep learning curve, so you've come looking for something a bit less complex, something that offers a good entry to the genre.  So the question is whether this game can be considered as such? In my personal opinion, yes it can. It combines many elements from roguelikes (such as random generation, permanent death, statistical minmaxing, variety) and elements from modern (RPG) games (such as UI&amp;actionbar, character&amp;story progression)  For a new player the system will feel familiar and accessible enough to not put off by it while still offering deeply strategic and intricate systems for more advanced players.

Its accessable and easy to get into. numerous races and classes to play as, and you will unlock more of both as you play, even with just the base game!  Even workshop classes you can download, havent tried any of those though.  So all your dungeons are randomly generated each playthrough, but the over world stays the same im pretty sure. Each race starts in a different place and with a different backstory depending on your race and class. The main story quests stay about the same but its nice that you can tackle them in anyway you want, I still havent been able to beat the game.  One of my favorite things about TOME is the different campaigns, the base game has 3, The main one and two unlockable ones. One is a gladiator arena campaign and if you beat it with a character that character will be the last boss for the next character! very cool.   Another thing I find sets TOME apart from other roguelikes is the selectable difficulties, they not only have easy,normal, hard type selections but also there is exploration,adventure,roguelike choices where roguelike gives your character only 1 life (unless you can find magical items that add to it) to live through the quest, Adventure gives you a 'free' life after certain level milestones, so when you die with an extra life you get to choose if you want to respawn where you died or outside the area. And exploration gives you unlimited lives.  There is a lot to loot here too, all types of weapons and rarities.  All in all id recommend this game to anyone looking for a good rpg or roguelike,",

            "review_text": "(Don't be fooled with my playtime on record - I've started playing this game regularly six years ago and must have invested at least 300 hours in it.)  When we look at roguelikes nowadays, we think of a couple things - text or pixel graphics, large pool of character customization, similar design but different feel every playthrough, massive replayability. Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) simply offers the best roguelike experience one could get: deep, nuanced gameplay that is not only highly customizable and replayable but also accessible to even someone who's new to the genre.  One of the greatest hurdles that roguelike games have in appealing to the mainstream is the massive complexity that can be seen in some roguelikes. ToME, in fact, is a testament to this - featuring the most number of unique classes that I've ever seen in a game, all of which have differing playstyles and specializations, ranging from the ever-reliable warrior to shield-bearing mages manipulating earth magic to combat alchemists controlling massive golems. In most roguelikes, this complexity is rarely explained - and some would attest to finding out what X item is for as a part of the roguelike charm. What makes ToME remarkable, though, is making this complexity as accessible as possible. The tooltips for each skill, talent, or item not only gives concise, pertinent information that is easily understandable but even features some lore or description - which, in combination with in-game lore fleshes out a massive and detailed world.  The graphics also are very pleasing. They obviously are not as polished or as pretty like the Endless series (Dungeon of the Endless etc), but the individual NPC/PC tiles have a tabletop RPG feel and further help flesh the world out with great visuals. The sound shines through in this game - the background music for each zone fits the zone's theme well without distracting the player.  Replayability is also one of the major criteria that roguelikes are measured with. ToME is, in all seriousness, the absolute best value game - there are so many race and class combinations you can try, and within one class there are several ways of playing. A great non-spoiler example of this would be the Rogue, which can focus on hit-and-run stealth tactics, using debilitating poisons and tricks to bring down enemies to their knees, or using a variety of traps to contain and damage foes. One of the absolute best examples of this would be  (spoiler)    the melee/ranged hybrid Temporal Warden class, which simply has so many options and gameplay styles: Bounce around the map, doing damage and teleporting out of sight all in the blink of an eye (Threaded Combat); Summon entities to fight with you (Temporal Hounds); Bend space and time to prevent damage to you and stop enemies in their tracks (Stasis); or even focus your attacks on one enemy as you seal their fate (Fate Weaving)  . There's simply so many things you can try that even with a non-procedural map and game flow there is still almost limitless replayability to the game - if you can beat it, that is!  I've played roguelikes for a long while - coming from classics like Angband, to modern games that stretch the limits of the genre such as Dungeon of the Endless and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and to modern reimaginings and improvements on the genre - where games like Elona and ToME fall. While most modern roguelikes stretch the definition and innovate the genre in so many ways, ToME sticks close to the genre's roots and provides a high quality, high value gameplay experience. Thus, Tales of Maj'Eyal stands tall as the absolute best that the roguelike genre can offer.",

            "review_text": "I have sort of conflicted feelings about Tales of Maj'Eyal. In short, if you judge it purely as a roguelike, I don't thing it don't hold up too well. Part of the reason I may think that may be my preference for NetHack influenced roguelikes, and my lack of familiarity or appreciation for Angband influenced or Ancient Domains of Mystery influenced rogelikes, but I am not sure how much Tales of Maj'Eyal's design is based on those games.  On the other hand, judged as a RPG Tales of Maj'Eyal does a lot of things right. It has a rather interesting tactical battle system, lots of different character creation options, many ways to tweak and customize your skills, any many items to find that offer a lot of tactical death. It's story, while perhaps presented in a way that relies too much on finding and reading lore text, is at least interesting and presents a few dark twists on the standard high fantasy setting.   No mater how you judge it, the interface is great, mostly easy to use but able to do a lot, the battles are fast-pasted and fun, and it can be very addicting. The graphics are simple but more then functional enough for what they are, and there are enough interesting special effects and visual flare to make up for the more static sprites. The music is generic but memorable and sometimes can actually be pretty fantastic, even if it is more or less all part of free game music packs.   I think that is all that really needs o be said, but here is some more detail about how I think about it as a roguelike:  The big problem with Tales of Maj'Eyal's design as a roguelike is simply that the game is too long, story heavy, and not random enough. There is variation in the loot you get and the monsters you face, but the over all world is basically set. Same world map, same town, same quests. The layout of a lot of the random zones are different but the basic themes of the zones are set, and each zone has a set rank for items, a set number of floors, a set list of enemies and possible bosses. Due to how the game is balanced and how enemies never respawn except in a few cases, it's basically required to repeat every zone and sidequest each run or you end up drastically underleveled very quickly, and due to each zone having fixed level requirements you can't even vary the order that much.   Although you actually have multiple lives before dieing in the default mode, permadeath still is a problem and when it happens you have to start over from he start and go through the same old stuff you already saw again. There is a mode where you can simply have infinite lives, but I kind of wish there was some kind of middle ground, perhaps a way to start over with a new character but with a number of story events that carry over and alter the world. There is a unlock system that adds new races, classes, skill trees, and other things, and that helps, but it still only adds so much and may of the unlocks are obscure or tedious.  I also have a problem with a lot of the streamlining or elimination of a lot of roguelike staples potions and scrolls are gone, and instead characters can equip a number of infusions or runes that can be used over and over again but have a cooldown timer between uses (actually every skill and magic spell in Tales of Maj'Eyal uses cooldown timers, I am not really a fan of them but it works). Wands and other tools work in a similar way as well. This eliminates stockpiling of consumable items, but also eleminates the sort of careful rationing of your resources you need to worry about in other roguelikes.  It's only logical because of this that the whole item identification game is gone and no items have overall negative effects, eliminating the kind of risk vs reward of using items in a panic. Many people may not like needing to worry about identifying stuff but the feature exists in roguelikes for a reason, the same reason randomized levels exist, to make sure you can't just win with rote memorization, and so every action you take has to be done very carefuly. Roguelikes since the original Rogue have always been about exploration and experimentation and the whole idea with unknown items was a big factor in that.   But again, despite all of these things I don't like about it as a roguelike, I still think it's a really good RPG. Maybe there isn't really that much of a difference, most roguelikes are basically RPGs after all, I just thought I would share my feelings on the subject.",

Not to mention this game is just sopping wet with lore that, if you actually take the time to read through, is pretty damn interesting. In short, it's been an amazing experience so far. If you're a fan of the classics like ADOM then I couldn't recommend this enough.  One of the things I absolutely adore about this game is all the unlockables. In a genre in which you can die fairly quickly or lose hours of progress over one stupid mistake, you need good amounts of replay value to keep you rolling characters. This game does that pretty well with tons of unlockables. You not only have races, classes and talent trees to unlock, but also prodigy unlocks that'll give every character you roll items like the transmogrification box which automatically picks up junk items and turns them into gold.   There's a fairly good variety of dungeons in this game. Not only in style and layout but in the ways you can go about progressing in them. I found myself in a cave with no hallways filled with passive worms that chewed up sections of the wall. In order to go to the next room you needed to follow one of these worms and if you stuck around in one of its tunnels for too long it could collapse on you. Made for a really intense boss fight at the end. Not to mention each dungeon is filled to burst with it's own lore which is definitely a plus. A lot of them have little challenges too in the form of rooms behind stuck doors. If you choose to open these doors you're usually faced with tough monsters and traps, but also some pretty fancy loot. It's completely optional so if you're struggling to get through a dungeon then it's just not worth it.  In the time I've been playing I haven't been able to find a whole lotta quests. It seems like half the people you talk to early-game are all looking for potion ingredients but the rest were actually pretty interesting. I found a secret door in the overworld that took me to a rogue's den where they captured a merchant. You have the choice of joining the rogues or freeing the merchant which unlocks a rare items shop in one of the towns. Later-game quests get more interesting as well.  Teaching someone how to play your game is very important. It's something I think about every time I play a game and it can ultimately ruin a player's experience early on if they have no idea what they're doing. Now this is especially difficult with games like this that are filled with content and complexity. The solution? Unlockables. This game gives you the basics of each different type of class to start off with. This keeps the player from being overwhelmed with options at the beginning or the advanced know-how to play the more strategic classes. It also gives the player a goal early on to keep them playing. I had no trouble at all learning how to play this game. If you're new to roguelikes then I don't think you'd have troubles either.  I think my only real gripe with this game is the random escort missions you get on some dungeon floors. They're great in that if you do manage to escort them to their portal, you get a pretty decent reward. However, their ai is absolutely ridiculous. They tend to blindly trudge slowly towards their portal and tend to get themselves trapped between monsters or just refuse to run away from some of them which is double bad if you're a ranged class. There's a mod in the workshop that helps with this problem but the problem's still kinda there, you're just able to make them wait in one spot for x amount of turns.  All in all, this game is fantastic. The amount of content you get in this game is astounding, too. Even it's DLC is soaked in content. Not to mention the price is pretty damn reasonable. If you're into roguelikes then there's no reason not to pick this up. If you're trying to get into roguelikes but are left feeling empty playing roguelike-likes or games that claim to have 'roguelike elements' expecting to get that same rush playing NetHack then you owe it to yourself to play this game. You can tell the developer put a lot of love into it and they deserve every cent they get.",

Prior to playing this, i weren't really into said kind of games, thinking those're boring. This game were my first try, and today is a game i often play when i'm bored.  Pretty simple at the beginning, you choose a class, a race, a name and a gender, then the gamemod (you'll unlock them as you play) and the difficulty/lifes for your character, with complete freedom to choose between some easy and relaxing way to start understanding how the game works, or to begin with an insane journey with only one life that you'll probably lose very soon. As i mentioned, you can unlock other gamemods while you play and complete certain tasks, and same thing is for other classes and races to have further plays with, trying out new playstyles and techniques.  It can be an unfair experience most of the times, even when playing with a standard difficulty and with a set amount of lives,   so don't try to get too upset when losing your character from a single killing blow by a 'something'-caster (if not 'anything'-caster), or for losing a fight with strange unique monsters that have for some reason your same skills/spells, or by overpowered monsters that have 40 more levels than you, that appeared when moved a little harmless rock.    It's surely an experience that should be tried by those who even thinks to dislike this genre of games, because this is a new perspective that should be taken into account if you didn't liked a previous one of the same subject; this doesn't mean that this game will be valued the same way by everyone who tries it, since it still is (and always be) one of the most difficult games, where to succeed one of the best way is not to win it, but to lose trying to do it.",

The thing that really shines about this game is the character progression and creation though. Unlike traditional roguelike different classes play COMPLETELY different and indroduce new and interesting mechanics (like the manipulation of time for example). Almost every style of play is to be found here; from being a nasty necromancer and summoning skeletons and bone giants to slaughter your enemies to the time manipulating bow - dual weapon hybrid to the anti-magic 'slime mage' that posisons his enemies, summons slimes to control the battlefield and uses PSIBLADES (F***ING PSIONIC LASERSWORDS). In addition to the HUGE amount of classes, the classes themselves are extremly complex by having many different skill-trees to develop and unlock. While some people might see this as a negative I feel like this adds a lot of complexity of depth to the game and makes you able to play classes in completely different ways.  TL;DR: DO YOU LIKE DEEP RPGs? DO YOU HATE DYING TO BS AND WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DEATHS? DO YOU NOT MIND F***ING UP AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE YOU SUCK AT THE GAME?

The creatures for which this godforsaken hellhole is named are trundling by, providing the only means of passage through the thick, treacherous sand. The worms are not the immediate issue at the moment, though; this cave seems stable enough. My consternation is with the three stone piedestals that stand ominously silent before me. The game is asking me if I want to inspect one of them. I know doing so might be very beneficial in one way or the other, but these random encounters can also be vehemently unforgiving, and I'd like for Arain to make it through his present quest before he keels over.   My mouse pointer moves towards  'Yes'  and then flinches back. What to do?   Tales of Maj'Eyal is very much the roguelike I'd been waiting for. In a time when every game designer seems obsessed with pushing as many types of gameplay into a game as possible, the creators of ToME instead focus on doing this one type of gameplay really well. As a result, the game combines all the aspects that attracted me to roguelikes in the first place, putting just enough character and originality into the mix to keep it interesting without ruining the experience. If you're anything like me, you will love this.    PROS   -- Hours upon hours of varied roguelike gameplay.  -- Heaps of interesting loot.  -- An addictingly great mix of casual and involved.  -- Lots of quirky charm.   CONS   -- The random nature of the game will occasionally put you in situations where you really have no chance of survival.  -- The stat system is in some ways a bit too complex for most.  -- Pretty it ain't.  -- The interface and the controls are still a bit glitchy at times, although they have yet to cause me serious trouble.

Then the UI and interface is fully costimizable, you can even auto cast spells, such as buffs and take them off your UI!  There are various items that have unique prefix-suffixs stats and effects attached to them, much like diablo or torchlight for example.

If you don't even want to use that item, then you can convert into not just gold, but into  energy  for a special building you acuire. The progession of this game is really solid and at times depend on your race, as some races level up more slowly, but are inately stonger then others. There are plenty of random events and quests that you can undertake, yet they aren't completely random to the point of unfairness.  The skills and abilities you can accuire are amazing and unique! You can create a  gravity  mage, or a invincible sword and board user that utilizes deadly counterattacks, or even a summoner where you can sacrifice creatures for various effects or contorl creatures to make one powerful creature! Then you have player races with unique abilities as well, for example a dwarf can eventually phase through walls, and a ghoul that can basically throw up on the ground that damages enemies and heals you! Last you have prodigies that are power and unique feats you acuire later on in the game, for example you can have a effect where an attack will kill you, but you'll save yourself from death, while slowly losing life to the point where if you don't heal you'll actually die!  The main story is quite interesting and there's a ton of lore that you'll find and is quite deep. Some of this lore can help you find secrets through-out the world and clear up some of the strangest things you'll encounter... There are various difficulties available, so you can have a more casual experience by not losing your hero after he dies, or a more hardcore one where you have one life to live with stronger enemies! There are also various other adventures you can have, without downloading anything extra, for example you can enter into a arena if you just want some good old action, or if you want to have the old experience where it's just you and a dungeon, then you can enter into the infinite dungeon and never look back!  In fact, I never looked back after playing this game, and never regreted it. There are plenty of games that are not worth your money or time, and this  not  one of them due to the quality of the mechanics and diversity of character crafting.",

It offers so much for it's modest price (or no price at all, you can download it for free from the game's site). You get immersed in the world of Eyal, with it's crazy mage hunters, demons, horrors from outer worlds, full with good written lore, amazing amount of different classes and races playable with distinct gameplay. It's more beginner friendly to player then other roguelikes rpgs out there cause of its refined and easy-to-use interface, big amount of visual information available and lots of difficulty settings available, making the game more suited to your tastes! Artists made an amazing job drawing all the game tiles, world and its characters are estethically pleasing to look at, having coherent artstyle. Also i want to commend the composer of the game's soundtrack, every last one of compositions is well-tied to the locations, plot advancement and other factors involved, while being incredibly pleasing to listen to.  In addition to all above, game has an online chat and forum with a great community, always ready to talk and give you some advice. So, if you want to try yourself in genre of roguelike rpgs, ToME would be the great choice for the first experience.",

Either you steam roll over your enemies, or they destroy you. There is no in between, no tactics involved. Basically, a left click fest.  What are the effects during combat? Why can't I move sometimes? Why is it so difficult to understand what is going on (meaning what effects are affecting your character and why)?  I am sure it is a good game, but I can't recommend it.

It has several notable changes from other roguelikes, foremost it's abilities system use a variety of different resources and are mostly about managing cooldowns. There's no health/mana pot chugging here which takes some of the tedium away from stacking potions to thinking about which abilities to use when.   Also, the storyline and overworld is static, while individual level layout and most npcs are randomized. This has it's own plus and minuses. Each area has it's own lore and strategy which planning for is part of the game and you wouldn't be able to do as much for completely randomized dungeons. On the other hand, if you are like me and like to rush to your death and try as many classes as possible, replaying the same quests and areas can start getting a little boring. However the game has a lot of different content and several starting areas to help alleviate the tedium of replaying the same starting areas over and over for each character.

There is an unbelievable amount of content and lore that only keeps growing due to an active modding community and DLC from Dark God. I'm still discovering new, unexplored, areas of the game. I haven't even unlocked all the character creation paths yet. Best of all is the difficulty of this game. Any boss encounter will prove to be a challange, every encounter will become one if you raise the difficulty at all. One word of warning, this game is ADDICTIVE. I literally haven't been able to put it down since the DLC was released. Each class feels completely different. The only true drawback of the game is it's UI. At times the interface can be difficult. Some actions, escpecially in the inventory, take to many key strokes to accomplish. The menu hot keys are oddly selected too. Item information is displayed in a pretty hard to look at format. It seems the game's interface was designed with the keyboard in mind and not the mouse. The item filters need to be more specific. Being able to view the items based on armor type or weapon class would be handy. The hotbars get pretty confusing torwards the end of the game, when your character starts having more abilities than theres convinient room on the hotbar. Two, or more, active hotbars could alleviate this a little. It definitely takes some getting used to to become adept at interfacing with the game efficiently. Overall though, I would give this game the highest marks on content, lore, gameplay, and challenge!",

You're totally free to blunder into areas and enemies way out of your league and get horribly murdered, as I just did, but you can expect  most  of the enemies in an area that are your level to be beat-able.  But even if you go to another starter area you might get swarmed and over-confidently die. It's tough and challenging but with the right tactics, equipment, power selection, and a little luck you can make it fairly far and play for a while. Then you'll open a sealed door with an unspeakable horror too powerful for you on the other side and die, but be so amused and enjoy it so much you pick another class and try again.",

Anyway, this is a good game with deep lore and a lot of different possibilities. It requires a lot of reading, thinking, and well thought out decisions. This is not the game you just jump into and start hacking stuff up. You can sort of do that on the easiest difficulty, but this isn't the game where that's fun since the combat is just moving into the other target.   It's hard to explain what is good about this game, because I don't quite know. I do know I would recommend it to people, especially at 6.99 (I was lucky enough to get it for $1.74) because I am enjoying it a lot.

Combat is turn-based and somewhat similar to MMORPGs (lots of skills which use a resource such as mana and most skills have a cooldown).   The UI is intuitive and accessible while remaining quite powerful, which means that unlike most roguelikes you won't have to learn strange key-combinations to perform simple tasks.  Inventory management is relatively straight-forward, and instead of consumables players have access to cooldown-based items. No more stacking up on different potions and scrolls.  The difficulty can be set according to your own taste and you can play both the classic 1 death = game over or have the ability to gain more lives as you level up.",
