            "review_text": "This is a fun tower defense game. If you have played Orcs Must Die 1 or 2, this is a sci-fi version which does not have quite as many weapons but its still fun.  Has 4 different characters with different weapon loadouts, so if you get tired of using the same weapons you can always change character. Seeing that this is the 1st installment of the game, I think if enough people get it they will be well on there way to a winning formula.  Highly Recommend.",

            "review_text": "Fortified is a pretty fun 3rd person shooter mixed with tower defense. If you've ever played one of these before you know exactly what to expect.  Personally I enjoyed it quite a lot, especially the comic book art style and the whole martian invasion theme. It's quite charming.  The gameplay isn't bad but I imagine the game must be a little too hard for people who've never played a tower defense game like this before.  The game isn't perfect, though. Some animations are a little too stiff, the characters repeat the same few lines all the time during gameplay and the game doesn't have that many traps, weapons and maps (12 for campaign mode).  I definitely recommend it, though. Especially if it's on sale and you've already finished Orcs Must Die 2.",

            "review_text": "I originally wrote a negative review about the game, and while it does have its faults and shortcomings, after playing it more and a patch from the developers, I've grown to enjoy it. The game is very enjoyable, it's pretty to look at, runs well and smooth and coop is easy to setup and play. The developers have already released a patch and fixed a few major issues that inclined me to write a negative review initially. They did an AMA on reddit and seem like cool guys so I expect and hope for continuing support for the game.    Pros:  - The texture and model work is really well done and pleasing to look at - Pretty and orginized UI - Game runs smooth in and out of combat and is well optimized - 4 individually leveled classes add more replayability - Can manually control unit-based defenses (Go to waypoint, hold position, follow, defend objective) - 5-7 Hour 12 level campaign - Occasional bosses - Pleasantly difficult - Coop is easy to setup and play - Good balance between being a TPS and a TD - Chill and dedicated developers (so far)  -----  The game has a hint of being underdeveloped or not quite finished. It could use some polish here and there and could definitely use more content. The campaign is long, but the defenses and weapons start overlapping when you start playing new characters, leaving you with things you've already had just at different levels. I'd love to see more TD mechanics like defense attack priority, in game statistics (enemy count, defense unit stats, etc), more upgrades and more defenses in general.   Cons:  - Bland level design and lack of world detail - Character animations can look really cheesy and don't match up with movement/look floaty - Most defenses and weapons are accessible with every class - Very simple game, not a lot of in depth mechanics or content - No incoming or remaining enemy count - Can't see attack radius of all allied defenses which makes it harder to plan out defenses - Combat can feel unresponsive at times with certain weapons - Enemies and players can get (permenatly) stuck in/on world objects - No in game text chat - Cannot mute voice chat for specific players (likely to change with patches) - Only ~3 lines of dialogue for each character so get ready to have them memorized quickly - Max out character level/unlocks fairly quickly  -----   Conclusion   I recommend it. It's cheap, it's fun, and it's coop. If you're a hardcore TD fan you'll notice that the TD mechanics are relatively simple and shallow, but in the end it is a blast to play. It's a great game if you're into Action TD's and takes a lot of influence from Orcs Must Die so if you enjoyed that, there's a good chance you'll like this. I don't find it as enjoyable solo and having more people can help a ton, especially on the later levels.",

            "review_text": "I had a great time with Fortified. I must admit that the game is extremely similar to Orcs Must Die 2. However, Fortified falls short in a few ways. First of all, Fortified lacks perks, which allow Orcs Must Die players a little more customization on the front end. The game also lacks 'trap spots' in the same way as Orcs Must Die, which keeps players from creating such aesthetically-pleasing and deadly choke points. Traps, in my opinion, just never seem very organized in Fortified. There also isn't much of an environmental element to Fortified. There is no lava, ledges, mine carts, etc. However, despite those flaws, the enemies in Fortified are much more interesting and the sci-fi 50's aestethic look and feel is a lot of fun. In addition, Fortified supports 4 players, so bring the whole crew.",
