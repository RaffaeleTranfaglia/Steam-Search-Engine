I found myself missing the slot to insert a coin when I need to use the continue on my laptop to complete the feeling. It would be awesome to have a second player (or more) to join the game.",

            "review_text": "A mediocre indie shooter that was released on the Dreamcast. It's a horizontal shoot'em up that really doesn't bring anything new to the table and comes off as being very basic. The controls seems floaty at first, but I quickly got accustomed to it. The game's art direction is definitely off putting for me as everything seems too big and toyish. There are 2 tracks in the game that sound pretty good Stage 7 and the game over screen. The rest of the tracks are forgettable. The game itself is pretty bare bones with its features. There are no replays, no online leader boards, but there's at least some graphic settings and remappable options in the settings .exe.  Almost all of the stages are ridiculously easy to get through with bosses offering some challenge. The difficulty just isn't there until Stage 7 where all hell breaks loose. It almost seems like all their work in terms of bullet patterns went only to that stage. There are other shooters who have gone this route and have done a better job with it. It's definitely not a horrible game at all and playing it on Veteran really brings a new twist to the game and makes it a bit more entertaining. Buy this only if you're really into STGs and just want something to scratch that itch in between notable releases.  Also, I've played this game for about 6 or 7 hours. I must have left the game on during a weekend trip or something.",
