            "review_text": "I have played many of the Choice of Games games. So I can begin to anticipate certain story elements and what the stats are going to push me toward. The stats in this particular story seem to be entirely irrelevant as often my character would say something wildly different to how he was aligned. And the trust category seems needless as well. Two of the characters seemed to be background, necessary in one or two moments, and the major 'love interests' as they tend to be, just became background as well. Any influence my character had was entirely ignored and full decisions were made for me, forced upon me with no way of fighting it.  There could have been so much potential in taking a non-agreeing route, in preventing certain events from happening, in choosing certain other moments to follow. But overall I feel that this story only wants you to follow it's tale, not let you decide how it will truly go.",

The good parts are very good. The bad parts are cringe-inducing. I can't hate it, but I also can't recommend it. Whoever wrote this will probably write something awesome someday.",
