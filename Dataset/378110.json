            "review_text": "This game represents the epitome of 'script-kiddy hacking'. You're given commands which you can run to attempt to access restricted systems. If you can guess a valid set of credentials you can use that to gain the information you need to target the next person. Sometimes you get new scripts to run and new targets to use them on. You never need to devise your own hacks, just acquire the scripts to do what you need.  This game is clever, but sometimes too much so for its own good. (Some of the solutions are very obtuse.) It's innovative, in a very retro way. (It uses the Windows console for the majority of the gameplay)  All-in-all, it was worth picking up in a bundle and dedicating an hour or two to it. I wouldn't buy it for more than a dollar, though.",

A little short, only took 3.5 hrs with minor distractions during play, but for the price, it's worth it.   Ditto on the story at the end taking a turn for the WTF lol, but entertaining non the less!!!",

            "review_text": "This game was really entertaining, though it is short. Some of the puzzles were a little confusing, because maybe I wasn't very good at catching the clues. I like that it sends you to actual websites and videos as a means to make it more immersive. I was caught off guard at first, thinking it was an ad or something. Good job.  The screen is a bit difficult to read if you have too much text sometimes, and when I clear it, I sometimes forget what I was supposed to do (I was very sick when I played it, thus the lack of concentration and memory). Maybe not a good game for someone who cannot read line after line of text without breaks. I know, obviously, it's supposed to look like that so I can't complain.   The story execution was a bit confusing and strange, mainly because it was an unforeseen turn. For a moment, I felt like Neo uncovering a huge plot point in the Matrix until the ending kicked in. I have finished this game a few days ago and I still can't grasp who or what wrote this story but I'll assume it's out of this world.  Overall, pretty amusing game. It's not too difficult because we get hints and answers if we ask for it. It's a short game for when you're bored and have nothing to do. Though I can't say when I played it, I thought it was worth what it costs on Steam.",
