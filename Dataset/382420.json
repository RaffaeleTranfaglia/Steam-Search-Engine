            "review_text": "  The Graphics are kinda outdated, but it's good as an indie game. The story and music is ok. The gameplay and shooting mechanics are smooth and nice. World is closed by invisible walls everywhere. Multiplayer is completely dead and servers are empty. AI is probably weakest part of the game, enemies see you through walls and obstacles and your allies doesn't help at all.   Overall, nothing really in this game is worth 15$ (it's too much in my opinion), but if you will get it at discount or bundled, totally worth trying out.",

            "review_text": "The game offers no replayability, no character progression, and has a lack of content. Once you've completed the game, there's no reason to start over. There are no collectibles, no new things, and only two differents environnement. Multiplayer is fun, but after playing some games, you get bored very fast since there are no character progression, no new guns, no customization, nothing. You play a few games, and move on to a real multiplayer game. Lack of content, multiplayer has two maps and it becomes boring very fast since there isn't much to explore. The campaign has a boring environment, and when you finish the game you would want to see more, do more different things, but there isn't.",

Graphics are for a small game like this kind of ok. There where some issues of bullet being fired thru solid rocks but nothing to seriously. Sound is also ok.. A bit mediocre in quality to my own taste.. All in all this game has nothing to want me to play this more.  I would not recommend this to most people but if you want to try something new and you buy it very cheap then take a look and perhaps you'll have a bit of timekilling fun but after that you will soon forget this game...  I'd rate this about a 5 out 10 overall points..  Sorry, not recommended",

Im guessing a bunch of console gamers freaking out because the controls arent what their used to and they have zero adaptation skills.  This is a UDK game, the Unreal engine it plays like a good old fashion FPS game.  Kids........",

            "review_text": "When I watched the trailer for this game, I told myself; not a bad game, worth the money I guess. After getting into the game for only a few minutes, I can tell you gamers that it's not worth playing at this moment.   The graphic is moderate, but doesn't quite fit our gaming era's standard, especially for FPS type. The voice acting is terrible, especially for the character we're playing as who I don't know for some reason sounded like an office jockey by the way of him refering to his superior as 'boss' all the time - 'Yes boss.' 'Ok boss.' 'Sure boss.', it gets annoying honestly.  And as a shooter game coming out at 2016, I'm surprised that there's no ragdoll physic in the game, only boring death animation with the corpses disappearing seconds after the enemy's death which brings me to the AI for the enemies - their strategy of combating the player is to literally fire indiscrimnately while not bothering to take cover. They just stood there, fire at the protagonist... moved a few steps, then fire again - the cycle repeats. It felt like I'm combating AIs from 90's and early 2000s video games.  This game needs a lot more work into it. That's all I'm going to say.  ",

            "review_text": "  Not too bad for an indie game, definantly no AAA title but it has cool graphics and cool guns.  It also has a lot of flaws, the biggest being the storyline cause it just doesn't exist its like it has one but doesnt cause it has no meaning and doesn't explain what the hell is going on it only just continues like waching a movie after its already started, it feels horrible. The storyline was the biggest let down for me.  The controls need some work as they are far from sharp along with many other things but if your not bothered by those things then its not all that bad. Im Going to up-rate this cause it isn't a AAA its just an indie game",
