            "review_text": "I'm a little undecided about this one. For the most part, I enjoyed it greatly; the graphics, atmosphere and other-worldliness of it all has massive appeal. However;  - Some of the puzzle bits I found very obscure. Near the beginning of the game I spent over an hour wandering aimlessly about unable to make  any  progress. Simply because I missed/misinterpreted the significance of two tiny things. In case you are also stuck, it's   the fireflies in the mine, and the hexagon on the floor there  . - Even when I'd solved some of the puzzles I didn't really understand why. I mainly brute-forced the gems in the mine, for example; I've still no idea at all why the solution is correct. - It's not readily apparent how to drop items. (Hint; click on the item itself, not the ground.) - The controls are generally excellent; with great path-finding. However, the number of times I accidently went up and down the tower defies belief. - As others have said, it's short. Even with the aimless wandering and ladder-climbing it only took me 3.5 hours. At the current price-point that does seem lacking in content.   I'm leaving it as recommended, as for the most part it is a beautifully crafted, delightful game. To mark it as not recommended would be like kicking a puppy. But be wary of the above points, and if in doubt wait for a sale.",

I've really enjoyed playing it even though I am stuck on one eye puzzle that doesn't seem to want to be solved....  It's a solid fun game for only $12.99. I highly recommend getting it.",

            "review_text": "Pan-Pan is a short but sweet puzzle game, with artistic visuals and music akin to those of Monument Valley. It'll only take you around 2 hours (at most) to complete it, but that’s perfect for this game. It shows you exactly what the game is about, sets you free to solve all the puzzles, and never overstays its welcome.  The moment you start a new game you are welcomed with delightful visuals, calming music, and a screen pure of any HUDs, text, or unnecessary cut scenes. Outside the menus, the game uses no words. Instead, it delivers its short story through the characters’ interactions and endearing sounds. Have I mentioned how charming the music is?  Visuals and sounds aside, the game delivers a fair number of puzzles, many of which involve moving objects around or pressing buttons. The puzzles are fairly easy, but not too easy. The game also displays some visual hints, enough to push you towards the right direction, but not too much that it annoyingly holds your hands. You’re free to walk around and solve the puzzles at your own pace and in any order. However, it’ll become obvious a bit later into the game that you need to solve some puzzles before others to open up new routs or obtain items.  The game feels good while it lasts. You won’t spend much time squeezing your brain for solutions. There isn’t any replay value. It’s nothing jaw-dropping. But that’s exactly what the game is about, sort of like drinking a nice cup of tea after a long day of work. ",
