            "review_text": "First of all, if you are a fan of Weird Worlds, you will enjoy this game. It plays very much like its predecessor, but with a 3D universe map. If anything, my quibble is that it plays a little bit TOO much like its predecessor. For the record, it's been about a decade since Weird Worlds, and we are not getting too many new ideas or upgrades with Sea of Stars. The ship models are cartoony and not very impressive, but the 2D art has improved overall. The unusual weapons, aliens, and planets are just as clever and enjoyable as before. The space combat actually seems to be a little more forgiving, and as a result, is more fun. Weird Worlds was ahead of the curve and was an unusual roguelike game before roguelikes became popular again. Now with games like FTL and Binding of Isaac out there, Infinite Space III feels a bit dated and dusty. Still a great time, just don't expect anything groundbreaking. Hope to see more innovation when Infinite Space IV hits the market in 2025.",

            "review_text": "Little torn apart here wether this game is an improvement to the original or not.   So i suppose i'll meet in the middle and just say buy either this game or the original Infinite Space. You will not regret it if you like roguelike space-games for very quick gaming sessions that last from 5-30minutes. It does not really matter which game you play as you will either hate the game very soon or love it. Both have a learning curve in the beginning.   So why am i not sure about this game? UI in this game is horrible. The 3D space looks cool but it's sometimes just too hard to see properly the best possible route forward. The advantages that 3D brings are lost compared to the original 2D map. UI for handling wares, trading and combat is troublesome. and there is no longer any speed-up button for combat so now you really need to wait when approaching that big drifting hulk you want to board.   Encounters and Combat and items are somewhat the same-same as before with some changes. So no reason there to 'upgrade' if you already have the original. In the end though i will recommend this game any day - it is just so brilliantly made despite everything. Just do some home work first which version suits you best.",

Has the trademark ominus 'thunderbirds/starfox' deep space feel of the originals. New races are awesome, cool to see Flotilla and FTL references.",
