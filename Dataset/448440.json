No windowed mode, no video options at all and the game starts up with a permanent glitch with the black bars and steam overlay pop up. If you bring up the overlay entirely it wil become the black bars permanently. If you have an older plasma tv like me this is your worst enemy...  I was gifted this game from a friend as a cruel joke. I tried to play this, I really did.. Don't spend any of your money on this trash.",
