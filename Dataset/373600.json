            "review_text": " Disclosure: I helped with pre-release testing for this game, and received a key from the developer for that purpose.   If you've ever played Mommy's Best Games' best-known title,  Serious Sam: Double D , you might be interested in this, their very first release back on XBox Live Indie Games, which turned out to be something of a prototype for  Double D . Like its descendent  Weapon of Choice  is a  Contra -esque side-scrolling 'run-n-gun', but best played (assuming you're using a controller) with a 'twin stick' scheme, with the left analog used for movement, the right for aiming and shooting, and the shoulder/trigger buttons for other functions. Moreover,  WoC  helps to showcase what would become the developer's instantly-recognizable brand of creatively gaudy visual flair and dark but good-natured humor which would prove a perfect match for  Sam .  As the title suggests, the main draw here is the playable selection of hapless commandos and their ludicrous individualized weaponry, from jet engine flamethrowers to lightsaber chainsaws - while some armaments are more useful in certain situations than others, everybody can switch to a more-or-less 'normal' machine gun if they need something more general-use. You only have a couple of soldiers to choose from at first, but MIAs are waiting to be rescued in several of the game's levels, and your handy standard-issue 'spiderpack' allows you to climb almost any wall and ceiling in search of them (and the occasional delicious pie). Each member of the crew has a different double-jump ability as well, so you'll want to find and try them all.  That being said, doing so isn't likely to take you too long, since the game encompasses fewer than ten levels total, and due to its branching path structure you'll only see three of them per playthrough. On the bright side, there are a wide selection of difficulty levels to unlock if you want to (re)test your mettle; when you're first getting started things are relatively breezy thanks to the game's 'death brush' mechanic (if something's about to hit you time slows down, usually allowing you to weasel your way out of danger), but go up high enough and not only do enemies and obstacles become more difficult but 'death brushing' is out the window, so you'll be burning through your one-hit-and-they're-dead ranks quickly even with the ability to pick up and rescue a downed character once the next one shows up (in an exploding rocket, of course).  While we're on the topic, I'd be remiss not to devote a few words to the game's unmistakable sense of style. Sure, you've basically got another 'shoot all the meanie-face aliens' situation on your hands, but when said aliens (particularly the bosses) are as freakish, silly, and invariably bursting with rainbow goo as they are here you'll still enjoy filling them with hot lead/plasma/spinny blades/etc. Oh, and did I mention you're taking orders from a commander who bears a striking resemblance to a noted actor, disease mispronouncer and oatmeal spokesperson? Couple that with entertainingly droll (and skippable) bits of text, a cheese-rock soundtrack, bold colors and smooth animations and you've got a game that's fun to watch as well as play, though a handful of improvements (faster walking speed chief among them) also make for a better behind-the-controller experience than before.  As such, it's not a big name like  Serious Sam , and isn't as expansive or ambitious as  Double D  turned out to be, but one can't really blame the game nor its circumstances for that; if you enjoyed that game, or were at least somehow curious about it, I recommend giving this one a try as well. It's a bit more expensive then the other XBLIG-to-Steam ports Mommy's Best Games has engineered, so if  WoC  is on your wishlist you might want to go ahead and grab the full package, which gets you three additional games for a measly buck apiece. If you do, any time you ever need a few minutes to let off some stress and cause some nutty mayhem without being led away in a straitjacket, you're all set to go.",
