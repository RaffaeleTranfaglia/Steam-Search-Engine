The gameplay is simpler and eventually it feels less challenging. I did not find any issues in the locked framerate and performance as I'm accustomed to console experience for these types of games. Definitely if you have a friend that wants to play with you, not worth full price. I enjoyed this at a discount.",

NO crashes and NO slowdown (not even in town) so I don't understand people who complain about performance issues, crashes and supposed frame drops. I didn't even format my PC since I installed Windows in 2012... so, it feels like most of the complains come from people that can't use a PC and should just stick with consoles. There's a 30 FPS cap yes and it would be better to play it more fluidly at 60, but the game is really fun and plays perfectly, and as I said, I didn't feel any frame drops, 30 steady FPS are still good and it's the same performance as on PS4 (also, this is a PS4 port). Plays perfectly with an 360 Xbox Controller, too. Haven't tested keyboard controls but people should just use a controller with these kind of games.  The game is really fun and totally worth a 50% discount (not sure if it's worth 100% of its price though, will probably update opinions when I finish the game.)",

It actually holds its own for what it is! Doesn't try to be anything it's not, but does what it can to differentiate itself. A very competent attempt to copy the Monster Hunter formula. Not nearly enough to justify paying $60 when the real Monster Hunter is much better, has much more content, and only costs $40 with free DLC--unless you don't own a 3DS.  Even then, I'd wait for this to go on sale if you want to fill that Monster Hunter-shaped void but don't want to buy a 3DS.  That being said, there's no mouse support, x360ce requires a lot of extra tweaking just to work with this game if you don't have a native xinput controller, it's locked at 30 FPS, and has a tendency to crash unless you set the EXE to Windows 7 compatibility mode and set 'particle effects' to low.",

            "review_text": "This game has been receiving some bad reviews calling it a horrible port. I am writing my first ever steam review to say it is fact a great, very fun game. Also TLDR version at very bottom.  Negatives (Not really)  I only truly see two “issues” with this game really. The lack of mouse/keyboard, and the 30 FPS lock. The 30 FPS lock is not an issue to me as this game runs VERY smooth for me. I have had no stutters, glitches, or crashes in my 15 hours of play. Granted I have a EVGA Windforce GTX 770 4gb card, but I am playing with every setting maxed, and I feel lesser hardware should run this fine. The mouse/keyboard may been a huge problem for some people. This game is designed for a controller, and ported with one in mind, plain and simple. There are no keyboard buttons on screen, and even using a keyboard and mouse everything on screen still refers to X,Y,A,B keys. Koei has a problem with doing this on their latest ports as Dynasty Warriors 8: Empire did the same, but in reverse as it only showed keyboard commands in game. As I only use controllers for these types of game, that game did bother the HELL out of me, so I can see the keyboard/mouse community's issues here.  Positives  This is a Monster Hunter style game on pc, plain and simple if you are into that sort of thing. There a quite a few different maps to run around, varied monsters, and crafting to make bigger better weapons to slay with. The game is faster paced than Monster Hunter, but is still slower than Dynasty Warriors. Add to this a pseudo spell system and different weapon types and styles; you end up with a surprisingly deep game once you start trying out different weapons and skill builds.  The story is pretty good. Nothing super deep or profound, but it does give you a reason to kill all those demons, and I genuinely find myself liking many of the characters as you get to interact with them and learn their back stories.   Online – There is up to 4 player co-op through the games missions, and I can say it is hella fun (if you can find other people to play with). Some folks say their game had horrible online syncing, well as far as I can tell there is no server based gameplay. If the host has crap internet then you will experience lag. I hosted my own online matches, and had no issues with the other players syncing. If you want to minimize the potential for lag go into the settings and tell it to only connect to other English players. I have never seen a Japan hosted game ever run smoothly.  TLDR  If you want a fun Monster Hunter style game on pc, this game is great; as long as you don’t mind using a controller. It wont ever receive the glorious pc master race seal of approval for its port job, but as long as you aren’t “trying to run it on a potato” (a quote from my best friend) you should have a great experience with many hours of play ahead of you.",

I think the game play experiance you have depends on your computer. for some, its great, while for others it is complete garbage. Its a fun game so I'd give it a shot and if it dosent work you can always refund it.",

It's game play is still good!  The game does not have an propper keyboard support, but neither would i say the dynasty warrior games have.... as others have been saying, an controller IS required if you want to play it.  I had an few problems whit the multiplayer because i changed an setting when i started the game but fixed it... But after me and two friends of mine played non stop for like eight hours, it was realy fun, tho it'd be quite usefull if they had put an crafting function in the multiplayer lobby...  The story mode and the multiplayer are bouth realy fun! tho! the multiplayer is alot more intresting, especaly if you have the oppertunity to play whit friends while you are talking to them..  I dunno if i should put anything else in this review but so far this game exept for the crashes is one of the best games i've played so far this year ^^ i strongly recomend it!   EDIT: tried to play the game on an asus laptop wich have an nividia GeForce GTX 560M card and the game went completely yellow and messed up at any graphical setting",

Get a controller, actually follow the steps that they tell you to follow in order to get it to work, and then; as expected. It will work.  If you're salty about 30FPS then I dont give two ♥♥♥♥♥, the only reason people buy this game is because they've had it on a different console and wanted to try it on PC, so naturally, it feels pretty normal playing it. Just with much better visuals.  I have a GTX 970 and forcing all kinds of AA into the game, and GPU usage is only at 20-30% whilst still maintaining max framerate at all times. This game is optimised just fine. If you're getting low framerates without maxing GPU usage, its because you haven't managed your GPU power settings, I'm dead ♥♥♥♥ing serious, you guys haven't even TRIED to get this game to work.",

Basically you go on missions, kill monsters, get items for crafting , and repeat, I think it's worth the $60 they are asking for",

Not all controllers are fully supported (On my the triggers doesn't work at all but everything else is fine.) No rebounding buttons for the controller.  So why am I recomending this game? Becouse I like it. Becouse I know I'm gonna get well over 100 hours into this game and love the entire run. I love monster hunter style games and this is one on PC and if this shows that PC gamers want games like Toukiden: Kiwami on PC then I'm all for buying a game thats far from perfect. But again that's just me.",

Despite the hostility towards this game in other reviews, I decided to give it a shot and see how it went. I won't lie, so far I'm quite impressed. There are issues in the current state of the game, however I trust that these will be fixed, judging by the fact that the developers have already address and fixed some crashing issues.   Pros:     Gameplay is lots of fun    Voice acting is fantastic    Translation is great    Very well rendered cutscenes/cinematics    Lots of playtime    Very diverse and flexible playstyle to suit anyone    Cons:     30fps lock, however is not very noticeable when playing and does not cause input lag    Glitches where particles, effects and lighting is not rendered properly (does not affect gameplay)    Still some crashing issues and compatibility issues with Windows 8.1 (however fixable)    Appears to be some issues with keyboard/mouse, however I'm using an Xbox 360 controller   In the current state of the game, it is playable by all means, as long as you do the following:     Set all graphics settings to lowest    In your Steam client, right-click on the game, go to 'Properties' &gt; 'Local Files' tab &gt; 'Browse Local Files...' and in that folder for the 3 exe files, right-click and click 'Properties', and under the 'Compatibility' tab, tick 'Run this program in compatibility for:' and select Windows 7, also in the same tab, under 'Settings', click 'Run this program as an administrator'   So long as you follow these steps, you won't have any issues with gameplay. Have fun.",

            "review_text": "Let's start with the actual review first. I haven't gotten super far into the game yet, but it seems promising and I've been enjoying it so far. This game is basically like Monster Hunter without all the unecessary fluff. Each weapon plays different and as a game by Toei, if you're expecting combat along the lines of Dynasty Warriors, you'd be mistaken. Each weapon handles quite differently from not only just simple things like attack speed and range, but also basically having different controls for each weapon. Though some button combos are the same, the result is different for each weapon.   Now for all you people complaining about bugs, awful controls, and other stuff, the only problem I've had with this game is random crashing, which I'm sure they can fix soon enough. It also seems running in compatibility mode helps out with this. People complain about no use of mouse, but Dynasty Warriors was the same way. It just takes getting used to. My controller wouldn't even work for Dynasty Warriors but I just kept using the keyboard and I don't even care anymore. If you're that stuck up about it, go buy yourself a controller (Xbox 360 probably). It's a surprise you already don't have one if you play tons of different games on PC. Can't afford one? Not my problem, not Toei's problem. I've heard there's an issue with not being able to setup your own keybindings, and for that, I have nothing against since I myself had to change some key binding to play Dynasty Warriors on the keyboard.   Oh, and the last thing. Locked at 30 FPS? Who cares  So basically, this game is great, the only problem which is completely fixable is the random crashes. No need to whine about problems you could easily work around or that don't even matter",
