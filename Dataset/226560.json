            "review_text": "I love Zombie games, and although I have DI and DI:R in my library, I decided to give this one a shot before the others. Yes, I've read the negative reviews, and decided check it out myself.   It has often been noted (negatively) that this is not an Open World game, and for that reason, it's a bad game. Well, Resident Evil and Silent Hill weren't Open World, either. A lot of backtracking was involved with those games. Did those excellent titles suddenly become bad games? No, I don't think so.   Yes, EDA is quite linear whereas RE and SH were quite complex. But you know what - I enjoyed it nonetheless. There's a lot to be discovered if you leave the designated path. I'm still struggling with two achievements.   Another criticism that has been noted is that there's no multiplayer option. Folks, this is an action adventure with a fixed storyline. It's 100% focused on telling a background story, just like good old adventure titles. Could you imagine a multiplayer Monkey Island? This story is Cliff-centric. Introducing other playable characters just wouldn't make sense.   As I said, I haven't played the other titles yet (but I will) and as such don't know how the game blends in with the series, but as a standalone, linear, Metroidvania-style action adventure, it is good entertainment.   Maybe I'm biased because I paid 5 bucks when it was on sale.   Anyway, I enjoyed it!",

            "review_text": "Genre - 3rd Person Survival Horror (Cel Shaded) I have enjoyed every single Dead Island game released on Steam thus far and this is no exception. Although it plays differently to the FPS original Dead Island games and the MOBA Epidemic. This is more centred around a story and sees you not only trying to survive the island but your own sanity with strange events being triggered, think of a cartoony Evil WIthin. I haven't completed the game yet so don't know the full story. Although this is good as stops me from spoiling it for you.  You get to use melee and ranged weapons and you will find various key items that allow you travese more and more of the Island. Sometimes this will make you go back to previous visited areas that were inaccessible before, so make notes as you go. The graphics although more cartoony than the other games look nice, as a fan of Cel Shaded graphics. The story will keep you interested and a few familar faces will pop into the game as you progress. I am over half way through and don't think this is an overly long game, although the Free DLC adds significant new content. However, if you are an achievement hunter, there is always plenty to go back for. I got the game on sale and think the original asking price was way to high, but if you can get at a fair price and are a fan of Dead Island games I would recommend giving this a whirl.",

            "review_text": "So far really good game. It´s not the traditional Dead Island we know, with co-op, first person RPG. But its great. Art is really strange but interesting, adds some freshness into the game. Controls are also pretty decent, I am using controller for playing and I am happy. Cant give any proper words about keyboard+mouse controls, but I recommend controller. There is a prologue mission that cannot be skipped where you play as an unknown character and search through an unknown place. I must say its a really good start of a story, even I wasn't expecting. Rest of the game is set on the island of Narapela in Banoi archipelago. You play as Cliff Calo, the you son of a, I think its a reporter or someone similar. He and his friends want to uncover the mystery behind the mysterious events on islands...   *SPOILER AHEAD* Cliff stole his fathers boat to be able to sail to the islands. Cliff's friends thought they are going to visit Banoi, but when they reached the island Cliff says they are not going to Banoi. It was Narapela. The island seemed pretty peaceful, but they soon found a problem, if weren't zombies, but earthquake hit them and sunk their boat. Cliff was trying to save their stuff, but he was hit by an explosion and drowned. That's where the fun begins. Cuz i don't get it myself. *END OF SPOILER*  Also, fine launch, no bugs or crashes for me, runs great.",

            "review_text": "214 Games in my library as of this writing. While I've regretted buying some of them, NONE of them hit me like this one. $40 down the drain. If it's ever on sale for $5...DON'T BUY IT!   Let me just state that I'm one of the biggest Dead Island fans on the planet. Spent much of my life playing DI 1 and Riptide on consoles and PC. So I essentially bought the games twice each with no regrets. I've even spent plenty of hours on DI.E. So yea, I'm a fan of the franchise, but this installment is starting to make me question Deep Silver (something I NEVER thought I would do). Why they would let the Dead Island name go to crap like this and actually publish something like this is beyond my understanding.  Graphics/Sound: Looks like it was meant for tablets and smart phones. The voice acting is so bad, it's impossible to even try and immerse yourself.  Contols: Combat is terrible, stealth is terrible, gunplay is terrible. It's all just terrible.  Story: I could not bring myself to finish this game. I tried and tried and pushed through as much as I could. Aside from the technical side of things being sub par, the story itself is anything but enticing. I wanted to know the origins of the virus, but not like this. I'd rather not know than waste any more time on this...'game'.  You've been warned, Dead Island fan or not, stay away from this one.",

But this game, I felt the strong need to express my utter disappointment, as an avid Dead Island fan from the start I actually pre-ordered this with sheer excitment.  That excitment quickly went to disappointment, £35 wasted!  Gameplay is repetitive and dull, combat is clunky and just not like how it used to be, graphics look awful, maybe some people like that whole comic style look, but for me, it really took away from the game. Voice acting terrible! No ability to upgrade your weapons in the same way that you could in all the Dead Island games, or actually have any choice as to what weapons you'd prefer to use, you don't even have a choice of character.  If you - like me - are a big Dead Island fan, DON'T waste your money on this, this is nothing like Dead Island!!  UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT !!! WASTE OF MONEY !!! STAY CLEAR !!!",

            "review_text": "While I like the art style and combat of this game, I find the lack of saving or even more closely placed save spots very very aggrevating. I also feel like they should have rebranded this game as a new title rather than following dead island. It's cool how they tie in the story a bit, but overall I feel the new graphic style is offputting to most dead island fans, but as a new game entirely it would have been accepted more.  I give this game a 6/10, mostly because of the save problem. The game will let you travel a very long ways and fight many enemies before throwing you against a enemy with crazy strength with no save inbetween. If you die you will restart at the very beginning and any collectibles you got will also reset.  I also feel like this game struggles too much to try and implement jumpscares, which dead island was never about. It has a FEAR element of things popping in and out of thin air.  Unless this save situation is changed, I honestly cannot recommend this game.",
