I have been a fan of the series from the beginning.  As such it comes as no surprise that I absolutely love this game!   As usual Fallen Tree Games has outdone themselves with their smooth and stunning visuals. The game looks great, from the screen of an iPhone or a 4k monitor.  The gameplay is as Iâ€™ve come to expect, a soothing and relaxing puzzle experience. Not reliant on twitch reflexes or tricky timing, you can sit back and do each puzzle at your own pace.  I absolutely recommend this game to everyone and anyone who enjoys the challenge of a good puzzle! ",
