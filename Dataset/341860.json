Well this game is for you :)  SickBrick is simple and very short FPS, but I really enjoy it. It is pure fun. Yeah.... graphic isn't most realistic and you can find some bugs in this game but still it got something..... soul i think.",

Pros: - Unique style and appearance  - Simple mechanics - Easy to play  Cons: - Lack of dialogue in the middle of the game (the end would've been so much better if there was a bit more of a story :\\) - No real challenge, I wanted to see more chambers if they were going to do some make a few challenges but there were only a few chambers so that felt really disconnected.  - Builds off of the last one, it feels a lot like Portal, up until the end. More dialogue from Brick would've helped that.  All in all, not bad I enjoyed it.",

You’re forced to do tests for an unknown robotic mastermind. Destroy hundreds of hostile robots with a wide variety of weapons on a strange alien planet. Jump in a hover-tank and wreak havoc on giant boss enemies. As you go through the tests, you slowly unravel the story through log files of previous test subjects.'  The truth IMO SickBrick is a dull fps with more roblox like graphics and a cheap short story, the log files are useless TOTALLY USELESS, 'I found some stuff I better stay here and die, the end.', There is some male-voiced robot that speaks some useless stuff, and the main objective is kill, go there, kill, go there, kill, go there. Also there's mentioned a wide variety of weapons, 5 WEAPONS is A Wide variety ? Really ? No, I do not recommend this 'Game'  EDIT: Somebody doesn't like the review, probably the Dev.",

            "review_text": "SickBrick is a old school fps that takes place in a testing facility similar like Portal. This means that the maps could have been design like they wanted with the only restriction that it would fit in a closed environment. But what they have done is just make empty rectangle hall after hall. The game doesn't have great art style or graphics and looks kinda dull. The enemies look and are also boring. They are all uninspired robots that are slow too kill. It's either that they have high health or the weapons are weak. The controls do their job. The feeling you get from the game is the start of a roguelike fps games(like Tower of Guns, Paranautical Activity, Fancy Skulls) without it being a roguelike. And all the normal old school fps are miles better with better map design and more fun gameplay.",
