            "review_text": "The only bad point of this game is that it is way too short. Too much fun packed in so few hours of gameplay. I really had a ton of fun playing that game, though I was sad after less than 15 hours, I reached the end. :( It's a very casual, relaxing game, to play when you don't want to break your head with complicated stuffs. It's worth way more than what it's priced at, especially when in sale at less than two dollars...So don't hesitate and give it a go. I'm really hoping to be able to play this again, either with added DLC or another version of it.  Only a little glitch with the quest I found is that if you don't do a certain quest (for example the humanitarian box to fill) before you change location, the quest doesn't go away, and there is no way to actually complete it.",

            "review_text": "Hello All,  First for the price you get a much more involved game than you would think. So far I haven't seen any bugs that I can tell, and its got good game play.  This game has one major drawback that I didn't see others mention, the constant clicking. You have to micro manage everything, constantly. Now most of us are used to that in some fashion in these type of games, but this is where the short cuts where taken, no matter what about every 20 seconds you have to click on everything that produces food, water, or cash, as well as all the resources that respawn for your workers to go harvest/collect. This gets old fast. clicklety click click click. Thats all you do in this game. keep clicking on the same tree, bush, same everything every 15 to 20 seconds as it respawns.   Even using the resources you gather, every few seconds click on the kitchen, to make more stuff, no auto queing. After 10 hours I was clicked out. Just way to much clicking. That said, if you can suffer through that, the rest of it is as others said a fun little game.   if the workers would be auto gather on where you send them once, and the wells, tents, and grills would auto collect after the first upgrade, that would make the game much more tolerable.   Edit the next day ... ok so once you get to level 19 ... you get a reprieve from most of the clicking. They finally give you a perk where you only have to click on one tent, or one water well, or one brazier, and you collect everything from them all. Also by that time, you aren't so desparate for collecting the respawning wood stone and food as much so the game play is much more enjoyable.   I finished the game today ... nice game, well wortth the price, but i don't see any real replay ability. I also got the feeling like I had played this game before or one very very similiar.   I would highly suggest they patch this and put that once click resource perk so you get it before you leave the first island, that would really make the game play much more enjoyable.  Also for you planners who like to max resources before you jump to the next new place ... um as far as food, water and cash go ... don't bother , you basically start over each time. When you get to the third place .... thats when its worth really going for it, and purchasing most of the big stuff.  Enjoy, looking forward to a second one.",

            "review_text": "Fun casual game. A little bit of everything and well worth buying, especially on sale. If you enjoy the build, collect, mini-quest, mini-puzzle type of game, this is for you. Promised Land is my very favourite of the genre so far (and arguably goes beyond the genre), but this predecessor game provides several hours of engaging relaxation. Some moments of humour, although the story is relatively superficial (but it's not supposed to be literature!).  Yes, it does look and feel a little bit like a Facebook (or similar) game, but it's nicely put together and I enjoy playing these games outside the freeware - 'must have a hundred online friends help you unlock cool stuff - or spend money' - setting.  The interface is slightly sless intuitive than I would have liked, but still quite good. Recommended.",

            "review_text": "I was going to recommend this game because it's cheap on sale, I finished it and it wasn't too bad an experience. And then I remembered how lazy the graphics were, how bad the English was (yes, there are attempts at a story... Just expect a Z-movie-level of cringy dialog), how unrewarding some of the mini-games were (match-3 is super easy and gets boring quickly, fishing is annoying as hell...), how ridiculous the concept is (why does the game ask me to build a chip factory to make money so I can fix a crane, BTW? Surely the chip factory costs more time and money to build than just fixing a crane?!), and how long my sentences can be. To top it all, the ending is just a composite picture of all the characters (nothing we didn't see before), and if you want credits you have to watch them from the main menu. No incentives to replay this, so this gets a no-no from me.  If you're interested in a MUCH better game using the same mechanics (time management + single area + many workers with many quest), I'd strongly recommend you check out The Promised Land instead. 'Finders' doesn't hold a candle to it.",
