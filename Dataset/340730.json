I will leave you with four words -&gt; 'get the steam patch'  (O_O) (O_-) if ya know what I mean..............

            "review_text": "I have put quite a few hours in this game and would like to offer my $0.02. My review will cover several topics including Art, Music, Writing, Stat management, and other little bits. (overall rating: 5.5/10) The game is NOT bad, but it's not good.  The concept of the game is great and allows for 4 different playthoughs. In the beginning you are very engaged with the other characters Chigara, Asaga, Ava, and Sola. Overall the stories are OK, but I will go into Sola's Arc a little more specifically because i was seriously dissapointed with it compared to the others. The game does have h-scenes that can be installed by a patch. I'm not really into the whole 'hentai' thing, but i always advise that one should install the patches just for the sake of having the complete game and not missing out on any information. Without the patch certain scenes will pop up with a blue error screen instead of the normal screen. (because theres boobies duh)  Art The art in this game was very well done. All characters have been well drawn, the scene backgrounds are fantastic, and the characters don't just stand in the same position. The charactes move around as the conversation continues, allowing for a more fluid/realistic feel of the game that keeps your attention. Verdict- 8/10   Music I never found the music in the game to be repettitive or annoying. It was implemented well and very fitting to the situations they are for. There are a total of (I think) 63 music files. Verdict- 7/10  Stat Management The stat management in the beginning of the game is not bad at all. There are constant encounters with the 4 girls that helps the game flow smoothly. After you choose a girl to pursue, the game evolves into a mindless grind. There are less encounters with the other characters as the game progresses and it makes the game very hard to play. Be prepared to grind the heck out of school, club, and then free time because each of the playthroughs lasts at least 6 hours if you take your time. Verdict- 3/10  Sola Arc *Spoiler alert* Sola's arc was a very well thought out idea that she is the 'shadow' of another preson in an alternate universe so in theory she shouldn't exist. She has these 'disconnections' that occur throughout the story that seem to stopped by the power of love (So cheezy). There seems to be a god/being that can allow her to coexist in both your universe and the origional universe that she is origionally from but for no real reason the god/being decides to not allow it until you undoubtedly prove your love and dedication for her. My main gripe about Sola's story is that it never goes into detail about the god/being at all. Even though it has full control over Sola's existence it never states what it exactly is and only has a few lines in the entire game. Also it seems that either the company ran out of time, money, or patience when releasing the game becasue all other endings include a nice summarization of your future along with pictures. Sola's arc did not. It is a very forced ending that is accompanied with a black screen. A crappy way to end what could have been the best story line of the game.",

There's alot of that, yes, but what amazed me is that the story was actually really good. Each route has a really different and interesting story that got me pretty emotionally invested in it. You can also get a patch that implements the lewd scenes back into the steam version, so that's definitely a plus. The only main problem I really had is that it took me about 12 hours to complete a single playthrough from very start to finish. There's also times where the story isn't very well spread out and feels light in some areas. At the time of this review I've completed two routes and the endings were both fairly satisfying and wrapped things up quite nicely in my opinion. I plan on finishing all 4 just because of how good the first 2 stories were. If you're looking for a dating sim that has a decent story, I totally recommend picking this game up.  TLDR: Good story and some lewd scenes. Totally recommend.",

Of course I want to thank producers for 'content restoration patch', it is not really common on Steam I think. I hope that rest studios will follow suit and release similar 'patches'  I'm not played many VNs (except Key's ones - I love them all), I bought it because I saw many positive comments from players which spent 50+ hours and I don't regret it at all.",

            "review_text": "I should start by saying that I have not played the previous Sunrider game, so the nostalgic effect was lost on me, although I did pick up on several references nontheless that I found amusing. Management sims like this are kind of new to me, so it took me a while to get into it, and I had to lower the difficulty to helper mode.   The story was mostly good (keep in mind that I played the Ava Route), although a few scenes seemed kinda strange, like the plot was being forced for one reason or another. The pacing was slow. There are 500 days in this game, but sadly most of them didn't have anything interesting going on. Now I'm not saying that every day should have had something going on, but a bit more here and there would have been more than welcome, and I do hope the developers intend to flesh things out in the future.   The music was fantastic. There were several times when I stopped playing simply to listen. Some tracks start to feel repetetive, but like I said, 500 days... so I'd be very surprised if nothing started to seem repetetive.   Overall, I'd say the game was good, but could use some work, and I know it has the potential. A few last things to note:    - The game seems very stable. I only ran into a couple of bugs, neither of which were game breaking, or even annoying at all, really.   - There are plenty of spelling/grammar mistakes, and these seem to increase in frequency as the game continues.   - The interface could use some work. The buttons have a square hitbox (or whatever you call it), yet the buttons are hexagons, so you may often click on a menu you didn't want.   - The rewind feature seems to get confused when rewound to the first line of a scene, which is when it's most needed. This doesn't really cause much issue though.  - What kind of sound is mou?! Do they all have cow accents? I don't understand!  - What in the galaxy is holowear?! I need to know!!!  It may sound like I'm being hard on the game, but I really did enjoy, and I hope to see some improvements to make it even better. And I fully intend to try another route. Maybe they'll even add more of those. (No, stop it James, you're getting greedy!)...please.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: Steam botched up my hours played and says (as of this writing) I only have two hours. I timed myself. I played for 5. Not saying it makes a huge difference, but I'm stating it to credit my experience with the game so far.  I was a bit put off by this game at first. I was afraid it would end up being another one of those graphic novels in the guise of an actual game, however after reading a few existing reviews I bought it myself and was pleasantly surprised. This is a management game with actual gameplay, even if it is all revolved around being in the right menu at the right time and clicking words.  I also wasn't very impressed with the character designs. Having a girlfriend that draws constantly, I've learned to pick details out of designs, and there wasn't anything overall impressive with these. However, this is due to a combination of setting, and the fact that the characters you meet in the game are more than just their appearance.  Sunrider Academy takes place, as is obvious, in an academy! Your job as the player is to take the role of a club manager, and to help several misfit, down-on-their-luck clubs get their members count, morale, and skills up in order to prevent them from being discontinued. You also have to simultaneously keep your own skills up and complete your school work, as you are still a student. There's also this, arguably unnecessary, sub objective in which you need to get a girlfriend out of all of this, and since each club you help is being led by an adorable anime waifu, your not exactly short of girls to woo.  If you already are into these kind of games, you'll more than likely find yourself completely invested in both the characters and the gameplay in a matter of 30 minutes. They aren't the most original or well written characters either, but they are charming enough to keep you interested. There are some genuine moments in the story and dialouge, though most of my time was spent figuring out what the bloody â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I should do to keep my characters stress levels down!  My first two hours went by alright, as I helped get each club in order and even helped two of them win bronze and silver in competitions, but this was quickly lost in shambles as I neglected to find a consistent way of keeping my characters stress low. I tried playing games, sleeping early, buying eroge, but some of these actions cost money, which required a job, which adds more stress, which eventually spirals into you getting sick and then getting the 'Bad Ending' of you being hospitalized. I know it's mostly my fault, but the RNG didn't exactly make it easy for me. Just be warned, it's definetely a game of patience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However this did end in my dumbass forgetting to save for over an hour, and having to restart quite a bit of progress.  Overall, the art is nice to look at. There is no voiced dialouge, but the music is pleasant to listen to, and the gameplay can be addicting. Just don't try to take it too fast or you'll end up in a disaster like I did.",

I was skeptical at first but after playing the demo, I was hooked. I instantly purchased it (off sale) and do not regret it.   I've hit bad ends a few times and was forced to restart and try different things a few times. I am currently in Sola's arc and haven't done any of the others yet. If you minus the time from my bad ends, I'd say I am roughly 10 hours into game Sola's arc and still 4 months left to go. So if the other girl's arcs are anywhere as long I'd say this game translates to roughly 40-50 hours of gameplay. Shorter if you make a save with all arcs unlocked by following a guide, and lower the difficulty.   I have been playing in original (normal mode) not waifu (god mode). The difficulty options are there for those who like a challenge, and I will be playing in space whale (hardest) difficulty for that last achievement sooner or later.  I do not regret paying full price for this game, and do recommend it. This developer stays true and makes it easy to uncensor if you wish for that. Which I respect, definitely a step in the right direction, towards the fight against censorship. Also since the first 2 episodes of Sunrider are completely free, it is about time they make some sort of profit. Keep 'em coming, can't wait for Sunrider Liberation Day!",

Can you surivie all 10 months while getting good grades, bring glory to your school/clubs, and getting a girlfriend. Yes, yes you can. While it is a fun game to play it lacks content, while I fnd most big budget games lack content (Cough Cough EA Battlefront) , I usually see low budget games try to add as much content as possible. I found myself just constantly skipping through some weeks so bored cause there was little to do. I wish they had added more content in to do in your down time like visit your friends/girlfriend. I also wish that you could have detailed conversations with your friends when you saw them randomly, instead of the same old dry response. It would have also been nice to still see them after 10 affection, because once everyone had 10 affection I never saw anyone other than my sister or when there was an event where there was stuff going on.   Did I enjoy the story yes, It was a nice add on to your story where you lived in a more peaceful time than the events in Sunrider, I enjoyed Ava's story the most, even though its been used before it was nice. Some scences with her made me cry and think about my life and what the purpose of life was, and our goals in life. I was finally glad when Ava warmed up to me and then pushed me away which made me sad, but then Kayto and her got close again. *Spoiler* I love Ava's ending, you rush into her room on graduation day to your despair only to find its empty, so naturally Kayto thinking Ava has abandoned him,goes on a mission to find her only to find out she was just ordering new stuff. You then precede to hug her and cry (Which was cute) then your wipe those tears away and pretend to be a smooth operator. Then you and Ava finally get married and live in your childhood apartment... with your sister (for no reason) heaven forbid your sister gets out of the house. So overall after all the tears and personality. I was happy with my ending with Ava.  Also the music is great, gets a 10 outta 10 in my book. It is really nice and fits the mood of every scence, it is peaceful and then dramatic when it needs to be. With so many songs, there is a song for every occasion, and even though if you take too long it will repeat it self, it just sounds so nice you wont care.   So if you love anime, syfy, romance, and really good music, Buy this game.",

I'm not exactly sure, but once you get club stats around I'd say 50+, you're set.  Since this is a stat management game, the rest of the days will be spent clicking on locations, trying to trigger the VN scenes, which a majority seems to occur on specific days marked by the calendar. It can be repetitive obviously, and I've already seen the guides on here, where you can modify the game and skip to each of the scenes.  I'll admit that even though I enjoy stat raising games, I just wished the developers had introduced the VN scenes by having you click on the location the girl's appear most at, rather than just waiting for specific dates. Other than that, I don't have a problem with anything else about the game. It's pretty polished, and grammatical errors are rare.  I actually bought this game because I heard the title screen's soundtrack in one of Charon's games, and wanted to see how, if at all, it was going to be introduced. Though after playing through it, I'm definitely going to end up buying the rest of the series, when my wallet is filled back up again. Maray kinda looks similar to Mayuri from Steins;Gate, my favorite.  So sticking through the game, even though the intro was kinda boring at the start, was ensured. I also want to thank the developers of this game for making their restoration patch simple, unlike some other visual novel studios.

This is far from what i actually got.  Sunrider Academy is a tedious slog of repeating the exact same daily events with the exact same text, over and over again ad nauseum. The only respite is the occasional conversation with one of the main characters, which consists of them saying hi and you selecting a chat topic  which then ends the conversation .  The biggest problem i found is that the interactions with the characters happen very infrequently, often not at all for days at a time in the game, you'll find yourself repeating those tasks over and over just waiting for a club competition to take place, or someones birthday, or a holiday event so you actually get some of the story.  90% of the game is based completely on RNG, your job, classes, club activities / recruitment etc are all RNG based as to whether you succeed or fail no matter how you do your stats. Which is a big negative for me in a game supposedly based on stat management. For me the game also crashes constantly on Windows 10 forcing me to literally save after every few actions or lose my progress.  While the storyline is good when you get parts of it and the characters are quite likeable, i feel i can't recommend this game based on the issues outlined above.",

            "review_text": "Perhaps I'm guilty of expecting too much from this game. The conversations are very linear with choices being few and far between. The characters rarely change expressions during conversations. Would it kill the developer to draw a few more pictures? Often nothing of the scene changes except the character's mouth.  The game requires little thought and too often I find myself clicking away through 'activities' and conversations without reading since the story requires little to no input from the player. The only reward for wasting your time is a few nude photos and those can easily be found online.",

            "review_text": "So this game look cool. And it was at first. But it soon becomes boring when you realize that day after you're spending time clicking and clicking and clicking doing almost the same routine just waiting to get on with the story. I was hoping for more story parts to thrown in with the stat managing to cut back the monotony. Even using the dev console to max out stats so I don't have to care, and even playing on Waifu mode doesn't help. I have finished one girl's route and it flet like a grind constantly.  The game can have you go in-game weeks of clicking and clicking for sat gains with 0 story going on. It gets very very tiresome and I tried doing a second route, full cheat mode on and everything, but I just can't. There's too much time spent away from story development. This could work with the stat managing but nothing new was done. There's too much down time and it gets repetitive really fast. And once you get all girls to 10 hearts, you won't even get little breaks from the same grind by randomly finding them at a location and clicking a conversation button. It was at least something but once you hit 10 hearts on all, the game starts to feel very empty. I want to love this game, and I want to reccomend it because I love the character stories/arcs. But it's far too much of a hassle. A standard VN I can do with just clicking over and over but that's because I'm reading dialogue. I'm reading the story. But this click-a-thon simply has too many dry spells of no new developments. After your first tournaments with each club, there's not much more dialogue for future tournaments or even them acknowledging they took home the gold, or won nationals or won the Galactic Tournament. I want feedback for how well I'm doing but the game doesn't give me that. My clubs are the best in the Galaxy, but no one even acknowledges it! I sadly must say no to reccomending this game.  TLDR: The game has a good story and characters that interest me, but it's spread too thin to make it worth playing through the clicking grind more than once.",

            "review_text": "To summ. first: Not enough explanations. No good stress balance over the second difficulty lvl (from 6). No good way of building up the relations (halfrandom smalltalks where you always only press on the topic, she responds with 'I like' or 'I don't like' and than go your way). I played until the fourth month by now. I'm going to reduce the difficulty on waifu lvl or 'baby' as I call it. Maybe than I can have fun.  1. It's not explained what the skillpoints are for.  2. I was on the third difficulty level and stress reduction was a pain in the ***!  3. It's not said when exactly you loose if you don't have a GF to a certain moment (but they don't stop telling me that i will loose if I fail my exams 3 times. Who would have expect that?!).  4. Aparently I can build up a relation but I have no sort of index that shows me how far my relation with a girl is by now. First i thought all events with girls just trigger at some point and that all the smalltalk is completly useless. And thinking so I have to say, makes the game booring cause managing the same things every day is almost acceptable but if you have the impression that the conversations you have sometimes are useless... Oh boy that makes it realy lame.  5. I have no clue if even making other girls happy while you want to date one other, will erase every possibility to go her 'path'. Not explained either.  6. I mentioned that this game lacks explanation. They explain realy precisely what stress does to you though... Cause you get it by everything. The balance between getting and loosing stress is, in my eyes, not existant.   7. I like the style of the game and for many peoples it makes a lot of fun. I suppose i'm just to stupid for it but it is the JOB of the developpers to explain the game so even dummys like myself can play it without having questions the whole time. Also it takes so much time to play it that if you want to reload it feels like days (reallife time) you have to replay. I think there are only manual saves so... Yea 'for the love of God' think of saving or don't loose!   8. I had much fun time on the second difficulty level until I just lost cause my sister is disapointed about me having no GF. It was not on Agenda though. I lost many weeks cause of that and than I tried to get a relation working. I mean I tried to trigger more relation conversation or whatever I should call them. I just tried for some weeks cause I was than again worrying about my stress (good stuff yo rofl), the fact that i NEVER become new members for the science club (all others were no problems but HOLY **** this science club!!) AND my stupid little sister and her GF plans for me.  9. I can't decide when to trigger conversations. The useful ones. I just wait until they come. I had no problem with that until I lost cause of my sister. Now i want to talk with a girl but I always get smalltalk IF I SEE HER and otherwise I don't even find her at her usual place.",
