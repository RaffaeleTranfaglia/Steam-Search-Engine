            "review_text": "I am 50 years old and not much of a gamer, but enjoy simulations of all kinds, which Assetto Corsa is. They are a small group of people and do a good job listening to us. They have improved this software so much in the past year that I had to update my review.   One thing I am sure, from hearing about what others are describing about AC, is that each hardware setup (computer/wheel/screen/vr) behaves a little different.   Then of course there is the settings (comuter/wheel/software). So much can be gained or lost here.   Go through (assettocorsa ini) file and set everything to your computer/wheel.   I got Razer Cortex, which shuts down background apps and Malwarebyts, which cleaned hundreds of pups.   Download the (Anti Clipping and Fanaleds) apps for your wheel.   REFLECTIONS set down to low and static reflections set to very low, may help.   I find it harder to drive in game than a real car so be patient and be aware of your speed. 50 mph in-game still feels like 30 mph to me.   I still have to remind myself of the power I have, without any repercussions to the $500 000 car or myself/public property. I had a V8 Vega (300+ horse, curb weight 2500 pounds), could, at times, leave me shaking for the rest of the day. I could only imagine the skid mark a car like the LeFerrari could cause in your underwear.   Assetto Corsa's physics really are incredible.   This is getting very real. Assetto Corsa is worth all the money and time.  One other thing that has me so addicted is the track and car mods.   Checking to see what is new every day is one of my favorite things to do. Just try searching Google Image 'Assetto Corsa car mod downloads' and see for yourself.   I can't emphasize this enough. Sim guys are some of the nicest and most helpful people from all over the world.  The guy's at Assetto Corsa must love what they do and it shows.   Have fun. Paul",

            "review_text": "Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.  The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.  AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.  So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.  I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.  If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)  If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.  Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.",

            "review_text": "Kunos Simulazioni came under a lot of criticism from most sim racers for their previous title NetKar Pro, but they have learned from that experience as Assetto Corsa is an outstanding racing simulation. The early release of Assetto Corsa has satiated the long awaited sim racing community, as the beta and bi-weekly updates kept everyone satisfied.   Sim racing fans will argue about who has the best tyre modelling, most accurate tracks, physics and visuals, but Assetto Corsa has managed to take all that and package it up in one great racing sim, with a top-notch physics and sublime tyre modelling, spending time with each car you will appreciate the nuances of the physics each vehicle has to offer.   The visuals speak for themselves, crisp, clean and easy on the eye. The tracks are accurately modelled and replicated from laser scan data. The force feedback, even after logging on a solid amount of hours, is appreciable with subtle feeling still surprising me.  On top of the regular developer created content, Assetto Corsa already has lively modding scene, making third party tracks and cars, so the future is really bright for this sim and I don't doubt most will still be playing this in years to come.  With a great core, Kunos Simulazioni has proven that they have built Assetto Corsa into a successful racing simulator. ",

Pulling out a huge successful slide or racing with sweaty palms for victory, this game delivers that all with tremendous success.  The driving physics are as real as they can be, and that for me is top priority in a racing sim. Pulling slides in a 458 makes you feel the same kind of excitement that I would presume Chris Harris feels when he reviews cars (even though he is from another planet when it comes to driving). After over a year of playing it's just getting better and better with more content to come. Awesome mod community with a lot of potential to add even more content makes this a must have racing sim.   If you like cars and driving, you'll love Assetto Corsa. Benchmark for all racing games, for years to come. And referring to Mr. Chris Harris: 'This is MEGA!'",

I was impressed by Project Cars, had to buy a steering wheel to play it though, unplayable with gamepad. But Assetto Corsa is ages ahead of any street racing game. The tracks really do feel right, they are laser scanned, the cars feel right, the street feels right and it's totally playable with a gamepad too. The game engine graphics is amazing, you can play with really high grapchics and have a constant of 60 FPS. Congratulations to the dev team of Kunos Simulazioni. 10/10.",

The game allows you to pick from a wide array of cars and tracks, and gives you the option to change each car's setup to your liking. Mod support means that you'll have plenty of community content to mess around with as well. DLCs also add more cars and tracks if you're serious about the game. The only negative I can think of is that people report a lot of 'rubber-banding' and other latency issues during online play.",

Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.  I emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.",

I'm in my mid 40's with a family so can't spend day in day out practicing. I've driven the real Nordschleife 'tourist' circuit in a Jaguar XF Sport with other real cars on track too. (I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!)   I got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.)   So this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970) so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it.   Assetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful. AC on the other hand gets it spot on. Touch a rumble strip in AC, you rumble. Touch a rumble strip in PCars, nothing. (most of the time.)   PCars offers more in the way of variety and content (a lot more to be honest) but if I'm after a quick(ish) lap of my favourite track, I come back to AC. It's not quite as pretty but plays much better with a heightened sense of reality that I look for in a Sim.  ",

Assetto Corsa absolutely delivers the real thrill of being behind the wheel of a car. There aren't so many vehicles and tracks to choose from yet, but the ones that are available at the moment - are recreated with maximum detail and with true passion. And more downloadable content is on the way!  As to the physics, only iRacing can compete with this game in my opinion - the driving is simply phenomenal. The fact that the development team uses real performance data from car manufacturers puts the experience to a higher level, you can easily lose yourself in this simulation for hours straight.  And the graphics are gorgeous, especially if you have pc-horsepower to crank up all the video settings. Cockpit cam is superb, the quality of the interiors is second to none. I recommend playing it in 3D with a good FFB wheel.  In a word, this is a must have for all racing fans. And if you are not a racing fan - play Assetto Corsa and you will undoubtedly become one ;)",

Let’s talk content as this is one place where kunos skimped out, assetto corsa has a small number of cars &amp; tracks and even the career is small when you look at most other racing games. There are no leader-boards which feel is a MUST on any racing game. It’s almost like kunos sat down one day at a board meeting and said let’s forget about content we will just let the community build the game for us &amp; they have. All you are is a couple of clicks away for endless tracks, cars &amp; apps, even the community has made its own leader-boards (RSR LiveTiming) in my mind this is the only con this game has.

Pros:  -fast load times make it easier to quit the game -An idea to bring a 'simulation' racer to the PC  Cons:  -Limited cars, can't believe it's been out this long and theres only that many to choose from -Sound effects are great on some cars and absolutly terrible on others -Every windscreen in the game is dirty apparently, funny this because it's based on tarmac, they're all dirty, so enjoy when you're driving towards the sun, over done linear glare that makes it impossible to see anything, this is NOT a simulation feature, this is just poor practice -Lousy textures on scenary, seriously terrible -Game play feels far to linear  It just doesn't feel exciting enough, it feels so boring (Is it lacking atmosphere?) and I'm basing this off the price I paid for it which was $75AUD   I think perhaps if they stick with this and knuckle down it'll be a decent game in a couple years time, however by then we'll have alot more out hopefully, so I'd probably skip on this if you enjoy the forza series and GT series. It's nothing like them, it feels less than one quater of what those games offer.",

I own 2 real drift cars, and have drifted both in Australia and in Japan. After the Japanese pack came out I got straight into drifting in Assetto Corsa. This lead me on a path to find some more tracks, and more cars, I've trawled the internet for what seems like days and downloaded everything I can find including many famous tracks in Japan including some of the Ebisu tracks (Minami, Kita, Higashi, and Nishi), Nikko Circuit, Meihan, Bihoku, and many many more.  After this I decided to suss out the online community and have found places to do judged virtual drift competitons, plenty of lads to run trains with, and usually a server close enough with a low ping.  I can't put the game down now and I'm looking into new steering setups, the current old Fanatec wheel is a bottleneck to the experience.

With laser scanned Nordschleife DLC tracks and high quality details on cars it really is a joy to play. I play with gamepad and it works just fine. I would say that this is the most PC user friendly racing sim.  The sound is my absolute favorite. I don't know much about cars but the sound is so good I had to turn off all music to listen to them. I need them. It's like drugs. No other simulation can satisfy me now  The quality, however, sacrificed quantity, which is good/bad. Each car has incredible details, at the sametime you may not find your favorites from the list. I like a lot of 90's sport cars without cpu controlling it but AC doesn't have as much compare to fully equipped GT/super cars.   It used to have lots of mods to cover that, but with the frequent update in the game that's no longer an option, without breaking the official content's file. I had over 40 cars for fun but it no longer has any sounds so I had to delete them. Modded tracks usually work, however.  So I feel like this game slowly transferring from 'game for everyone' to 'game for serious driver'. If you like cars in general, you will enjoy this, but don't expect any content rich materials like Gran Turismo or Forza, especially that mod materials have shrank significantly.  $30 pricetag seems right to me, but it's not a pricepoint of materials, it's for a  quality .

The force feedback feels great and commuicates tons of info about the car, more so than any other driving sim i've played.  All that said, so far at least, I've found another sim 'Raceroom Racing Experience' has a speed quality that gets my adrenaline pumping a bit more and somehow feels more realistic, while simultaneously lacking some feel for the car compared to AC (both games played without assists on a FF wheel). I may need to keep adjusting on AC to find the sweet spot with the view. So far AC is very nice and superlative in many ways, but not every way.  EDIT: At this point, this is the main racing game i play. The overall experience is excellent, especially the feel of the car.

            "review_text": "An incredible driving/racing simulator. The standard content of Assetto Corsa is decent. I would highly recommend adding the Dream Packs as well. In addition, there is an amazing community of modders who produce professional quality tracks and cars that can be downloaded and added to Assetto Corsa, the vast majority are free of charge. The community is very welcoming (the official support forums) and you'll get help for ANY issue as long as you are polite and respectful.  The driving physics of Assetto Corsa are second to none. Sure, some people will say that's a subjective statement. Others may say that they prefer another sim's physics. That's fair, but no one can say that Assetto Corsa's physics aren't great, even if they think another sim is better. I personally think AC has the best physics in the biz. To me, physics matter the most. After all, we're talking about 'simulation'. I'm looking for the most realistic experience possible behind the wheel of a virtual car.  Graphics and sounds are excellent. Again, thanks to the amazing community of modders, if you aren't 100% happy with the sounds of a particular car, the odds are great that you could download a substitute set of sounds for just about any car. Heck, you could make your own if you want to learn how to use FMod. Likewise, you can download or create your own PP Filters which change the graphical properties of the sim.  Again, if you're really into realism you must own Assetto Corsa. If you're more interested in just logging onto public servers and smashing into others all in the name of fun, stick to console titles like Gran Turismo or Forza. Of course there are people who take those games seriously, but there are also people who just want to look at fancy cars and go fast. Assetto Corsa players, like most Sim drivers, are looking for realism and don't mind a steeper learning curve in setting impressive lap times.  There is no car modding, like adding turbos and upgraded LSD's or suspensions like in the console games. There is no grinding for in-game cash/credits so you can purchase more cars and more parts. You get every single car right out of the box and can download many, many more. You can 'tune' the cars, however, to suit your driving style or correct any issues you might be having with a particular car. Usually for street cars it's just simple things like Toe In or Out. Adding or reduce Camber. Adjusting Tire Pressure. Maybe slight Aero adjustments if the car has a rear wing or active aero components. Race cars, however, usually have much more that can be adjusted, like Ride Height, Spring Rate, Bump Stop Rate, Gear Ratios, etc.  Assetto Corsa can be played with a gamepad, but you really want to get yourself a steering wheel and pedals to fully take advantage of the driving experience. Many people run triple monitor setups for racing sims. I'm running a single 46' LCD TV as my sole display and the game is beautiful. With all the graphical settings maxed out I really can say that Assetto Corsa is a gorgeous game, for the most part. I would recommend this game to anyone who's even vaguely interested in experiencing the 'serious side' of driving and racing cars via computer.",

You will get pushed off at every opportunity.. I race mostly offline and when a car is right behind me i can't race the track anymore i just have to push beyond all my braking points just so that i avoid the AI ramming into me or taking an inside turn when one doesn't exist. I don't understand why this is such a problem for assetto when there are games out there that do pretty good with AI i mean.... atleast the AI is aware that you exist... As for AI vs AI it's non-existent. They just drive the line and that is it... )  -Kunos doesn't listen to their customers as to what they want in this game and consistently release DLC's that no one really asked for and are priced terribly high.   -I tried a g27 a TS500 and a Fanatec. Sadly they controls are just too senstive. I've tried everything to reduce them from within the game or outside and it doesn't reduce sensitivity. Other games easily have this problem solved by allowing you to change sensitivity of your pedals and wheels but this doesn't exist in Assetto. The closest thing they have to sensitivity is brake gamma which really has a set curve that you can move along and with nothing for steering or for accelerator settings... I do not drive any car with TC or ABS even if it comes as factory. For me that kills all the fun in braking with the right pressure and actually preventing your car from spinning out when coming out of turns or braking hard. Some people like just pushing down on the brakes and letting the abs do the work for them.. To me that isn't racing if all you have to do is accelerate to full and brake to full... It makes no sense to me and i don't see any challenge or fun in that.. I've asked Kunos many times to simply add settings for sensitivity but alas as you can see they just ignore everything even though Kunos well knows it will help alot of people out. You can go and type in sensitivity with assetto corsa in google and see for yourself.  -Very bad multiplayer setup. If you want to host a server for a simple race with some friends be prepared to do your homework since it isn't anywhere near as easy as other games where you just click on setup server or custom server or start an internet game. Kunos has almost willingly made it very tedious to run a server of your own.  -No crash damage... You do see a diagram of your car come up and turn different colours as you damage certain parts but as for visually don't expect to see anything apart from perfect cars... Makes no sense to me....  - Nothing to do with weather or nighttime racing.  - No pit stops....  - Basically this game simulates a car i guess really well... That is where it stops. This isn't a racing game its just a car simulator. Please don't get mistaken before or if you buy this game.   The only reason i love this game.  - The physics are great.  - FFB is great and you can feel the car really nicely..   I'm sorry to anyone that wants this game so badly. I just find it so upsetting when Kunos has such a great game and there are very clear suggestions put to them from many people as to how they can really help change this game. But it is beyond me and this doens't go for Kunos only but it is beyond me why devs don't listen to their customers and tailor the game to what they want or need just like any other seller of any goods. It's usually a demand or a niche that people try to provide to which Kunos fails to do everytime. I mean simple things like allowing additional settings has nothing to do with whether most people will like it or not. Just give people the options to race anywhere with any opponents to have all steering and pedal options available... I really don't see this as hard or challenging in anyway...  Lastly and sadly... Assetto Corsa is the only game i know of where i had to do so much research and reading just to even find information that is important. I've got this game during Early Access and i've seen it grow but i'm sorry that Kunos decided to go this way because it saddens me that they really have a rough diamond in their hands... I just wish they would cut and polish it the correct way and the way it's customers want... I still get confused till today as to why devs don't do what their customers ask...",

There are many excellent AC racing leagues online that race clean, fair races and are always looking for new talent to race with. The AI have shown great improvements over the last couple of updates, and though it isn't yet perfect, you can now enjoy some excellent AI racing.

It features great physics, good FFB and an overall extremely rewarding driving experience.  Sure AI has issues, it's weak and perfectible on some track / car combos.  This should be improved.  Hotlapping is great though.  Despite some constraints and some problems with collisions Multiplayer is quite satisfying too.

The base game however is very barebones and in my opinion a little lackluster when compared to games such as Gran Turismo and Forza. I understand that this is due to the game being developed with modding in mind. Yet I still feel a little underwhelmed with the lack official cars and tracks and addition of an incredibly simplistic Career. That being said the community behind this game is incredible as the amount of fan created vehicles and tracks are astounding. The forums are active with members eager to help other players with anything and that is a nice thing to have. Personally however I have not tried the online component of the game since that really isn't my thing, however after some research for this review I understand that it works well and is filled with freindly people who prefer to race fairly and clean. Overall I really like this game, it's fun to boot up every now and then and do a couple of laps.

As it is right now there's no downfall and you can't drive at night. 8am to 6pm isn't nearly enough for someone looking for the complete experience (or in my case, someone who love Le Mans.) As a passtime I find Assetto Corsa great, but for someone who wants to sink a lot of time into just one title--this falls short.   No amount of DLC cars and tracks can mask the fact that the game is inherently lacking content on a basic level. If you like sim racing and want something very specific (Lotus 98T on Imola was my reason) I recommend this title. Otherwise I would wait for content patching that doesn't assault your wallet.",

The bakery has lots of customers and examples of their cakes you see in the store are impressive. You bring the cake home, take it out of the box and it looks fantastic. Then you cut into the cake and find that it’s literally half baked.  This is what it’s like buying Assetto Corsa.   Pros:   Looks good. I’m not usually an eye candy guy, but wow this is definitely pretty.  The amount and variety of car content is commendable. Both official and mods.    Cons:   Automatic pit lane speed limiter.  When a race weekend session ends, the screen just fades to black and places you back in the pits at the beginning of the next session.  No apparent way to review your individual lap times after a race weekend session has ended.  No way to do standing starts dumping the clutch with the car in gear (well known).  No assignable control to place the car directly in neutral. Race cars have had this for over 20 years. Amazingly, there’s half a dozen assignable controls for MGU-K and MGU-H hybrid power, but nothing for the simple task of putting the car in neutral.  Car will not roll downhill when in neutral. It doesn’t matter how steep the hill is or what the surface is. It can be off-track grass or the track surface itself. If the car is sitting pointed uphill, it will not roll backwards once you place it in neutral. Spin off uphill and you have to shift down through all the gears into reverse and power yourself backwards. You can’t just simply roll back.  Different behavior entering/exiting instant replays. To enter a replay you hit Esc which pauses the action and brings up a small dialog with a menu. When you exit the replay, however, you’re returned directly to live action in the car. If the action is paused going into a replay, it should also be paused coming out of a replay. This could be placated with a simple assignable pause control but alas, like selecting neutral, there appears to be no assignable control for this basic game function.  And the worst flaw...steering!  The way this game handles steering is an immature and absurd mess. I'm not aware of any other racing game for the PC that makes dealing with the most fundamental vehicle control (steering) such an arduous and complex task. Maybe it actually is technically more accurate. I don’t know. But this is still a piece of entertainment software not a commercial engineering simulation. New owners of the game should not have to spend 2x-5x as much time researching steering and getting it configured than they do actually driving anything in the game. And that’s just to get to the point where it’s possible to physically complete a lap on a track.  There is no steering lock adjustment as part of the car setup. None. You’re stuck with how you have your controller configured. Now couple this with the fact that cars have steering lock ranges from 360 to over 1,000 degrees. Which, by the way, are not visible anywhere from within the game. You have to find the values for each car online or activate a developer tool and measure it yourself while sitting in each car. Either way, you’ll probably need to keep a notebook or spreadsheet so that you know what values to configure your controller for  before  you select the car you want to drive. Had your controller configured for a car with a different steering lock value than what you’re driving now? Too bad. You’ll have to exit your session/race to either load a different controller preset or leave the game entirely to access your controller’s profiler software.  It’s quite possible you’ll enjoy this game if you have a wheel controller with 700 – 900 degrees of rotation and profiler software to control it. If you don’t, however, be prepared to put in an extraordinary amount of effort just to make the game drivable.",

Yeah it's fun with the controller but you can't really get a feel for the cars dynamics, So i went out and purchased a logitech g27 with wheel stand and it's enhanced the gameplay by miles so if you can afford to do so i would get a wheel to give this game the immersive driving style it deserves.  You don't need a high end steering wheel i just wanted the logitech due to the reviews about this awesome bit of kit and decided it was the one for me and i'm totally happy with the purchase, but im pretty sure a cheaper wheel would bring you the same satisfaction.  Just to top off what i have already said this game is really good, The map mods avaiable are really good some are life like and others are just low detailed replicas but that still doesnt detract from the beauty of the games mechanics which make this a awesome simulator.  I would recommend this game even with the high price tag if you are a Racing game fan and want to have the challenge of driving fast and keep the car in one piece.  It does lack tracks and cars but rumour has it they are brining out DLC soon even though i think the game price already warrants the cars should be free.. but hey all developers are now using DLC to draw in more money so it was only a matter of time until assetto corsa did aswell.

            "review_text": "This review has been heavily edited. If you found it useful or unuseful before, your opinion may have changed.   I haven't re-written this review to say that, now that i have a slightly higher amount of game time, i fell in love with this game and i'm ready to recommend it. My overall opinion on Assetto Corsa hasn't changed: i do not recommend this game for a whole series of reasons. I just wanted to change the tone of the review and some of my pros and cons. Let's see.  PROS -The driving model is probably the most convincing out there right now. It is not 100% perfect, but it sure manages to give the player the feel and thrill of driving a fast (or VERY fast, depending on the model) car. Without any TCS, ABS and stuff, the cars react to every imput in a very plausible way, blocking the wheels when you brake too hard, losing traction if you try to go pedal to the metal at the wrong moment, and generally making a mess if you're not capable of handling them. Learning to drive decently in Assetto Corsa can be a tasking challenge, and it's very fun and satisfying, though sometimes frustrating. There are some slight flaws, pointed out in the cons, but globally it's awesome. -The magic triangle dampers-tires-track is depicted extremely well. The vehicle is realistically influenced by every bump (and with Laser Scan, you can only blame the track for being like it is), the grip is extremely realistic and you can select various asphalt setups (i.e. perfect, dirty, old etc.) that influence the behavior of your car. Very nice. -Online is taken very seriously by the community, and has nice races with qualifications and so. -Career mode is vast enough and as varied as the small car amount can allow it to be. -Adjustment to your car's components is extremely precise and well-crafted. -There aren't many circuits, but it's a rather good selection: iconic raceways (Silverstone, Monza, Spa), modern raceways (the Nurburgring GP), some italian tracks (Magione, Vallelunga, Mugello) and a curiosity (the challenging 17 km mountain climb from Trento to Bondone, also good for relaxing). Few but good ones, i'd say. And the Green Hell is coming. -The sound effects are excellent. Full stop. People say this or that racing game has realistic sounds, then play Assetto Corsa and drop their jaws to the ground 10 seconds after the car accelerates. -The game is very open to modding, to a certain degree (read: it has to be GOOD quality modding, otherwise go away. Kinda classy, but assures a high average quality).  CONS -The current lack of value for money. As i've basically said in the pros, the core game is there and works magnifically, but there are few cars (43, a large part of which are variants of the same car, like GT2, GT3 or such racing modifications) that don't quite represent what sport cars are today and/or were yesterday and few tracks. I understand buying licenses and scanning tracks is all but for free, but the game isn't for free as well. Its price is rather high. More cars and the notorious Nurburgring Nordschleife track will come, and DLCs are said to be planned up to 2018. But... -...they will be payed DLCs. No surprise, after all. The willing to cash in on a game through downloadable extra content is common. Kunos is somewhat justified because what they'll offer isn't already finished and ready to ship but is being actively developed, but i'm ready to bet these packs will be excessively expensive. The only hope is a lifetime season pass or the fact that i'm wrong and these packs are cheap. -I am forced to hit this nail a little harder. Stop being such elitist a-holes, please: not everybody can afford a steering wheel and/or is willing to buy it just for you. I have a different kind of problem, for example: it doesn't fit in my current room layout. Assetto Corsa can be as better as it can get with a good wheel, a full pedal set and maybe a gear lever/paddles layout, but you can't just shoot in the legs the users that don't have a steering wheel. Joystick controls are broken: accelerator and brake can't be remapped, thus forcing the player to revolve around the frontal triggers while the right analogic lever is also a good choice (i prefer it, for instance). Steering sensitivity is also way too obviously steer-like even while playing with a joystick (read: way too histerycal to allow the needed precision, because levers are way less accurate than a dedicated peripheral). So please please please, take 15 minutes of your developing time to improve those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. -The racing UI is highly customizable, and that's good, but it has some flaws. The rankings can't be moved from the bottom of the screen, an uncomfortable location, and all the adjustments can only be done while in the middle of an actual event, a very annoying and inexplicable fact. -Now a quick summary of minor cons, not very serious but still annoying: 1)Having an automatic clutch, which even many steering wheel users have no choice but to accept, makes the car start in a very unrealistic way, unless you start revving the engine in neutral then insert first gear suddenly. Kinda annoying, sometimes. 2)Some technical issues (questionable optimization, anisotropic filtering having an inexplicable as severe performance impact, some out-of-the maps clipping bugs in Trento-Bondone and a generally last-gen quality in background and scenarios, needing some improvement). 3)Incomplete localization. The game is made in italy, but the default english text isn't fully translated (cars descriptions are still in this language). For an italian, that's quite a ♥♥♥♥♥slap.  Summarizing, i like how this game handles (though i'm limited by the controller i can still 'feel it') and i find it fun, but lack of content can be a problem on the long run and the very likely DLC spam feels depressing already. The game has quite a high price now, and though it has been officially released (current version is 1.0.4 when i write this review) it feels unfinished on some sides (dynamic weather will arrive in a future update, and don't come and tell me that's not a feature worth being inserted at launch, in a Driveclub fashion). So do i recommend this game? There isn't a 'meh, it depends' button, so i'll go for the no. But my judgment isn't negative. If you find it at around 20-25 euros, then spend them: you'll have fun, if you like the genre.",

            "review_text": " Blog Post  [uberswe.com]  |  YouTube Video   I love that there are finally some games for the PC that are starting to rival my favorite racing game, Forza. Assetto corsa feels real when driving and is rumored to be amazing with a steering wheel. The developers have put a lot of work into the physics of the game and force feedback for steering wheels in order to make the game as good as possible.  I start my career with one of the slowest and most basic cars where you go through different champoinships and races in order to earn money to start a career in racing. The better you do the easier it will be to progress to the next championship and purchase better cars. The cars look really good, very realistic even on the inside.  For my first race I do a time trial, the controls feel a bit sensitive as I am using my xbox controller but this is good, this is the way the game should be. I had to take my turns carefully, turning the steering wheel will definitely lead to understeer as expected. This is not an arcade game, this is a realistic racing simulator.  My only complaint is the UI and believe me, it is not a big complaint, but it does feel a bit unfinished when I am in the service depot for example, the red/black/gray layout is fine but it feels like something that was made for the early access version of the game. I think that this is something that can be improved.  I definitely recommend buying this game, however the $50 price tag may be a bit high for some and I do recommend getting it while it is on sale as I did.",

It's great to be able to perfect driving skills and have an exhilarating time doing it; you really feel accomplished going around a track in a BMW M3 GT2 at substantial speeds.

Yes it's good and the cars for the most part tend to drive differently which is nice, but it's very shallow, there's not much to do other than time attacks and over taking the car in front of you. The AI is simply put, stupid. The other cars drive on rails most of the time and will run you right off the road. Sure you can tweak a ton of things, but you can't setup a realistic race weekend with practice, qualifying, fuel managment, tire management, and pit stops let alone a realistic racing season? Racing games had all of this stuff and more twenty years ago. I don't see much more to do in Assetto Corsa than what's in GRID which is a sorry state. Skip this and try iRacing or RaceRoom.

I race this game because I want to prove what I can do. Not organised races aren't really fun due to having almost no challenge. The only challenge is to try and not get hit from the Crashtors because there are many, and when I say many, it's a lot! That's why I race on Social Organised Races that you can find Online. Because of the Crash Physics Online being... how could I say, disastrous? It's impossible to have a Full League due to a lot of online issues.  Now, Single Player is just a bunch of fun in Practice Mode! The Physics are just awesome and there's a lot of cars you can find online that are pretty fun to drive!

The career mode is fairly noninteresting, but I honestly don't mind that. If you buy a proper sim like this you probably just enjoy driving and have no need for career events. Although the AI is imperfect, it is certainly enjoyable to race against them. People complaining about constantly getting crashed into by the AI are probably just ignorant of the racing rules.

I am not sure if its fair to call this a real issue (although these are issues for me), but I can't be asked with it. The menus are badly organised and poorly implemented, the automatic steering configuration stops working when I try to center the wheel, The driving is completly unrealistic (I can drive a lotus elise around Imola for real, but fail to do so in the game) and I have come to the conclusion it is just nmot for me.  I am sure someone will point out something obvious like steering calibration, but I tried that in the game and it failed. No doubt this is all my fault again, but I am a user who paid money for this. I wish i hadn't.  ---- original review  It seems that the trend of early releases continues, in line with other toxic internet trends. If you are looking for an enjoyable experience this game is n0t it. If you are looking for quality, look somewhere else. Aparently releasing limited, buggy code is ok. Asking for money for this is just laughable, yet I fell for it. Simply put, stay away unless you want to pay for testing privaledges, because that is what you are becoming, a paying tester. The driving is sluggish, the code is buggy as hell (I keep getting video setting alert from windows, that interfere with the code so everything stops working, there is no code optimisation to create a high performance race game - at least my 8 core computer, NVDIA 2GB, 8GB of RAM are not fast enough to make it past basic settings). To boot there is no racing, just trying to get good lap times. It is still a mess, and that is ok for a .5 version, but pleease don't make people pay for playing it.

More cars are on the way.  -Would be nice if you could host a multiplayer game with the click of a button rather than having to set up a dedicated server. Multiplayer is still in beta, that may or may not change.  -Customization of cars is limited to picking a color/livery. Can't make your own like in Forza but it can be done using modding tools.   -That danged 5 sec penalty for going off the track whether you did intentionally or not.    Would I recommend this game?

This is the kind of racing sim where the reward is strictly the experience itself, as opposed to a grind based collect-a-thon. The hard work of shaving a second or two off of your time or figuring out a tuning setup that actually makes you feel smart for using it to carve around a track a little faster, thats the glory here. I will admit though, that there is a small part of me (and I imagine, many of you) that actually slightly misses and, dare I say it, NEEDS the variety of cars/tracks and the structure of a monetized career to keep playing. Although the cars list isn't tiny per se, its not really all that expansive either when you consider some are just slightly beefier versions of the same models.   The biggest complaint I would levy at the game is the lack of tracks, there really are just a handful, and although they are extremely detailed, they ultimately number few enough you can get rather bored of them. Furthermore, while I really like the moddability of this game, it needs steam workshop integration to make that process more smooth, currently it is a pain to update your mods as they are often broken by game updates. Currently you have to go forum diving and manually install everything. I also think that in a game where everything is instantly available and the selection of assets is fairly small, the main draw is competition over leaderboards in online play. While I can only speak for a small amount of experience in online play (micro lag isnt as bad now), I can say that it would be better if the devs put in thier own leaderboards that were specific to each car per track, thus each one would have a chance to shine. As it is, you have to go download the RSS Live timing app which I find kind of confusing to use to see where I am at against other people given my current choices of car and track. Though also improved recently through patches, I find the AI drivers during races to be particularly rigid.  Overall, this product nails the feel and immersion of driving these kinds of cars. The level of customizability in the UI, AI, the cars, and the feedback you get from them that is all really a job well done. Overall though, the lack of content and listless career structure hurt the longevity of the game no matter how you slice it, they want you to buy all the dream packs they plan on releasing but Im just not sure when its all said and done this game will be worth more than 60 dollars with all the dlc for what will always remain essentially a hotlap simulator. If they improve online play further, and incorporate steam workshop and better leaderborads this could really go places, but currently I would strongly advise obtaining this at a moderate discount.",

So if you're a fan of Mclaren or Germany's racing tracks then buy it, if not stick to the original game and if you're looking for a racing in cities or forests or general urban areas with people in them I would say get either Need for speed or GTA.

This is the game for you. If you want a game with track diversity check out 'Project Cars'. Currently this game gets a bit old before the half way point of the career mode when you are on the same 8 tracks and their variants all the time.  This is exactly what you want in a game and racing title in this day and age. A stream of updates, realistic simulation and continued post launch support. However, this is not NFS, Forza, GT, Grid or the Crew in style. It is more in the style of 'rFactor' and other simulators so expect the handling to be brutal if you have a sloppy arcade racing style. You will need to break into the corners and follow the racing line. To overtake you will often need to be aggressive and risk it all and break late into the corners to get around the AI and expect them to be there to win back positions if you are sloppy.   Even on the Easy setting the challenges are challenging and racing will be a challenge. I've yet to notice 'Rubber banding' with the AI, but it may well be there in some form.  The Menus take some getting used to, but this too has evolved throughout and I'm sure it will continue to evolve.  This is also a game that shines with a wheel and a VR headset.",

Its now by far the best racing game i have ever ever played, There is still some work to do with race rules and pit stops etc but its all just better than it was now.   The modding community, whilst its been nerfed on the official forum a bit, is still active as anything. new tracks almost daily. New cars are a plenty. The new tyre model is great, the racing feel is great, the AI is much improved, The multiplayer.. on the right severs.. i'm looking at you ALOOG.. is great. The VR integration is almost perfect, its hard to find fault now. Career mode is still pants. I mean the races are good but its just not encouraging you to play it. it feels like there is no real reward. I am 90% of the time on my own server now racing the lemans circuit in a ferrari 458 but thats how this works. I race one track till i have it down before changing either the car or the track and its like a whole new experience again. Each car is unique, they all feel totally different, I could harp on all day. Just buy it. then buy all the DLC, then buy a rift. Now you spent enough money but ya know what.. its all the game you need!",

But all that effort is wasted, poured out like water on the ground, because the AI is horrible. Pole Position, from 1983, had better AI than this game. Every race you enter, you'll restart a dozen times trying to make it around the first corner without being run off the road or spun out by a clueless AI driver and their monomania to be exactly on the racing line, even if you're already there (and ahead of them). One touch from the AI car, and you go spinning down the track, while they proceed uninhindered.  If that wasn't bad enough, the penalty system is an insane joke. If you exit a corner too fast and drift a bit too far over a curb, you are suddenly 'cutting' the track. So you have to slow down for 10 seconds. As you watch the clock tick down, and your opponents speed past, the clock resets itself back to 10 if you accidentally touch a control. The upshot is that if you drive one pixel too far over a curb, the race is over and you must restart.  AI drivers, on the other hand, are blissfully unaware of these penalties, and will drive over the same spot that gave you a penalty and suffer no ill effects.  I'm amazed that the developers would spend so much time an effort on a game, and then ignore these fatal flaws. All of these things have been pointed out, repeatedly and often, in the comments, but nothing has changed.  This game is unplayable. Worse, its not fun.",

Regardless, IF you are a sim racer then this one needs to be in your garage.  Graphics are very good and getting improved! Physics are excellent. Good FFB. The community is getting behind this simulation.  EDIT:  Well, 240+ hours later and many changes; This is the best driving simulators you can buy on Steam. Racing is done better by titles such as iRacing and rFactor 2 * not yet on Steam. However when you consider the cost, graphics, FFB, content available, and quality of the entire package AC is a WINNER!  Some people prefer pCARS &lt;--- This is a game.

This sim is a work of art. Pure, simple, sensational and deep. Getting within a couple seconds of a fast lap is simple enough. But finding those last couple tenths of a second are going to require all your focus, attention to detail, and silky smooth control. DON'T PLAY THIS WITH A CONTROLLER.

My only complaint is that it can be very hard to try to be a bit of a yobo in a car as unlike other simulators, it is not to forgiving when you mess up a corner, and you experience a lot of understeer and if you want to try drifing, you are in for a lot of stressful attempts to get the car of choice to go sideways.

You'll end putting so much hours playing it, and downloading hundreds of mods to enhance your experience, that any other racing game will seem ridiculous, boring, or just bad. The physics model is second-to-none, and is comparable to iRacing, but will leave your wallet full instead. The modding community is great for any kind of racing fan whether it be, F1, GT3, Rally, Drift, etc. The only thing that AC is missing is the Oval track racing community, so that makes NR2003 the king of that still after thirteen years. My only complaint is that the wheel setup is a bit of a pain at first due to the weird UI, and this game isn't easy to pick up and play for beginners due to being so difficult. Once you learn to master your favorite motorsports, you'll feel like more like a racecar driver then ever before, instead of some guy on his couch playing Gran Turismo holding down the X button until he wins. All I have to say is that you NEED to get a racing wheel before you play this game, and not a particularly cheap one either. This game requires a willingness to learn, and a lot of free time to do it, but if you like racing JUST BUY IT, but if you're a casual then stick with your Need For Speed and Forza.",

For road cars they are often miles of the manufacurers actual settings - the way of understeer/safety.  Talking of setups it treats us like console owners having really simplistic ways of showing adjustments. But it does make it easier for casual play.  I also found the force feedback was a bit lacking out of the box and needs some tweeking.  Tracks and cars are in short supply unless you add aftermarket stuff.   But its all minor stuff, the core game is excellent.
