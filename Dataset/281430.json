Offcourse having the music playing wouldn't go a miss and no I don't wish to play my own music during this kind of game, as nice as the error message at the beginning was.   Im not gonna knock it to badly as yes it still is a seventeen year old game which atleast runs. Just that if your gonna bring back nostalgia, make sure it feels and sounds alittle better.   plus the fact that Combat in this game is borderline hoping you have a good angle of attack that the enemy cant hit you. And the voice acting whilst not terrible, Is so cringeworthy. Obnoxious is definitely the best word to use for this game.   At the end of the day when all is said and done. This should of probably stayed back in 1999.",

Pretty good, aged like cheese, but still minorly playable, i haven'nt beat this game yet, but i've played it more than any Assassian Creed games, and I do plan on some night, cracking open a beer and raging hard through this game. There are some things I like, 1, its an almost isometric game, which is something I love, thanks fallout. Also this game falls under that, 'so bad its good'. The combat is very simple, pick fighter everytime, the voice acting is laughable, actually this game made me laugh quite a bit, defenitly one of the best games i bought for less than 30 cents. If you want some real fun, try and convince a friend to purchase this game, and play it multiplayer. Im not gonna rate it, cause it isn't one of those games.",
