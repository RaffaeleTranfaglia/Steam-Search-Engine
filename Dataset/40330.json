    "description": "Unravel one of the greatest mysteries of our time! On the 30th June 1908 an explosion with the combined energy of 2000 Hiroshima bombs rocked the region of Tunguska in Central Siberia and felled over 6,000 square km of trees. The explosion could be heard from as far as 1,000km away.",

            "review_text": "This is a pretty good game! It has a single plot line so it plays kinda like an interactive graphic novel, but it's pretty cool anyway. It has some humor and the plot was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. I actually stayed up all night (accidentally, I swear!) because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The speech is a little odd here and there but not bad considering the era the game was made and the graphics are really good.   The game has no tutorial, so it took me a little while to figure out that you click to move and right click to examine things and left click to interact. That sounds simple but it isn't so much so, as you'll see, because of the inventory items and needing to combine them. You have to select the item, then move the cursor over the other item or spot until it lights up for interaction. One beef I had was that the game has her (or Max) speak something whenever you examine something, but you don't always know what spot will go to what, so they may repeat something several times. Luckily you can fast-forward what they say or it could get REALLY irritating. I think most of the length of the game comes from listening to the characters talk; it's a pretty long game (much longer than I was expecting). It felt like around 26 hours? but it might vary depending on how fast you play and what you do.   Also, there's a magnifying glass you can click on in every scene to see everything you can look at or interact with and the location of movement arrows to go to new locations (so you don't have to guess where to click.) Periodically you'll hear the sound of an old-fashioned typewriter, signifying that you have another journal entry. A lot of them merely chronicle your adventures but some contain useful information that you need to solve puzzles, so it's helpful to look at them.  The puzzles aren't always intuitive, but they are varied and interesting. Avid puzzle gamers will enjoy this game! There's also some beautiful scenery to enjoy as you solve your way through the story. I was pretty amazed by some of the graphics. Overall, great game, and I'd recommend it for puzzle lovers.  *****Possible Tangental Spoilers!!! Read at your own Risk!!!*****  I liked that the game has a happy ending and epilogue -- it even has a blooper reel even though the whole thing is animated! I appreciate that the designers put in the extra work to add that touch. I do wish that they had portrayed Nina as a little smarter and found other ways to progress the storyline, because she seems very resourceful and innovative so it seems odd that she would repeatedly fall for being used by the bad guys. I also think it's strange that she seems so young and naive but also wears a leather jacket and rides a motorcycle. I think some things like that were done simply for game design convenience though, rather than for logic (who puts a torture chamber next to their bedroom? on second thought, don't answer that!!) but I still liked it and liked that Nina is so independent and resourceful. I thought it was funny that she was flirting with that guard and neat that she aided in her own rescue. Ok, I'm gonna shut up before I give too many things away. I hope I didn't already. :P",

            "review_text": "When you start Secret Files: Tunguska, you will notice several things, but what stands out immediately is the voice acting, being at the best of times, tiresome, somewhat embarrassing and even downright abysmal. To be fair, a few good actors do a good job, but between the unusual “never use contractions” thing, the odd phrasing and peculiar word choice, the “breaking of the fourth-wall” and the main characters voice choice being all over the place in terms of quality, you’d have a hard time bringing yourself to finishing the game.  Puzzles were regularly the “combine some items” types which are generally a staple for any self-proclaimed adventure game, but they were about as contrived as “puzzle” of this type can get. Before long, you would be sick to death of guessing which inane impromptu tool you are supposed to make from the items in your inventory.  So by finally finishing the game, you would see the extent of its dull, inane, meandering story; hear your fair share of sub-standard voice acting; you’d enjoy plenty of robotic animations; you’d play your fair share of 'hunt for the pixels that you can click on to find an item as you would assume was there more times than you’d liked; and you had gone through puzzles that, had if you had played the game organically, probably would have meant resorting to systematically trying to combine everything in my inventory until you stumbled across the right pairing.   I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they'd run out of other adventure games to play and needed one that would probably would have taken them a long time to get through. ",
