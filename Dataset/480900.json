            "review_text": "Slap Village is a Wild West point-and-click adventure game where you play a young girl named Luriditas. Even though it uses a cartoon art style, it is very distinct with very detailed areas. The various characters you come across are unique, to the point where you can recognize them by the outline (and most likely their voice and how they speak). Slap Village has a very fluid and consistent animation. This game may be colourful, but it balances it well enough to where it doesn't strain your eyes after long periods of time.  Slap Village's story can easily hook you in during the first few minutes, and easily draws you in the more you unravel what is going on in the country Luriditas resides in. The various problems you need to solve requires you to think outside the box, and most of the time you will find the solution is right in front of you! It features good humor and minigames that will unlock as the story calls upon them, while making room for references to pop culture.  The dialogue (English) dub is well made, with some awkward moments (and pronunciations) but it doesn't take away from the experience. I'm guessing this was originally a Spanish game translated to English, based on some leftover punctuation marks, but that shouldn't turn you away as it is still made well.   The only problems I have came across is a misplaced dialogue, and some before me has come across bugs that halt their progress, but it has been fixed pretty quickly.  Slap Village is very enjoyable and the mechanics are well rounded. If you like the art style, this game genre, and/or have been on the fence on getting Slap Village this game will be a great addition. I highly recommend playing Slap Village.",
