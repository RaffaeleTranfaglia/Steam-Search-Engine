The main plot of this game is about learning how to run business, how to maintain family's relationship and how to live in mortal world.  โดยรวมแล้วก็เล่นเพลินๆดีครับ",

I can tolerate weak graphics if the story is good, but this one is not.  I got it for about 20 cents US in a bundle, and played for about 10 minutes. Did I give it a chance? Yes, given how it began, where you are supposed to draw the player in, I knew it wouldnt get better.",
