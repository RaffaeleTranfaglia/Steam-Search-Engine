            "review_text": "Quick Review: Stellar game. Totally worth $15. Highly recommended if you like random generation or 2D space shooters.   Detailed Review: If you'd like to make an informed purchase, check out the original flash game for free  (captainforever.com) . It'll provide about 2 hours of fun before you beat it and are thirsty for more. So, apart from being incredibly faithful to the original, what more has been added to keep the game fresh? Well, they've added: - 12 new, incredibly varied weapons.  - 3 new types of stut (bulkhead) that all dramatically change how you think about ship design. - 2 new types of thruster to mix things up. - An augmentation system to upgrade your ships with. - Much less waiting around for ships to show up, with the added ability to jump to the next level. - The ability to repair your ship. - Lot's of obstacles and bonuses floating in space.  - A sandbox mode where you can fly around in your past ship designs. - A very welcome and well implemented difficulty setting. - The game explains istelf a bit more and is easier to understand. - An awesome cartoon style and great soundtrack.  I can't think of anything that they've missed. This is the best remake of a free game I've ever played. You can tell that this Captain Forever Remix was developed by big fans of the original game, and for the first time I can safely say that they completely captured what made the original so fun.",

Even easy mode is hard to get to pluto on.",
