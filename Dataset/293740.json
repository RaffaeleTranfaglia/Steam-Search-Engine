            "review_text": "Road Not Taken is great. It is a really well done puzzle-roguelike with a FANTASTIC core mechanic. It is one of those games that absolutely nails the concept of easy to learn, difficult to master. It also has a bleak yet hopeful atmosphere coursing through the entire thing, which I found very charming.  Winter is slowly overtaking a small village. You play as a forest ranger tasked with recovering children lost in the woods. The core mechanic involves combining objects in the forest together to make new ones by picking them up and throwing them. You can also cary objects, but doing so depletes your ever dwindling energy reserves.  There is a staggering number of items and combinations, and it's a LOT of fun to expirament with all the different objects. Some combinations are beneficial, replentishing your energy, allowing you to manipulate the forest easier, and save the kids easier, but others are dangerous, and you should take care not to clumsly throw things around, creating hazardous items accidentally. However, many of the dangerous items can also be turned into bigger benefits if combined correctly. It strikes a really great ballance between risk and reward.  Being a roguelike, it has a LOT of replay value, especially since you can forge relationships with a few of the towns folk. If they like you, they will tell you tips, secrets, and even give you items and accessories to make your job easier, or harder if that's what you're in to! You have the ability to replay the previous year if you really screw things up, but I have also tried starting over from year 1 to leverage all the new combinations I have learned. ",

Imagine a mix between Spelunky or The Binding of Isaac, a new take on chess and Braid. Hard to imagine I guess, so try it for yourself. It will blow your mind. I would say this is THE best puzzle game I've played this year, it might even be one of the best games released this year, all-categories. A strong recommendation. And you might notice that this is one of my few reviews, which means this has a special place in my heart. 10/10, simply amazing art-style, magical music and sound, great gameplay, simple but touching story and a whole new idea for how a puzzle game should be like. Again, 10/10.",

            "review_text": "A novel game that starts off fun, but soon becomes tedious without offering appealing incentives to continue playing. Rather than feeling like I was getting better at the game or that it was getting incrementally more challenging, the difficulty became a lot harder without giving me a good reason to want to keep playing - the newly discovered items and modifiers did not greatly adjust the challenge level or provide interesting enough combinations to make me want to get a bit further and unlock the next one. After a few games getting to a more difficult random ('rouge-like') puzzle, it became clear that too much was dependent on luck and one or two bad moves could ruin the game and random brutality without grace just leads to nihilism and uninstalling.",

I know thats bull. i dont get it i dont like it. i know it trying to get across a deeper message but is i wasent so destracted buy the fact of how infureating it is. i mean you dont get to replenish your health in town, and trying to get more health in the forrest is up to chance and if you can its hardly worth it because you spend a heap just getting the ingredience together. not fun.",

There is a great sense of discovery as you peel back layers of mechanics without having your hand held. The art and sound are both utterly top notch. The procedurally generated levels stay fresh and interesting without feeling too random (very akin to something like Spelunky). And most importantly it’s just a ton of fun. Recommended to anyone who loved Triple Town, anyone old enough to prefer turn taking to twitch, or anyone who likes well made games.",

I really honestly enjoy everything that this game studio makes. i've easily got over 200 hours invested into triple town, and so this game is fairly second nature to me. It is such an emotional experience as well.. I truly care for the children i'm saving.. and it hurts me when i realize i made a mistake that costed one of them their lives.. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good puzzle game.. anyone who loves beautifully crafted worlds and characters... I recommend that everyone play this game at least once, its a true gem.",

            "review_text": "​ Most beautiful aesthetics, moody music and balls-to-the-wall hard puzzles make that a very interesting indie title.  The seemingly cheerful town life in the snowy village contrasts with an underlying theme of death and transitoriness - No, seriously! The story is told by the few lines of dialog the townsfolk deliver and the strange item details. It's incredibly intriguing, especially compared to other ways of storytelling, when you just repeatedly press X to make the dialog go away.  As little as the characters say, they all have a distinct character and worldly fears. With the friendship system and a - lacking a better term - crafting system, this puzzle game takes a completely different path from whatever I imagined before picking it up.  If you are looking for a fresh approach, pleasing design and a good challenge, please, please, do pick it up and support these incredible minds behind this masterpiece!  However, if you are looking for something fast-paced, if you cannot handle the picturebook-esque aesthetics or if you can't handle failing and starting all over again, this might not be the right title for you.",
