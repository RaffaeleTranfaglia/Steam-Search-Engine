            "review_text": " For me this is the best Single Player game, I've ever played.     Storyline - 10/10   Story is presented in a very nice form. In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or killing everyone. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. The story is for 30h game without sidequests. We also have mini games like cards (Gwent).   Gameplay - 9/10   Beautiful world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, helping peoples and doing much more things. The map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part. Crafting and Alchemy are more important, we also can upgrade swords, armors and signs. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.   Characters - 10/10   Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend. We also can choose the path of the main character. Character (mainly Geralt's) and monsters doing really great feeling, details are amazing.   Graphics - 10/10   Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water clouds are very well refined, falling leaves, changing weather make a huge impression.   Sounds - 10/10   Music and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. We can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game. Animals noises are natural. The monsters sounds are really threatening. Character voices are well selected and fit into personalities.   Overall - 10/10   If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. These game is masterpiece.",

            "review_text": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt continues the novel-to-video-game adaptation of Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher Saga. This latest entry in the series concludes the tale of witcher Geralt of Rivia by following his quest to track down his adopted daughter Ciri. She is being chased by the mysterious and evil 'Wild Hunt'. While previous Witcher games featured a more linear level structure, The Witcher 3 is the first to introduce a completely open world that is described by the developers as 20 percent larger than The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.  Geralt is a Witcher, a spellsword trained and mutated from childhood to become a near-superhuman monster slayer. The game’s prologue finds him in search of the two most important people in his life: his lover, Yennefer, and his adopted daughter, Ciri. For different reasons, both are being pursued by a terrifying supernatural force known as the Wild Hunt. Like a lot of things in life, this game is much more about the journey than the destination. Geralt’s journey sees him make his way through three huge, distinct, and open areas of the Northern Kingdoms and their surrounds. Roman Empire analogue Nilfgaard is on the brink of completing a crushing invasion of them, but begins the game in a temporary stalemate against the last two of these kingdoms, united under the banner of the stern king Radovid V.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt expects and rewards preparation above all else. Anybody who plays it like an Assassin’s Creed title or other action game will find themselves reloading frequently — I should know, because that’s how I initially approached it. Mashing attack might kill a few stray dogs, but that’s about it, as I found out. Side quests are all but mandatory, as enemies do not scale to the player’s level. It’s one among many ways that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt makes you feel like one man in a very large world. That’s one of the things I really appreciated about the game. The tutorial, if enabled, will nudge you once or twice, but afterwards will leave you with plenty of rope with which you are free to hang yourself with. Multiple save files are a must for this reason.  The game’s soundtrack was generally fairly restrained, but battle seemed to bring out the silly side of it. Each time the chorus of wailing warrior women got started, I felt like Geralt and I had stepped into an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. In a way, that’s an apt comparison. As Geralt slashes, pirouettes and leaps through skirmishes, I can’t help but think of Xena, beloved in part for its occasionally slapstick choreography.  Combat is both challenging and rewarding. Experimentation is again, encouraged: I found that one of Geralt’s signs, minor spells that Witchers cast, was able to knock men from horses. From there, Geralt was able to execute the grounded fighters without a struggle. I realised that a similar technique could be applied to flying enemies, and cursed myself for having not thought of it earlier. It wasn’t too long ago that I had been fighting a griffin, after all.  Signs, swordplay, bombs, potions and oils are Geralt’s main tools in combat, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s crafting ensures that you’ll be making the majority of them yourselves. Weapons and armor both degrade over time, and require repair in order to function properly. For a small fee, craftsmen can also take materials provided and upgrade Geralt’s current gear or craft entirely new items for him. You’ll find yourself spending a lot of time in the company of blacksmiths, so why not challenge a few to some cards?  That’s where Gwent, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s amazing minigame, comes in. Gwent has its roots in games like Goofspiel, being a simple game to learn but a complex one to master. Supposedly an analogue for how a battle unfolds, Gwent sees players placing numbered cards across three different zones. The first player to have the highest numbers on their side of the board for two rounds wins. It’s not as crucial a part of the game as Triple Triad was for Final Fantasy VIII, but it was compelling enough that I had to force myself away from it, lest this turn into Gwent: A Review.  Load times are disguised by short recaps of relevant main quests, matched to panning images like the one above. Unless you’re re-loading a save or just opening the game, you won’t actually see them often at all. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt really is an open world. Gone are the days of plotting where to base your Skyrim life to minimize loading transitions: if you see something in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you can usually walk up to or inside of it.  On the presentation and visual side, The Witcher 3 delivers one of the more engrossing and atmospheric game worlds seen in awhile. From trees waving in the wind to waist-deep swamps, everything about the game's visuals create a world that effortlessly combines real-world beauty with fantasy and medieval themes. The game world is presented in such a way that each territory, and the people that reside in its cities, are unique in their views on the current war, not to mention differences in their clothing and armor. Larger cities feature shady characters walking about streets and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on corners promoting brothels, while a smaller, more controlled city only contains nobles and streets that are well maintained. While there is a fast travel system, it's far more enjoyable and atmospheric to use Geralt's horse Roach, or to sail across rivers and oceans in a boat.  There’s a whole bunch of blacksmithing and alchemy plans to uncover and put to use as well. The world is chockful of components, particularly on the alchemy side, where the general wilderness seems to hold plants to collect every few 10 yards or so. It can get a bit overwhelming early on, but you’ll quickly learn that it’s not necessary to use or craft every potion or oil in the game, as you slowly mold your alchemy use to something that benefits your particularly playstyle. Crafting armor and weapons is fairly easy to do, but I found plans and competent crafters were a bit hard to come by.   The side contracts are where the game really shines. Where other open world fantasy games would treat bulletin board quests as a chance to make players gather ten bear butts through text only prompts, these can be just as nuanced as the main story chapters, with interesting twists on straightforward setups forcing the player to make the call as to who the real monster is. Even incidental missions and collectables filling up the map, while appearing too much like Ubisoft at first blush, manage to have something of a narrative seed embedded within. Treasure hunts often have examples of environmental storytelling and letters, and roadside encounters can lead to more complicated missions later on.  Story-wise, The Witcher 3 does an admirable job of giving new players enough information for them to understand the world in which they live, while also providing plenty of bonuses for long-time fans of the series. While some elements of the narrative are left vague for quite a while - what's the deal with the Wild Hunt, exactly? - you'll usually be too busy dealing with the dark, gritty, interesting world around you to worry about the bigger questions.  It’s hard to not spend all day singing The Witcher 3’s praises, but it really is a special kind of game. One that reminds you of how games can be engrossing experiences, ones you want to share with your friends, filled with moments that make you laugh, cry and sing along to a sweet ballad about the white wolf and the sorceress.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ends Geralt’s tale in spectacular fashion, finding ways to fill a giant world with thrilling combat, beautiful sights, and a bevy of compelling content. A strong conclusion to The Witcher trilogy, and a masterpiece that will keep you enthralled for weeks and months to come.",

I don't care I can pick flowers or find tin cans in an area the size of South America. Most of these types of games are written blandly as well. HOWEVER, WItcher 3 gets past these breaking points (just don't treasure hunt on the Skellige seas) by having an AMAZING story, fantastic and unique character interactions and dialogs, incredible animation, side quests that are interesting, and fun and challenging combat mechanics.  Look, Witcher 3 is really one of the best games around. It is likely (since I haven't played them all) THE best open-ish world rpg - surpassing things like Skyrim (what a bland repetitious pile), Fallout 4 (Jesus what a boring place with terrible writing) or Dragon Age Inquisition (Dragon Age, but now with MMO Fetch Quests instead of interesting things) or that cruddy one where you're a hacker in Chicago or something (I mean, Sleeping Dogs and STALKER were great, but come on). If you want to play a large, wonderfully written, compellingly character-driven, logical and well designed open world rpg with (granted, not Dark Souls' - it's more Arkham than DS) fun combat mechanics then The Witcher 3 is the way to go here.   CDPr did such a great job making Witcher 3 gorgeous and fun. I thought Witcher 1 was really good for its time, and WItcher 2 was a fantastic game well worth playing even now, but Witcher 3 stands on the shoulders of giants and midgets alike, leaving it towering over almost any other game, overall.",

I think if you want to maximise you're fun, you should play the side quests first, then do the main quests. One of the most funnest part of the game, is doing monster contracts. You negotiate your pay, gather evidence, track the monster, have an epic fight. Don't bad sad if you have hard time defeating some monsters.

I never played TW1 yet, but I played The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings few years ago and so I was waiting for this last part excitingly with my brother for months last year.   But I finally managed to finish TW3... after about 10-11 months haha :D, first buying it for PS4 in last May I think and later for Steam. It took me a while because of couple reasons, like too little time, burnout by open world games and MGSV hype. Some might think TW3 is too long as a game and I did too at first. Actually I have often liked more linear and shorter games. But anyway, it's one hell of a amazing game, that you should spend time with and enjoy the story and world, not trying to rush it.  The Witcher 3 is indeed a damn long game, perhaps the longest I've played from start to finish, and I still haven't played the DLC. Especially if try complete most of the side quests like I did, takes hella lot of time. I admit that I didn't explore every place and skipped some sidequests like gwents, some horse races and some treasure hunts. It sure is worth your time investment to reach the end, will give the feels. Once you spend hours and hours going through the story and you finally reach those certain big moments you've waited for... they will feel emotional. I've heard it has a lot of different endings and the one I got made me shed tears of joy :).  CD Projekt RED managed to elevate open-world and RPG into a whole another level in my opinion. I don't think I've seen so much detail added to side quests either, which alone is one great achievement. They're all done so well and they actually feel interesting. Hunting monsters is great. The way the forests move in wind is incredible, the weather changes too...just beautiful.  The story, world, characters, combat, voice acting, graphics are all fantastic. And music...that beautiful music is mindblowing. The voice acting is also some of the best I have ever heard, there is such a huge amount of it and makes the characters feel very real. The choice making is great and the outcome of what you chose, might not be always what you wanted in the end.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is perhaps the best RPG I have ever played. A must have for anyone who desires to experience an epic dark fantasy story. 10/10",

I wish every developer must learn from CD Projekt Red for making a good dlc for a worth buying season pass. Heart of stones expansion is great dlc which i ever played, hopefully Blood and wine also do the same cuz it is the last journey of Geralt so it will be amazing too .  Hopefully you give it a shot, in my books its a must buy . I bought A retail GOG version first on the release time now i bought this game again on steam so u can guess how much this game means for me . Congrats to CD Projekt Red for creating such a magnificent experience with   THE WITCHER 3 ...",

            "review_text": "In Witcher games, you play as a Geralt – a famous (or infamous to a lot) member of the chemically and magically transformed orphans turned monster hunters, called the Witcher. Unlike most games, the game does not hide the fact that your protagonist Geralt is not a hero – nor does he particularly want to be – or a villain, he is much more complex for being labelled as much. It is very common for ordinary folk to label him as a freak, or even a monster, but if he needs a label as the society constantly pushes for, he prefers the term -- a Witcher. He is not interested in politics or choosing sides in the ongoing war, he is only interested in solving the ‘monster problems’ and getting some coins in return. That is the way of life of a Witcher, and Geralt proving time and time again to be the person to call when you want a dreaded beast to be taken care off.   Leading up to the release, Witcher 3 would very often get compared to the Skyrim, and why not? The Elder Scrolls game is considered as the industry benchmark for doing sandbox RPG – the direction where Witcher 3 was seemingly headed. Both games were fantasy RPGs, with a huge world to explore filled with quests and mysterious begging to be discovered. Once the game got released however, the discussion took a turn and instead focused on the stark contrast between the two games. At that point, trying to draw further similarities with Skyrim quickly ends dead in the water though. Where Skyrim puts fantasy and sandbox gameplay at the forefront, Witcher 3 pushes it to backdrop. Instead, it uses it as a setting to explore mature themes which appear not so different to the time we live in. As you work your way to slaying the monsters, the revelations leading to it often paints a darker scenery. Forcing Geralt – hence the player – to ponder: who is the real monster here, the beast or the man?   Players are given full reign over the decisions Geralt faces throughout his adventure. They come in all shapes and forms. What is even more impressive, the effects of these decision are very unpredictable, and can be felt right away or…after several hours. This provides an illusion over the decisions, as the player cannot tell whether the decision will have an impact or not, keeping players from making rash decisions and altering the game world in interesting ways. A lot of games highlight decisions as a major gameplay element, but they never tend to be as far-fetching in their implementation like they are in Witcher 3.  Side quests in RPGs provide a great opportunity for developers to explore the game world and provide varied gameplay and story opportunities. But more often than that, the novel idea is pushed aside for the foundation of extending gameplay time and stamp it out for a marketing bullet point. Witcher 3 sets the benchmark for side quests. They are like self-contained stories. Other games could easily package it as small sized DLCs and charge them 5$ for each. I love how the game blurs the line between main quests and the secondary quests. Even the random events have more story in them than most other games do in their Secondary quests. Where many RPGs roundup the secondary quests as means of just extending gameplay time -- often through monotonous means, Witcher 3 takes the high road and uses this opportunity to further flesh out the world and it’s lore.  The game caters to a lot of different types of players with varying skill levels. Combat in Witcher 3 can be as easy as hack and slash to careful balancing act of preparation, attack, defense and improvisation; depends on which difficulty you play in. If you are seeking for challenging combat, I really can’t recommend enough for players to start from a higher difficulty -- like Death’s March – to have a reason to use the full range of the combat system the game has to offer. Otherwise hacking and slashing your way from the start to finish works with no problem, making the combat system very one dimensional and empty.   So what do I actually mean when I say the ‘full range of combat system’? Well, unlike most games, the actual combat is just one cog in the wheel to defeat a monster. Going into a fight with little to no clue about the monster you are dealing with is a straight up suicide. Lucky for Geralt he is a professional, he would prefer to go through a series of steps before coming across the monster itself. This is yet another one of the areas where the game sets itself apart from the rest. Unlike most games out there, simply stabbing the monster several times with your blade will lead you to an ominous fate (you think the villagers haven’t tried that?). Many of these monsters have very specific weakness: some are bounded by a curse and can be only lifted by doing a specific ritual; others have specific weakness which Geralt can decipher by interrogating the villagers as well as investigating the crime scene. Once you have all the information you need, you are better equipped in dealing with these abominations. Most of these quests are under the ‘monster contracts’ and are scattered across every settlement. They are quite short but manage to contain all the elements which make Witcher 3 great -- in a small package-- perfect if you don’t have much time in your hands.  When CD Projekt released the original Witcher, it was a solid effort but nothing quite stood out for it survive the test of time. With Witcher 2 the studio had a much clearer picture of what their game was and it showed; the game had the exterior of a fantasy game, but deep down it was much more than that. It was praised among the critics and created a strong fan base for the developer. Unfortunately game was still not much accessible to the majority of the gamers due to some design choices and balance issues. With the third and final entry—where Geralt’s story is concerned—the studio in Poland have finally come of age. They essentially took essence of Witcher 2 and expanded in every direction imaginable, raising the game to the pedestal of excellence. The game rewarded returning fans by providing them with the deep engrossing gameplay they know all too well and love. At the same time, CD Projekt listened to feedback and improved the core interface and fixed the nuances of the past games. All which worked in tandem to make the entire game much leaner and cleaner for newcomers to get into without much trouble. CD Projekt created an all-round masterpiece, more than worthy enough to stand side by side alongside the greats of its genre.",

            "review_text": "This may contain spoilers but I will try very hard to get at the meat and potatoes without spoiling anything. My first playthrough was on Death March with about 95%+ completion/ exploration spanning 144 hours.  Okay let me start by saying GGAT. Greatest Game All Time. Move over Zelda.   Witcher 3 Takes over a few months after the events in Witcher 2. Nilfgaard Is on the Attack once again and the Northern Realms are in shambles. Everything south of Redania is under Nilfgaardian occupation and in a move of genius/insanity King Radovid attacked his, leaderless ally, Kaedwen and taken it has his own. This sets the stage of Red versus Black, Redania versus Nilfgaard, with Temeria serving as a No-Mans-Land growing more destitute and plagued as time goes on. An epic backdrop for this fantastic story to be told.    Our hero Geralt, having recovered his memories, sets out to find his beloved Yennefer of Vengerberg. Geralt received a letter from her saying that she would meet him in White Orchard. So after a fantastic plot filled tutorial our journey really begins. From the very beginning we see that witcher 3 has improved upon 2 in more ways than just stellar graphics. The combat is still very much like 2, but now we have reposte as a staple ability not a researched one. NICE. Second we have a new dodge move, instead of a full roll its a mellow jump back cut that I like to call The Matador. Once I finally got a stong handle on the fighting it became so much fun to mix and match everything. Especially when an almost nonchalant chain of Matador dodges are executed to evade and slice a whole mob of drowners and nekkers without taking a hit. Reposting is also very strong, and for my tastes very fun. Reposting in this game is a nice mix of an Assassin's Creed meets Chivalry: Medieval warfare style. One can not just sit back and cheeze hold reposte and get it to work. It has to be timed perfectly by watching the enemies attack animations like in Chivalry or kind of like the Batman games. There is also the good old hold and wait block as well, but more things will knock back and stun and just negate a turtle blocking style. The larger monsters in the game often cannot be blocked, reposted or Matador'd. So proper, Witcher 2 style, super roll dodges are needed. Whats best of all is that they are all balanced and stong/weak in certain situations so you can and must use the full arsenal to excel. A wonderful job was done making witcher 2 better, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel into something new and most likely stupid. Combat is great in this game. It might not be the end all be all that some people want, however, I love it.    Along with the combat the new gear is well done also. There is a lot more of it. Instead of daggers Geralt gets a crossbow, much to the discontent of Pope innocent II and indigenous griffins. There are way more things to craft. There are Witcher sets as well that are really powerful. They have upgrade tiers as well, so as you progress you can upgrade them to improve their stats and looks and everything else about them. Each set is based on a Witcher school so each has a playstyle focus. Cat increases raw damage ( my favorite, because you know.... I like to hit dragons for 1000 damage a strike and what not) Griffin increases sign intensity, Bear increases adreniline generation and some others. There are more potions, like Whale which increases underwater breathing and new 'potions' called Decoctions, which are made from monster specific mutagens that grant long term buffs. For example a favorite decoction of mine is the Ekhidna. When stamina is used (signs) life is regenerated. Combo that with full adrenaline and a Superior Blizzard potion ( signs dont cost stamina with full adrenaline) you truly become The Beatdown and can juggernaut fight most things in a proper Skellige manner.     The skill trees have been tweaked and changed. They are in 3 familiar arcs, but there are way more to play with. I love trying to mix and match skills into uber builds. I had such a nice time in Witcher 2 doing so. Witcher 3 has even more. The major change, however, is to the mutagens. Instead of specific skills with a slot, there are 4 level locked hub/ slots that branch into 3 skills. So say one wants to use Red Mutagens to get 5% more sword damage. First you drag and drop a sword tree skill into one of the 3 'box' slots then in the mutagen slot, that attaches to that box and the 2 others of that hub, you place your Red Mutagen. Giving you 5% more attack power. When you have 3 sword tree skills in a hub with that Red Mutigen you get 15% overall bonus. It makes it so you need fewer mutagens, but it creates a nice tension between which skills to mutagen and which not to. I still really like Witcher 2's style but I like this one just as much.   The open world is a nice addition that most people, Skyrim fans especially, will like. True, witcher 2 was wayyyyy more linear but I felt it was just right. Not too much that you needed way points and a horse and not too little that it was a Call of Duty level. Witcher 3 goes big though, tons of points of interest all over. Secret caves, bandit camps, places of power, side quests, horse races, barfighting, cities, hamlets, military instillations, wild game, monster nests, Special named uber monsters tied to quests. So to make getting around the world easier the player is given 2 new things; Waypoints and a legendary stallion named Epona..oops I mean Roach! Roach is fun to ride, race and jump with. There are times when the movement can get wonky, in thick shrub or when theres junk to block all directions of movement. I did get stuck every now and then and had to put up with the turn around struggle. To go backwords you have to spin the horse around in a small radius, which can be annoying in the previously mentioned instances. I found jumping a lot made the horse control much easier in those sticky spots. Overall though I found Roach to be fun and necessary. I had a blast jumping and sliding off death drop mountain heights and not taking any damage and doing horse wheelies while sliding down snow mountains. Tony Hawk approved horse. The Waypoints are tried and true, bread and butter waypoints. Usually 1 per hamlet and a bunch in the major city hubs.   The major city in the game is Novigrad and it gave me nostalgic feelings of Baldur's Gate and Amn (Docks, Temple, Merchant Square anyone?) . It is the main city due to its wealth, location, and importance to both sides of the war. A sort of Jerusalem in feel. The look is more modern Assassin's creed style, of course, but it felt... right. Yeah theres more filler homes that I cant go into than I would like, but overall theres plenty of merchants and active npcs and guards to make it feel real and enthralling. Even the smaller towns and villages accomplish this and also do a good job of showing the horrors and ruin left in the wake of the war. Novigrad even pulls a sort of Shadows of Amn with the underworld factions being the true powers in play in the city. A good job is done really getting the city to come to life with the plot as well. The radical agents and ideals of the Temple cracking down on mages ( from the happenings at the summit in Loc Muine in 2.) The criminal power plays. The people just trying to endure. All of it splendidly done.  Here we go. The plot. Amazing. This truly is one of the best stories of all time. Not just for a video game, this is a masterpiece on par with Shakespeare. I laughed, I cried, I felt anger and extreme bloodlust at certain characters. I really felt in alighnment with Geralt. As people continued to give Geralt the jerk around, we both became more angry, soon choices almost turned to butchering innocents to save Ciri. In some places I wish the player did have more freedom to kill. Some Final Fantasy Limit Breaks did occur on some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.............",

            "review_text": "I just finished the WItcher 3 for my first complete playthrough and let me just say the Witcher 3 delivers on so many levels. It stands shoulder to shoulder with many of the great RPG's I've played to name the more notable on my list; TES Morrowind, Fallout 2, Fallout New Vegas, Baldur's Gate 2, and Planescape Torment. When I say it stands shoulder to shoulder in terms of RPG experience, I neglect to inform that the Witcher 3 has a much longer neck, towering over the best RPG's in most ways. And that's despite the major RPG deficit of the Witcher 3, that of character creation. In the Witcher 3, you don't start off as some unknown, unnamed prisoner who doesn't remember who he is or where he came from. Instead you are a well established character named Geralt who happens to be a Witcher who happens to be based upon multiple books inspired by the same name. So the witcher 3 is about character customization rather than character creation. And the Witcher 3 does an amazing job of dressing up Geralt in all types of armors, and fitting him with the best looking weaponry available.  Visually, the Witcher is stunning. One step further. Graphically, I've never played a more beautiful game. The setting of the Witcher includes many places included in the first game, like Novigrad and even Kaer Morhen. However, these areas are opened up and you can travel all over the place in open world style. Other areas like the Isles of Skellige, which have a very Skyrimesque feel, become available as the game progresses. It's amazing to be able to climb up mountains and look out over breathtaking vistas, crash your horse through rivers and streams, tromp through meadows and swamps and forest, even swim through ocean and lakes. I would seriously love to go camping in this world, except for the downer drowners, it would be pretty amazing. The Map in the Witcher 3 is huge. After my first play through I still feel like I didn't touch the surface.   As for gameplay the Witcher 3 plays out a little like a Rockstar game. For example, the horseback riding in the Witcher 3 much resembles Red Dead Redemptions' horseback riding mechanics. And that's a good thing. There are plenty of paths and roads to ride your horse all through the countryside, and the Witcher feels so fluid while on horseback. Also combat on horse is done well. There is actually a bonus to combat if attacking from a horse. Skyrim felt like punishment for trying to ride and attack on horseback. Also like a Rockstar game, is how quests are presentable. You can travel around the map focused on completing the main quest while along the way various side quests or interesting characters pop up. There are so many quests and side quest that one play through feels like just skimming the surface.  All in all, this review could be overwhelmingly long with all the great things to say about the Witcher 3. Is the game perfect? By no means. There are still flaws I could note. For example, one being that some of the world feels like filler. You can pretty much walk into any home at any time in any village and take whatever you want without an NPC batting as much as an eye. Only in town in front of a guard will stealing be an issue. Also, many of the characters are not vital and they just walk around to fill the game space. You'll see an odd amount of 'Shady Looking Characters' walking around Novigrad and also a number of meatheads saying 'pam peram' or something like that? But in fairness to the creators, the world is so huge many of the non essential npcs are there to make the world simply feel more alive. The game is still chalk full of characters in which Geralt can interact with.  If you are an RPG fan as well as a fan of action oriented open world games like GTA, or Batman, or even Assassins Creed, the Witcher 3 is probably a perfect fusion for your gaming style. It's like a hardcore RPG without being too hardcore. In my humble opinion, The Witcher 3 deserves game of the Year, and also deserves to go down as one of the best RPG's of our time. It's certainly my most epic gaming experience of the year. The creators of this game really hit this one out of the park. Hopefully the Witcher 3 will inspire more great games like it. Cheers.",

            "review_text": "Attempting to write about this game makes me run into the same problem I had when playing it - The Witcher 3 is overwhelming. In several ways.  If you have played one of the previous games, you can expect more of the series' staples: a highly detailed, rugged fantasy setting with a twist as it's borrowing heavily from Slavic folklore. Because of that, the setting manages to feel familiar and fresh at the same time. In said environment, you're forced to make non-binary decisions that have the potential to bite you in the ♥♥♥ later on. It's also nice to see that CDPR stepped up their writing game. Some of the main questlines could be among the best in a role-playing game so far.  While the combat system still leaves a lot to be desired, it's a clear improvement over its predecessor's. The action-oriented Arkham Asylum style fighting is back, but with less annoyances this time around. Meaning: more movement options, less weird hitboxes, less dying from an opponent jumping in from off-screen. There are nitpicks, however.  The potions enhancing Geralt's abilities were crucial to winning fights in previous games, but now they last barely long enough to make toast. They can be applied during combat now, but you only get two quickslots, meaning you have to open the inventory and apply new kinds of potions manually once your charges are depleted. And there is no way to switch between bombs other than the quick menu, which amounts to the same thing - it breaks flow.  Unlike its predecessors, The Witcher 3 is a bit of an open world game. The areas are massive and reward the player for exploring every nook and cranny. It really pays off since the best gear can be acquired that way. Additionally, optional quests, random encounters, treasures and monster contracts are sprinkled all over the world. There's also the card game for the times you want to take a break from monster slaying.  This is where the game's aforementioned overwhelming nature shows itself. At some point, the secondary quests just keep piling up and you don't know where to start. There's so much to do that at times you don't feel like making any progress at all, which is sometimes crippling the narrative. You get one cutscene in which Geralt proclaims that he needs to find someone asap only to ride off into the sunset, play cards and get drunk. Even without the optional tasks, the primary and secondary quests are enough to fill two games worth of content. The Witcher 3 is in dire need of a monster slayer itself because it is a content BEAST.  Unfortunately, making any game open world comes with certain downsides and The Witcher 3 is no exception. The tragedy about open world games is that the sheer amount of content they feature is usually bought by sacrificing direction. Where a more linear game would feature a few well-developed, splendidly paced quests, open world games go for sheer numbers, resulting in standardized, forgettable tasks that become menial. While The Witcher 3 tries its best to avoid this, you can’t shake the feeling of engaging in busywork at times. It doesn’t help that the rewards for doing monster contracts, for instance, are rather miniscule and mostly serve as an excuse to spend more time with the game.  Strangely enough, The Witcher 3 tends to be inconsequential about its open world aspect: You can explore, but all points of interest are already laid out for you on the map. You can do what you want, but quests have a level recommendation and attempting a quest maybe five levels higher than your own usually doesn’t end well. And the game doesn’t tell you which level is recommended unless you accept the quest. The absolute worst part is that gear has a level requirement, too. Which may lead to the following scenario: You’re stumbling upon a monster several levels higher than yourself, but for some reason you think you can take it on. After several tries and the exhaustion of all your resources you pull through. The prize for your effort? Top quality gear you're allowed to use after 10 level ups. Yay.  The implementation of an open world environment also comes at the expense of uniqueness. While the areas look gorgeous, they’re hard to tell apart sometimes as one grassy field with shaking trees chases after another. Still, maintaining that level of detail in an area as big as Velen with no loading times in-between is pretty damn impressive.  There are other nitpicks like the lack of item storage, overly enthusiastic weapon degradation, hefty falling damage or a certain glitchiness, another open world game staple, but it’s really just that: nitpicking.  The Witcher 3 is a fantastic game and among the best story-driven RPGs in recent years. Ayup!",

Really, side-quests in this game doesn't feel like side-quests. Even MMORPG like 'get that, pick this' style quests have intriguing stories and does not feel boring. There are some side-quests in this game that could easily be a main story for another game. Graphics of this game is really good especially at sunsets it looks damn good. But deactivate HairWorks because it really kills the fps and imo Geralt's original hair is better but I can't deny that HW looks damn good on monsters. There is a mod for activating HW just for monsters you can check it out. They gave us 16 free DLC and some major some minor patches every few weeks. They really listen to their community. This game easily takes at least 60 hours to complete generally but if you don't want it to end and want to explore every square meter of it then it would take a whole lot more and the price is really low for this kind of entertainment. If you have the money, just buy it!",

It makes the combat a lot more fun because you can't go all yolo on them. You have to plan your fights, look at who your opponent is and kill the weakest first. The only time I kept dying was at the very first fight with the ghouls. I wasn't aware of the fact you could walk away and leash one by one. Killing enemies 5 lvls higher then your own is no problem.  Would I suggest the game? Hell yea",

Music; The soundtrack to this game... Its just unbelievable.It makes you sad when it needs to, makes you angry when needs to. Its so good and melodic. If you play with music disabled. Enable it.  World; The world is huge with diffrent kinds of characters all over it. You go to Velen. Go to the country side. People are diffrent. They are poor,sad,scared. You go to the cities. People hate you, they are wealthy. You go to Kaer'Morhen. People there are your friends. The buildings,views are amazing. Wherever you go there is a new esthetic to it. Places are diffrent and not boring.  Story; As a person that did not play Withcer 1/2. This game got me into the story so hard. I got sad,happy,angry. Everything is so detalied and perfect. Don't hate me but I think this game has better story than some other popular series that are on TV at the moment. To be honest with you, I played the whole main story with goosebumps.  Items; There are so many items with diffrent characteristics and abilities. You can never collect everything.  Dialogs; I hated the game with dialogs like this. But this game... The dialogs never bore you. It changes the story a whole lot as well. Encourages multiple play-throughs.  I know I am a bit late playing this game. But I honestly think I made the best decision of my life buying this and playing it. I absolutely love this game and RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE. IT IS A MASTERPIECE.

The graphics are stunning. Often, you find yourself thinking that 'this scene would make a great painting' or 'look at how much detail they put into this!'  The characters are perfect. Geralt is a badass, Yennefer and Triss are as strong as ever, Ciri plays a great leading role, and just about everyone in the world 'adds' to the world in some meaningful way.  The world/level design is excellent; the environments feel realistic and lived-in. Each environment is unique as well. For example, there are snow-covered peaks, pitteresque orchards, busy towns (and a legitimate city), and even castles.  The story and quests are amazing, with no fetch-quests or mindless killing contracts.  The music is incredible!  The combat can be a bit annoying at times, but it does have its fun moments. If you plan on buying the game to cast magic spells, you should know that magic is not at all a major part of this game.  Some of the technology in this game is so cutting-edge that you have to see it to believe it. Loading screens are virtually non-existent, and in Novigrad, the capital, you can walk right into a building and see the city outside through the window. I want you to play this game and have the experiences I did, so buy it at any price because it will be worth it!    ",

Basically on the political side, witcher 3 story is very disappointing. I was expecting much more.  What i liked Other than the political side of the story progression, i love everything about this game! from the rich open world to the beautiful graphics. The main story revolves around Geralt (the witcher) trying to find Ciri and save her from the wild hunt (specter Knights). There's also plenty of side stories and quest lines. Witcher 3 has a HUGE amount of content with very well done and interesting sidemissions that actually have an impact on the overall story, a tone of monster hunting contracts and random events, There seems to be an endless amount of stuff to do. Combat isn't easy and you have to use potions, oils and the witcher's powers to win fights. You can also fight on horseback but it is awkward and doesn't control too well. CD project red delivered on everything they promised and much more. This game is one of the best RPGs of all time and is a MUST BUY! but i do recommend you play the first 2 games or read the books before playing the witcher 3.",

I can't stop the complentionist in me to get to all those question marks even though I finished the game.  Some notes: - I feel the movement is a little bit clunky. I don't know if it's by design but I can say it's not smooth. Even with the alternative movement setting, I just feel it can do better. - I'm not really sure about this but the UI seems a bit slow (30fps ish). I don't know what a 60fps UI feels like but when you play the game then hit that start button to open up inventories, maps or quest, it just doesn't feel right to me. - Crafting system could be better.

Gameplay 10/10 I am very impressed with the combat its not like The Witcher 2 where you really did not use any spells i find myself on my on just using them,The combat is difficult but it makes you really want to master it in this game dodging and parrying etc is essential to stay alive.I recommend starting the difficulty on blood and broken bones it makes you need food and drink to get back health.There is so much to do it is really overwhelming so many missions,treasures,Witcher contracts,etc it really just immerses you into it,And the skill trees allow you to play how you want and invest points into spells,combat,alchemy,oils,potions,and so much more.  Characters 10/10 I find myself reading every character entry i find just seeing the history of each of them,each character is so different in its own way some characters you will love and some you will hate and you can decide for yourself in the dialogue if you want someone as a close friend or a enemy but be wary decisions will affect you later.  Sounds 10/10 When im riding through a forest i find myself hearing wolf howls birds and just the sound of my horse hooves hitting water or just on the ground it is just so dynamic and real sounding and each beast has its own and very unique sound.  Graphics 10/10 i have mine set to ultra the frame rate is amazing when im playing sometimes i just sit back and admire how good the graphics are it is definitely one of the best graphic games up to date,The trees moving and the water reflection and the sunsets etc were so well put together its just amazing.  Overall 10/10 if you like rpg's or single player games or just having a good time and getting lost in a world full of adventures.I would highly recommend this game to anyone this game was long awaited and anticipated and it did not let down one bit.I would call this game a master piece and one of the greatest games of all time and definitely a need to play.",

Sure, you will complain about this and say 'BUT AGE OF EMPIRES AND CHILDHOOD' well screw that. I don't care about your nostalgia. I grew up on DOOM and AoE and Starcraft. I was doing all the jazz too. This was the best game I have ever played.   I did not complete all of the side quests or Witcher contracts or treasure hunts or secondary quests because... 1. Side quests were often silly and not as interesting as secondary quests 2. A lot of the Witcher contracts were out of my level for quite some time and I never got around to doing them all 3. I had mastercraft Ursine armor. I didn't need to do all the other treasure hunts. Ursine armor is life.  4. About half of the secondary quests don't tie into the story mode, I pretty much only did the tie ins but a healthy amount of them were finished.   I would like to start out with the beginning. This game has the single best introduction and training feature ever to be in a video game. You can spend upward of five hours in White Orchard to get everything. You can, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND spending as much time as possible to get everything 100% in White Orchard. It is worth it for story. It is worth it for mechanics. You need to do it if you are on the two highest difficulties.   Combat - This combat is great. It seems clunky as first but it is really quite smooth. It is very unforgiving on the higher modes and YOU CANNOT BUTTON SMASH! I learned the hard way. I started on Death March, and gradually lowered. I finally got a feel for the combat so I stuck to blood and bones after about 8 hours into my playthrough and I only lowered it when I fought bosses I was ill equipped (bombs, oils, potions) for that I shouldn't have been so.    You need to use your bombs, your oils, and your potions on harder difficulties. Even if it is just Enhanced oil, you will destroy everything. Those early werewolves you encounter in the very first areas of Velen, you can't kill it without bombs and oils. It's health regen is just too great. Most people I read on the interwebs waited until they were well above level and could safely DPS it. Your starting Items really do suck and you need better ones as well as abilities.    Bombs, Oils, and Potions. Buy your formulas early so you don't get destroyed later in the game. I went through with level 1 swallow and didn't even have that until about 15 hours in. Seriously do all the quests and if it tells you to make something MAKE IT!   This game makes you think before you fight. I prepared for my werewolf fights by finding the ingredients to the cursed oils. Then I set up my potions, swallow and thunderbolt. After the very early first two you encounter I was prepared for the next ones, the harder ones. I thought about it how I would do it. 'I will dodge and then use my Igni hoping to light it ablaze. If not then when it jumps me I can roll backwards and throw a silver bomb which will hurt it badly. Igni will be back up and it should light it on fight but I will be able to land attacks in'    There are some creatures that takes more preparation and knowledge. On the harder difficulties you won't be able to kill the big bad vampires unless you have fought the lesser, weaker ones. They help train you. Really it's about how many monsters you kill because with each one you kill, you learn their weakness. You learn what to do to prepare. You learn what types you need oils and what types not so much. (Trolls, elementals, gargoyles, so hard thankful I had oils)   You need to use your full inventory pretty much. You need to use your knowledge, You need to use your Bestiary. Killing different types and named monsters increasingly help you by adding to your bestiary. Knowledge is key. There are a few books that actually help in that regard.    Use ALL OF THE SIGNS!!!! Many of them are useful when going against large amounts of enemies. I used Axii more than Aard, Igni, Yrrd, or Quen when against a large group of humans that could easy chain kill me. I would Axii their halberd/spear/shield people and end them. Use your abilities and it's up to your creative mind how to do it. I have used Aard to take many of the enemy out to the ground so I could engage fewer foes.   You won't be making a lot of money on PC. You don't have the exploits that PS4 and Xbox have. So Witcher Contracts and looting. Don't sell your alchemy or ore/ingots/crafting supplies. You need them.    This game has by far the best crafting system in the entire history of crafting systems. There are hundreds of supplies. There are hundreds of ways to get the supplies if you count dismantling items. A lot of the rare items are FREAKING RARE! Dermitium or whatever the heck it is, IT IS HARD TO FIND! I RAN OUT! You need so many things for your higher tier gear it isn't funny. But it's part of the Witcher world.    I spent so much time looking for diagrams for ingredients or ingredients that I found every mystery point in Velen and Novigrad. Every single one. I have no regrets. I found side quests that are more memorable than the main story line. I fought epic battles that was only overshadowed by boss fights in the main story. Some of them were far more dramatic and cool then the actual story fights.    The choices I made I saw reflect throughout the entire game. This is the one and only game where I have cried because of choices I made. It made me frustrated, not because I couldn't win, but because I chose the right choices. I was a good person. I chose the right. I let the consequences follow. People died. Things happened. It frustrated me that in this world bad things happened to people I liked.     The Character development is unmatched. It brings humanity to this world. Everything is grey save a few people. It makes me angry that I can't stop many of the things. Stop or change. I have emotionally invested in this world.    There are very few fast travel points. This is so good. Many people will think it is a burden but it forces you to actually travel. You explore the world. There are not many quests that are forcing you to do this tedious tasks. Very few actually do.   There are a plethora of Fetch quests that have been better than the plots to most games such as Dragon Age, Dragon age 2, Dragon Age inquisition, Skyrim, DOTA 2(&lt;LoL is better by the way) and every quest is different. There is not a quest that plays out the same. Each is unique.   Many of these little quests will impact the main story in immense ways. There has not ever been a better game with better quests. Ever. This has just set the bar with how an open world RPG should be made.   This is one of the few games where the side characters you meet once and never again actually have personalities. You will have people putting up Witcher Contracts that are each unique and breath humanity into this game. Some of the most interesting people in this world were not the main story line people. They were the farmers, the guards, the soldiers. I liked quite a few of them.    READ ALL OF THE DIALOGUE! PLEASE DO IT! PLEASE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IMPORTANT IT IS!   Please let me tell you about the monsters. They are each different and fight completely separately. Trust me. Every creature plays differently. They each have their own personality. Bird, beast, Nekker, Drowner, Hag, Ogroid, Instecoid. Everything.    It has it's own personality and will mess with your emotions.   TLDR; Good combat, lots of unique quests and creatures. You can't be dumb and play hardest settings",

It took me over 80 hours to complete the game, that's the main quests, most of the secondary quests, many monster contracts, but very few of the treasure hunts. There are side games, such as Gwent (a strategic card game) and horse races, I didn't play Gwent and probably did only a few horse races. Needless to say, the game has more than 80 hours in it.  The fighting in the game is fairly simple and easy to use, I used a 360 gamepad and found that quite manageable. I initially felt a bit overwhelmed learning the various crafting methods but quickly became accustomed to everything. The graphics are very good and performance is equally good but I did play a year after release and am using a GTX 1080.  The story is good and sometimes it's difficult to tell peoples' intentions, which is good, but the story is very long. They manage to keep the story going without becoming repetitive, even doing monster contracts didn't feel repetitive like Skyrim (didn't I already kill a bear in that same cave!?). When it was all over, there were still a ton of undiscovered locations on my map, probably just monster nests and guarded treasures.  I recommend this game; high-quality producion with 80+ hours of play time.",

You simply won't find anything that hasn't change for the better.  - Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff, - Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end, - Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes from this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created, - Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the felling you are in there, in some village , city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable thing, - Every single side quest, and believe me there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs, - Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you, - THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childish or not at all, - Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to put an end to his misery.  The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealth person (which he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content. Many of the things I struggled with had been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them.  All in all one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",

            "review_text": "(This review is spoiler-free)  The witcher 3 is simply put, one of the best games I have ever played in my life.  After 55 hours of gameplay, I still have an INSANE amount of things to do even though I completed all major side quests, many minor ones, and the main quest itself.  The devs went out of their way to make this game as polished and as filled with content as possible. There's detail and depth everywhere you look, There are always things to do, hidden lore or old european mythology to find and read and many more.  I can sit here and praise this game for all the things it did right and I could probobly write a book on everything it did right, even the devs know how to treat their customers right!  But, since everyone's praising this game and has allready said what needs to be said (superb story, vivid and wonderful cast of characters, amazingly detailed and multiple routed side quests, amazing character progression, fantastic RPG mechanics, developer treating you like a human being and not a wallet and the side quests that are so good, you can't use words to describe them) I am gonna base my review on the negatives this game has to show CDPR the things that didn't work in this game to help them make their next game, Cyberpunk 2077, the greatest game ever. All my hours are on Blood and broken bones! (2nd hardest difficulty) so, it should be known by now that my review has to be taken with a grain of salt.  Let's start with some minor issues:  I appericate that the devs handed me the soundtrack on purchase (and the sountrack itself is legendary) but, I can't help but feel dissapointed that there is none of the ambient music in the files.  Controling your horse roach can be a bit difficult becuase of weird camera and movement problems. They never bothered me during races or normal horse-back riding but still, something worth mentioning.  I don't mind the UI, but I know a lot of people who hate it so, it has be in here.  Alright, now I am gonna mention my biggest issues with the game.  Starting, with the endgame gameplay setup. After you beat the story, the world feels empty as all main plot characters disappear and you are left with nothing but the few side quests you didn't finish. I wish I could have gone contract hunting with those characters or even talked to them for more dialogue sequences and simply, seeing them again. With such interesting characters that feel so life-like, at least radiant quests would have done justice. I can litterally sit for hours hearing the characters talk about anything, even their morning. They are THAT interesting.  The Camera is a bit wonky and doesn't feel right at times with wrong angles and unresponsiveness especially, in combat. The devs did relate an alternative mode which does help a bit, but I think that this is something worth mentioning as it bothers me a lot in combat. Also, I feel it would make combat even more satisfying than it allready is if we were in full control of the camera during combat.  despite being bigger than even gta V, the world has some empty parts with no room for exploration. Parts like ard skellig's explorable locations are all under the sea or on an island, I wish there was actual places to discover on the main island of Skellige.  Speaking of Skellige, The main story section of Skellige felt really rushed as the main character didn't spend much time there. I think I am the only one who realised this so, I think I might be missing something but I just think that they had much more potential with that area.   That's it, as I said before, I like the game a lot and would even go as far as saying that it's THE BEST RPG I have ever played, I just hope these problems aren't present in their next game to make it the best game it can ever be.",

            "review_text": "This is hands down the best game that I've ever played. Superb storytelling with an amazing story that wonderfully balances world politics and personal conflict. A serious, dark tone that also revolves around morality and religion with a likeable, badass and sympathetic lead and an amazing set of main and secondary characters with great voice acting and writting. The witcher 3 has a huge, beautiful, coherent and immersive game world that feels alive with very interesting side quests and activities that are so well written and good that could have been part of the main game/quests. The game looks phenomenal with beautifully rendered characters and breathtaking scenery. The roleplaying is very deep and detailed with so many different type of choices (ex. good/bad)that have a MAJOR impact on the story and on the characters. What I liked in the choices in this game is that unlike most of the other games, there are some moments when there are no good and bad choices. There's bad and worse, or bad and evil. There are so many difficult choices in this game that are fantastically revealed later on. As far as the gameplay goes, the combat is really fun and responsive with a very detailed customization and crafting system and a wide variety of swords, armors, skills and items. The 'detective part' of the game is very fun. You have to use your witcher senses to 'investigate' an area in order to track someone down or to learn who was here and what they did.  With the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red’s saga has grown into something magnificent. It’s a truly epic game with an amazing story that will have you hooked on throughout the whole game and that sets the bar higher for every other new RPG game . I couldn't help but care for every single character in the game, which made making decisions much harder. The Witcher 3 at this point is a MUST for every fantasy world and RPG fan.   For all the reasons above I'm giving the witcher 3 a perfect 10/10. Even after finishing the game you'll still want to come back to this breathtaking fantasy world to explore more interesting side quests, kill monsters and meet new characters.",

However, once I spent some time playing (and then re-mapping a few bindings and sensitivity levels based off what I was doing in combat), things got a  LOT  better. Combat in particular is actually nicely tactical and quite fun and rewarding, once you wrap your head around the underlying design mechanics.  It also helped that I can run it on full Ultra with all the bells and whistles and still get 100+ fps everywhere. It's pretty nice to have a graphically intensive game that is also very well-optimized to use the PC's full potential, rather than just total slop garbage code everywhere (I'm looking at you, XCOM 2, Total War, etc. etc.).

Between the awesome graphics, depth of character(s), facial expressions and amazing story-telling, this game is truly a one of a kind game. Based off of the books written by Andrzej Sapkowski which, due solely to the quality of this game, I now intend to read after I finish this game to further explore the lore of this beautiful, dark world. The love interests and sex scenes aren't bad and it adds to the quality of the game, making it more life-like. Not only that, just like in real life, people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They lie to you, spit on you and curse your name and f*ck with you during quests, making Geralt's life a lot more difficult. 12/10",

A masterpiece of story telling that draws you into a dark, dirty and very real world where pain and suffering are all around and your desire to help those around you may have results you never saw coming.   Graphics - 9/10  Regardless of the 'graphics downgrade' this is a beautiful piece of gaming art. Simply looking at the skyline in the evening is enough to keep you interested for longer that you would think. Lighting effects and wonderfully detailed environments make this a gem amongst games. Facial design and textures are particularly excellent even at lower graphics settings. A few minor issues aside such as the oddly over-animated trees this is easily one of the best looking games ever made considering its epic scale.  Gameplay - 8/10  If you have played the previous Witcher game you should be familiar with how this game plays. If like myself you have a game controller to hand it works fine. However, if you are only using keyboard and mouse this can feel a little awkward. Combat is fluid, not quite up to that standard of the Arkham games but still very enjoyable. The simple act of wandering through the wilds of this game is awesome on its own even if you don't run into anything that wants to eat you.  Story - 9/10  Never before has a game made you this aware that you have made an impact on the world around you and in such a subtle way. There is no indicator telling you if you are making the 'correct' decision you just make it as you would in real life. Trying your best to help a person only to find out that what you did has doomed another you never knew is a refreshing change from a game holding your hand asking 'are you sure?' every time you talk to an important person. As in Whitchers past the story is excellently written and involves topics that are sadly lacking in many AAA games. Moments that seem believably part of this sometimes harrowing world and not simply a grotesque shock tool.  Overall - 9/10  A few minor issues here and there and bugs that should be ironed out soon. A must buy for all RPG/open world fans. This is easily one of the best RPG games ever made and is certainly a contender for game of the year.  A wonderful, terrible, beautifully dirty adventure through a real world filled with thoroughly believable characters. Well done CD Project Red.",

You can get ability points but slots to use them are to slow to open. 3. Early message boards with quests like suggested level 33 when  you are 5 is kind of silly. The first Griffin is not the Griffins you will run into later on. A Griffin in Velen kills me in a split second.  4.

There is no way I'll be able to give this game justice by posting my opinion in this review, but I'll do my best to outline some of the key elements that made The Witcher 3 one of the best, if not the best, game I've ever played.  CDPR went to enormous lengths to create meaningful interactions everywhere you turn in The Witcher 3. Not only is this game packed to the brim with rich story, but all of the diolague serves a purpose and will keep you engaged. Not once did the diolague feel forced. It took 44 hours for me to beat the main story line with limited secondary quest participation (without the DLC's), an incredible value for 40 bucks.   The character development is unlike any other game I've ever played. I found myself making decisions based off of what I thought the characters would want because I just wanted everything to turn out well for them. Even the charater of monsters and creatures you have few encounters with is gripping.   (Shout out to my boy Bart)    I have seen some complaints about how combat feels/plays out, and I agree when playing on a low difficulty setting. Playing through the game on a higher difficulty does test your ability to appropriately use light attacks, counter attacks, blocking, and magic. I was satisfied after defeating a foe, and when I lost I was able to analyze what I could have done differently and replan an attack.   The vision of the artists and writers came together seamlessly for this title. They truly produced a masterwork that will exceed the expectations of many people considering purchasing this game.  In a time where developers are shoveling incomplete Alpha games with microtransactions in our faces at AAA title prices, CD Projekt Red is proof that the future of gaming is a bright one.    This game is a 10.    ",

It lacked some things that are what made me enjoy DA:I and Skyrim as much as I did such as character customization, play style, creating your character's personality, and the overall situation that the world is in that you have to deal with. I figured that I was pretty much done with it, and I left a negative review speaking my opinion of the game and why I didn't like it. After recieving a vicious comment on the review of some random person calling me an idiot for having an opinion, I removed the review and started an entirely new game. I don't know what happened, but after starting a new game and really getting into the world and not focusing on only gameplay I was pleasantly surprised. After spending a lot of time playing TW3, I can say that it is equally as good as DA:I, but not quite as good as Skyrim (many people disagree but that's just my opinion). I like the combat system in TW3 more than DA:I's or Skyrim's, but I like DA:I's story and world more than TW3's, and the freedom that you have over your character in Skyrim. All 3 games have pros and cons, but if you enjoy either DA or TES, then you're sure to enjoy this one. I guess that I have to thank the jerk that roasted me because he/she was he one whoconvinced me to give it another chance.

The story-telling in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing magnificent, you just can't help being grown attached to the characters, and in my opinion, this is what makes this game so good. I've had some trouble with the handling of the game, for example the horse movement isn't really superb and it can be clunky at times but the combat system is fantastic, yet, all of this doesn't matter. If you came for a game which is focused about gameplay and movement and such then this isn't a game for you (not to say that the feel of the game is bad, it's suprisingly good) but this isn't what the game's about. If you want a game which has a great story with fantastic voice actors, storytelling, characters and a deep story at that then you should get this game, full price or not, this game is definitely worth it. The story keeps you focused in the game, I don't think I skipped one cutscene! You find books and such that you can read to know more about the lore of the game, you can do side-missions which will also give you a better background on what had happend before and of course, there are witcher contracts which aren't really related. The main focus of this game is the story, it can keep you playing the game non-stop for hours at times just to know more and progress more.  Honestly, if you're looking for a story-driven game with one of the best storytellings which every act you do will affect your ending (well, not any, but most) then get this game right now. I give this game a solid 9.9/10 (9.9 for the horse mechanics, sorry), I think this tops every single player game I played, definitely GOTY.",

            "review_text": "I was never a fan of the Witcher games. Part 1 was too tedious to get into (a lot of people had that problem), and part 2 threw so many names, events and political intrigue in your face within 10 minutes that I ended up not even finishing it initially. I gave part 3 a try and, eh, it's the best game I've ever played?   Like, this isn't an exaggeration. I've played a boatload of games. RPGs, mostly. None of them come even close to this. It's the immersion that really gets me. Especially the sound. There's nothing quite like hearing the wind roll in, leaves rustling louder and louder, until a storm hits you. The stupendously great graphical engine helps too, of course.   As for the quests, of which the game contains about an estimated 23 thousand or something, they're actually fun. Not a single quest will ever feel lazy, or tacked on. Even something that starts off as a simple fetch quest always has a little twist at some point, leaving the player to make a decision, big or small. Even walking into a pawn shop to sell some of your junk can open a quest, it's nuts.   Then there's the monster hunts, which make you feel like a crossever between the brothers Winchester, Sherlock Holmes and freakin' Sir Galahad. Tracking down the beast step by step, figuring out what it is, where it is, and how to efficiently kill it. It's fun. Like, really fun.  I liked this game so much I actually went back to Witcher 2 and found myself finishing it and enjoying it quite a bit. The fact that I remembered a lot for Witcher 3 actually helped me understand most of the characters and events from that game a lot better. Let's call it non-linear storytelling.  But yeah, conclusion, 10/10. I want to come up with critique but I genuinely can't.",

            "review_text": "Ah, the Witcher 3. What can you say about a game that already has 50 thousand reviews? Nothing new, most likely, but here's my two cents anyways:  It. Is. Gorgeous. It looks like art on my screen, it's simply lovely. It may not technically be the prettiest game you'll play but everything you see is done with such a consistent and balanced approach to quality that it wraps up as an exceptionally attractive game to look at.   The writing, what can I say about the writing? It is, in my opinion, 10/10. Superb characters, with memorable plights and stories to get caught up in. You'll love some, hate some, find many annoying and others still you'll wish there was more to do with them given how interesting they are. There is a deep, frightening and engrossing world to get lost in, with particular attention paid to believeable settings. The lore is fantastic, and the story is grim and ultimately is one of my favorite RPG stories of all time - and the DLC is disgustingly good, damn near better than the core content. Which is astounding to be able to say.  The ability you have as a player to shape the world you move through and the ends of your stories and characters is something that you have to play to see. There are so many subtle touches, little things to tie everything you do to your story. The flexibility of the game, given that it is based on and driven by a linear storyline (having originated as a series of Polish novels) is remarkable. There are no black-and-white lines here. You are not going to be smacked in the face with Paragon points or a little bar telling you how evil you have made Geralt become. As like life, these things are found in the people around you and the way they react to you. It's marvellous.  However, the Witcher 3 has some of the dryest and dullest combat you will come across. It's actually pretty disapointing how boring fights that should be awesome are just plain snooze-inducing. The combat just is not built very well at all, and I know that many will disagree with me, but the magic isn't impressive or even particularly useful in many cases. The alchemy is useful but crafting has been simplified significantly, so much so that it feels deliberately game-y now, which I found to be a confusing design choice in a game with such an obvious focus on immersing the player in another world. Gathering materials is boring and tedious. Crafting, and pretty much everything in the game, is buried in a nonsensical amount of menus and sub-menus. Equipment upgrades feel more-or-less worthless as besides the aesthetics, nothing but the damage number matters.   I firmly believe this game is an overall masterpiece in the realm of interactive fiction, an accoomplishment that everyone even slightly interested in can enjoy. I recommend it because the story and characters are par-none. Better than anything else I have played in recent memory. But it is not perfect, nor is it completely above reproach, so be warned - the gameplay itself is not terribly engaging and the combat is boring, even when you're fighting monsters that should make your heart race. In my opinion, ultimately this game will absolutely be worth it to you if you're looking for a world to explore, less so for gameplay to master.",

            "review_text": "Already completed the base game from GOG, bought the GOTY here since it was cheaper than buying the expansions on GOG thanks to regional pricing. So currently on my second run of the game and I have to say it is one of the best games I've played. Seeing the changes in gameplay and character interactions when player makes different choices continues to impress me. Even secondary quests and monster contracts are quite fun and crafted very well. Excellent score, visuals and characters make its many GOTY titles well deserved.  At first I hated the skilling system, now I don't hate it but at the same time I think they could've gone with something better. Also one other minor complaint of mine is how the game doesn't at times give enough hints about failable quests, a small alert saying this quest would fail would have been nice but this is not a deal breaker in any way. Pros    Combat has been highly improved over the W2 one    Revamped alchemy system which removes the need to constantly brew them, liked this change    Well written quests and characters    Great soundtrack    Choices which go beyond good or evil often with surpising outcomes  Cons    Customization is a bit limited, would've been nice to be able to customize armor color for one    Directions on map can be very misleading at times    Monster trophy bonuses are a bit disappointing in terms of variation    Main characters disappear once game is complete, would've been nice to keep them in world with minor interaction options with them like say playing gwent, doctor or what not  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   Overall I'd say that this is definitely a game to be played and has more than enough content both in terms of quality &amp; quantity for its asking price.",

            "review_text": "Alright, so, this game has become one of my favorites of all time, if not THE favorite of all time, after my first playthrough. I'm going to see how well it holds up after completing it, soon. So, let's begin the list of reasons why I love this game.  1) It sticks to the key points in the story it originated from. I read the books first, before i ever played this game, and there is no describing how happy it makes me when the characters are chatting and they bring up the story of Dandilion and the Djinn from The Last Wish. I wont go any further into it because additional tidbits involve semi-spoilers, but if you read the books, the game is that much more wonderful. Conversely, you by no means have to have read the books, or even played the previous games, to understand what's going on in this one. Sure, it helps for background stuff, but you'll still understand everything going on at all times,   (except maybe the unicorn)   so dont let that stop you from this amazing experience.  2) The story itself is wonderful, in my opinion. The level of depth and detail to each character is so amazingly well done to the point where you can get reads of their opinions from the body language during a dialog scene, and you almost always have the ability to steer the conversation how you want it to go, defuse a situation or make it worse, start a blood fued or end one, etc etc.. The voice acting, too, is quite spectacular, and characters lips and faces are some of the most expressive I've seen to date.  There is one part in the story, for instance, where you listen a lady sing (she's part of a performing group) and it is hands down the best singing I've heard from a video game ever. As someone who went to an internationally acclaimed school of music for his voice, it was a fantastic experience. Shortly after that, someone is greviously injured, and the person who loves them looks at you and says 'Geralt, find them. Find whoever did this... and kill them.' with such emotion that I wanted to shed a tear in sympathy and was furious as hell at the same time. This is also the only game that I've enjoyed or gotten a great benefit out of 99% of the side quests in it, instead of doing them for the xp or something.  For instance,    I felt good after I helped an old lady find her best frying pan.    I took the moral high ground and didnt take money after bringing someone the news that their loved on was dead, and got a reputation as a decent person, instead of a vile witcher, in that area.    Abandoned villages can be repopulated, meaning more blacksmiths, armorers, herbalists, etc.  3) The actual gameplay, combat and movement and such, is very well done. On the two easiest difficulties, you can be pretty confident, maybe a bit more care is needed once you get to big boss type stuff. But as soon as you go higher in difficulty, you feel very mortal in a very dangerous world.  Each monster belongs to a class of some sort (ie necrophage, hybrid, spirit, etc) and each has a general weakness, like oils, but every single monster has a different attack pattern and/or ability, and usually a spell weakness that can be exploited. No cookie cutter formula here. You have to be able to anticipate the attack, dodge or roll out of the way the right way, and then know how much time you have to hit it before it strikes again. Feels like the glorious offspring of skyrim's open world and dark souls-esque combat, for a good reference point.  The world you fight these monsters in is, in a word, GORGEOUS. Each continent feels distinctly different, each area has it's own clothing style and accent, and every single bit of scenery is vivid and wonderful. As an aside, the clothing and armor in this game is a world apart from anything else I've seen. As you journey, you can unlock different sets of 'Witcher Gear' which grow more powerful as you upgrade them, AS WELL AS change their appearance. For instance, I played with the Cat School gear, and it starts out as a short sleeve shirt with a hard vest, then a light longsleeve with padding, then chainmail on the sleeves, etc etc. Really gives you the feeling that your armor is evolving with your character, and you're improving it and refining it as you grow more accustomed to it. And it stand out as clothes instead of a body suit, unlike most every other game I can think of. There are some times that hitboxes and models can be a bit buggy (geralt can jump/float up a slant sometimes), and the occasional body bounces a bit further than it probably should, but it is honestly more funny than annoying, as it happens so rarely.   So, in conclusion, the story is 10/10, the gameplay is 9.9 out of 10, the world design and depth is 10/10, and the only regret I have after playing it through is I'll never get to experience playing it for the first time again. Such a wonderful journey.   also, dont forget to check out the (at this time) like 14 free dlc things that are all great.",

            "review_text": "The Witcher 3 is a final journey in the game series based on A. Sapkowski's books. You don't have to read them before playing to fully enjoy it, as the game has its own encyclopedia of people, monsters and other things. The in-game books also tell you a lot about the lore. You don't have to play the previous games either. Although their events take place before Wild Hunt, the game tells you enough info about them to put things together. Of course if you want to have the best experience possible, you should play them as well, because the choices you make carry over and people will react according to them.  The choices and actions you make are one of the reasons what makes this game so great. Help one person do a certain thing and you'll get a whole kind of different situations afterwards, even when it's gonna end bad and you didn't realise it could be that way. After each action people might act differently towards you, too.  The main story quests have some of the most memorable moments I've ever experienced in a video game and will have you glued to your PC. The same goes for the side quests. As they are practically everywhere, you'll spend most of the time doing them. They're not the typical boring side quests, all of them are diverse and have their own unique stories to tell and that's what makes them so wonderful and very enjoyable. Either doing the witcher contracts on monsters or helping out an old woman clearing out her kitchen. All quests can be found on notice boards in towns or when exploring.  The world you'll get to explore is huge. You'll encounter different kinds of stuff everywhere. In the forests, bogs, swamps, beautiful fields, meadows, hills, rocky mountains, rivers, the open sea and the surrounding isles, or outskirts. The cities and towns are lively, especially the majestic city of Novigrad, where you'll spend a really lot of time.   The graphics are breathtaking, the soundtrack is fascinating and suits the places where you are or the situations you'll find yourself in. The controls aren't hard to get used to and the same goes for combat. It can be tricky in the beginning because you can't fight all enemies the same way. You'll have to adapt depending on who or what you're fighting, which is a good thing though.  The game's expansion pack is another thing worth mentioning because it adds new locations but most importantly, more stories! The story telling is fantastic, maybe even better than in the original game :)  Another thing worth mentioning is Gwent, the game's addicting card game. Once you'll understand how to play, you'll spend hours gambling with other people to win their cards which you can add to your deck to make it stronger. And of course there are Gwent side quests, too.  The game offers a lot of fun for hundreds of hours, the characters are unforgettable, there are moments where you'll laugh, other will be thrilling. And in most you'll have just some casual fun, but it's damn worth it and you won't forget any of it.  Definitely recommended, because for me it's the best game I've ever played!",

            "review_text": "**Disclaimer: I've been a very big fan of The Witcher games since I played TW1 back in 2012. This review may have a bit of bias towards the game and it's creators**  Having put almost 40 hours into the game now, I feel I can make a review about the game. The Witcher 3 is the third and final chapter in The Witcher saga and it delivers. Picking up about 6 months after the events of The Witcher 2, the kingdoms of the North are in chaos as Nilfgaard's invasion shows no signs of stopping. You play as Geralt of Rivia. A human who had undergone severe magic rituals and mutations to become the perfect killer. As a Monster Hunter you're biggest enemies will be the monsters of this land. Giant insects, elementals, vampires, etc will be other enemies you'll face besides from humans of course.   The starting area of the game is basically one giant sandbox tutorial that allows the player to get a feel for the game and learn how to play through helpful hints and tutorials. Veterans of the series will blow through this area rather quickly but if you're new to the game I'd suggest you explore everything the game laid out of you in detail because most of what you will learn will be useful even in late game.   Combat in this game is brutal. On normal difficulty monsters will hurt hard and won't back down from a fight. Unlike other RPGs, enemies in this game do not scale. They each have their own set level and stats. So that wraith guarding a cemetery might be too high but after a few levels, you'll be ready to take it on. This adds an overhead challenge when exploring. The first zone outside of the starter area does not have a level requirement. You will run into monsters that far exceed and even triple what your level is. This is why it is best you save often while exploring. The village that offers quests for you level might look safe but after going out towards the thick swamp you might come across a few nekkers who will eat you for dessert. Your best friends throughout the game will be your Steel and Silver swords. Steel is reserved for wild life like wolves, bears along with humans and non humans (dwarves, elves, etc). Silver is reserved for the monsters of the world. The game itself has a monster encyclopedia called the beastariy. It contains information on all the monsters you know and what they're weak against. Oils and potions are also necessary for combat. Oils on your sword can give more damage against certain types of creatures while potions provide active effects in combat like healing, damage resistance, etc. However, you can not just spam drink potions. You have a toxicity bar that fills up each time you drink a potion. Filling it up fully will cause you to lose health rapidly until you die. Knowing when to drink a potion and when to save will be the key for battle.   Questing in this game is also incredibley fun. Unlike normal side quests that devolve into kill X and retrieve Y, they turn more into overhead stories that will flesh out into unique stories. An interesting side quest I came across was to retrieve a woman's frying pan. The entire quest took part in a single house on the shoreline and barely took me five minutes but it still felt like an actual quest. CD Projetk RED have excelled in this aspect in making not only a very interesting main story but side quests that feel like an actual story is being told.  The game map is huge. The zone of Velen is massive in space and feels like it's own little world contained inside itself. Villages sprawl across the countryside with a massive city that looms off in the distance that yearns to be explored. Guarded treasures, monster nests, villages that need cleaning of monsters, and more are littered across the countryside all offering loot that can be used or sold depending on your character's level.   Pros:    Beautifully crafted game with an expansive world yearning to be explored    Tactical and engaging combat that will not be afraid to punish you for mistakes    Engaging narrative that doesn't rely on black and white/bad and evil choices. Instead focusing more on choices you think as a player are the right ones.    Dark and gritty world that doesn't shy away from controversial topics like sexism, racism, torture, etc.   Cons:    Gwent card game needs a better tutorial     No dice poker  ",

Once I had reached the part that I reached when I played on Xbox, I wasn't sure what to do (as the main reason I stopped playing on Xbox was the fact that I wasn't sure what to do during a certain part of the game (family matters)) But after some faffing aroud I found out how to continue. The more I played this game, the more attatched I felt to the characters in the game, and by the time I was nearing the end I wasn't even playing for fun but for the insanely good story of Geralt by CD Projekt Red. I honestly think this game has the best story in a video game (that i've ever played at least). I rate this game a solid 9.5/10. The only reason I won't rate this 10/10 is because I don't think ANY game can TRULY be 10/10 and every game has flaws. Get this game even if your not into RPG's (like me).",

Some games, you get choices but it doesn't feel like it changes much of the story. So your choice(s) have zero impact. This gave the game HUGE points to me, I hate when games offer you choices, but really whatever you decide is rendered irrelevant to the story and overall outcome.   The combat, well it's very good but like most RPG's it can get repetitive but combat in RPG's will never be perfect. This could be as good as RPG combat ever gets.  The soundtrack was great as well and the cinematics were really well done. When I first heard 'Priscilla's song,' I was blown away. Such a beautiful song, I forgot that I was playing a game and just sat back and listened. Wonderfully done.  Character development was overall really well done, I actually cared/disliked characters which generally I don't end up doing in most games. Most games are quite 'black and white' with their characters. I like that the developer was not scared at all to let your character go from ♥♥♥ kicker, monster hunter to having emotional connections with his romantic partners.  So overall, this game (in my opinion) definitely is a huge favourite to be considered Game Of The Year. It's possible by 2020 this could be the Game Of The Decade.  Absolutely fantastic. I will be replaying this game, to make different choices and see their effect on the story and possible outcomes.  10/10 ",

I need to make that potion to defeat the dreaded Baggool in Brokeback mountain to get the money to feed my family. how am i supposed to do that if I am dead? Play as the main character, mister man himself as he dies to over 40 different monsters and humans as you didn't make the right potion or a bloody griffon swoops him off his horse and feeds him to her children. with over 20 million different places to explore and a ever changing environment, this game allows the main character to explore the wilderness and be doomed to never find that one stupid flower to beat Baggool. One of the greatest features in this game is the ability to take out loans as it is the only way to make money and feed your family as monsters kill you in less then one hit unless you use a potion. If you are suicide, you may also take contracts to hunt these monsters to get them dollar dollar bills and even extort 50 extra money from an old lady who is dumb and has no many to pay you with in the first place. Now, possible the best experience I had in this game is when I punched a bear and then ran away. I had always wanted to do that in real life but I would probably die. Because of this point, i will give this game a 80/08. It was a good game where a dreaded chicken named Baggool kills a grown man with nice hair in one hit on the pinky toe.",

And they all look the exact same age - from his 'daughter' to Yen, Triss, every single sleeping partner (Steam blocks the name I tried to use), and everyone in between even though all of them should age and are different ages. And seriously? High heeled boots on the women? Ridiculous. I mean, they call Witcher an old man and he looks a lot older. But not the women he's been with forever. I mean, come on.

I almost cried when I realized that the story is over. The story is so good I actually started reading books (already completed 'The Last Wish') which I would never usually do. I highly recommend completing the first 2 games as I think they are essential, they allow you to build up your own Gerald, and it gives you time to get attached to the characters. If you have completed the first 2 games I guarantee that you will go on an emotional trip after the completion of the 3rd game. Although at first I thought the story did not flow very well from the 2nd game to the 3rd after a few hours I was again fully immersed in the Witcher. 10/10 for the story  Combat:  The gameplay overall is a massive improvement on the first 2 games the fights flow very nicely and they feel very cinematic which is very hard to achieve. Furthermore, you have to use different tactics when fighting different monsters you can’t just press one button repeatedly (on easier difficulties maybe). I do however find that it does get repetitive after a while. There are also signs and potions that are infinitely important. I love what CD Project red done with signs, they are no longer repetitive feature of combat, in Witcher 3 they are dynamic and very fun to use, in combat you can decide what is the best way of applying the current sign. The potions however are a bit disappointing now, you can basically just spam them. 9/10 for combat  World:  Just WOW. It is absolutely massive and very very dynamic, the little side quests are always fun to do when you travel from one location to another, the people you meet and new quests you pick up are always interesting, it feels like every location has been worked on for month! The random encounters add adventure to every little bit of the map. 10/10 for world  9.9/10 MUST HAVE  ",

It has quite a few bugs here and there. And the combat can be both repetitive and frustrating at times. Sometimes when you just want to avoid battle you enter automatic battle stand and you are forced to fight. This can be extra annoying if the area you are fighting in isn't flat. Cus the combat can be extremeley clunky if the ground has got multiple levels.  Now don't let these flaws decieve you because this game is a one of a kind experience and I regret NOTHING of playing this.

Because of the size of the world and the large amount of side quests, there are a lot of quests that can have similar types (go to ___ kill ___ return for reward), but because of how well the characters are written, every quest feels like something completely different. You are driven to want to help these people (or not, your choice) and you actually care about the outcome. Your choices actually matter and have real consequences down the road. Some may be immediate and some you may not see until the end of the game. Overall, one of my favorite games in recent memory.

Go cross country and witness an amazing sunset from atop a mound of rotfiend corpses on the way!).  The main story is captivating, in true Witcher form. Oops, pulled another all-nighter.   My only complaints so far are minor stability issues resulting from a mild overclock, and the new alchemy system.   This game is VERY sensitive to GPU stability. My overclock is very mild, no stability issues found during stress testing or other games, but this one finds them.   As far as alchemy goes, I'm not a fan of the 'hotkey' potions that you can instantly slam down while wrist deep in a werewolf's chest cavity, I prefer the strategic preparation required from the first two games. Luckily, mods are already popping up on the nexus to smooth out these minor issues! Can't wait until official mod tools are released, this game is going to stick around.  In my opinion, while not required, play through the first two games and read up on the witcher wiki for backstory and character information. Really immerse yourself in the universe, remember who people are, remember what they did, remember that how you deal with them may have consequences 40 hours later!  ",

I didn't even touch the Gwent stuff either, I hear that can take a long time too. I also didn't try and find all of the optional locations in Skellige but that might have ruined the game for me. You'll see.  It's a phenomonal game. The world is enormous, but also dense. The side quests are compelling in their own right, not just filler to get more XP and pad out the hours. The main story is well done. It meanders through the different regions, and each of the subplots within are pretty well fleshed out. Your actions do have consequences, yet unlike most games, those consequences are not immediately apparent and even after finishing the game, I am not really sure what I did that resulted in some aspects of the ending. And it doesn't even get into the Good/Bad Ending crap, some parts of my ending were very gratifying, others actually made me regret what had happened and want to do it over. So despite having just put ninety hours into the game, I'm feeling ready to start a NG+ and play again on a higher difficulty, with DLC enabled, making different choices, and trying a different build of character. It's definitely one of the best games I've ever played. Can't recommend it enough.",

Secondly, all three games build on each other, however, the third installment is congruent enough with lore and sidequests, to get you what you need to know to enjoy the game and the story, just like you can watch Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and get most of the story, even if you have not watched the previous 2. Even if that is a bad example, you will enjoy this rich, atmostpheric game which is both gritty, deadly and beautiful at the same time. The romances in the game are what you decide to make them and as with most relationships in the real world, can be complicated. If you play one game this year, this needs to be it, without a doubt. Check the rating on the game to see what you are buying, if you do not want to see certain things flash across your screen, in the living room, be aware that could be the case, depending on what choices you make with Yennefer or Triss. I must stress this is not a game for children. The combat system is finally much more enjoyable, albiet a bit more simplistic. This feels much more realistic and sensible as fantasy stories go and you will not be dissapointed. The graphics are top notch and yet will not run badly on most mid to high level rigs. Surprisingly, they have it working fairly well on consoles, particularly the PS4. If you are a fan of the Witcher, you need to set aside some time, stop playing Call of Duty or Destiny and play this game thoroughly. Take your time, enjoy it and it will stay with you, long after you complete the game. 10/10 stars.",

I'm now about 70 hour into this game, done lots of quests, side quests and witcher contracts and every single one has been enjoyable, even the ones i thought were destined to be boring just by their very nature, the horse racing and card quests, turned out to have very good missions attached in some way or another, i have not came across one single boring or tedious mission yet and i find it quite sad that those type of quests are considered normal in our games that i still fully expect to run into these type of quests at some point, because that's just what happens in rpgs.  I really hope other game developers take note of what CD Projekt RED have done here because this game is an absolute masterpiece, yes there is a few niggles, the controls can be a bit iffy at times (on foot and on horse) the combat takes a bit of getting used too but after a short while you begin taking out groups of monsters with ease and style, as long as you have the right equipment and signs.  The game looks great, plays great (minor niggles aside), sounds great, has some of the best characters and story i have seen which is delivered by the best voice acting i have ever heard in a game.  Lets all hope that this right here, these side quests that are not just there for you to grind away with or to pass some time just for the hell of it, that these side quests, ones that feel like they actually matter, they become the norm.

The attention to detail in this game is just huge it can be as simple as you getting trophies from the monsters after u killed them to prove that u killed a formidable beast.GET THIS GAME NOW 10/10 game of the year 2015!! Having played this 2 times now and playing the DLC's it is right now the best game u can find i nthe past 10 years. It's simply the best game out there in the market right now",

And HOLY ♥♥♥♥ this game!!!  First off, every side quest in the game feels like it eventually becomes a major quest as each one has a pretty big backstory. Some of the quests actually made me tear up a bit. All of the characters are interesting and something that was huge for me was that I actually wanted to read my character index and bestiary, which I never do. The voice acting is outstanding and every character you come across feels important.   Combat in the game is....well...arguably bare at times. However, preparing for a big fight is always fun like brewing the right potions and applying oils to your swords. General movement is pretty clunky and a controller is definitlely required, until I found out that if you go into the options and change movement to alternate, it's much snappier.  The game looks absolutely beautiful; sharp textures, pretty environment, insane amount of detail etc.  The game of course isn't perfect. One thing that I found frustrating was your income comes in at a very slow rate when starting out. If you're playing on the highest difficulty, alot of your hard earned money will go into food and other healing wares. This will slowly change over time when you aquire new armor, but the first few hours will be aggrovating.  Final Verdict? 10/10.  This doesn't mean that the game is perfect. IMO there is no such thing as a game that is. But a 10/10 to means that it is worth every single penny you pay for. This game isn't limited to just Witcher fans, this is a game that everyone needs to play and take notes on what a true piece of art this game is.",

In short, you can stop reading here, unless you enjoy rambling nonsense. Just buy it.    The one viewpoint I   can   bring to this game is one of someone who tried and failed to get into the last two games, despite enjoying the lore of the Witcher's world - IT IS SO MUCH BETTER. It takes all the ideas of the other games, the combat, the crafting, the magic, the potions, the loot, and it improves them tenfold, and sticks it all in a GORGEOUS open world with a great story and a great cast of characters, and a ton of stuff to do.  For a start, you have job. Yes. An actual job. It is your job to kill monsters. You take on contracts, you find specialist equipment, you wander from town to town picking up work and monster's heads as trophies. That in itself would be a fun game. But this game is so much more. Sidequests with interesting stories, places of interest with nice loot, fun boss fights, fun combat, good levelling and progression, and a great main storyline for when you get bored of all that... this game is the ultimate open world RPG, and I want there to be a hundred more games like it.  That said, it is not without it's flaws. It is an extremely demanding game, for a start, and even with a Nvidia 970 and 16gb of RAM it doesn't always behave, the fps drops for no reason (on any settings), not a lot, but enough and often enough to drive you mad. Also, it tricks you into thinking you can do Parkour. DO NOT, unless it is really obvious. You will get stuck. And, obviously, not every sidequest is great fun. Some of them fall flat. Also, the loot system is a little bit confusing, it feels complicated and there are a lot of items, but most of them are literally junk, and 90% of the stuff you find is crap compared to the specialist gear you can craft every few levels. It is far from a perfect game. It's more of a flawed masterpiece. But a masterpiece, and really, really fun, nonetheless.  And, of course, Gwent. The BEST minigame within a game that I have ever seen. I bought Playstation DLC special edition packs so that I could pick up some real Gwent cards and play it against real people. They're turning it into a proper game in itself, coming soon on Steam. Gwent is amazing. And if you get bored of it, you can always go off and kill some monsters before continuing to play cards. Did I say minigame? Isn't that thing about Ciri the minigame, actually, now that I think about it? I'm playing The Witcher III: Gwent Card Hunt.  (Witcher 3 for 'Best Game Within a Game' Award! Also, every other award that could apply to it. Even the farm one. It has farm animals in it, although they don't live long when I'm around and feeling hungry...)   P.S. Since I finished this game and both dlcs I have tried to play the Witcher 1 and 2 again, and, honestly, it doesn't matter how much I love the characters and story now, I still don't like playing them. That's proof to anyone who's in the same position as me that the Witcher 3 IS worth your time.",

It has a fantastic story; really good, almost smooth and beautiful graphics compared to the size of the world, I mean the LIVING world!; almost nonexistence loading times in the world; absolutely fantastic music and voices; etc.  Everything is just PERFECT!  Also, all the DLCs are must and adds much more story and interesting content. Just finished Hearts of Stone and WOW, what the sad and bit scary story it was! Now I started with Blood and Wine, and I'm loving the Toussaint, the atmosphere and the world.  There are some things that might have done better, for example combat + movement + keyboard. Also the inventory views (shopkeeper or armorer etc.) aren't the best, it's hard to understand if you have the item or not and you can easily order double items. Then there are some weird graphical glitches and sacks that you can't reach.   I have older i7 with GTX 780 and 16GB and it runs really, really good with high settings. There have been some crashes and lower framerates, but mostly runs beautifully.  It' really sad that Blood and Wine was the last of Wicher, because I really love the saga.

Still, I'd like to share my opinion, and hope it is helpful.  If someone was to ask me what my favorite game this year was (even though there are still six weeks left before 2016, and at least one more game that I am interested in will be released this year), it has to be this one.   This is actually my second review... I deleted the first one, as I just started my second playthrough. I got the game when it first came out, finished it and had a blast, enjoying it tremendously.  I wasn't sure how much replay value this would have, but starting another playthrough, I realize it's almost as much fun as the first time, even though you know the reveals etc. I will make different choices this time, seeing how much things will change when I do.  In a nutshell: - Graphics are beautiful and very atmospheric, and the game is well optimized. I have an i7 4790, 16 gigs of RAM, a GTX 960 with 4 GB RAM. The first time I played this, I still had a GT730, and even with that card, I was able to play the game and it looked nice. With the 960, it's even more beautiful.  - The soundtrack is totally awesome IMO  - Difficulty ofc depends on what you pick, but I thought it was fun, challenging without being unfair. You will need to do some research (in game) on the different kind of monsters, using oils and stuff, and figuring out what you'll be fighting (contracts) is very cool... I love that moment when I know what I am fighting, meditate, go to the haunted spot and hear the monster approach.   - This game has some AMAZING writing. The characters are sometimes quite mysterious, and IMO not as cliche as you see in so many other games. They might be evil, but often have a soft spot, or a reason for their behaviour, or do something unexpected. So many dramatic stories here, and the storyline in general is VERY well-written  - So much stuff to do. Some of it can be a tiny bit grindy, but on my first playthrough, I did pretty much every bit of side-content until I eventually moved ahead and focussed more on the story.  - No glitches, no crashes, only one bugged event (Geralt drew a sword, but it wasnt in his hand, so I didn't do any damage. Happened ONCE)  - The atmosphere... omg, it's hard to explain really. I have no idea why but the world of the Witcher, the setting, the landscapes and towns captivated me right away. There is a quite dark and foreboding vibe to the world... riding through the forests at dusk, with rain coming down and the wind blowing... it's SO well done, so very beautiful. MGS, AK, FO4...none of these games captivated me even half as much. I am not sure whether its the graphics, the design, the music, the writing, or a mix of all that, it just sucked me right in.   - Replayability. I started playing when the game came out, and now, about half a year later, I started another playthrough. And it's FUN. Yes, of course I now know all the big reveals of the main story, but still, it's fun to play it again. Will try a slightly different spec and playstyle this time (because you can eg. focus on swordplay or signs or the other weapons, mix them the way you like. My first build was relying very much on signs, using Igni and mind-controlling enemies).   - DLC... check out the list of FREE DLC that the devs have added. I was blown away when I reinstalled the game and saw quite a list of free DLC. Some of it minor, some adding quests etc. Plus, the first expansion adds SO much to the game, it's amazing, especially considering the price.   - Controls are... a bit wonky. Have a bit of that 'drunk' feeling, a bit too rough and inaccurate. You eventually get used to it, but compared to games like the Arkham Knight or some of the AC games (and these games have control issues as well, mind you!), it felt a bit too...loose.    Pros: - Graphics and optimization - Amount of content - Music and sound - Story and writing (!!!!) - Fights - Very mature topics, things you don't have in games too often  Cons: - Lore and stories might be a bit confusing to newcomers to the franchise - Same for crafting, inventory management, alchemy - Wonky controls, not quite precise enough ",

It really encourages you to learn about the world (where to find certain plants to make into oils, what oils work best against which monsters etc). You rarely see a game that makes you learn the same stuff that the character actually learns.  It all adds up to a world that feels so incredibly alive - victory can be hard fought, but with every victory you really feel like you've done more than button mash/thrown yourself against a wall until you get lucky.   A smart Witcher lives a long time, a smarter Witcher when to run away ;)  An amazing game - pick it up if you like rpgs/engrosing narrative/swordplay/fantasy/sassy main characters   10/10",

The game just feels massive, the combat is challenging but very fun, I find the animations elegant and fluid. The game is incredibly immersive, and tells many great stories.  I must admit I have always had trouble getting into any of the Witcher games and this one wasn't any different. These games have so much to take in, that it can be overwhelming at first. If you feel the same way I'd suggest buying the strategy guide, it really helped me understand everything, and now the game is much more enjoyable for me.  Hope this helps,  Cheers     ",

I've seen many men flood through the gates of hell, I reckon every man or woman has the same story to tell, it wasn't me, I didn't do it, I'm innocent. You could hear the screams just intertwine with each other, a cacophony of nothing but desperation. The new souls are always the worse, they could go on moaning for hundreds of years, until one day they just stop, as to figure out this is their life now, nothing that anyone can do. They become hardened and they start to hunt their brethren. Than there are the lucky ones who accept that they were garbage in their past life, they come to terms with the monster inside of them. These souls ascend to where all souls wish to be, they are free of the pain and free of their past crimes, they have repented and acknowledged their wrong doings. These types of souls are rare, when they first appear you can always tell.  They lived with this guilt for so long, they hated who they were, what they thought of, who they hurt, They were tormented on Earth, vilified and to far-gone to fix. When they pass the gates like all men do, they are asked what they wish for most in the world, and they all mention the same thing. You can interpret it in any language, and it still comes to mean the samething. That's not my place to say, no, I am the watcher, I see all that is the sum of man. I see the hearts and minds of creatures that are capable of love, and also capable of things unspoken. So if you find yourself approaching the gates, ask yourself what type of human you were, and what did you contribute to humanity. May the lost souls seek guidance from the unborn, innocence cannot be bargained, bought or faked. The heart is a gateway to salvation or oblivion.",

Oh, and the people in Toussaint aren't complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They're actually respectful. Only a few have insulted me so far. This feels weird.    The main storyline wasn't the best in the world, as far as a certain entity counted, but it was still better than anything else out, and still to this day is. Hearts of Stone improved on all of the main entity's mistakes, and left us with one of, if not the best antagonists in history.    While I am currently going through B&amp;W, its already shaping up to be another AAA game that CDPR has called 'DLC' once again. Great to see actual expansion packs like this in a world of AAA publishers who don't care about you and charge for everything.    Okay, I have now finished Blood and Wine: Damn, is it fantastic. People actually don't treat you like a freak, for the most part. Its weird at first, but once I got used to it, it is wonderful.   'People, like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.' - Geralt of Rivia (The Last Wish)    Some people fight for glory, justice or gold. I fight for those I hold dear.

The start can be slow and combat might feel infuriating and frustrating, but once you get a grip on it it feels really fun. The world is just massive and unlike some other RPGs I've played it doesn't feel dull, boring or bland at all. All the sidequests have their own little story behind them, they're not just kill and gather type of quests. The graphics (even after the 'downgrade') are just amazing with the weather system being just stunning. The world feels really alive, with soldiers and bandits patrolling the roads, deer and wolves roaming the forest, the cities are like an ecosystem of their own and the dangerous monsters lurking in the caves and dungeons. It's the first RPG where I just could immerse myself in to. I played 7 hours on almost at one session. It even has it's own collectible card game, and it's not even a small one.  My pros: - Good graphics, weather system must have a note of its own - Combat is fun and challenging (I play on the highest difficulty) - Huge open world - Story is good, there's been a good few surprises - The card game, Gwent - Very immersive, it really feels like you are an witcher - Top-notch quality voice acting - Best bang for your buck. Since 5/28 I've played 67 hours and feel like I've done just half of what the game has to offer   Neutral about:  - Gwent, it feels too luck based - Game performance. I feel like I should better performance with OC'd 970 and OC'd i7 4790k 4.5ghz + 16gb ram.  - For some, slightly including me, the combat even on the highest difficulty might feel just a little too easy. I might just be really good at the game, don't know. - The game has so much content it might feel overwhelming for some. This is a huge bonus for me though  My cons: - Somewhat clunky controls (using controller, prefer it over kb + m) - Occasional bugs, few crashes - Some very muddy textures  My tips for new players:  ( Might contain really light spoilers. Not story related )  - Play on highest difficulty. It is really challenging, and killing boss monsters feel really rewarding - Don't start playing gwent too late - Invest in alchemy - Try to keep all the ingredients, trust me, you'll want them later on - Learn about strong monsters before encountering them - Learn to dodge, try not to roll too much - Loot pretty much everything.

The choices that you make in the game change the game in such unexpected ways. little things passing a guard in distress and helping them will much later have that person coming to help you get into a city. there is no clear right and wrong , it makes you thing about what choice would be best and then it ends up have negative effects.  the combat system is a much more refined version of the second game and is complex and truly fun it makes you make use of the enviorment and tons of potions and different buffs to craft many unique builds and play styles.  the graphics while not as good as the 2013 E3 trailer still looks like the pics on the steam page and it looks absulotly amazing, i found my self many times stoping it the middle of nowhere to enjoy the view.",

I will apply no spoilers - But if you are a person who thrives on an ever-changing story, one where your decisions ACTUALLY alter future and current events, you needn't look further. There are an untold amount of side quests, witcher contracts (which you can haggle for higher prices, if you can complete them), treasure hunts for both money and witcher set gear, and of course - Places of Power to find!  Geralts beard grows as time passes... How is that not F**kin awsome?!  DLC Content is released weekly, and it is free. There is no EA garbage microtransactions. And to those that say, WELL THERES A SEASON PASS! - That is for Expansion pack DLC which will provide over 30+ hours of gameplay content... Remember the old days when you bought an expansion and actually got your money worth? Well, welcome to the return of those foreign times!  The voice acting, scripts, and interactions are very on point. I haven't noticed any missed beats. Geralt is as nice or as badass as you let him be. There are some good comedy points as well, but you'll have to find those for yourself.  Combat is probably the most fluid system I have played in a game. Each movement feels real, and you can swap targets, dart/dive, mix in signs - all without ever missing a beat.  Graphically this game is very well optimized. I am by no means running a garbage machine (see specs at end of review) but it is not a top notch beast in the gaming world. I have the game set to near max graphics, and I run a constant 60+ FPS even in large scale monster battles or deserter brawls. If you can see it in the world, you can get there in the game. If you can't, it's because you reached the 'edge' of the map... I won't tell you what happens if you stray too far into the night ;-)  Character progression is amazing. I have about 40 hours on record, only hit about level 12. It does take some time, but I spend a load of time exploring and seeking the hidden treasures of this wonderful world. And yes, you are definitely rewarded for it. Anyhow, the skill system is well designed, and allows you to bend Geralt to your will - Want to be more of a mage, or perhaps a pure fighter? Maybe you just love those alchemical brews that give you ungodly powers. Maybe you want it all! You can (to an extent) - the choice is completely yours.  Difficulty... I have to say, even on normal the game provides a very nice challenge. I find the monsters just difficult enough that I am not wiping the floor with them, yet not too difficult where I have to restart every 2 minutes because said wyvern ripped my head off. The nice thing; The game warns you if said monster/quest is a bit too difficult - but it doesn't stop you from engaging haha  Don't be afeared to spend your money here - 'less you afeared the night boy, then wander elsewhere.

The story has been the obvious main focus, because almost every side quest has its own cut screen and dialog options, its quite ridiculous as to how much game play they have put into it. I have only two complaints. The major one is the repetitiveness of the combat, its basically a mash the fast attack button or the strong attack, not really any variation. The other complaint is that in between the dialog, if you chose some of the non-main dialog options, to obtain some information, then choose the main dialog option, the transition doesn't seem genuine. it just sounds like it was recorded separately, and some times breaks the immersion. all in all, if your PC can run this game, it is a definite buy no doubts about it. its pretty much a mix of The Last of Us, and Skyrim. what more can you ask for? 9/10",

Still dozens of quests in my book and none of them a really boring. Very little is repeated and the side quests have stories that some games could only wish to have as their main storyline. Always history to each thing you do, and the consequences become quite clear as you go through the life of Geralt. It is impossible to put in this review exactly how much content is stuffed into this game but it is well worth its buying price and more. First time in a long time where a game was made to be long without dlc pieces hacked off and fed to you later. Many game developers should take note, this is a worthy game.  The combat is fun and fluid. Even more variety than there ever has been before in how you want to build your skills. You can mix and match things from all the trees far more effectively than witcher 2 where if you did that you were gimping yourself incredibly. Mix of sword and signs and you've got yourself a deadly battle caster burning enemies and cutting them to ribbons as they flail around on fire. Go down the alchemy route and stick a few points in signs and you can make some brutal combo's with your explosives.  The story is great. It grips you from the beginning begging you to look deeper and find more hidden gems. You feel your choices have weight and what you decide may not turn out as you had planned. Save a being from a trap thinking you are doing a good deed only to find that it destroys an entire town due to your lack of foresight. Hindsight is painful in this game. Only because many a time it seems the right choice, the good choice, and then people die because of it. You must always weigh each decision carefully. I'd suggest playing the game through without going back on your choices. Live with them and see what happens. Then try again on a different game, see where all the paths lead you but stay on the one you chose.  Graphics though not what they were shown before are still damn good. Hell most people would never see the graphics that were shown anyway without several grand to toss down for a computer. So I'm fine with it being a little less shiny to allow a greater audience to play the game. Its a game worth playing and even dumbed down a little the detail is amazing. Save for my beard disappearing if I am slightly too zoomed out but just a minor pet peeve at best.  All in all its the best of the series. The open world has given it a lot of life though I will admit its a bit jarring to go from place to place then get beaten to death cause you walked into some level 30 monsters lair and you were only level 10. Usually best to do all the sidequests before checking out the treasures. A game that will be remembered for a long time as being one of the most well done RPG for a long, long time.",

The world is massive and the graphics complement it greatly, save for the red filter. Honestly though, the graphics are not something to scoff at. I would say it's on the level of, if not greater than, a fully modded Skyrim. As Kosmozuikis, in his review, said some things could use some work, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience at all.  The combat system feels nice, never really experienced something similar to it before -- whether that's due to having gone into a DoTA coma or some other factor I'll never know. I personally find myself going towards a certain style over the others, mainly, 'Screw blocking, everything must die!' In another run I'll probably focus more on a more defensive or counter heavy style, because I feel like I'm missing out on a lot just relying on a single sign, essentially spells, for defense.   The story is phenomenal. I have not played the prior two installments, nor have I read the books, but so far I'm captivated by the way the story is progressing. I'm not even sure if I'm halfway through the game yet, but it keeps getting better and better. More than likely I'll end up reading the books due to my thirst for knowing more about the lore of the world. Sound-wise I've found myself getting scared, I'm a major wuss, when the music gets darker and I'm in the middle of a cavern or out doing a contract. The atmosphere in general is just amazing, especially when you go to any of the cities.  I have yet to play Gwent yet, mainly because of my want to explore everything. For example, 'Ohhh, treasure... OH LOOK A BASILISK...' And then subsequently realizing that it has question marks for a level and then bolting faster than Usain Bolt.

I'm about 50 hours in, and i'm no where near done with my first play through of the game, and already planning my New Game + playthrough.  To be quite honest, i never got into the Witcher series, i picked up Witcher 2 on a sale, and maybe have a total of 3-4 hours in that game. So i was skeptical when a friend recommended the third installment. I'm glad that i got this when it first released because the developer deserves every penny of that initial purchase price.   The world feels alive, there's nothing better than galloping down a dirt road, and the wind picks up, and you see the trees start buckling under the strong gale. It feels lived in, and not just like a playground for the player, i feel like i dropped into a world that actually exists.   It feels real, not everyone is happy to see the hero, some people try to actively hurt you for disregarding their customs, or just because of their fear of Witchers.

            "review_text": "After many Hours with this game, and close to my first finished Playthrough, i decided to write this.   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a very special game of sorts. Let me first Talk about the Cons!  Cons - Controls  Many times into the story you just wanna grab your mouse and smash it into a wall. 'No Roach start to Gallop now, no Geralt i want you the get OUT THE WATER' UGGGH!... Its the biggest con for me so far, and maybe its just because i don't like to play with a controller.   -Narration bugs I don't really know if this is a Bug, Or for some strange reason done that way (if this is what you wanted.... please fire the Game Designer... he deserves it). Whenever you fast travel from one 'country' to another (from Skellige to White Orchard for example) Dandelion will explain you the story, over and over again. and you cannot skip this, its a Loading Screen, and Dandelion going 'now that Geralt knew where to go...'. It would be okay, if he would be up to date. but until the last portion of the Game he always tells you, the story of this specific area of the world... even though you already finished everything in that area.   Another big sad Part is for me...     Even After the Bloody Baron killed himself (he did so in my Story line) he keeps being Mentioned as the Current owner of Uma, only in the Quest text itself is speaks of his Sergeant who took his place     -Fighting  This here is only counting for the combat with your fists. its dull, its stupid, and its absolutely no fun to be killed by 6 people packing up on you and you have to beat them with your fists. This also counts for Geralts buggy swords. Sometimes the game thinks combat is over, and he sheathes his sword, the next moment you try to slap a Water Hag with your fists, get repelled and take a great amount of damage, cause the game decided to sheathe your weapon.   -Many other tiny little Problems I just make a short list, and people who wanna know more should read up on it. Game was designed with controllers in mind. Sadly this also means, the Menu screens are bugged beyond repair sometimes. You hit ESC to get out of the menu, but it keep selecting a Item, his ESC again, it goes to a item again. UUUGH! get your Menu's right! You are far too many times in your Inventory. Your Carry Capacity is way too low, after a while by just collecting alchemy supplies, and Crafting goods, i had 80/90 packed, but nothing i wanted to craft. And there is no stache or something. Your Weapons are ♥♥♥♥. Fight 10 Drowners and its down to 70% durability. where it starts to rapidly lose damage. Weapons break far too easily. Applying Oil to your weapons should be in the 'TAB' Menu and not be managed over the Inventory screen (basically always going into your Inventory and breaking from the fight)  So this is my List of Con's other peoplementon Graphical Problems and all... i must say.... 'horse ♥♥♥♥♥' the game looks decent. And there are enough ways to tweak it nicely (sweetFX configs and so on).   PRO's  -Combat The Combat in the Witcher always was quite real, you have to be careful of a beasts swipes and have to dodge or parry attacks, cant just slap into enemy's until you win (unless you play the lowest difficulty) You have to know what enemy you are facing, its weaknesses and how to beat it. Have to use oils, sigils, bombs even, in order to get some of the more fierce monsters to bite the dust. But don't Worry the Beastiary is your best friend.   -Sigils You are no wizard. But you have Sigils, and Axii is probably your best friend of them all. don't underestimate the use of them. They help you. a lot!   -Alchemy You make a Potion once, and every time you meditate you refill them as long as you have Alcohest. Sound's broken? It's not. It is absolutely okay i think. You run around, gather ingredients to make Potions like Swallow or Cat, and when you need em you just use them, but don't overdue it, if you drink too much, you will die.  -The Story While flawed at some points, its a lot of fun to play through the Story and to see how HUGE this game is, and how deeply most things... weave into one another.   -The Talk You do not understand English? I am deeply sorry for you. This game is awesome when it comes to language, should totally play it English with Subtitles in your language.   -The Witcher I always loved how... 'hated' Witcher's are. It is to me one of the biggest hight's the Story has to offer. People will beg you to help them with killing a beast, you Agree, for Pay, and they call you a heartless greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The world damn well knows how to work in the fact, honest pay for honest work. Even when the peasants keep crying about you beeing greedy and ♥♥♥♥.   Thing that would have made the Game better for me: -Stealth Geralt is not exactly stealthy. sadly. And that's what i am looking for usually, a more stealthy approach to things. Maybe an option 'lets wait until the beast falls asleep' or something like that.    So do i recommend this game?  Yes and No. I only Recommend it to people who are willing to dive into a huge Game, that will force you to read a LOT, force you to do a lot of sightseeing, and force you to stop on your Story Quest to do some random ♥♥♥ thing, which helps in the end to improve your character and overall bond with the Game's world.   My Recommended Setting for Difficulty:  - Just here for the Story - If you wanna have a very easy game, no need to worry about anything. No Potions are needed, no Oils, no Brain. This setting really is just for people who wanna hop from one Story point to the Other.  - Story and Sword - Here you will need some Brain, you need Potions, you need some Knowledge on how things work. Its i think the Perfect setting for Witcher Newbies and for the first playthrough  - Blood and Bones You need everything i have mentioned before and then some, Enemys do significantly more damage, have more health and you NEED to know how to beat every Enemy. Perfect Setting for Veterans and for People who really seek a challenge  - Death March Almost everything will oneshot you. Geralt is almost 100 Years old. And here we notice how fragile it must be, be Witcher or not. You have to plan your every move, you have to chose the fights carefully, it feels very realistic, Only chose this on your second or third Playthrough, so you know what kind of things will await you.

            "review_text": "First of all sorry for my bad english. When i finished Witcher 3 first time i thought i will never feel again in any game what i felt, and i have to delete my memory and play this ART again. Yes its not simply a game, its a masterpiece artwork. I remember my first video game at my childhood. We played with some atari device had a ball and needed to hit back to other side, and not let it out at our side. This was before the commodore computers. So you can imagine how long i playing games. Why i say this? Becouse Wicher 3 is the BEST game i ever played in my life. Everybody tell here what the game offer, i dont want to repeat, so better if i try to tell my feelings with this game. So i started 2nd time the walkthrough (now with dlcs), and i tell you a secret, this walkthrough wont be the last. I have better computer now, so i can play it at very high settings, not the low-med as first time(the visuals was amazing with that settings too). Now when i playing sometimes i realize that i just sitting on my horse at top of the hill in Skelige and i watching the small river , and hearing what the naked women who are sitting in the water and speaks becouse they have tons of free time... Another time i just standing at early morning in a dock and listening / watching a working man who use saw for woods and saying how hard his work is... I told you i will say the feels, but honestly i cannot. This is an open world game and i love to live in and help people, getting more money, crafting equipment at smith etc... Oh those amazing looking gears....you wont see in any game this kind of quality looks like here in Witcher 3. I want so says some word about 'Open World'. I played many AAA games, the biggest ones and i never liked the repeated / randomly created dungeons/guardposts/etc etc... In witcher 3 you will feel the Next generation Open world...There is no repeatable places, dungeons, crypts. This is the first Open world game i really enjoy in every aspect. I want to say some word about the 'minigame' Gwent / Gwynt. I played the Other(you know which) card collecting game in 2 years now, and i just finished when i get better and better in gwent. This Gwent simply a much better game for me....and this is only a 'minigame' in witcher 3... I think that says a lot.  I'm a guy like you guys, always watching sales in Steam, buying rarely some cheap 'good review' game, but many time i regret it later. I dont buy/play many game in a year and usually cheaper ones(you see it in my library) and i tell you becouse i bought Witcher 3 and the expansions 2 times...Digitally in Steam, and the box versions becouse of Gwents. I never bought same game 2 times (my wife still don't know this :P ).  If you reading reviews becouse you want a good RPG game and you still hesitate i tell you man stop it...Witcher 3 is the BEST rpg you will play in 2016. The first walkthrough was 160 hour for me(only the main game, didnt have the expansions) and i still had some secondary quest what not finished...So the game is easily go to 150-200hour + Expansions another 50-100 hour... You won't regret believe me.",

At first my plan was to just play the main storyline, but I got so immersed into the game that before I knew it I completed all the sidequests without any regrets. The Witcher 3 is definitely my game of the year 2015 and might just top my list of best games of all time!   So yeah... the story:  Since The Witcher 2, Gerald has regained his memory. This allowed him to search for Yennefer so they can both search for their lost adopted daughter Ciri. Ciri namely has The Elder Blood running through her veins. This Elder Blood can be used to summon one the most powerful magical spells which opens a gateway between dimensions which will lead to the destruction of worlds. So with Ciri on the run from these demons called The Wild Hunt, Gerald sets out to find Ciri and help her defeat these enemies. On the search Geralds meets many new and old friends, which together play a part in the amazing adventure that is The Witcher 3!    The best things of The Witcher 3:   -The writing is the strongest point of the game. The main storyline is amazing and has a some of the most epic gaming moments in gaming history. There is a lot of attention to detail in the cinematics which makes the story much more immersive. There is also a lot of great humor in the game which everybody should love. The best thing of The Witcher 3 is that every quest, even the smallest of sidequests have an interesting story. Ofcourse many of the sidequest end with you just killing a monster, but the writers wrote a storyline around it which makes it interesting almost every time. So you are constantly helping people for a reason instead of just helping people with gathering items.  -The game the beautiful graphics to date in an RPG, especially the lighting and amount of detail everywhere. This resulted in an enormous amount of screenshots for me every time I played the game.  -The game has one of the best sword battle systems from any game I've played. Especially because the higher you set the difficulty, the more immersed you will have to be in the game to stay alive. Instead of simply slaying monsters on easy, higher difficulties require you to prepare for battles, brew potions, pick the right bombs etc. At the start of the game this preparation might seem daunting, reading through a lot of lore to find out what to use to kill each monster. But after a while you know exactly which monsters require which strategies which makes killing them a lot more fun. This battle system adds a lot of variation to the gameplay which immersed me into the game even more because it forces you learn about the lore and the world as you go.  -GWENT!!!!!!! -&gt; Doesn't need explanations.  -That Bloody Baron questline, mannn &lt;3    The somewhat lesser great things of The Witcher 3:  - The main story line kinda goes into the background when you start doing sidequests, especially at the first 50 hours of the game when you are just exploring the world. This way the 'search for Ciri' could lead into Gerald just doing his thing for weeks and then deciding to go search his daughter again. On the other side, I don't really see how this could be improved other than reducing the amount of sidequests. - Some parts of the story feel rushed (The End), while other feel fleshed out (The Search for Ciri). The Search for Ciri is however filled with amazing main story questlines, so you won't feel bored. Its just that the overall story basically is on hold until you finally find Ciri after following leads for many many hours (of amazing other adventures).   Personally I think this is the best RPG currently on the marked and thus I really really recommend this game to anybody who likes open world games and has the will to dive into a deep, complex and epic story!  I also really recommend you buying the Hears of Stone DLC, which is an amazing addition to the main game!",

First of I’ll go by mentioning what I didn’t like: - The Witcher 3 suffers from the same issue most open RPGs do, it has a major plot that drags - is this a bad thing? not really, but it’s ironic that when the whole world is at stake Geralt can still prance around, I’d like to see some risk/reward system that makes the game harder if the protagonist takes their time to finish or continue certain aspects of the game. - I didn’t like how the game ended, after beating and getting one of the many ending the game boasts about you’re sent back to the world where everything has reverted back to what was before the final phase actually began, this just seemed lazy. - Maps are too condensed, walk 50m to the right and you get an event, I’d like a more dynamic system where bandit camps may move around certain locations  I have to admit that emotion gets the better of me after seeing the level of detail and care CDPR took, they built a truly amazing world from the books, Novigrad and Oxenfurt are some of the best and most believable medieval cities in any format ever.  The characters are amazing, CDPR had already proven with the Witcher 2 that they know how to bring book characters to the interactive format, they proved it again with The Wicther 3. Even though some of the best characters aren’t even from the books, but I’ll leave that to you to find on your own ;)",

            "review_text": "I'm going to touch on some things that some reviews don't bother to mention about the game. Mainly the environment, sounds, and performance.  The environment. It is probably one of the nicest environments I've played since Metro Last Light. Now while it may be more like Skyrim in its nature, it has the immersion of the Metro, which is the most immersive game I've experienced. Everything you do is compounded by the environment, fighting is largely influenced by it as well. Oh, you got backed into a corner and still got 3 enemies left and a sliver of health. Maybe you shouldn't have approached the pier and came from ect direction instead. Its small things like this that really get me going, it adds replayability and strategy on how to go about dispatching enemies. Much of the game is already akin to strategy, you cannot just spam attack, you have to be tactical about it. If a sword alone isn't doing it, then maybe set up Yrden as a trap or back off and use some bombs. I'm really waiting for a mod that makes a penalty out of dying.  Then comes the sound and ambient graphics. Its a pretty game, no doubt about it. It shows in the cutscenes and it shows as your riding your house around the block. At times it may feel lack luster, but thats only once you get used to the beauty of it. After all a sunny day can only be interesting so many times. The sound helps kick things back into immersion though. I would definitely recommend playing this game full volume with headphones in a dark room. The sound of the wolves growling or the wind rushing by as your speed on your house are really great and it is this small things that come together to make it a master piece.  Unfortunately there is a lot of bad news surrounding this game with Nvidia Gameworks and the like as well as poor performance. I myself using two 780s in SLI cannot achieve a solid 60 fps on full settings at 1080p. Dips as low as 30fps in some scenarios. This is just one of those games that you cannot play on full settings. As nice as Hairworks is I would recommend turning it off and setting the game to high or medium, even if you have an enthusiast level graphics card. Because this game is very vulnerable to choppy motion as a result of going from 30fps to 60fps three times in 6 seconds depending on the direction you are looking.",

However, I still had not even finished all of the question marks (?) on the map, hinting that I had only completed maybe half the game?   The Witcher 3 story I felt competed with amazing storytellers such as Ken Levine with Bioshock and the incredible focus on the 'small things' as shown in the Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The game is what can only be described as an emotional rollercoaster of fear, happiness, worry but excitement! Every side-quest has it's own unique storyline, giving the feeling that one person was designed through the entire production process to make that side-quest memorable and engaging.  With this being the end of the Geralt Triology, I wasn't saddened, as with the end of one story, another begins.  Bioshock was my favourite game of all time, but I am confident that this game passed the greatness of the Bioshock triology (Thus far) and if Fallout 4 is to be released this year as another one of my favourites, it will have to do it's damn hardest. :)",

I cried at the end, as if I was emotionally attached to the storyline and it was my child.   What I liked the most:  - Making real decisions quickly and accepting the concequences of those dicisions. - Facing off with massive beasts and trying to figure how the hell you beat them. - if you get bored of the quest side, just roam, plent to see and do.  The ability to explore was the one thing that lured me in. Though, in saying that there are certain things that did irratate me from time to time. These were:  - the clunky movement of Geralt, especially near small bridges, ledges and things that require precise movement. - about 5% of the missions were glitched and I was not able to finish them. (I expect this to be corrected in the future naturally)  - The explore tactics applied to the vast ocean areas was quite dull. (Placing smugglers drops everywhere doesnt make it interesting) - The go fetch this and give it to that person, or go kill this person and report back can get dull after a while. Hence, why they suggest go to explore a bit inbetween.   ...160 hours, around the same amount of time to finish a subject at most universitys.

The graphics are stunning! but its 2015, why would they not be?  $30 well spent! and this game went far and beyond my expectations.

The storytelling on its own is some of the best in the genre creating meaningful relationships with curious friends, lovely heroines, and bitter enemies. The Slavic lore from which the universe is themed has captivated me and kept me engrossed in the game. Turning up the difficulty forces the player to use the tools at the Witchers disposal further engrossing me in the fairly simple combat style. In the gameplay the items, spells, and systems reward the player for their proper utilization against specific monsters and situations. These details are coupled with the numerous small additions added over the course of the year by CD Projekt Red, completely free of charge. (Free DLC? In 2015? Absurd!) Not to mention the paid DLC, Heart of Stone, was one the best written stories in a fantasy title ive encountered in the medium.

I will be lucky if I finish it before hour 200, and I'm already looking forward to my next playthrough...)  What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? I'd agree with most everything everyone has been stating. I thought it was all hyperbole, but thankfully, I was wrong. Rather than rehash what has been stated time and again, I will simply point out that I have tried to find fault with this game, and I've only found a single one that sorta sticks out--and that's not even really fair:  I can't play as a Pure Mage. I can't play as a Sneaky Thief. Often, when I play an RPG, I prefer to avoid direct Melee (e.g., via Stealth, Artillery Fire via Spells, &amp;c.), and this is not really possible in the Witcher 3. It's not really fair to hold this against it, as in this RPG I play as a Badass Witcher named Geralt--not a character of my own Design. It kind of reminds me of playing as Commander Shepard (although there seemed to be more flexibility in how I could play my Shepard), which isn't a bad thing at all. And in many ways, this more focused narrative direction--whilst somewhat more restrictive in character direction/growth--leads to more meaningful plot and character arcs than games that are more open-ended lend themselves to. And the interwoven 'side' missions (that are anything BUT irrelevant fetch-quests and other RPG standards) are always making me want to talk to that next person, or pursue that next quest... I think the only things more beautiful in this game than the writing are the gorgeous sunsets. I have screenshot wallpapers for years...  I think it worth noting that this is really my only gripe, and that's a pretty huge compliment itself. Keeping in mind my preference for avoiding melee (whilst being forced into it regularly as Geralt), the fact that this has quickly become one of my favorite games in years (ever?) only reinforces how incredibly mind-blowingly amazing this game is.  I've read some criticisms re: the Witcher's combat. FWIW, this is one of my first 3 games as a 2K16 PC Master Race n00b (longtime Sony fanboy who is Hardcore about his Casual playstyle ;-), and I'm enjoying Normal difficulty (and that kb+m is still taking some time getting fully used to for me). I'm finding it no more or less clunky than any other game I'm playing on my new gaming PC.  So, in case I didn't make it clear, I absolutely LOVE this game. I don't know that it's 'The Best Game EVAR(TM)', but I wouldn't argue with those who do. It's certainly up there--no question. Most importantly, it's engaging, impossible to not get lost in for countless hours (game of Gwent, anyone?), and as beautiful as it is unique in its handling of the High Fantasy genre. I would recommend this to gamers who don't like RPG's or Fantasy. If you don't hate RPG's or Fantasy, why haven't you played this game yet?  Did I mention how breathtaking the sunsets are?",

It is a must in my opinion to read all the books but the first one will give you enough knoweldge to understand the various encounters and experiences of the witcher 3.

And I've probably spent several of my gameplay hours just messing around playing the mini game Gwent!  Theres been some controversy about the graphics, but playing this on an R9 280x (R9 290 was the recommended I believe) this game is still one of the best looking games I've played, especially when considering the scope of the game world (the city of Novigrad alone is huge and I haven't been to the Skellige islands yet which I'm told are another big area!)   Cons The story is interesting, long and full of many characters (31 hours and only level 13 remember!) so even having played the Witcher 2 I was a little bit lost at the beginning. If you are new to this game look up some info about the backstory and the lore before playing as you will ease into the game more!   There is still a little bit of a learning curve at the beginning with the various aspects of gameplay - combat, potions, signs, inventory, bestiary, crafting, alchemy .etc etc. BUT having played over 30 hours later in the game I can say this is appreciated as it adds interest and variety to the gameplay.  Overall I would say this game feels like a triple A game that the developers actually put the time and effort into, making one of the best games I've played in a very long time.",

You must have good timing on when to counter and dodge. Many different ways to build your character, from the signs of magic he uses to how many potions he can drink without killing over. Can also choose between the set of armor and the hair style that best fits your witcher.  This is the game that other game companies need to look at. Good story, Combat, Minimal bugs, and a world full of things to go do. Game took me a good 100+ hours(most of my game time was offline which steam doesnt want to show) to beat on the Death March difficulty and all my time playing was very enjoyable.

            "review_text": "TLDR: - Stop thinking, and buy this atoundingly good game.  Long Version: Like many newcomers to this series, I played The Witcher 3 before I read any of the books, or played the first two games. I was intrigued by the colorful, varied, and lively Witcher Universe. I greatly desired to play the first two games, though I was unable to, as I just had an Xbox One (I know). On the Xbox, it was still a fantastic game, really only let down by the graphics (or lack thereof), and the horrendous load times that exceeded two minutes for not just the initial load, but all subsequent loads, including those during fast travel and after dying. I didn't know about the novels that inspired this incredible series yet, so when I built my very own PC, I immedeately bought the Witcher Trilogy on steam during the Summer Sale. I expected the first two games to be a drag, the first one more so than the second, and I only wanted to play them for the background for the third, but much to my surprise I was wrong. Due to my faulty expectations, I skipped the vast majority of side quests for the first two chapters, and upon learning of the novels, I decided that I would read the books, then start the trilogy over. Boy am I glad I did, the books were a phenomenal read, some of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. This is coming from someone who thought the joy in reading died with his youth, someone who hasn't done a lick of reading outside of assigned works for years, since early middle school. The books gave me an immense understanding of the Witcher's world, I knew about monsters before I had seen them, I trembled at the thought of fighting a Griffin, or a Higher Vampire (though the fight was disappointing to say the least). I knew the characters before I saw them, had my own feelings for them, knew how Geralt felt about them, about his past trysts, affairs, and the like. I knew who had used him, abused him, and who had been used by him. I felt unequivocal hatred towards certain characters, a platonic love towards others. Needless to say, I am extremely happy I read the books. I knew things about characters that changed my actions, things that, had I not known them, the game would've ended very differently. The books supplement the games, and vice versa. Each one a masterpiece in its own regard, but together, unparalleled in scope and depth. I can't recommend reading the books enough, If you enjoy the games, you are sure to enjoy the books, even if you don't normally like reading (like me). Buy the games, buy the books, and enjoy what is quite simply, the best narrative I have ever heard.",

The combat is great, though the actual controls for navigation are sometimes a bit wonky (when indoors/tight spaces or when on horseback through the wilderness instead of the road for instance).  The quests are the best thing about this game. Every little thing you have to do is in one way or another unique. Sure, the 'track these footsteps + scent to a person/monster's location' grows a bit dull after the 30th time. And it is amazing how many people hit trees or fences and subsequently lose somesort of fabric for you to find and easily trace the culprit :P  I'm actually sorry to have bought this game on sale.

I have just recently played through the two major expansions - 'Heart of Stone' and 'Blood and Wine' - and editited this review to reflect this.  The game is epic and the story and world keep you captivated throughout. This is by far the best open world and story telling rpg experience there is. Forget Skyrim or the Fallout games (including Fallout 4 and it's expansions). This is the new standard all future games in this genre will have to measure up against.  The huge world never feels empty, but rather alive and lived in, and just exploring this war torn world provides an imense satisfaction. The quests are interesting and diverse, and full of choices, and even small encounters provide you with snippets of lore or small side stories. There are few really good or bad people, and even the heroes have their edges and dark sides. If you have read the books and/or played the previous games you will feel right at home (and if you haven't and come to like the game: read them, too), with many favourite characters returning to make their appearances.  Plan for a lot of time to sink into this one. My first playthrough (just finished) took me 200+ hours (base game only) covering many but far from all sidequests (I left out many treasure hunts, ignoring them almost completely once I had my feline witcher gear in order, as well as missing a few quests that were simply not available after certain points in the story). Little of this was due to the difficulty, but rather because of the sheer amount of things to do, the long and well told story, the well laid out world design and the pure fun of exploration! With the two expansions I added easily another 100 hours on top of that (still on the first playthrough!). 'Hearts of Stone' expands the existing maps with more terrain and additional content all over, while 'Blood and Wine' adds a new huge map with even more content.  Also, almost no technical issues out of the box - and it has been improved all over during the last year. The game plays well on average hardware and looks stunning even on my notebook (with a GTX870M). Kudos for that, we've seen so many big dissapontments in this regard over the last few years, that this is actually worth mentioning. Not to forget the free DLC released for the game - and paid DLC that is actually woth the money and offers more content each than some full games.  Regarding the expansions: Without wanting to spoil their story let it be said that these are the best expansions I have yet seen for any game. The Fallout series had some nice DLCs over the years, but they pale in comparison to these - storywise as well as in the amount of content they add. As the main game they have their sad and hilarious moments, offer a great story each and are well worth the money and time.  If you like immersive open world rpgs with real time combat and the very best story telling in the genre, this is the game to go for. There were other great games in 2015 (e.g. Fallout 4 which I also loved and played), but even in 2016 nothing equals this game in scope, quality and pure fun!",

I still find myself coming back each week and playing a little bit more of this game.   I would strongly recommend getting the Season Pass for this game, the DLC packs alone are beyond-better than some of the AAA games that have come out this year.  All the voice overs are believeable and authentic, although an occasional background towns person may sound a bit cheesy. But that still adds to the charm of the world.  The combat has been majorly redefined since Witcher 2; I wouldn't say it is easier but it is certainly more intuitive. The animations are excellent and all the cutscenes are rendered in real time.  The game also runs brilliantly, with plenty of graphic options that I think will future proof it for a long time. ",

(Would totally recommend you read the books too btw). With The Witcher 3, CDPR simply makes other games look half finished and sub par.  The combat is great, and animations are bloody. The skill sytem is improved and allows you to build your character in a certain way rather than being a god at everything by late game. A sign/fast attack build, which I went with, was pretty fun. There is something satisfying in burning witch hunters alive with a stream of Igni. The mutations introduced in the Blood and Wine expansion were great options to enhance your character further.   My only gripes: - Cant pause the (sometimes long) cutscenes without alt tabbing or a mod.  -  The inventory system has been simplified since witcher 2, harder to find certain things. Eg, withcer 2 had a tab just for bombs, but bombs here are stored along with others in a more generic 'usable items'.   FIXED WITH PATCH!! - They shafted all the people who played an Iorveth/Saskia playthrough in witcher 2. :\\  One of the best things however in that a lot of secondary quests have very interesting stories, and they are not simply fetch quests but often tell their own complex tale.  Pick carefully in your dialoge choices, as this can really alter how you expeience the game. (A great touch of story personalisation). I want to play this game again in order to experience the different endings and consequences - And thats the thing, choices arent black and white good/evil.  'There are no lesser evils.'  I played the expansions and omg they were cool - so much good content. I ABSOLUTELY URGE YOU TO PLAY THIS GAME!",

Gwent   Romance   Characters   Impressive open world, you can make 200 hours easily on the first playthrough.(if you want to complete almost 100%)   Amazing Soundtrack, which make story even more addictive   .....   Bad :    Points of interests (questions) are silly and i think the only use for them is to fill the map.   Story of the second dlc, is not so awesome, but this is a minor point.   Combat is easy in main game, even on death march.  Hints: PLay witcher 1 and 2 before this one, because you will be confuse, and will say on forums how shityy is this game. ( i saw many complains because of story, is poor, but they never tried to understand more) This game is the last one , so, make a good playthrough.  For fans who played witcher 1 and 2: this is a great improvement, combat is better, gwent is more fun than dice poker, and more romance options.  (i made in past another review, but i deleted it since i wanted to write more serious one)  ",

CD Projeckt Red cares about its customers and even more about its game. The pride they took in crafting TW3 can been seen in every line of dialogue and every shining link in Geralts chainmail. The DLC amounts to the sort of oldschool expansions that many believed lost: expansions as games in their own right well worth the money you trade for memorable experiences. With EA and Sega you get worthless skins and new units that do little to change the games they populate. Most can't recall the specific content they have bought because it is bland and predictable. I'll be in a nursing home somewhere fifty years from now and still be able to relish the fun I had playing through the plot of Hearts of Stone my in the same way I remember the roller coaster ride of playing through Brood War.   Companies like Sega and EA rely on customer stupidty to leech as much money from gamer wallets as they can with as shallow of content as possible. Giving CD Projeckt Red my money was a pleasure.

Then there are the games that stay with you, the games that you remember, the ones you return too time and time again, the 'classics'. Make no mistake this is a classic.   In truth, I've never been a huge fan of third person RPG's, but I found myself looking for a new game to play. I wanted a new world to explore and a rich story to delve into, so I began searching the store for such a title, and quickly stumbled across Witcher 3. Intrigued, I checked out the screenshots, then read the reviews - they swayed me almost immediately.  So I bought the game. At first I was unsure if i'd made the right choice, the world was simply stunning, but I found the camera and movement a bit awkward. However after playing for an hour these initial fears were banished. I quickly began to realise the sheer quality and scope in this game, and the more I witnessed, the more certain I was that Witcher 3 was worth every single penny.   If ever you want to lose yourself in a world, this is it. The scenery is nothing short of majestic, you will frequently stop to admire your surroundings - You will savour each stunning sunset, and find yourself seeking shelter from ferocious storms. As i'm sure you'll be thinking, good graphics alone do not make a game, I agree. The true enjoyment of this game comes from its variety of characters and fluid combat.  I fell in love with the characters populating this world. Each one was unique and believable. I was amazed at how the smallest decisions, could have such dramatic ramifications. The characters brought the world of Witcher 3 to life.   The combat speaks for itself.  Its a rare enough thing, to complete a game and feel a mixture of elation and dispair. Joy at witnessing such a masterpiece. Sorrow knowing that it be a very long time, before another game can even get close to matching this.  I envy those yet to play and yet to experiance Witcher 3. If you do buy this game throw yourself into the world. Enjoy the journey - believe me, you'll enjoy every second of it.",

But I am not able to simple sit back and say nothing more - before I knew anything 'bout this I sought for a game that was worthy for a title of a true time-killer, like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD ReMix (and the ReMix predecessor). Even though I've naught touch or heard anything 'bout the earlier titles presented and made by CD Red Projekt, I could naught help but to notice the trailer and the talk 'bout it. My curiosity was sprouted by what my simple eye caught in the content of the trailer; the astounding graphics, the vast-looking scenery, not to mention the taste of immersion in the farms, the life in the streets of cities, the adventurous feeling I felt by simple looking at the protagonist galloping through the well-a-lot-made wilderness.  Despite being hesitant by nature 'bout games I've naught tried yet, I was already convinced to at least give it a try caused by my longing for finding a game that was as good as the earlier mentioned different franchises. But... oh boy!  This game has an incredible vast content of story to tell that could easily be matched with or even surpass most of the story in the world of Kingdom Hearts, and believe me, it is enormous for a franchise. The earlier mentioned description of the visual content inside of the game easily surpasses TESOV: Skyrim compared how long PS3/Xbox 360 existed before the release of the latest single-player TESO-title. After a year and a half of the release of PS4/Xbox One CD Red Projekt was able to make a game that made several, if not dozen of standards of what you should expect of a game that stands true to the RPG-genre. The trailer did not in the slightest delivered unfaithful content, more likely otherwise, and even more: Immersive world which is full of sprawling life with people and collectible vegetation, challenging creatures and monsters with a battle-system which fitted the nature of the protagonist as agile, fast-paced and full of variety, exciting and compelling stories from both the main and side quests, an addictive original mini-game called Gwent, the beautiful and sometime simple breathtaking Original Soundtracks that would make you want to just stand by a high hill or a mountain side and watch the world go by with the ever-changing weather. Unfortunately, some of the soundtracks are only available ingame if you've pre-ordered the game but I assure you, you will not be disappointed if you buy the game after its release.  Some glitches, bugs and exploits have already been found and I must admit, even though some of the bugs and glitches might be eye-catching, the defect parts are as much worth of a pile of fiend dung compared to the upside of the game!  Last but not least CD Red Projekt releases frequently small but worthy DLC contents in form as new quests, new cards and alternative looks for some of the main characters which helps to keep the world from dying of the White Frost!

The map and quest system works great and there was always direction. I found was always driven to see the next part of the story.   The story was very engrossing and interesting. Very well developed and voiced characters and I loved where they went with the plot. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

Overall I was lost in the Witcher world agan in this one. Great experience and a well polished game.  The gameplay is fantastic, constantly kept fresh with new mechanics, abilities and plot twists. Classic Witcher abilities and ingenuity. And the graphics are definitely 'next-gen.' Very beautiful game.  I recommend this game to anyone looking for an RPG and a great story. Took me ~35-40 hours to finish the main story, but I wasnt a completionist by any means. There's tons left to do, I just couldn't wait to see the next part of the story so other than some pretty relevant side-quests, I trucked along pretty quickly.   Game ran well with no problems. I run a i5-4460, 8 GB RAM, and a GTX 760 2GB and I was able to run the game very well at 1080p with medium to high settings and 45-50 fps.",

If you're looking for an adventure game (somewhat similiar to The Elder Scrolls or The Legend of Zelda), I definitely reccommend The Witcher 3.   The fights against the harder monsters take forever; people are not kidding when they say you need to actually PREPARE for these fights with potions, repair your weapons and armor beforehand, etcetera etcetera. I've died a couple times already against challenging bosses, and let me tell you, it is VERY rewarding when I actually thwart said opponent. And I'm only on the second easiest difficulty.  The only thing I dislike about it is the fact that in order to know what's going on in the story you need to at least have played a little bit into the first two (both of which I now own because of Steam sales). Oh and I can't forget, there are a few bugs here and there that annoy the hell out of me. When I first started playing, there were times the game froze while I was in an inventory screen, but that's dissappeared since I capped my framerate to 30. (I really hate capping my framerate, but oh well.)  I probably would have purchased this at full price had I known the game was this good. Although I did hear this is the last game in its set, unfortunately.  Overall amazing game.  8/10",

And after playing it I have to agree that yes, it  is  an excellent game.  Most of what can be said about this game has been said by other reviewers already, but to summarize: it looks great, there is  alot  of story, the characters are very well written, the gameplay (fighting) is pretty good... Not much negative to be said here.  One thing that I don't think has happened to me before is that I actually regretted some of the choices I made in this game. The choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes things don't turn out the way you want them to.    For some reason I ended up with Triss when I was trying to end up with Yen...    I really loved the Ciri character, the main character Geralt's 'adoptive daughter', and after playing her side missions I wish they had made a DLC focusing on her as the main playable character.  I never got into The Witcher 1 as the game had a pretty slow start and the fighting felt really awkward, but now I might consider picking it up again (for the third time).  As for this game, I can't do anything else but recommend it, just like pretty much everyone else.",

            "review_text": "It's the greatest game ever created. Everything from the writing to the voice acting to the combat to the graphics is superb. I've just finished all DLCs on my second playthrough in the NG+, and after I uncover every single other thing there is to see and do, I'm going to do it all over again.  The devs have already said that for now this is the end of The Witcher, and that really is a shame. Personally, I don't think it has run its course even though I've got nearly 250 hours into the game; I really hope the devs decide to make more DLCs instead of making The Witcher 4. This game could go on for years and years just by releasing DLC like this, even one a year. There are at least three different endings for each version of the game and DLC, and every single action you take will affect those endings, no matter how small or insignificant it may be. Dialogue choices - even those seemingly harmless - can have a massive impact on the story. I recommend you manually save often because it can get really confusing. There are so many possibilities that I had to actually go to a spoiler site to keep track of them all and get the ending I wanted from the vanilla version in order to get the ending I wanted from the other DLCs. It's truly a domino effect and can get really unwieldy at times, but the good news is that it's so massive that it's pretty much got infinite replay value. There is just_so_much_story here that every time you play through it you love it even more. It's like the first Star Wars trilogy for Star Wars fans: it's something that just never gets old.  However, it's not without its faults, although they're mainly just tiny gripes. Maneuvering on Roach can be a pain sometimes because she gets stuck on trees and rocks occasionally, but it's not a big deal. Also, it's so incredibly non-linear that it can get unwieldy at times, almost making you feel like you've missed something in your quest for that next mission or next contract. I know that sounds like a first world problem - and to be fair, it is - but there is really nothing truly negative I can say about this game. In my opinion, it is literally the greatest game ever created, and with each DLC lasting at least 20 hours a piece, there's so much to do that it starts to feel like an MMO, only not crappy and repetitive. In fact, when the MMO genre came out, I'm sure this is the type of game they were going for yet never lived up to. CD Projekt Red has managed to create the perfect game, and although I'm very excited to hear about Cyberpunk 2077 being their latest project, I'm at the same time saddened to think that The Witcher will take a back seat to it.   A word of advice: go ahead and play through the first and second Witcher games. You can load your save from TW1 into TW2 and from TW2 into TW3, and all your big decisions from the previous games are brought forward into TW3. Of course, you don't have to play them at all to enjoy the game, but that continuity really adds to the lore and it makes you feel a part of the story. There's also a bit of nostalgia there.  Now excuse me while I embark on a third replay. I'd say it'll take another 150 hours or so.  Final Verdict: 100/10",

PROS: ------ THE STORY is compelling for those that want a story in a videogame capable of matching and surpassing those on the big screen, and detailed/extensive enough for the type of person who likes to really get into every detail of the lore. Even the side missions have great writing and attention to detail.  GOOD BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. I ended up spending almost 100 hours by the time I finished the story. This was with me wandering around a lot for fun, doing many of the side missions, and using the brothels.   THE GRAPHICS are as far as I can see some of the best to date. From the smaller perceptible facial details you can notice to the epic, varied scenery there is an abundance of eye candy.   THE POLISH of the product by the Polish (at least the build that I played) was very good at least on my machine. For such a large scale open world game release that can't be easy. I encountered few bugs, or anything that disrupted my immersion. Only once was there an odd glitch where all my session's save games went into a balck hole.   CONS -------  THE ENDGAME was lacking in things to do. Once you finish the story, it puts you back at a timeline point in the game that for all intents and purposes is before all of the main missions have been completed. This combined with the fact there is no incentive to carry out the other unfinished missions breaks immersion somewhat. With such a large world I am sure I did less than half of what there is to do. This is partly because I leveled so fast so most of my secondary missions and undiscovered locations became obselete. It would have been nice to be placed in the correct point of the timeline afterwards, and given the ability to effectively continue to level up while finishing some harder challenges. Otherwise a shame to have created a large world with much going unapreciated. That kind of thing would also enable to developers to monetize with DLC in an acceptable way.  ",

            "review_text": "In typical style, CD Projekt Red have outdone themselves.  I've been a fan of the series for years now, and have played each of the three installments, and there are some common themes amongst all of them:  - There is a fantastic element of choice in how your story progresses, with each choice having often far-reaching and unforeseeable consequences in the world. This mechanic is a staple of the series, and is done so well at least partly because there is never a right or wrong choice to make. There is no black or white, everything is a shade of grey.  - You're given the tools of swordplay, magic and potions and allowed to use them as you see fit. Additionally, each species of monster you hunt has its own strengths and weaknesses which you must learn to use against them.  - The character development forces you to become heavily invested in the game, and makes each of the previously mentioned choices matter all the more for it. You will find yourself genuinely caring about the consequences you caused, even if they were the lesser evil at the time.  - All of the games in the series have a wide variety of side quests to undertake throughout, adding hours of gameplay.  However, whilst The Witcher 3 shares this theme with its predecessors, it somehow manages to set itself apart by a wide margin. Combat mechanics are as crisp and responsive as they have ever been, allowing for you to truly become a master swordsman; the side quests are so much more detailed than they were before, requiring you to use investigation skills before tracking and killing the monster you're after; the visuals are the best this series has ever seen.  On these bases alone, I would absolutely recommend the game to anybody, and label it a must buy for any self-respecting PC gamer. However, I think it's only fair that a warning is also given to any prospective buyer... Many players (myself included) have experienced a high number of crashes. CDPR are working to fix this (at the date of writing two patches have been released already) but this may be a problem which blemishes the otherwise outstanding gameplay for you.",

Graphics are still great at medium with a bit of high mixed in with great frame rate. controls are a bit janky at the beginning trying to figure them out. Once mastered, they feel fine. Swimming sucks a bit though... Tried controller and keyboard but settled on controller.  Overall, 9.5 for me. The controls frustrated me the most at the beginning but as I said, they feel fine once you get comfy with them.

I like the transition from dry land to water. I can see the bottom of the lake as it drops off into deeper areas. I can skim over shallow water in the boat and see weed beds gliding past just inches from the bottom of the boat. I like how the surface of the water is effected by the weather.  Last night I noticed how as I rode my horse slowly out of rolling plains and into a shadowy forest...the sounds changed with the location. It went from the sound of blowing wind in the high grass to song birds and crickets, etc.  Another time as I was making my way on horse back to a quest location, and a storm blew in. The sky turned dark and rain began to fall, thunder rolled and the sound of the rain hitting around me was very realistic. After a bit I saw a village coming into view. The warm glow of light spilling out of the windows of the homes. I was fortunate it had an inn. So, as I would do in real life in that situation I dismounted and went in.   That is what makes an RPG for me. This game is loaded with the kind of things that make an immersive experience. I just like being in the game.",

Anyone who sees a pre-rendered cutscene two years before a game is released, and expects that to accurately represent what the final game will look like is a total idiot. Period.  2. This is the best RGP I have ever played.   There's too many amazing details about this game to fully describe here, so here's an essential pro/con list.  Pros:  1. The most satisfying RPG game mechanics I've ever experienced. This is a true role playing game. You play a well known character with well established abilities, rather than an unknown blank slate. This may make it seem as though you have less choice in progression, and while that's true in a way, it makes all the abilities you do have so much more meaningful and satisfying.  2. Every single quest, from the biggest primary quest, to the smallest side quest, has multiple ways to find and complete, and your decisions make a difference. Bad choices may come back to bite you, while others could prove helpful in some other future quest you haven't even found yet. Your actions truly have an impact on the world around you.  3. Combat is of the simple to learn, hard to master variety. Think of Arkhams free flow combat, but with even more depth, and no hand holding such as indicators for when you're about to be hit. Different enemies will have different weaknesses to take advantage of, and it behooves you to learn them and use those signs and poisons which will aid most in your fight. It is extremely satisfying to take down an enemy several levels above you with patience and skill.  4. Many areas and enemies will chew you up and spit you out until you're high enough level. Makes things much more interesting, and much more rewarding when you can defeat a boss that is very tough, and get that sweet sweet loot.  5. The game is absolutely gorgeous. I never pass up staring at a sunset.  Cons:  1. Literally the only con I can come up with is that sometimes there will be some jarring pop in of objects. Doesn't always happen, so it may be something that will be addressed in a future update. Either way, it's far from game breaking.  In conclusion, this is the best RPG I've ever played. Period. Nothing out there compares. It is, in my humble opinion, the new king of open world RPG's.",

Every quest had a cutscene and dialogue perfectly voice acted. When I go and search a 'crime scene' often I get to inspect what happened and get to draw my own conclusions and make a decision based on not only what Geralt thinks but what I think.   An example: looking for a dead woman, talk to some kids who say they saw a woman leading her into forest. Search forest. Womans sister comes to tell me for the good of her husband to leave to end his pain. I remember what the kids said and am interested about the woman leading her into the forest so I refuse and continue searching, I don't want to spoil anything so all I can say is it was worth the extra search.   I feel as if my decisions in this game are important, every bit of dialogue and every decision. Also I find the dialogue extremely interesting. I rarely skip conversations and when I do it is because I already read the subtitles.  I keep seeing negative reviews due to controls and combat. I enjoy a challenge and play on hard because the combat is difficult but rewarding. I play on a controller and keyboard and mouse depending on how I'm feeling. I can tell that I am getting better at combat and now am rarely dying. If this game were an alcohol it would be a fine whisky. This isn't something you toss back to have a bit of fun. Instead it's something you savour and enjoy.   I would like to write more on the game, however I'm too lazy. All I have to say Is you will either love it or hate it.

The world changes, a trader you save out in the wilderness, you can later find selling his goods in the city. While ofcourse giving you a discount for saving his skin. Overall you lead Geralts life in this game, it's your choice of how to lift a curse or how to fight a wraith. If someone is worth saving or if it is better to turn a blind eye. Would rate the game 9/10 overall but 11/10 while comparing to the game to any game that has come out in the recent years  Downsides i would say about the game is that there are still bugs, although for my experience none are game breaking but, rather as annoyances. Also warned that the graphics in this game are strong, i use a i7-4700HQ CPU @ 2.40GHz (overclocked to 3.2) and NVIDIA GTX 765 graphics card and must play the game on low settings to low medium settings.

I'm not going to give it a full review, but here are the pros and cons mentioned briefly: Visually, the game is absolutely phenomenon. Gameplay was a huge leap from Assassins of Kings; completely overhauled - giving you more liberties than ever in the series. The buttons and keys are adjusted more ergonomically than in previous games; no longer will you have to choose between movement and parrying for example. However, there is still some clunkiness to combat that renders the use of the brought-back alt+movement_key animation useless; forcing you to hit space and dodge instead - as awkward looking as the previous installment. I'm not sure if it's proper to complain about the healing system and alchemy, but it's made a lot simpler and a lot easier, so ♥♥♥ for tat if you hate and love drinking your potions in-battle. Oh yes, riding... and swimming... this literally revolutionizes the series in many ways. It immensely adds some immersion to the open-world atmosphere. I'm probably 5% into the game and I'm loving it. Gameplay cons aside, the only real downer (no pun intended; drowner... get it? nvm :P) is the fact that this game is pretty damn demanding! I'm having a hard-time running it on my GTX 765m (laptop; because I'm a moron). Nonetheless, that doesn't affect the score I'd be giving it.  This game deserves a 5/5, though if I was angry joe, I would reconsider giving it a badass seal of approval.",

Recommended to everyone especially Skyrim fans.  -GAMEPLAY  I didn’t like the fights at first so much but as I advanced they became more interesting and challenging. I played a combo of signs and strength. I was too lazy to learn the alchemy or crafting so I just relied on what I bought for armor and signs for fight.  -STORY  I should admit that the game didn’t get to me when I first started. Played it for 3h, left it for 6 months and then decided to give it a second chance. When I went back to it again I became obsessed with it and didn’t play any other games till I finished the main story. Maybe it was because I hadn’t played the prequels and the story was confusing at the beginning but when I played it for more time, I loved it even not knowing the story of other Witcher games.  The effect of choices you make are on of a kind and even better than Skyrim. Because of this there is a lot of replayability. For example Ciri has 3 different fates and Geralt has 3 different relationship endings and so there are at least 9 different main endings resulted by the choices you make.  The side quests are quite fun but as the main characters are appealing and the story is great, I’d rather play the game for 2 or 3 times instead of just completing one. Well this could be different for another game.  -PERFORMANCE  I have an i5-4440 3.1GHz, a GTX 960 and 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM. My monitor though only supports 900p so at this resolution with everything at ultra I get about 45 FPS. I set the max FPS to 30 so I could get a constant FPS with rare drops to 28 (usually when it starts raining ore there are more than one people with fancy hair on the screen). Overall I can say it’s a decent port and a smooth game.  -GRAPHICS  The graphics are just awesome. The sceneries, Nvidia gameworks etc. make the game so beautiful and luring even at 900p.  -BUGS &amp; ISSUES This game, like any other vast open world game, suffers from minor bugs. The most unpleasant one is the clothes changing to their original when you use “Alternative looks” DLCs during some cutscenes but the whole game is so playable and clean.  -CONCLUSION  Just one word… a Masterpiece   Truly the GOTY for me and looking forward to preordering the next game from CDPR.",

Yeah it's 'open worldish' but if say someone important dies you would like to have other people talk about that. During the course of the game certain characters may side with you but they don't really do anything past their respective side quest.  In addition, I imported a save game from Witcher 2. I wasn't really too shure about my decisions there. The fact there was no single moment of Witcher 3 where someone responded to those devlopments sucks. Im pretty sure I sided with Iorvith. I never saw him in the game. Roche did not respond to my decision. The fact that I went for Triss in the final chapter? Apperently Gerald and Triss broke up after wards, don't now why. Maybe I should read the books.  The first one might be fixed a little bit, I have no hopes for the second one. So my personal verdict is 9/10",

            "review_text": "I feel like I robbed a bank and got away with it because this game provides more amazing gameplay than many games I own combined. The value in this GOTY edition is great. I only have 15 hours in the game so far, but I feel pretty confident in going ahead and saying...this is the best game I've ever played, and I'd have to assume one of the best games EVER made...hands down. I can only assume I could get 1000 hours of play out of this game if I wanted to. I think one would be justified in buying a new PC just to play this one game. This is what Bethesda wishes it could achieve with their games. Despite them being separated by years for their respective releases, just for comparision's sake, this game makes Skyrim look like a joke.  Many reviews have already detailed the amazing things about this game long before I ever bought it, so I'll be brief:  PROS: -Story, story, story -Tons of mission, every one feels real and important -Choice in every mission and the choices feel real -Map design, without a doubt the best there has ever been, rolling hills, roads carving out ditches and embankments, trees placed in realistic clumps -Obviously graphics...worth upgrading your card for if you're near that point -Immersion -Voice acting, strikes a great balance between getting to the point and being immersive with conversation -Horse -Boat -Combat, I didn't like combat in the W1 and W2 but for some reason I like it with W3 -Forests, I mean, come on, the trees and the wind and the moon = eyegasm -Loot everywhere -Crafting is easy to get into -Alchemy  There are so many pro's to this game, I am sure I forgot several.  CONS: -If I were being really, really, really picky, I'd say the character movement sometimes gets annoying when trying to 'line up' to loot a container -Sometimes, rustic buildings get a little repetative to loot as they tend to be laid out in a similar fashion  FINAL: For $40 bucks, the GOTY edition should be an essential item in anyone's game library with a GPU that can run it at decent settings. The game is still well worth it if you can only run it on low settings.",

            "review_text": "  8/10  A huge game with tons of detail and amaizing content yet lacks in a few things and has A TON of problems.  Problems ive had: Signs scale up much slower than lvling either combat or potion.  Not having the option to jump in combat can get you stuck in certain places like falling from a small bridge protecting you from poison making you to kill the enemies from a distant in order to jump back up on the bridge.  Fps droping from long playthroughs (If you are having this problem a quick short solution would be to pouse the game and alt tab out and back in to it. Also if you are using nvidia, go to your global setings and manually add the game).  Movement outside of combat feels verry clunky combined with an awkward camarra position that makes it hard to loot and examine objects at times. Also disliked how there are places where you cant sprint... While it is understandable that someone would find it disrespectful if you run around there house, an abandoned almost destroyed house or a sewer i dont think should have this restriction.  Witcher gear is verry easy to find and it is way better than normal gear making you just sell everything else, most of the time its not even needed to dismantle since most dont give you any rare hard to find crafting matterials and they are all verry easy to make even the bear school. Now this is different when talking about the dlcs. If you wish to upgrade all the witcher gears to grandmaster it takes a rediculous amount of money even by crafting the resources. Combine this amount of money with the money you need for the glyph crafter and the house and its almost impossible. This gives more reasons as to why you should sell anything that isnt witcher gear.  Enemy difficulty. soo many monsters contracts are actually verry easy, some of em you can even stun lock em without having any stun or stagger on your equipment... And then there are some monster contract or bosses that just get rediculouse out of nowhere instead of implementing enemies that make you slowly think outside the boss and force you to slowly try new things to implement them against those bosses. and example of a really hard boss compared to soo many others are Djinn, and Von Everecs Nighmare.  Inventory needs more filters ESPECIALLY for diagrams. I would just love to not see any crap that isnt witcher gear. Also the way they are named... witcher swords have for example 'griffin steal sword - enhanced' which makes the diagrams much more organiced unlike armor which are named as : Enhanced witcher gear', This makes it so swords have the order for all the upgrades unlike armor which are piled up with all the enhanced ones.  No buying back option for the same money you accidentally sold the item for. since skipping a cutscene is the same button as selling an item i have accidentally sold a few things i didnt want to sell making me load back my previous save files a few times. Also idk if its just my game but a few times i have clicked an item to sell and even tho i click it multiple times to make sure im highliting the correct weapon i wanna sell, sometimes it ends up selling another item.  Game cutscenes not having the option to either pouse them or being able to load a save file, this makes it so that if you end up pressing a conversation by accident, you need to either press the sht out of your space button to skip everything to the end and close your eyes so you dont spoil anything or close the game entirely.  When sprinting with Roach he sometimes stops out of nowhere, this happends mostly when crossing bridges.  Volume problems especially when switching to cutscenes.  Djinns lvl scaling. For some reason if you are higher lvl than what djinn is supost to be and you have lvl scaling option on than he will 1 shot you with any of his attacks.  Npcs you need to follow sometimes not walking.  Witcher senses sometimes not showing footsteps unless im standing on top of them or if i pass em by and im looking behind me.  And finally when the game loads into a combat. For some reason when the game loads even tho its done loading it is still loading something while the game has started making so you dont have full control over geralt and sometimes not even being able to pouse the game and let it finish loading. This is a huge problem for the fist fights especially becouse the npc can still hit you while your character cant punch or roll for some reason.  Glitches: Invisible walls while in combat making it so you cant move to that location even tho there isnt anything on the floor. Roach getting stuck on a tree making it so that both he cant move and if you get on top of him than none of your buttons work other than loading a save file. Enemies that can jump sometimes jumping on to a invisible platform that for some reason makes em walk on air while not being able to hit me. The mission for lifting a cursed warewolf. If you kill the guys they still drop the neckless needed to lift the curse but for some reason it cannot be lifted unless you let em live... I guess the item isnt supost to drop in the first place.   Main annoying thing... Spiders. Almost impossible to dodge there webs sometimes even stun locking you.  Thing that I would love, An optiont to remove the hedious, horrendous, vomitting green smoke on the screen from taking too much potions. This both lowers my frame rate and makes the game look like garbage.  Roach appearing more closer than he is especially if he appears at my left instead than appearing far away behind me. The game not ♥♥♥♥ing auto equiping the torche in my inventory when I don’t even have it equiped on the tab inventory. When the torche is equiped it doesn’t let me use strong attacks, making it a real annoyance when you are using a strong attack build. Not having soo many secondary missions in which you just do the same thing over and over again. Remove the option for the potion clearance to not give you back the mutagens you used to unlock the abilities. It just makes the game tedious to go farm more mutagens just to test different builds, Im already paying 1k for the potion. An option for witcher senses to turn on by toggle instead of holding. Game needs a cap on dmg reduction that isnt either burn, bleed, poison. Geralt turns into a god when you reach 100% dmg reduction its crazy. An option to skp every cutscene by just holding the god damn button. I feel like ima break my space button playing NG+ skipping the things i already know.  Final thought. The delusion perk. a verry good perk for dialogues yet theres alot of dialogues where you are just left to question as to why it didnt have the option to use it? If Geralt can get out of a few combats by using it than why cant he use it for every situation where a group just wants to fight against you? why cant you use it to calm the jarl? seems verry weird. And the game being a bit shy to show beheadings and some gore at times. It kinda feels like the gore has been censored, in a game that one of the first conversations you might get is with a guy explaining gwent to you and you end up talking about how there should be a novel not afraid showing the horrors a war and yet the game itself is afraid to show it completely.  P.S Learn Gwent, it is the best card game ever.",

But after getting a good 5 hours into the game, I became really invested in the story and gearing myself, soon as I learned crafting I started to have a lot of fun, the game has a lot of nice armor and weapons as well as a kick-♥♥♥ story and full voice acting, even for the main character.  The overall map is huge and has plenty of space to roam and explore with beautiful terrain and scenery. The characters are mostly well thought out and interesting, and the combat system even on the easiest difficulty can prove difficult if you don't learn to time attacks, use runes, and dodge/alternate the power of your attacks. Though this is fairly easy to learn and quite fun to play with after a couple hours of play. I will warn you though, anything above the lowest difficulty setting will be quite difficult to beginners unless you've already played Witcher 1 / Witcher 2 and/or are hugely familiar with battle strategies in 3D RPG games.  As the time of writing this review I have played the game for around 16 hours, and have only encountered maybe 2 very minor bugs and 1 fairly large bug, but this large bug was very entertaining and made me laugh for a good bit, I fixed it just by saving then restarting the game, so it was more fun to have happen than to have not.  TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥ Fallout 4, get this, way more worth it and $10 cheaper.",

            "review_text": "I'm fifty hours in, and I THINK I've started the game?  What I am saying, is that Witcher 3 is one of the longest ga- WAIT I know what your thinking. This isn't a single player mmo like dragon age (no hate, amazing game) but this is a completely full thought rich game, where surely every acre of land was looked over many times by the developers, and they thought 'what meaningful quest, secret, or chest that has a book that, if you read it you find out about a murder that begins a quest tha- ANYWAYS'.  There is a LOT to do in the Witcher, and 15 hours in not one thing has been repetitive. I was originally scared to buy Witcher since 'graphics downgrade'. They released a hogwash trailer that was and still is not the quality of the game. They recieved too much flak, as the game looks a m a z i n g. It runs 55-70fps on an (overclocked) GTX 970 All ultra, 1440p w/ no AA or motion blur. Consoles hurt the game, but in the end it was the developers who chose to limit the graphics. Great graphics (like, god tier. Crysis tier), but not CGI tier. There are no insane effect w/ fire, smoke, or really any of the magic spells Geralt has. Not a big deal to me, but... yea.  So that's over, if that alone is enough to make you not play Witcher 3 I get it, but consider it. This surely will be known as one of the best games to date, ever. Let's go to the REAL cons, since there are some.  Cons: The combat for KB/M is m i l e s ahead of W2s controls, and overall is a pleasant experience. It 'almost' had a Dark Souls 2 feel, the flow of combat. The signs are well done (besides Aard, below), but sometimes the controls feel sluggy and especially when you fall into a CC you can't break out of (that I know of).  It's not dark souls. Fair con, right? The combat is great, but feels... dullish ~ once you master it. Still great and skill based with lots of timing. &lt;-- I played on Death March and died frequently, the game is hard on the hardest difficulty. Very hard.  At 55 hours, I can say Aard when upgraded (the push ability) is overpowered. Cool? No, not cool. I had to respec to make sure I don't want to use it :( It is basically a 1 hit kill. Sort of, if you know how to 'exploit' it, though it's not a bug but a design.  Pros for straight males:  15 hours in, saw 6 ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, 2 asses. I demand more ♥♥♥. Now.  50 hours in, saw 42 ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, 11 asses. I am satisfied. :boomer:  Nvidia hairworks is BS and should have never been added as it cripples performance from AMD cards. BAD! I have a 970, and my FPS goes from 52-34 with it on, amd ~ 20. And for what? Tomb Raider tier hair? Who cares. -Edit the fps is much better now on both AMD and NVIDIA but still for me, I reaaally don't care to lose 10fps for curly animated hair that feels fakeish w/ it's motion..  TL;DR The game is amazing overall, with some small forgiveable hiccups. This will be known as one of if not the best RPG ever made. Long game, without grinding or dull 'go here and fetch me this' quest.",

Most games I play I end up skipping through most of the cutscenes and dialogs but this will make you want to see it all.  Compared to Witcher 1 and 2, you are limted to where you can go but this is total free roam. Also the secondary quests are more important and more fun to do this time, I would recomend doing them all.  I would also recomend playing Witcher 1 and 2 frist so you understand the story more but if not then go ahead and play this but you WILL wonder about the history between the main characters.  I've had only 1 bug which was during a tressure hunt quest for bear school witcher gear, with the amount of content there is only having 1 bug to come across in my opinion is amazing.   The graphics are perfect with more than enough optimization to choose from but this is without a doubt a hard game to run. At 2540x1440 I am getting 54-64 FPS with 1 980ti and a AMD FX-8370 CPU on ULTRA settings using a G-sync 144hz monitor. At 1920x1080 I get about 74-84 FPS.  If you haven't played any of the Witchers before then don't go straight into the hardest difficulty, you will need to learn mechanics of combat, potions, weppons/armor, skills and have knowladge of monsters.

You will cry when the game ends. If you are a fan of Lotr-ASOİAF like I am you will like this. I really can't find anything bad about this game. Maybe the lack of weapons (there is thousands but they are all swords which is the only thing a witcher uses so it fits the lore)   You might think side quests doesn't give much XP and Coin but it fits perfectly.

            "review_text": "-- Played On --  Windows 8.1, i5-4460 @ 3.20 GHz, 8 GB RAM, Nvidia 680 graphics, Ssd drive, Xbox 360 controller.  -- Graphics --   There is a lot of settings for your graphics so you can find a good graphic with a stable frame rate for your PC. I don't have the most powerful PC but still got good graphic and stable FPS with tweaking the graphics to my liking. Went down from 1080p to 900p just to get a stable FPS on 60 and that is worth a lot more than 1080p and unstable FPS. With 60 FPS fighting feels fluid and more 'responsive'.  -- Sound --  The effect sounds and music are perfect. The voice acting are also top notch.  -- Controls --  They are also very good when you get into them. Of course there is a lot of buttons you have to learn. Different button layout on exploration, combat, swimming, horse riding and sailing. But the button layout always show on screen when you are in the different activity so that make the job a lot easier.  -- Combat --  You feel like a powerful Witcher but at the same time you feel like you have to work for it. Combining spells, swords, blocks and dodging are very fun. It can be very challenging with many enemies on a high difficulty setting. Whenever I lost in combat it felt like my mistake and not the game system letting me down. The only negative with the fighting was that the enemy had their specific fighting area and if you walked outside that area the enemy didn't followed you. So it was easy to manipulate the system when fighting powerful enemies.   -- Story --  For me I enjoyed the main story and it kept me interested through the entire game. But even with a good main story the side quest wasn't boring distractions. They almost felt like main story quest and while you were on a side quest you forgot all about the main quest until you finished your side quest.  -- Choices --  I love the choices in this game. There isn't a correct choice, just different choices with different outcomes. The consequences of your actions doesn't appear right away so can't save right before and test every outcome easily. That means when you are about to make a choice you consider every options a lot, but sometimes in action you don't get unlimited time to choose so then you have to take a hasty decision and live with your consequences.   -- Sex and Romance --  This game actually admits that sexual drive exist between humans and don't treat sex like you live in Duckburg as Mickey Mouse. It's not like Bethesda games where you chop off heads, blow out brains and comes home to your girl to have sex and the screen turns black. I love Bethesda games but that is breaking game immersion when sex is such a big part in peoples lives.  Even the romance and sex are very good created. You will feel strong connections to your girls and appreciate when Geralt get some sex. Geralt is one horny dog but the girls love to tease him.  In the romance part it's also big choices and consequences. It's created tastefully and realistic.",

            "review_text": "This game is absolutely brilliant! Best single-player RPG game I've ever played 10/10  Without the expansion packs I've easily put 100 hours of gameplay into this game. The story is amazing, and if you've played the previous Witcher titles you're in for a treat.  PROS + Main plot is breathtaking As I've said, if you played the previous titles you're in for a treat =] Even if you didn't play the previous games, you can definitely relate to the characters and enjoy the story  + Your choices matter The choices you make in the main or side quests deeply affect the plot and the world around you. I didn't play through the game multiple times, but I get the feeling the story is not linear at all.  + Side quests are interesting Each side-quest is unique and it's story is well-rounded and interesting. This is the first game that I can actually say 'I want to do the side-quests for the story', instead of just for grinding for better gear / XP / ...  + Open world exploration is optional yet rewarding I'm not a fan of open-world exploration, I usually like to stick to the story and not wander around too much... yet in this game on route to different quests I found myself taking detours to explore. The world they built is beautiful, filled with monsters and challenges, and the rewards for exploring the map are immense. Yet you can definitely choose not to explore and still manage just fine.  + Combat is challenging A lot of different challenging monsters, each with their own weaknesses/strenghts/patterns. Each battle I fought was challenging, and I has to consult the bestiary (encyclopedia of monsters) often.  + Skills &amp; mutagens offer various and rewarding play-styles I personally chose the Alchemy tree and wasn't dissappointed. After a certain point the bonuses I got from that tree made me really powerful on the right conditions. Each monster required different oils and/or potions to fight, and when I used the right ones they had a really big impact on the battles I fought.  CONS - On higher levels you are overpowered At around lvl 22+ I found myself having no difficulty defeating monsters 2-3 lvls above me. Maybe my build worked really well for me... but still, at a certain point the games ceases to be challenging and begs you to finish it already.  - Final battle is easy if your lvl is too high I reached the final battle at lvl 31 and it was a piece of cake, despite me playing on the one before the hardest difficulty. This was a bit of a letdown, especially because the build-up for the finale really had me gritting my teeth and saying 'I want to nail that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'... and then I did, and he was just so weak...  - Monsters are a bit predictable There are a lot of different monsters, yet once you learn how to battle each one they become easy to defeat (assuming your lvls are not too far appart and you use the right potions/oils/signs).  - The brawling / racing / gwent(cards) mini-games are not that rewarding or interesting Gwent is a big improvement over the previous gambling game (dice) but it's not that rewarding. Brawling and racing are just boring and not worth it.",

            "review_text": "I remember playing the first two Witcher games. The first one had a really engaging atmosphere, but the gameplay was fairly complex and not easily approachable without a lot of time set aside. Regardless, I still enjoyed it, but I don't think I ever finished it. The second game was much more approachable to a wider audience, but still retained the same depth and atmosphere. In a nutshell, the third game retains the level of polish and detail of the previous titles, (allbeit with a few bugs that every open-world games have) but in an open world larger than Skyrim. That, in and of itself is an incredible feat, but this game is truly an experience, not just some game you can waste time in. Geralt is a relatively unemotional character due to his mutations, and is morally gray for the most part. This works in the game's favor as long as you don't mind Geralt's gravely, sexy voice. You can choose to be distant, and stay out of others affairs, leaving them to fend for themselves, or you can go out of your way to sabotage them to benefit yourself (usually by means of money), or you can go out of your way to be kind and helpful, and be rewarded with meaningful relationships with characters that you struggle to accept as being merely fictitious.  This of course, is without even mentioning the gameplay. The keyboard and mouse controls are usable, but this game is probably better used with a controller. The combat is intuitive, challenging (just be sure to turn the difficulty up), and satisfying. The simplest way to describe it is a mix between Assassin's Creed and Dark Souls. Dodging is essential, but you can still parry and use Geralt's unique set of spells (called signs in game) to enhance your battling.  The Witcher 3 is amazing, no doubt about it. I'm on my second playthrough now, and even after doing the same quests again the game feels fresh and exiting. Add CDProjekt Red's free DLC and upcoming expansion pack and they've earned my love. And yours. Please experience this for yourselves.",

        {
            "review_text": "9.5/10.  DISCLAIMER: I have not played any other witcher game, nor have read any of the books before playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.  The witcher 3 is a story about Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. Witchers are mutated humans that hunt monsters for payment. they carry two swords. a steel sword for humans/non-humans. and a silver sword for monsters. they also wield magic at their disposal, are alchemists and can get sober at will! The game follows up through the story of the witcher 2 I believe, and might be confusing at first if you haven't played the prequels.  STORY: - Introduction - The intro/tutorial of this game starts off fairly alright, the tutorial feels rushed quickly which is not neccesarily bad, it has more 2 sides of the coin on it. on one side a quick tutorial is nice as it makes it so you can start the game as soon as possible. on the other hand it causes a bit of initial confusion on how to play the game properly. although admittedly, figuring stuff out by yourself can be fun to an extend.  - story as a whole - This story features an incredibly extensive amount of dialogue, and the best part is that the vast majority of it is split into tons of different dialogue options, allowing the player to more or less make the main character say what they want him to say. My favorite part of the story is that there are moments in the story where your choices have a lot of influences on what happens thereafter. not a single moment goes by that I regret doing certain actions after I found out what their implications are, and also wondering what would have been if I had chosen a different option. To me however, the most incredible thing of this game is how the main story actually takes a very long time to complete. Most story driven games nowadays seem to settle around 8 to 10 hours of gameplay and that's it. but this game takes a genuine long time to complete, and with that feels as if it's trying to spit in the faces of game designers that haven't tried to make their games this long.  - Side quests -  This game features an insane amount of side quests. I'm sure about half my playtime has gone to side quests.  Some of them are short, other moderate, and some are fairly long. some side quests feature small story instances with sometimes dilemmas or different endings depending on your choices. there are also monster contracts which make you track a monster and kill it in exchange for gold. and lastly there are treasure hunts which feature niche area's that are hiding loot. overal the side quests are a very big part of the game, as it manages to fill countless hours  GAMEPLAY: - Combat - The combat is not exceptional, but it is really fun nonetheless. you have a variety of ways to engaging fights to your liking, using spells as you wish and slashing around with your blades in a way that feels a bit loose, but satisfying. and it's not one of those babysit-gameplay games either. if you do not utilize dodging and blocking accordingly, you will find yourself in a world of hurt. it follows the terms of game-flow really well. neither too hard nor too easy, but with challenges from time to time.  - Horseriding -  Your horse is the means of travel in this game. I was really surprised to see a game that actually succeeds in horse-travel, which I personally haven't experienced since Red Dead Redemption. your horse has stamina, which depletes when you gallop, although it recovers fairly quick. your horse also has a fear level, which is a mechanic that allows it to kick you off its saddle if it gets too scared by monsters, wildlife, bandits, etc. It feels somewhat realistic to have it, and it doesn't happen too often that you get thrown off your saddle, so it's not annoying.  - Crafting - Crafting is fairly well executed in this game. In order to craft something, you require a diagram, aka blueprints, which contain the recipe of how to craft an object. there are 2 things when it comes to crafting: Alchemy and Smithing. Alchemy: this means creating potions that give you small edges in combat. It actually took me a while to realize one feature that is really loveable about alchemy, which is the fact that once you create a potion, you won't need to create it again. instead it refills by using strong alcohol. this removes the annoyance that is gathering resources again and again, and simply allows you to enjoy what you have achieved permanently. Smithing: similar to alchemy, you gather components to create a piece of armor or weapony. you then go to a smith to have them craft gear for you. it's pretty much like any other crafting in games, so nothing exceptional to say here.  - Gwent - Gwent is a card mini-game inside the game itself. it's a best of 3 in which you try to outmatch your opponent in numbers, but you have to manage with your limited resources which makes it so you have to play it smart. if you spent all your cards at the first round you might be bound to lose. it has a lot of depth, too bad you are against AI. there's an official Gwent card game coming out soon though, as of the time I wrote this you can apply for a closed beta.  - Customization -  Your options at customizing your character is a list of perks and abilities that you can unlock by leveling up. every time you level up you gain a skill point which you can spend to unlock or upgrade abilities. these abilities eventually define your playstyle so it's important that you read them all first before you spent your points. I for example went mostly for magic perks, which in turn didn't give me a lot to invest in alchemy perks.  GRAPHICS: -Visuals- absolutely stunning graphics and that while I was playing at medium settings, I can only imagine how incredible the max settings can be.   -Design- The world is incredibly beautiful and nothing looks as if it has just been thrown in there to fill space, it's almost as if every nook and cranny in the game was thought out precicely. not to mention this is the only game to me whose forests actually feel like forests, and not a bunch of trees thrown around next to each other. the enemies and monsters are beautiful and very immersive, although at one point you start noticing with npc's that models are reused a lot.  BUGS/COMPLAINTS: first of all the bugs, holy ♥♥♥♥ there are a lot of bugs/glitches/faulty code that I've encountered in the game. I already mentioned how the combat was loose, that's because the game seems to have extremely accurate collisions, and small stone or tree will fully halt your movement, not to mention your horse's movement. AI at many times seems to get stuck or clipping. I've had many ocassions in which dialogue scenes are ruined by some random AI walking in the middle of the conversation. the AI itself seems to be glitchy at times, I've fought many enemies that just wouldn't attack me or walked away slowly because they became bugged. the funniest of them all was near the end when 6+ soliders got stuck on a tiny bridge and walked in circles clipping inside eachother. I also had the misfortune of getting outside the map boundaries once, making me walk mid air while also not being able to get out, forcing me to load a previous state. Fortunately these are mostly minor bugs which just break immersion, and the autosave system in the game makes it so anything that goes wrong does not ruin hours of gametime.  To summarize, this game is a masterpiece that ♥♥♥♥♥ on all the other story driven games and makes them look like utter garbage with their ~10 hour playtimes, it features enjoyable combat and a ton of very polished Rpg elements. the story is incredibly beautiful and intruiging as well as replayable due to its multi-choice dialogue and consecuences, and the graphics are very nice. Truly deserving of it's 'game of the year' award, even though that award is given a way a bit too loosely imo.  My general rule of thumb is that for every dollar/euro you pay for a game, 1 hour is spent playing that game, and this game goes far beyond that.",

Never seen water look so real and nice, not even in real life! - There is no lag for such a gorgeous game (Tried with Nvidia GTX560 which is below minimum and it was fine with low settings) - Sound is fantastic. Weather effects and night and day cycle is just awesome. - This is an rpg following the witcher style, so i you didn't like witcher 1 and 2, then this game won't be fun for you. - They now have a mini card game named gwent i think. It's pretty good a la magic the gathering style and hearthstone. - The fights and move are much better than before due to gorgeous graphic engine. It feels more like real combat compared to the old witchers games. - Magic is diversified and not always helpfull - The world is biiiiiiiig and full of guarded loot. Luckily you got your horse to move faster around but it's still big. - Crafting armor and weapons is a lot of fun and very well made - Leveling is veeeeeeeeery slow. 15 hours in the game and i'm lvl 4. Take that wow!   The Bad: - This game is hard. Pant sheeeeting and peeing hard. You can encounter a lvl 10 monster in the first region just by exploring around. Sure it guards an insanely good treasure, but watch out! I spent a lot of time running away! - The fights are hard even at normal difficulty (and there are 2 other tougher levels for those masochists among you). Each monster needs to be fought a certain way and you have to experiment to find out which is best. No hack and slash forever in this game. You can use fast magic spells, bombs, crossbow, 2 types of swords, potions, oils, trophy to better your odds of winning. Lots of dodging and parrying are needed too. And there is a biiiig talent tree to specialize yourself in a lot of things. - Crafting potions (not oils) is bad. Problem is that you find a sheeetload of herbs everywhere, but the alcool you need to craft a potion is so rare or expensive that most of the time it ain't worth it. And crafting those alcool is more expensive than buying them. So you make very little potions in this game. And the potions last for just a few minutes so in a long fight (which most are) they expire waaaay before the fight is done. - Going with the crafting of potions, there is so very little coins to be had in this game. Maybe it gets better later (I saw that they actually nerfed the coins in loot in the latest patch! Da  fuuuu...ck?) . So you have to be very carefull what you buy at the trader.  That's it!

            "review_text": "Oh boy, was I in for a ride...  TL;DR The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an amazing game, that has been said countless times over, and it deserves every bit of praise it gets. I'm enjoying every minute of this game, and anyone who has a pc even remotely capable of running this gorgeous pearl in the gaming industry should give this game a shot. Even if you might be unfamiliar with it.  Now to get in to the gist of this review. I was extremely hyped for this game before it's launch, even if I didn't really know anything of the Witcher in general. I tried to play The Witcher 2 on my old laptop, but being as incapable as it was with running graphically intensive games, I stopped after a while. It was just not enjoyable. But even so, not knowing anything in the slightest, this game drew me in right from the start. Sure, you get lost and confused at the start, and I do recommend searching for some short YouTube videos explaining what happened in the previous games (as I did), or even better, if you have the patience; Play the previous games yourself. They seem to be worth your while. I simply couldn't wait playing this masterpiece, and therefore I jumped right in.  After familiarizing myself with the setting and the characters, I felt more attached to the story elements and background/lore of this amazing world. The countless books and villages seem to make the game feel more alive than anything I've ever played before. You really feel like a witcher, searching for contracts in towns, simply travelling the road and suddenly seeing something red pop up in the corner of your eye as you were using your witcher senses, therefore starting a new questline as you discover the mysterious claw marks on the tree besides the broken merchant cart. It simply has a never-ending universe of quests, contracts and exploration, carefully binding these three elements together and truly hitting the mark with all of them.  The atmosphere and story aside, the gameplay itself is nothing to sneeze at either. Playing the game on Death March truly gives you a sense of danger as you discover all kinds of enemies who you never fought before. Trying to dodge, roll, parry and flank yourself to victory feels very rewarding. Admittely, the game does sometimes restrict your movement a bit too much in certain areas, and you may very well find yourself getting stuck against a tree branch or a small fence, simply because the combat does not allow you to traverse all the objects in your path. This however does not retract form the awesomeness the combat ensues, and I do thoroughly feel the 'Dance like a butterfly, and sting like a bee'- mood.   The progression and skills feel balanced overall, although I do find some signs and bombs to be rather useless. Then again, it might just be my playstyle, and that's what I love about the Witcher 3; It let's you approach a situation, and you decide when, and with what, to engage.  As far as customization goes, I do feel the Witcher 3 might be a bit lacking sometimes. Before an angry mob shows up at my house, let me explain: Yes, it's true, there are tons of swords and pieces of armor that can be equipped with many different looks and styles. However, once I aquired my first 'Witcher Gear' it felt kind off pointless to try and search for better loot, apart from selling it. Don't get me wrong, I love the Witcher Gear, and the way the appearance changes as you upgrade it througout the game, but they just make the other armor and weapons feel a bit obsolete at times. This might just be intentional, for Geralt is a witcher, and perhaps he's supposed to wear gear designed solely for witchers.  All in all, this game is insanely good, and I can with utmost confidence tell you that it is worth every penny. Do give this game a shot, but beware: You do need a lot of time to truly experience this game. This is not a game to play once every few weeks. But boy, is it worth your time...",

To me, this is the standard setter for open world RPGs going forward.  Definitely one of my favorite games of all time, but not without some flaws of course; some glitches can be found, the game becomes too easy with how powerful you become as your character progresses.

This from someone whose gaming 'career' took flight with Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 in the early 80s. An incredible story with lots of twist and turns and 2 great extensions that, for me, added about the same playtime as the original game. My ingame time of ~240hrs is for a single playthrough of the game and its two extensions. Needless to say I enjoyed every one of those.  A word of warning though. This game might leave you feeling a tad empty once you finished it as there is nothing comparable. Other than that absolute recommendation, even for people who do not count RPGs to their favourite type of games. I am neither - although I bought Ultima 6 back in the day (cloth map and all), installed it, diddled around for 30 mins, uninstalled it, put the box back on the shelf where it has been sitting since collecting dust. TW3, however, the story, the characters, the graphics.. they all will draw you in. In an instant. Give it an hour or two playing and there won't be any letting go. I got the game a long while after the initial release because I was wary. In the end I got it for less but having finished I would have gladly paid the full price or even more than that. It's worth every penny. And the extensions, as mentioned above, add more content than most actual base games have. So go for it and let yourself immerse into it. Chances are you will like it very much.",

Before I started playing, I decided to finish parts 1 &amp; 2 once again to be more immersed in the story.   So, as a fan of the Witcher universe, I cannot but recommend the game. The graphics are stunning and well optimized, gameplay took me some time to get used to as there are a lot of key binds for my taste but that was quickly surpassed. The story so far is intriguing and hooks you up immediately but as this is a semi-open world game, I leave the main story for later. The game is worth every penny.  The game is wrongly labeled as open world while it's not actually one. It has vast area maps but you can't go everywhere without loading screens. E.g. from White Orchard to Velen, or from the HQ at Vizima to Velen. That is actually the only drawback I can find for it. Oh and Gwent. Why did they decide to implement that silly card game is beyond me. Dice Poker was excellent...  Finally the game, although beautiful, has some really blow-your-mind mods available, which make it even more stunning. Totally worth going there.",

I don't often sing the praises of a game but 'The Witcher' like any work of art deserves a round of applauses and bows. During these 46 days I was on a true to life, almost real, absolutely extraordinary adventure.&nbsp;The 'Wild Hunt' took me through its tremendous world, from the burned to ashes villages, caused by the Great War's aftermath, and dark gloomy caves of various monsters for all tastes to incredibly beautiful forests, valleys and misty mountains stunning with their majestic ice peaks. On my journey I met a lot of unique people: kings, beggars, soldiers, poor mothers whose sons were taken by the inevitable wars or happy couples which were about to get married inspite of all the atrocity happening beyond the boarders of their village. And I still remember them all because they all had their own custom-made stories and fates in which I played a very significant role and so did they. All of these little stories I took part in were either ridiculous but really fun or dramatic and touchy. They got me into laughing hysterically or weeping bitter tears because of the consequences and the choices I made. The main story of Geralt of Rivia is deservedly one of the best stories in the history of the computer games. Throughout the whole gaming experience it keeps you on the edge of your seat and sets you free only after the credits fading away to the incredible soundtrack which is now forever stuck in my iPod. 'The Witcher 3' has erased the distinction between the games as a source of entertainment and the games as a source of something spiritual, a source of enlightment. Like a powerful book or a movie, long ago recognized as a masterpiece, it moves you into the burst of different emotions and thoughts which won't leave you in the next week or even more. To me this is the end of an era, the end of the epic trilogy started back in 2007 and finished today on June 26th, 2015. There's the only question left - What's next? Is there a life after the Witcher? Will there ever be anything like this? I hope so... I really hope so...",

Prior to this, I felt it was a tie between Fallout: New Vegas or Skyrim, but this RPG blows those two out of the water. While it's probably not my favorite game ever, it is definitely up there. The visuals are stunning, the narrative is incredible, the combat is balanced - I actually feel like CD Projekt Red created a game as close to perfect as they get. The reason it's not my favorite game as of yet is because I haven't played it enough.   I recommend that when you play this, take it slow, do all or close to all of the side quests and contracts (which I didn't do and I regret since coming back to them later is too easy,) and also start this game on the 2nd lowest difficulty, and when you reach level 10 turn it up to Blood and Broken Bones or even Death March.   10/10  Update: Played through the game and Hearts of Stone by this point, and started Blood and Wine. Incredible. DLC is definitely worth buying, and the atmosphere in Blood and Wine is so different and beautiful.   11/10",

I got this game and all its DLC on sale, yet so far I have put enough hours in this game to have paid full price twice over. Yet I'm still not done with it.   The game has replayability, you can go back, try new builds, try new paths in your choices. Yet I haven't done that yet. The time I have put into this game has been playing the main story line, the Hearts of Stone quest line, and a lot of side quests. With still a lot more to go.  I can see myself putting over 200 hours into the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, with its vast open world, its amazing creatures, and immersive story telling. Not only in the main questlines, the side quests and witcher contracts feel like a short story themselves.  Each time I play the Witcher 3, I find myself not wanting to put the controller down. Many late nights have been spent as Geralt of Rivia, the butcher of Blaviken, and the many other titles that precede the main character of this breath taking experience of a game.   Witcher 3 Wild Hunt has won many awards, and whats more than that, its DLC has won many awards. The DLC good enough to be a stand alone game themselves. On top of that you even get around 17 free DLC to add onto the game, for completely free. CDPR is an amazing developer, they are what other companies should be, and they produce games other companies only dream of creating.   If you don't own this game, I more than reccomend it. You will start it up and play for what you think was a couple of hours, and find out you spent 10 hours in the game, and haven't even scratched the surface of this amazing work of art.",

The controls are slow and methodical, with quick reactions and swift, decisive strikes being your friend. This lends itself easily into an enjoyable and deep combat system coming very close to how Geralt would actually go about things in the books. Thinking things through, avoiding strikes where he can and cautiously maneuvering around his environment and his enemies.  The dialogue is thoughtful and mostly natural, with grade 'A' voice acting making everything come together perfectly.  Questing anywhere and everywhere is unique and rewarding, with many memorable side quests littered everywhere in the world. The story itself is, while a bit convoluted in places, enjoyable. Now, the expansions, 'Hearts of Stone' and 'Blood and Wine', are immense and interesting in both their storyline, but also the sidequests that lie within them. Adding these two masterpieces in storytelling to the lacking main story in the vanilla game easily makes this one of the best RPG's of 2015/2016, and hopefully for the next few years to come.  Performance is what you would expect from this beautiful and sweeping game.

It had a semi-rough launch with a few crashes, but they've fixed most of these problems.  The game itself is very pretty. Very nice to see a game with such a dynamic weather system. Most textures are high-quality, but there are some less appealing textures in certain places, such as foliage and rocks.   There is an obscene amount of NPCs in the game, though many are 'fillers', which provide a sense of immersion. They are often rude, disgusting and / or annoying. While traveling, people sometimes spit, cough and wheeze if you interact with them. The characters you can talk to have reasonable reactions to dialogue, believable expressions and body language.   The quests you can complete are many, but they don't get very repetitive. Well, at least they do not SEEM repetitive. They certainly are, but the depth of the world, plus the details the devs have managed to bake in to the quests make them unique nonetheless.   The gameplay feels polished. You can feel that they have used quite a bit of time to make things work well. However, the dodge and roll mechanics are sometimes a bit dodgy in the hit detection department. (pun intended) An attack you'd expect to dodge would hit you anyway. It's not gamebreaking, but i would not cry if this was tweaked.  The targeting system feels OK, you can usually rely on the autotargeting the game does for you. Alternatively, you can lock on if you like being whacked from behind.  The character progression trees were dissappointing. You get four mutagen slots, and twelve skill slots. The mutagens are drops from monsters, and some are unique to certain enemies. If you place said mutagens in their slots, all they give is a scaling damage / health bonus (depending on colour).  Most of the 'skills' or 'talents' you can get are flat damage / crit / health boosts. There are a few abilities such as alternate sign modes and a sword whirlwind. You will however see many 'boring' talents which give you flat bonuses which do not provide any new mechanics.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a game i can reccommend. If i'm to give it a rating, i would give it 9/10. Not full score because the game is not perfect, which is what the 10/10 rating is reserved for.",

The world is large allready but much of it is either open water or dreadfully boring swamps.

Your horse is possibly the dumbest individual in the game. Character movement can be clunky and get you stuck behind boxes, more annoying than game-breaking tho. Combat against multiple enemies can be hard at times, but it's even worse when friendly AI does nothing but soak up punches, block YOU from attacking and get you killed by being dumb.

            "review_text": "At first I was a bit apprehensive about this game, I have no idea why I just was. But damn, I am so sad I didn't get it sooner!  The world is thriving with life, there is so much content you will find it hard to keep track of all your quests and witcher contracts. The ways of traveling in this world make you appreciate the effort put into this so much more, wether you are riding your way through the forests on horse-back, or sailing the beatuiful seas surrounding the land or trudging your way through the mountains following the tracks of a Chort.  This game also has so many choices which will effect what happens in a story, and for a game with as much content as the witcher does whilst being an open-world game, that's pretty amazing! Ontop of the content they already have in the game they also let you customize yourself, with hair and beards, armours, swords, axes, maces and if you can find them in the city, masks. The combat system is both hard and fulfilling (I am playing blood and broken bones so please don't call me bad at the game for calling it hard xD) there are counters, heavy attacks, light attacks, blocking, parrying arrows and execution moves.  Also if you weren't already immersed in the game enough it makes some characters you will swing between loving and hating due to how real they are to the point where you really care what happens to them in the end. And even ontop of that immersion they have the witcher contracts, these are missions that you can get from a local towns bounty board, notifying you that a citizen needs someone's help to deal with a monster, which really puts your witcher skills to the test, you have to prepare for battle by brewing oils to do more damage, bombs, potions to buff yourself against this specific type of creature. This game has so much content, the voice acting is great, the characters are realistic, the world is beautfiul and thriving with life and they have a load of free DLC and the one's you need to pay for add so much more to their already full game.  If you still don't believe me that the Witcher isn't worth a buy, I managed to talk about a load of features and things about the game without saying ANYTHING about the main story. Now come on I can talk that much about a few minor things about the game for this long without mentioning a single thing about the main game.",

The performance overall is grand. The graphics are beautiful, even with my mediocre GTX 760 GPU.  Dialogue has a perfect mix of emotion, story/character-depth and humor. The voice-acting - along with accents, dialects, etc is top-notch.   The gameplay is great, attacks work fluid most of the time and you have some fair variety, plus a decent list with skills. It took me 110 hours to finish this game - WITHOUT THE DLC - and I gotta say, that's quite impressive for a Singleplayer game. The quests vary from challenging boss fights to hilarious goat-chasing, but every quest felt 'unique' and made me both curious and motivated to pursue all of them.  I recommend buying this if you're both a fan of the Witcher series or RPGs overall, you certainly won't regret it. It's truly worthy of the title 'Game of the Year', and the developers being 'Developer of the Year'.  Overall this is a finished game that's actually worth 60€, if not more - with a great story, great characters, great combat and great dialogues/voice acting. Something that is left to be desired in nowadays' gaming industry.  I will also be looking forward to buying the DLC later, for I'm convinced that CDRP won't disappoint.

PROS! +This game is freaking beautiful +The combat engine is surprisingly deep +A LOT of character customization (outfits, skills, weapons, heavy, medium, light armor, etc) +AMAZING voice acting with superb sound editing! Even on my ancient speakers, it sounds FANTASTIC! +A story that seems simple, but becomes more epic as you play through it +BIG. FREAKING. WORLD. I'm over 50 hours in, and I've only just now hit the second map! It's a BIG game! +Lore, everywhere, so much lore!  CONS! -Absurd difficulty at times, where you may have no trouble beating a wyvern, and then a wolf that's 10 levels higher than you shows up 5 minutes later, and one-shots you.  -That's it for cons, seriously. That is my only gripe with this game, and it's easily fixed by dropping the difficulty.   Uhhh...? ?Gwent. The card game that I feel incredibly indifferent towards; I played it for a while to get extra money early on, but got really tired of it really quickly. For me, it's not particularly interesting, but I know some friends who basically decided to quit adventuring in TW3 to become, for lack of a better comparison, Yugioh.    In conclusion, you could do FAR worse for an open-world RPG. But be warned, if you're ANYTHING like me and like to try to get every collectible, you're going to go insane after a while. A lot of areas have a soft level-gate, where you can go in them, but you'll get gangbanged by a horde of robbers really quickly. It's kind of terrifying when it happens. But yeah, I seriously have very few problems with it, personally, and I can recommend this game to just about everyone.   I recommend The Witcher 3 to: RPG fans, lore fans, Witchers, people who like simple but good combat systems, and finally, anyone who thinks Geralt is a badass. And Geralt himself, if he can be bothered to play after murdering thousands of monsters and then falling into a moat.   I may play very different from everyone else...",

The story, including expansions, can be quite dark on one moment, and really funny another.  And I think one of my main things is that, even though you are a monster slayer, a witcher, violence is not the answer to most of the quests. It's based a lot more on research, detective work and the hunt. Ofcourse there are whole bandit hideouts to take out, but there are also quests to get through the beaurocracy at a bank or grabbing a pan for an old lade in a hut. Where a lot of games make violence the only conflict resolving option, like Fallout 4, the roleplaying, survival and real gameplay makes this game worth all. The expansions are vast and very worth it as well  Can't recommend this game highly enough.",

Lets start?   Gameplay:  I haven't played much of the other 'The Witchers' but i think its safe to say the gameplay is phenominal, the fluidity of movements and combat just seems amazing... This game is the first game where i actually took my time playing it... instead of running through towns trying to rush everything, i walked and listened. You can hear chatter amongst the NPC's as they discuss their personal issues, or issues you might encounter later on in the game... It's honestly a game that it going to take you a while to 100% complete... That is by no means a bad thing by the way, that just means you're getting more bang for your buck!   Graphics:  The graphics are unreal... my PC isnt beefy, and i cant play maxed out, but i can clearly see how much detail they put into it... the optimization is a large reason why i stay... as i said before, my PC isnt beefy, sure it has a r9-280x in it, but its not beefy &gt;_&gt; There are small details which make me have an inner-climax... The fog the blows in the wind, the monster looks, the towns that differ in variation... this is truly the reason why i play on PC... you can control how the world around you looks... it's in your capable hands!   Atmosphere:  Breathable.... Just kidding!. Anyway, this games so atmospheric that it just, sucks you in, and you can't stop playing it... remember that time you bought some other favourite game (i.e.) Far Cry 4? How everything around you seemed so lifelike, the animals were running around, eating, doing their animal stuff... people were chatting, driving, walking around, doing human stuff... Games like this are rare to come by, and the Developers of The Witcher 3 {CD Projekt Red) did a great job making sure that you would keep playing... I love you can just, walk in a small town, and want to stay there for the rest of your life, you just dont even want to finish the game, you just want to listen to the conversations, and become part of the community.    Sound:  The sound in this game is... well, i don't even know how to say this without being mean... up to speed with current games? It's comparable to GTA5 in the sense where, instead of hearing car horns beep, you hear people talk, and work at the village. I am using surround sount headphones (steelseries syberia v2) and everything is clear, and you know where the talking is coming from... its like there's someone behind you in real life when NPC's talk behind you... once again, great job devs!   Controls:  Controlling Geralt feels spot on, apart from some aspect where you're sprinting, and you stop, and you run into the wall and it looks clumsy. Same with the horse, you run into the wall, and it looks clumsy... im not saying that its a bad port by any means, im just saying, don't expect yourself to run into the walls and not look clumsy... :P   Plot:  No spoilers, i promise... The plot was well thought out, and followed through perfectly... It kept me interested, as there were moments that would shock you. and other moment where you just wanna cry and hug your cat because its the closest thing you have to a best friend (dat lonely lyf) Even the side missions are amazing, it's comparable to Skyrim to be honest... if you enjoyed the skyrim plot/side missions, youll enjoy The Witcher 3's side missions and plot!  To give this game a rating out of 10... it would have to be an honest 9/10, the other 1 point is because i havent finished it, and im stuck in Velen with over 100 Question Marks to deal with -.-",

I could go on for days about terrible triple A releases and their pricetags, but for once CD Projekt Red shows the industry how its done. Not only is this game beautiful, but its incredibly well written and will keep you playing for hundreds of hours. I've played through the game twice now, and can say it will be one of those games to inspire constant returns for the years to come. Whats most impressive for me is how flawless the combat feels. In the games predecessors I felt the controls could be clonky and found myself screaming at my monitor because my dodged just missed the tip of the enemy's sword thus resulting in my immediate death and wipe of all my save files (CURSE YOU WITCHER 2'S HARDEST DIFFICULTY!). Combat rarely gets boring and offers many different ways to deal with situations, though there are definitely 'optimal' ways to dispose of enemies.   The books this series are based on are throroughly well-written, even when translated and The Witcher 3 really holds strong to this fundamental for this intellectual property. The game's voice acting is excellent, and the writing is on par as well, with countless hours of dialogue to keep you listening and hopefully interested in the world unfolding at your whim.   This game is amazing, and definitely warrants a purchase from enthusiasts and casuals the same. You'll easily get your money's worth, which is greatly refreshing for our modern landscape of gaming. CD Projekt Red deserves a lot of kudos for this title, and I can say they've earned my money, and given me a chance to truly engage in the vast world of The Witcher.",

            "review_text": "The visuals and storyline of this game set it apart from anything currently on the market. You need to be aware of how you interact with certain people as it can alter how the game ends, whether or not you can fully (100%) complete the game, and the time frame of when you reach higher tierd (level) fights.  Secondary missions are key to not only leveling you charachter up but also to fully fleshing out the Witcher universe. Completing these missions throughout the map allows for you to talk to more minor part charachters who may help to develop the main storying.  There are books that tell you about not only different spells/concoctions you can make but also the history of different charachters and how to better fight specific monsters.  The only issue I have with this game is the somewhat boring fight system. The game gives the ability to alter how difficult the ai is to fight (this is the difficulty in the settings menu not levels in game). At the lower levels this game turns into a button masher, where no boss fight/monster fight will ever take more than one try to finish. At the higher level difficulty you may need to think slightly more about how to attack a monster (what concoction to use on weapons/monster/yourself) but again the majority of the fights feel monotonous.   This fight system can also make witcher contracts feel monotonous, this lead me to skip a number of them mid game to focus on the main and secondary storyline. Witcher contracts (unlike some of the main/secondary missions) can be completed at any time during the game and will never disappear (or atleast to my memory none did), they didnt change or evolve over time and therefore contracts that were meant for me to be completed at level 10 stayed at that level.... returning to it when I was level 24 made for an easy 1 hit kill. Personally I think each contract should evolve slightly if you skip it, so that a contract can become harder to defeat if you leave it too long (with the monster evolving) rather than being easier to defeat.  I would definitely recommend this game, the fight system is only a small negative as it is much like other games, the story however is step above the majority.   ",

Some people are saying the game has issues- I have had none. Conclusion? It's not the game, it's them.  - The map is massive. - The graphics are breathtaking. - The combat is brutal. - The humor is dark, and it's everywhere. - The story so far is fantastic.  The only downside is when you think Nilfgaard soldiers will be able to kill a drowner and it slaughters them while you watch.",

You intervene ... and after saving her she insults you.  You enter an abandoned village with corpses lying around, Suddenly a strong wind starts blowing, trees and bushes are bending and the sky grows dark - just before a wraith attacks you.  In short... Witcher 3 is a true masterpiece.  PRO: The obvious: + Stunning graphics, animations and cinematics (best I'Ve ever seen in an RPG) + Superb music, voices and sounds (BTW fully voiced) + controlling your character inside and outside battles is fluent and intuitive + Game never crashed - not just once. + Excellent quest navigation (never had to look up where to go next). But most of all: + CDPR created a living world worth exploring every last corner + with an immersive atmosphere + an interesting story + meaningful (no 'pick 10 flowers' or 'kill 5 Bears') and adult sidequests. + different outcomes and endings based on your decisions (decisions you might even have made in the first couple of hours)  CONS: Well not much here - and some are not even real arguments. - You need to get used to playing a premade character: Gerald of Rivia - so no character creation or individual look. - Also development of your character skill wise only plays a minor role. - Most of the time you are on your own - so no party or companions.  MISC: * Playing on max details, I5-2400, GTX780, 8GB RAM, 1080p * Playtime: without sidequests approx. 30 to 40h. With doing all sidequests and exploring the land &gt;130h.  VERDICT: I played so many RPG's over the last 30 years, I lost count. But today a fully voiced game is mandatory for me because I'm simply tired of reading quest texts. So for me Witcher 3 is the best RPG since Dragon Age: Origins - and it's even better. It is one of the very very few games I'd say 50 € are well spend and CD Project Red deserves every cent of it. 9/10  Tip: * Install the game on an SSD because loading times (when you died - so not ingame loading!) can be annoying. * Consider playing the game on a higher difficulty level right from the start.",

            "review_text": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was an incredible journey. I played this with no prior knowledge of any of the Witcher lore what so ever, but that did not matter because CDProjektRed did a good job of welcoming newcomers to the game by making Geralt (the main character you play) recovering his memory, I suppose he lost his memory in previous games. So if you have not played the other Witcher games, do not let that stop you from picking up this incredible game. Graphics are impressive despite a graphics downgrade from previous showings. Character models for characters are very detailed in voice acting and animations, a little thing I noticed however were that some character models were re-used throughout the game at varied points, which is not a huge deal, but lessens the ammount of immersion and authenticity of the world around you. A problem I personally come across in other RPG's is that I do the main quest and pretty much ignore everything else, unless it presents itself to me. That is probably one of the best things that this game does very well. Side quests are shown and placed very strategically so that it feels natural to the player. You will be on your way to a quest/location, when suddenly you will see an exclamation point on your mini-map showing a side quest available. This makes the players feel as if they naturally stumbled across this side quest on their own, and deepens the immersion by making it feel like a living breathing world. Everywhere you go there are side quests like this available, which are all optional, but at the same time are so satisfying if you decide to follow through with them. Most if not all feel as if they are apart of the main quest. It feels like you are Geralt, and you are just doing your job and helping or not helping people in the world that surrounds you. I did every single side quest that was available to me, and I do not regret it at all. I do praise the developers for making that happen, and I wish to see other games try and incorporate this as well. Combat in the Witcher 3 is fairly simple, you have your fast attack, heavy attack, parry, dodge, and roll. These are the basic combat elements, which play very well. There are also other ways to play for advanced players, such as applying different oils and potions for specific enemy types which will cause more damage. You also have Witcher signs which are basically magic spells. The combat dips a little bit here, because in my playthrough, the only sign I used was Quen, which basically gives you a 1 hit shield from enemies. I played on the second hardest diffuculty which was challenging but satisfying. I never felt like I was being cheated whenever I died. The story in this game is simple as well, you are looking for a girl named Ciri, whom you raised and tough how to fight as a child and the antagonist named Eredin wants to use her powers to bring what is essentially the apocalypse. Yeah Ciri is OP as hell. She has elder blood in her which makes her ridiculously powerful. That is the main goal, but the Witcher 3 shines in the journey towards that. You meet a vast and interesting set of characters along the way. The characters in this game really make this game stand out from others in it's genre. When you talk to other characters in the game it consists of a list of dialogue options. Yellow dialogue means that you will progress and get on with the story while white dialogue options give you more insight and background information which really help flesh the game out and make you essentially care and deeply invest into the games characters. I constantly found myself picking all of the white dialogue to find out more before continuing on with the conversation. Choice is another essential part of this game, your choices have immediate impact and effects the final conclusion to the game as well. You can even play out the choices you make with the love interests in the game. I found myself struggling with which love interest to pick from before deciding on one. The Witcher 3 does many things right, but it is not a perfect game. There are quite a few of bugs that I encountered on my playthrough. It varied from hair dissapearing from characters to constant pop-ins every time the camera angle cut between dialogue. I once found a man doing the 'Reject' a dance move while carrying some boxes. Those bugs were kind of annoying and broke the illusion of the world. Some game breaking ones however were when I had to get on a boat for a quest but had previously parked another boat there before hand which cause the two boats to glitch out on each other, which forced me to have to re-load one of my previous saves. Luckily the auto save feature is pretty good and keeping checkpoints so I did not lose too much progress. At the conclusion of the game I clocked in at around 94 hours. All in all, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was amazing. Simple as that. Like I said before the game is not perfect. However, everything that the game does right makes up for it and even more in my opinion. The game is beautiful to look at, the story is interesting, combat is generally fun and challenging at the same time. The enemy types have tons of variation. I found myself get choked up at least 3 times in the game. This game has an incredible amount of value, and it is quality as well. It does not compromise one for the other. It was a time investment, but one that I do not regret. I have even bought The Witcher 1 and 2 because I wanted more Witcher (You do not have to do this however). It was an incredible journey, one that I will remember and that will stay with me. I can honesly say that this is the best RPG I have ever played. I am now curious to see what developer CDProjektRed is planning next.",

            "review_text": "The Witcher 3 is one of those rare jewels that you only find once or twice every decade. It is masterfully crafted with the audience in mind by CD Projekt Red, a once-a-time small team. Their only games up to now are the Witcher series, but that will change soon. And you can easily see the love they put into it, from the beginning until the end of production.  First off, this game is beautiful. Moments like the splatter of raindrops on puddlesin the giant city of Novigrad, to the wind sweeping through the forsts of Velen will create beautiful screenshots, and the optimization is perfect. One of the best looking game for the amount of land there is to explore.  Combat is straight-forward : strong attack and light attack. There are 5 signs you can use as magic and variants to all of these. Since this is quite simple, The Witcher 3 compensates with a smart AI that is different for every creature in the world. Each has resistances and weaknesses, both in the damage and their patterns.   Story-wise, the main story is only 5 to 10% of the entire story. The side quests create a living world, full of colors, wether they be dark and need mosters ridden or colorful in masquerade balls. Oddly, up to now, my favorite quest has been a treasure hunt because of the lore and background they gave to it from books found near the objectives.  On the note of sound, kudos to the designers. The soundtrack is perfect for the setting and the moment, with a fluidity between all of the songs. The bustling Novigrad streets sound like streets, and I once had to remove my headphones because I heard birds and thought i forgot to close my window. It was still closed.   TL ; DR : Amazing. Witcher 1 and 2 are sitting in my library, with about 2 hours each. They never caught me, partly because of some inaccuracies to the books, which I have read. Witcher 3 retells these stories and speaks of the impact that transpired from these events so wonderfully, it is making me wonder if the author did not write the stories of the game. It is fastly climbing the ranks of my most hours played on steam ; il a week, I added 40 hours to it besides my full-time job. That is something I have not exerienced for a while.   Now, the wait for Cyberpunk 2077 shall start, but in the meantime, I probably can add at least 300 hours to this.",

This is a VERY good thing, and I thank CD PROJEKT RED for allowing me this experience, seamless and engaging.  It has bugs of course, and the occasional amusing glitch (once I witnessed an entire town of people gliding around posing as strawmen) but the developer is actively and expeditiously patching the game, but I would expect no less from this most excellent company.

            "review_text": "44 hours in, and I've done what seems to be a quarter, perhaps less, of this game. If that doesn't tell you the sheer scale, I don't know what will.   Firstly,  Graphics . Probably the least important feature for me, but the way the Witcher uses them is amazing. This game uses it's second to none graphics to create moments of jaw-dropping awe at the wonderful and amazing world in front of you (Seriously, I sometimes had to put down the controls and just watch the scenery in silence).  Secondly,  Story . I haven't actually finished this, but so far it seems intuitive and well told, which I would expect from a game based off a book. The game has a great way of unfolding the story to you in discrete ways, such as through world design and general attitude of people toward your character, and other people. Right from the get go, you know Witchers are hated and shunned as freaks, monsters and discriminated against big time. But this isn't just told to you in dialogue, you witness it first hand. It really makes you form your own opinions on things, instead of just being given the truth on a silver platter. Also, I'll incorporate side quests in here, since each one has a detailed, engaging story, which can span many hours of gameplay. Twists, interesting characters and unique, fun objectives. There are no kill quests, AT ALL in this game. Each quest has it's own unique structure and objective set, which makes them more of an enjoyment than a chore. Masterfully done.  Thirdly, the  Sounds . What to say here? The ambient sounds are very good. Not the absolute best I've heard, but honestly I don't think very present ambience would suit this game. It suits your current environment, and thats fine by me. But then... Music. The soundtracks of the Witcher are AMAZING. From fast-paced chanting to soft, calming mumming, the music does an amazing job of getting your attention and keeping it. Combat music really gets you focussed and into the mood, which is just masterful.  Fourthly,  Dialogue/Voice Acting : Dialogue is superb. Dry-wit lines from Geralt mixed with creative lines creates a wonderful experience. The things you say in conversation are often neither good nor evil, but a mark in between. Characters speak like they would; you won't see a commoner going around using words such as 'Grandeur'. The English is very good in the lines, much better than previous games, which makes me happy. Often times in previous games, lines would get lost in translation slightly due to CDPR being a Polish studio, but somehow they fixed this. Voice acting is amazing. You will rarely hear the same voice in two characters (Very rarely), unless it's passing commoners, but in both cases, repeated voices are far enough apart to not break immersion. You won't talk to the tavernkeep, then go down the road and talk to his mate the Blacksmith and hear the same person.  Fifthly, the  UI/Controls : Nothing to complain about here. The UI is very flexible, allowing you to turn off certain elements. It's all structured in a way so information is easy to access, but not overcoming. You'll only ever see things you need to see. Controls are nothing too amazing, but nothing too shabby. I use a wired Xbox controller with games like this (3rd person sword fighting games which use X/Y/B/A in combat), so I can't attest for the PC controls, but I have heard they are fully customizable. I never experienced any input lag, and Geralt always did what I wanted him to do, except on rare occasion, but honestly it was often times my own fault  Finally, the  Combat . A masterpiece. It is perfectly paced. Slow enough to keep it suspenseful, fast enough to keep you on your toes. There is a real need to combine several different aspects of combat i.e you can't just spam attack creatures or enemies, you have to dodge, get behind them, block, prioritize enemies, use signs, etc. Every creature feels different, and must be fought in a different way. For example, when fighting a Bear, you must wait for their slow attacks to finish, and use Quen sign all the time as a safety net, then go in for quick pot shots, where as with wolves, which hunt in packs, you must constantly be moving and using signs such as Aard and Igni so they don't group up and slaughter you. This means you develop personal styles as you play the game, which is what a Witcher is about: adapting to the fight. Also, I'd recommend Death March, as it really enforces the need to prepare for fights, which is half the game, and makes it all that more rewarding.   Final Conlusion",

The side quests are subtle, well-designed, and provides interesting back/side story to the game.   The gameplay is smooth, the hack n'slash is not as easy as it sounds as it requires a bit of item strategy and timing. So you won't get bored easily with enemy encounter.   The audio is superb. I love the musics and the background sounds really fit into the game's world. Really love those thunders and winds noises when a storm is approaching. Make the game feels alive.

While I did not yet complete the game I can already say that this is by far the best game I have played in a while (atleast for RPGs). The world is incredible, it is massive and very beautiful and the weather effects and physics make it really feel alive, it feels like you really are in a forest or city. And all the little villages you ride through during the game is just lovely. I was struggling a little in the beginning with the combat system on the other hand, it felt a little clunky but it is just something you have to get used to, it is in every way an improvement on previous Witcher games.

Now with the combat - it's not bad in any sense of the word, it's just not perfect and you cant say that about any game really. But it's honestly not the game's strongest aspect - though it never feels repetitive, it just is there to hold your attention so you can get to the next part of the story or side-mission.  And honestly those are my only two criticisms of the game other than the fact you can sometimes fail quests when you start others since they might conflict with the grand-scheme of the story-telling, though those moments happen rarely and only during crucial parts of the story. You could always reload just before starting the new quest and quickly complete the old ones before they fail. I did that almost every chance I got and they were always worth it.   All in all I'd give this game a perfect 10/10.  Though it's not completely perfect - it comes extremely close to achieving perfection. Best game I've played all year so far.",

All I can say is that the 200 hours of my life that I lost in this series of video games were COMPLETELY worth it, and that the Witcher 3 is perhaps the best game I've ever played.   This game is somehow able to combine all the great elements of a linear, story driven game: choices, different endings, compelling characters, and a complex plot, with the immersion and exploration of an open world game. Every side quest you come across is interesting and has its own well-written plot and characters where your actions often influence the quest's outcome. In one quest you will be investigating a murder, while in another you will be hunting a legendary monster found deep in the forest. As for the main quest, where do I even begin? Combining both the personal life and challenges of the main character, the war-torn political atmosphere, and a prophesized apocalypse, this is a story worthy of any good book. The atmosphere in this game is incredible. From the cozy mountain fortress of Kaer Morhen, to the swamps, castles, battlefields, and villages of Velen, and the rocky, monster-infested, norse-themed Skellige Islands, the environment in this game is brilliant. The city of Novigrad, especially, feels very real, with a high-class of priests, two kingdoms, and a criminal underwold each competing for control of the prosperous merchant city.  A game, however, isn't only about its story and atmosphere. The combat is complex, yet fun and challenging. You utlize both strong and fast attacks with your two swords: steel for humans and silver for monsters. In addition, you can oil your swords with poisons that affect certain enemies, brew potions to boost your own stats, craft bombs with various effects, and use magic spells to manipulate the battlefield. All of this in addition to a complex skill system involving trophies taken from slain monsters, and the vast variety of weapons and armor in this game, and the combat in this game is definately a major strenght.  Finally, the game's developers need to be complimented, having released 16 free minor dlcs (such as new armor, weapons, and quests), in addition to two expansion packs that will together have over 30 hours.   Ultimately, this game is a MUST OWN, and is a testament to how a developer with a relatively low budget (compared to other AAA games) was able to create possibly the best story and world of all time in a Western RPG.",

            "review_text": "I've been sucked into the Witcher world since The Witcher 1 (also read the books). So I came into the Witcher 3 with a huge amount of hype and expectations. Having finally 'completed' one run through of it (DLCs included), I can say that Witcher 3 is definitely the best RPG game I've played in this decade. CDPR has set a high bar for all other RPGs to aspire to (and sadly, I fear that it might have ruined other RPGs for me in this lifetime).   Graphics: As everyone can see from the crazy amount of screenshots out there, Witcher 3 is a beautiful game. I could potentially just stand there for hours, soaking in the digital rays. More gripping is the fact that each country in the game is so different from one another, making you feel that you're truly in another place.  Combat: I play on the M+KB (I'm no good with controllers). It definitely feels less clunky than the Witcher 2. While they haven't revolutionized everything, it's comfortable and engaging and that's enough for me.  The story: The books have always had an amazing storyline, and for Witcher 3 to dip its toes into it more and write a true sequel to the books excited me but scared me beyond measures. They did not disappoint, they helped find explanations and closures and twists and excitement.   The writing: A lot of the fun tidbits in game is through the books and notes you pick up. DO read them, they are so fun to read and often hilarious or heart-jerking.  Voice acting: Doug Cockle once again delivers, bringing Geralt to life. All other voice actors did a great job as well (e.g. Denise Gough brought out the ♥♥♥♥♥iness in Yennefer quite well)  Soundtrack: I often turn off the music in the back ground for RPGs this long because I'd rather listen to my own music after a while, but not for this game. It ties everything together and helps immerse you into the game, its world, its lore.  I think it's time for me to play through the game once more.",

            "review_text": "I'm a tough game critic, I'm the first to point out flaws in a game that the general population may find 'amazing'.  That is not the case here. My first hour into the game, I had no negativity, none at all, I was immersed into the story, enjoying the gritty combat (severing of heads and limbs), and laughing uncontrollably at literally almost all of the dialogue. I actually felt the need to take some time away from the game just to write a review on it.  Let's start with the basics, the graphics and scenery are out of this world. Setting the time to sunset near a lake, you'll actually feel like you're 'there', it looks the closest to reality that I've seen to date. (the ambiance such as deer, grass and trees swaying in the rain/wind, and even blades of grass swaying in the wind, really come together to create an amazing environment).   Secondly, it takes the importance of decision-making to an ENTIRELY new level, the importance of your decisions in games such as Fable or Fallout PALE in comparison to how much they matter in The Witcher 3. When a game gives me the option to end a cute/romantic date with the choice of either bidding the woman a bittersweet farewell, or slashing and incinerating her on an island....I'm at a loss for words at how awesome that is.   Also, I can't stress enough how important and influential your dialogue decisions are, they make a huge difference. You can either charm your way out of what would've been an unfair fight, or you can just say '**** it' and taunt your adversaries into a relaxing bath of blood and fire.   The storyline is very well written, and was put together in a manner that shows the developers actually cared about the outcome of the game, and the satisfaction of their consumers. My particular favorite example is the quest 'Family Matters' (From beginning, to end), I hadn't been that immersed in a side-story that much since I used to watch Law&amp;Order in 2001.   I'm also enjoying the realism of the development of romantic relationships, or how that possibility can be revoked as a result of one single mistake/error in dialogue/task refusal (As is such....in reality...).   In short, all I can say is, just buy the game, and the Season Pass, if you can spring for it. You won't regret it. If you're a fan of gore/dismemberment/gritty combat, you'll love it, you can spend hours just wandering around slaughtering wolves, people, monsters, harpies, etc. If you love gripping storylines, then you'll definitely enjoy this one. If you like romantic stories, definitely go for this one, plenty of that. If you like sex....do I really need to explain this one? It's the Witcher series...and they've outdone themselves x100 in this installment.   Just buy the game, you definitely won't regret it, no matter how picky of a gamer you are.  Ultra settings + Nvidia Hair= ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the eyes.  Oh, and...HIS BEARD GROWS IN REAL TIME.....I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. THAT IS JUST PLAIN AWESOME. ",

I am 50 hours in and have not even finished the main quest, and I admit that the side quests and contracts are so intriguing that I find myself doing all of them. The game has just so much content it's hard to actually explain it, honestly I am astounded at how many quests there are, things to do, and how the game has a backstory to each character and town which make me actually care about its inhabitants. Leveling, combat, and all other game mechanics are great, although there are some glitches which are purely aesthetic and do not interrupt gameplay. I can't wait to beat the story and pick up the two DLCs for the game which provide another 20+ hours each! Do yourself a favor and buy this game, you won't regret it.",

Really, the quests in this game have so much quality in them that they rival the main story line. Gwent have been one of my favourite time killers, I really enjoyed completing all the quests and collecting most of the possible cards. The sad part is that when you start a new game (on increased difficulty for funzies) the deck won't carry over.   Combat: At first, I found combat frustrating given the amount of possible actions you need to memorize for each type of enemy (and there is quite a few of them) but after some time and leveling some signs (Igni and Quen op. Quen is not so op as in Witcher 2 but it's still a great sign). I was quite pleased at the synergy some signs have with witcher bombs, for example Dragon's Dream which fills an area with explosive gas which can be detonated with Igni.  Alchemy: I really like the addition of oils in witcher 3, there are so many types that force you to discover areas and merchants with the right recipe, they also require you to have a certain degree of knowledge as to which monster falls under which category (and making the beastiary more than just a lore addition).  The famous witchers' Elixirs were given quite a change, for those who played Witcher 1, you can use them during combat again! YAY! But they are quite harder to make now. Many times you need to search for their recipes in various places (most of them are avaible in stores however some eluded me), and some ingridients require you to seek help of a craftsman who can dismantle your current ingridients into more basic ones.  Armors &amp; Weapons: Lots, Lots &amp; Lots more weapons &amp; armors! However when it comes to finding the right craftsmen it takes a bit of time and exploration. Which is not actually a bad point, since the game tries its best to emulate a witchers journey, through which he has to search for his prey, resources, and craftsmen.   Overall 10/10 the game was really worth the money!",

Pros:    Massive world to explore    Outstanding voice work and dialogue    Almost every quest is interesting and doesn't fall into MMO tropes like fetch quests    Interesting cast of characters, including rich character depth    Visually stunning, especially if you can run Ultra + Hairworks (which is no easy task though), even with the slight downgrade after E3 2014    THE FEELS. OH GOD THE FEELS. If you don't tear up a bit at end of Isle of Mists, you have no soul.   Cons:    Enemy and horse AI can be sketchy sometimes    Still a few bugged locations that can get you stuck    Easy and normal difficulties are too easy    Handful of progression bugs (none gamebreaking though)    Will bend almost any computer over and make it it's ♥♥♥♥♥    A few minor annoyances that still need fixing (like losing Decoctions during vital battles)    Flat out awful keyboard + mouse controls. Very clearly designed with controller in mind.  And this is completely ignoring the giant minigame that is Gwent. A quite enjoyable card game once you get the grasp of it, though can be a little lacking in balance as there is rarely a reason to include weaker units unlike games such as Hearthstone.   Final Thoughts:  I'm amazed at what CD Projekt Red have accomplished here. They set the bar really goddam high for other western RPGs. Not only did they make almost all quests feel interesting in fresh, the sheer amount of content is kinda staggering. If you have any interest in WRPGs, what are you waiting for?",

            "review_text": "  Pros:    Story: Wow. This game has an immense, immersive…I need another “I” word…INCREDIBLE story to it. Almost all of the quests have a depth behind them. It can be little crap things that lead right into a huge line that you would have never even known existed if you hadn’t talked to that little village person (there’s no giant exclamation mark above the heads of people). I stumbled upon many of them just wandering around the world. It’s…crazy. I’ve been humbled and taken back by how awesome it is. I’m not even talking about the main story, which in itself is pretty legit. No, enthralling. It’s storytelling at it’s best and honestly, all games in this category need to step it up if they want to compete with future witcher games.  The sheer amount of armor, weapons and items is staggering. You can upgrade a ton of things including your horse! There are so many designs to find and craft (treasure hunting) that you’ll be drawn into that aspect just to find them all. Things to do: You will get caught up in so many things you won’t know what to do with your time in game. It’s encompassing. Side quests will pop up everywhere from you running around while you’re just exploring or while you’re already on a quest or checking out the local board in a town, ect. Witcher contracts, horse races and treasure hunts, oh my!  Gwent! – This is a side game, but really it should be a stand-alone game. It’s in-depth and I found myself wanting to challenge anyone and everyone that I could to a couple rounds of Gwent just to win a card that I didn’t have.  Funny lines batman! The devs included references from media culture in the game. For one, I dare you to find all the Pulp Fiction quotes.  The world is crazy big and there is so much to explore. If you’re like me, you’ll love to just venture around and check things out on your map that might look like something interesting even if they have nothing to do with a current quest. The environment is fantastic to look at! It really shows with whatever atmosphere you’re in too. It might be in a pitch black cave or on the top of sprawling snow capped mountains. It all looks beautiful! No matter what you heard about dumb downed graphics (because of the console versions), the pc version is awesome.     Cons:    No matter what graphic setting you put the game on I still can’t get out of the game unless I ctrl + alt + delete. Alt + tab does nothing. I have two monitors, so that might have something to do with it? I’ve tried all the settings (yes, even windowed mode) and I still can’t get it to leave the screen without pressing those said keys.  Combat is just…well, it could use some work. It’s sad to say since it’s a main part of the game. There’s only a handful of things that you can do. You have your fast and your strong attack with your swords. Those each have a combo. Then if you “spec” into a certain skill tree you can have a special attack with the fast attack and/or strong attack. That’s it as far as the swords.  Magic skills seem to lose the value of what being a witcher is supposed to mean. They don’t seem to do enough vs. what your swords can do.  Counter attacking needs some help. If you have multiple enemies attacking you, just roll out of the way, If you don’t, you just get hit. It has no assassin’s creed combat value where it actually knows that multiple people are attacking you.  There needs to be more skill slots. That or they need to change the amount of points you get. You’ll end up just putting points in a tree and just going with that. There’s no hybrid builds really.  The game is riddled with bugs. From quests to talking to people to just trying to look at a loot items, you might stumble upon a bug or you might not at all. Don’t get me wrong, these are not game breaking bugs, but they can be very annoying. I can go into detail if you need.  No bug fixing by the devs? There was an update 9 days ago from this posting, so it seems they are doing something… This could just be me since most of the bugs that I’ve experienced haven’t been fixed yet.    Conclussion:    I could probably talk more about various things, but this pretty much sums it up. The game is definitely worth it’s weight in gold. Even if you haven’t played any of the other Witcher games, you’re sure to love this one!",

And I loved it, and loved the characters I met. Reading up about how Geralt has interacted with them in the past games/books made me love them even more. The DLCs are also full-game scale alone. Hearts of Stone is roughly longer than the BF4 campaign in terms of time to complete, and Blood and Wine blows that out of the water, giving a storyline that's literally a full game by itself, with the inclusion of an entire new worldspace that has beautiful design, and more interesting characters. The only downsides to the game that I could say is that the fall-damage is messed up, but there's a mod to fix that, and that your horse has a propensity to get stuck on walls and obstacles (In a great sidequest in Blood and Wine this is even referenced in a tongue-in-cheek way). Aside from this, this game is deserving of all of the critical acclaim it's receiving, and more.  Do yourself a favour, buy this game if you haven't already.",

The Witcher III is an RPG of gigantic proportions, with almost endless content spread throughout a massive and frankly stunning looking world. The starting area at the time felt huge, but it's a microscopic portion of the game, when all is said and done you can easily spend 150 hours in the game if you want to complete everything. Every part of the world is filled with life, be it people or wildlife, and the scenery is truly breathtaking, I often found myself just sitting back in awe of just how good the game looks. The world feels so alive, and this is helped by some truly fantastic voice acting and story telling, riding through a town you will here countless little conversations organically playing out around you, and decisions you make will change the course of the game, so pick wisely!  So the game has top notch visuals and audio, unmatched story telling and all the content you could ever want, so what's wrong with it? Well, not much really, in fact the only negative is the movement system, especially on horseback. It's so bad I feel knocking off a point is justified as you spend a lot of time on horseback especially which is by far the worst offender when it comes to movement, as well as AI (Roach will often spawn nowhere near you, on the other side of a wall or just refuse to move at all until you manually mount him). Geralt's movement has been improved since launch with an alternative movement option, and I suggest you use it.  I should also mention the game within a game, Gwent. It's a card game that you can play against NPCs throughout the game, think similar to Hearthstone. It's very easy to pick up but quite hard to master, you will need to use sound strategy to beat the harder opponents. You can get lost Gwent easily if you're not careful, it's very addictive.  To sum up, The Witcher III is up there with the best games of all time, and it's an absolute must buy for anyone who enjoys the RPG genre as it's as close to perfection as possible and you will love every minute of it.",

For a game of this scale that's definitely worth some respect for the devs.  Not only does the game play beautifully, it also looks spectacular - even on a mid-range PC like mine is.   There's literally dozens of settings you can tweak in the game menu, and I recommend checkig them out. Especially if you're like me and don't want the HUD cluttering the entire screen. ;)  The only sort of negative thing I can say about The Witcher 3 is that it's bound to take up all your spare time (and then some). :)  Needless to say I heartily recommend this game! Easily worth its price - would be even without the free DLC you can download.  With Hearts of Stone released and Blood &amp; WIne coming on the 31st you'll have dozens upon dozens of hours of exploring to do. :D",

Well worth the full price, plus the expansion pack.  Think of it as an interactive epic novel series, where you can do anything you want in that world. The amount of dialogues and stories may be overwhelming at first, but it will be worth every second as each quest will leave a mark in your heart and mind. It is a rare game that show who you are as a person, as every choices, every decisions you make will be reflected onto the main character, as well as the stories and NPCs that surrounds you.  Combat can be played differently from button mashing to careful executions of skills such as Fast Attacks, Strong Attacks, Dodging, Magic Signs, Potions and Oils, and it is up to you if you want to go all at once, or do it one at a time as if you were dancing with your opponents.  The Witcher Series has left me in awe inspriation, and only dissapointment I have is that this will be the last of the game series. However, It will be a series that will leave me inspired for the rest of my life.",

Like the former witcher games this games is set in a very dark version of fantasy than many of it's competitors, there never seems to be a right choice only a lesser evil, sometimes you finally think that you have done everything correct and all will end up good, and that is when you realize you have been betrayed. damn why am i even writting this review when i can play the game instead!",

The story is incredible, along with the characters. It has by far some of the best writing in an RPG I've ever seen and despite having a massive wealth of content to explore (a lot of my hours were spent wandering the countryside or sailing in Skellige) none of it ever feels half-♥♥♥♥♥. It takes everything that was solid about the first two Witcher games and expands and improves on it. It also is not a bad place to jump into the series, since the plot is mostly self contained, with stuff from the previous games being mostly references and in-jokes. Another big positive is that many of many negatives that I was going to bring up have been fixed recently with the current patch, making the inventory and general movement (running/riding/swimming) far superior to how they were at launch. It's clear CD Projekt Red is dedicated to listening to feedback and making improvements.   The only negatives I can list now are the aforementioned performance problems. The game crashed probably 10-15 times in my entire run-through to desktop, sort of freezing in the background. Audio would continue, but if I tried to get back into the game, the process would end. There was a point a couple of weeks back, as well, where I would crash this way every single time I reached a certain point in the main storyline, barring my progress, though a patch fixed that issue. More recently, in the final stretch of the game, I had two HARD PC crashes which forced a reboot. I fixed this by fiddling with some Windows settings (based on a huge thread I read about ths issue) and managed to finish the game no problem. Regardless, when the game doesn't crash, it runs incredibly solidly framerate-wise on my 970 on maximum settings. I just need to note the crashing because I'm not the only one it affected.   All in all, this game is probably gonna be sitting on a list of my favorite games to come out this year. It was a hell of a ride.",

To put words to the beauty within this work of art is nigh impossible but I will give it a go anyway.  The Witcher 3 is the last leg in the story of our very near and dear White Wolf. The realm is in utter chaos. War is no more in the distance. It is the way of life for the common folk. Amidst this chaos our hero must risk all to fulfill his fate which is forever intertwined with that of his long lost love. You can guess who that is.  An open world which challenges the likes of Skyrim and Dragon Age Inquisition but having the flaws of neither. One of the most pleasant surprises was once you know a potion you don't have to keep brewing it again and again and again. It had become tedious and annoying in Dragon Age Inquisition but it is not so with Witcher 3.   The UI is quite superior to Witcher 3 and very interconnected and fluid. Shortcuts for EVERYTHING which is brilliant!  The gameplay is just fantastic! The running around and fighting has not changed much but the subtle platforming built into the game makes it so much more believable and fun! And Geralt can jump! Woohoo! No more 'Press E to climb'.  The animations are well done. Every subtle detail has been paid so much attention. CD Projekt Red ARE a bunch of perfectionists!  And the GRAPHICS...Oh My God! When it's dusk in-game...all i want to do is walk into the sunlight wafting through the tree leaves!! And thts just the tip of the iceberg!  The story is something filmmakers could learn from but having said that the game is based on the books so there's that.  Overall, the devs have outdone themselves! My only trepidation is that this is the end of the trilogy :( although i have yet to even get 1/4th thru the game after having played nearly 20 hours.

As I am not meeting the minimal requirements I had to play on lowest graphics, low resolution and with 20 FPS (It was sometimes lagging a bit but it's only because of my PC) and still the game was just beautiful. The gameplay itself may not be ideal but It's still great. Ofc there are some annoying bugs but only few. About the story, it's sometimes intresting, sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic, everyone can find something for himself. Anyways let's talk about minuses of the game. First one and the most annoying for me, game itself is designed for consoles. You can play with keyboard and a mouse without bigger problems but while riding a horse, dodgeing or even attacking you'll feel that it's most comfortable to use a controler. There was only one bug that forced me to reload the save and It was an enemy stuck in the wall.  Now the final verdict is: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is close to be a master piece, it has wonderful graphics, intresting story, great humor implemented and very good combat system. I would surely reccommend you to buy the game, complete the story, start the new game + what is a great free DLC btw. and focus on exploring, side quests and leave the great main story for the end.  P.S Remmember that you can export saves from both Witcher 2 and 1 what will slightly change the story (depends on your choices) and is a great addition :)",

In group fights you can plan out your swings and rolls properly, along with sign spells to give some strategic results. From I have seen so far decisions from the previous Witcher games have impacted my now current story. The facial animations, voice acting and writing are great and I am always amused to meet new characters. The graphics look great and I often just stop riding around to look at the landscape.

            "review_text": "It’s a good game. You should play it.  All right, I can talk a bit more about it than that.   I’ve played 160 hours of it as the time of this writing and completed the main quest, all sidequests, and Hearts of Stone. I’m a late comer when comes to the Witcher series, only really pushing myself to explore the games this year (2016) starting with the first one, then second and finally Witcher 3.  I see why so many give this game such high praise. It looks beautiful, plays amazingly well, a moving soundtrack, and a story that builds in epicness as you continue on. It’s a special high note coming right off the previous games where I was familiar with the already present characters and the world and how it all comes together here.  In case you can’t tell, you play as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher. You serve the role as a monster slayer for hire utilizing your various skills of combat, alchemy, and investigation. Thankfully there is more to it than just running around hacking at opponents as in some games. Being careless in this game will just make things harder and result in death. The game rewards you for acting smart and investing the time to being prepared and knowing your opponent, whether beast or man. This keeps the gameplay engaging and prevents the staleness of repetitive boring quests. Find the right info and you can effect the outcome of many a contract in the game, for better or worse.  Combat wise, the Witcher 3 feels like a tweaked version of what was implemented in the Witcher 2. It’s still action RPG, but the combat has been smoothed out a bit to reflect the open world nature. Combat will be a mixture of fast/strong attacks with parry/counters and dodging/rolls. Gone are the unnecessary prep times for potions and oils as you can just use/apply them when needed and just focus on the combat at hand. Throwing knives have been removed, but now replaced with a crossbow weapon. You still have a plethora of bombs and I find them much useful now than in the previous game.  Speaking of open world, it is, but not quite like Skyrim or Fallout. Instead you have open world “regions” spanning the world of the Witcher. You’ll spend most of the game in the Velen/Novigrad area which is the largest, but other areas such as Skellige, Kaer Morhen, White Orchid, and Toussaint (Blood and Wine DLC) will still provide a huge amount of time exploring. All in all, it’s a lot of land area (and sea) to explore and it’s all filled with things to discover (ala like the map in GTA V). Thankfully you have a horse for quicker land travel and can use boats for water travel. Oh, and you can fast travel, but only between set, discovered markers.  Like many open world games, there are… distractions. From horse racing, fist fighting, crafting, romance quests to ever popular Gwent. Gwent is vastly superior to the (IMO) broken dice poker from the previous games and I’m so happy CDPR replaced it with this. Fist fighting is back as usual, but it’s changed up to be more combat like. I guess it was too easy before, but now it feels too hard and gets ridiculously difficult towards the end of the fighting quests.   Besides that, the graphics of this game look phenomenal. This is a game worth investing in a good GPU for. Just look at any screen grabs to get an idea of this game. Yes, it’s that good, and for those who run this game at 4K on a large monitor, consider me envious. The game is filled to the brim with cutscenes, hope you like that, but only a few are pre-rendered (You can usually tell which ones).   Sound quality is again excellent. I praised the Witcher 2 for its excellent use of surround effects and the same holds true for the Witcher 3. SFX and voices are varied and distinct and have direction. Voice acting is pretty good for the most part, but admittedly at times I do get a bit bored of hearing British accents constantly. The music for the game is very well done and fitting. It just works. I especially liked the BGM of Skellige while exploring.   Game sounds perfect doesn’t it? Well… No game is perfect.  As with any huge open world game, there are some bugs and glitches here and there and I came across my share while playing. Ranging from minor graphical/animation bugs which were quite amusing to a couple game-breaking ones (One of which I lost about 2 hours of progress to). Sudden game crashes started to become more common once I got beyond the 100-hour mark, often times in the middle of cutscenes. The horse, Roach has a tendency to stall out on bridges, much to my annoyance during races. The in-game option of enemy up-scaling (while an excellent idea) will glitch out certain quests making them impossible to complete (of course you can just turn it off, but I feel like these issues should have been caught by CDPR in play testing).  On a negative, I would say I’m not a fan of the randomized leveled loot system in the Witcher 3. 90% of the time you will find equipment that is either inferior (because you can often craft things much better) or find a random crafting diagram for something you can make but can’t use (since you can only equip items equal to or less than your level). It’s system that doesn’t make much sense to me as most of things you will find are not useful or appropriate to your level. If only that “up-scaling” system was applied to equipment finds, hmm. As result, much of the early game feels RNG dependent on whether you will find good, usable gear and crafting recipes. The latter portions of the game don’t suffer from this so much. Some better consistency on this would have been nice.  So what do I give this at the end of it all?  9/10   This is pretty close to perfection here. Ignoring and forgiving some glitches, there were some gameplay elements I didn’t care for, but the story, graphics, sense of epicness and gameplay make this one the best RPG games ever made. CDPR has come a long way since the Witcher 1 and it’s been fascinating to see and experience the progression of this series. I look forward to what they have in the future.",

I'll start off by listing my PC specs  I5 3570k CPU GTX 660 TI 3GB 16GB Ram  So as you can see, my video card is the min requirement, though being the 3GB TI it has more juice then the recommended card for the game. That being said I run everything on Medium or better, and it holds 50 FPS throughout the game. Theres a minor degree of texture 'pop in' when in the largest of cities, but nothing unacceptable. Helps to have the proper graphics driver and installing the game on your SSD is recommended.   Combat: Feel its improved alot since Witcher 2, many of the annoying aspects of the 2nd game are gone in this case, virtually no complaints in this category. I feel i use potions/signs/bombs a lot more this time around instead of relying on the swords.  World: Lush and full, has great atmosphere and you buy the situation your in. Through out the land are various areas to explore and clear, these are kind of like little 'instances', but every few you run into something that stands out from the rest, giving it a memorable feel (where as in games like the Elderscrolls, alot of the areas you explore are cool but never really leave that lasting impression)  Horse: Your mount in this game controls better then virtually anything else I've played. Vastly superior to Dragons Age or Skyrim, it actually feels like your riding an animal for once. 10/10, would ride Roach again. Oh and theres mounted combat, which takes a bit of practice but is pretty enjoyable. *protip, use igni to dismount other riders and quick attack them while they are prone, Geralt will put his sword through them for a 1 hit kill :D  Story/Character: Story so far is interesting enough to keep you involved. Everything is voice acted, and done well. I like Geralts personality more this time around, some good changes.  All in all, postitive expirence so far, I've crashed 3 times in 18 hours, all 3 times were when accessing the inventory after playing for 3-4 hours straight, never lost any real progress due to the autosave.   Was a worthy preorder....and interestingly enough I was one of those folks that picked up Witcher 2 the un-legit way, and while i beat 75% of it and liked it, I never would of paid cash for it, but because of that expirence, I looked into Witcher 3, paid full price and have been enjoying it.

For me, once I got to Skellige (Which is about fifty hours in) I was burnt out on all the quests and stopped playing for a month or two, and just wanted to finish the game,. I'll give the game credit though, the main missions and side quests are interesting but after doing so many it gets just a wee bit tedious, especially when your in Skellige, the parts when your sailing in your boat for five minutes to do one quest on the other side of the isles is boring as heck.   But I'm listing mostly cons. Here are some pros about the game.   + Runs amazing on my system on almost all Ultra, system specs 8320 and a 270X +Lots of Content +Interesting characters +The world itself is beautiful +The music, oh the music! It's fantastic, the gwent music is my favorite, just whistling along is a blast. +Gwent! I'd bet at least four hours of my game time are just playing that card game! Want to get a couple decks in real life and play. It's that fun. +The game has lots of choices to make. +Story is complex, deep and interesting, I recommend once you beat the game read up the entire thing on the Witcher Wikia.   Guess I'll list some cons.  -Combat. This was one I debated whether it was a pro, or a con. It's alright but once you get to higher levels it really amounts to just smashing your way through ♥♥♥♥. -  Armor designs; I still haven't found an armor other than the one you start with that I actually like (Got a mod so the other witcher sets will use it's model.). Wolf armor came close. Witcher 2 had the best armor designs of the series, in my opinion.   A friend showed me what some of the armors look like after upgrading, some look pretty dope so this is taken off. -Roach. Oh my God, Roach. He is such a pain in the ♥♥♥ to control. He will randomly stop while your sprinting as though there is a fence or something in the way, turning is weird, hard to explain until you actually control him around. -Actually movement in general is kind of finicky.    Now, the story. I can't list it under pro or con. It's a good story, but feels somewhat cobbled together, Ciri drops in from nowhere no mention of her prior, same with Yen, but I think she was mentioned one time in Witcher 2 in one of those flashback scences with Geralt. Maybe it was done on purpose, but it confused me. I got lost lots of times in the story due to the game always throwing around new names, but Geralt knew who these people were. It feels as though I missed some piece of story.   Story is complex, and after reading up some, it is hella well done.  Now, before this game came out there was this huge controversy about the graphics. The game is still awesome-looking even if it doesn't have 4k Ultra HD textures, people! Very mis-placed arugument, and I've even heard of some people passing this game up purely for that! Crazy! Game still looks amazing.  To sum it up, The Witcher 3 is an amazing game, one of the best RPGs I've played even with all the gripes I have with it. The Witcher series has definitely earned its place on my mantle of favorite series. Good work, CD Projekt Red.",

            "review_text": "Finally, after several months, and nearly a hundred hours of gameplay, I’ve completed the main quest of the Witcher 3. This is an incredible Open World Role Playing Game that everyone should experience. People who see my steam library can see how hard it is for me to focus on a game and finish it since most games I’ve played only have 1-3 hours of playtime before I get bored/distracted, but Witcher 3 was a beautiful delight to play through.  And what a journey it’s been. This is one of the most memorable RPGs I’ve ever played. I enjoyed the Witcher 2’s intrigue heavy plot, and found Witcher 1’s gameplay much too obtuse for me to get into, but from what I’ve read, Witcher 3 marries both the gameplay refinements of the second game with the open world, epic nature of the first and polishes everything to a near perfect mirror sheen. CD Project Red has absolutely gone all out for this game. The effort that went into creating such a stunning world is prevalent throughout. It took 2.5 years and over 950 characters were voiced in the game total. The game’s presentation show off the most convincing European fantasy world I’ve ever seen virtually created, with lush hillsides, dark forests, snowy mountain tops all rendered in crisp fidelity. The impeccable audio design covers everything from subtle birds chirping, wind howling, and silent sobbing from villagers whose lives were utterly destroyed from the conflict the world takes place in. Great soundtrack too.   The game’s plot follows pretty directly from the first two games, but still does a decent job of easing new players into the experience. I still feel like you get a lot more out of the game if you at least play the previous ones, something I didn’t do only because Witcher 1 was so rough to try to enjoy. The setting and characters are based off of the works of Andrzej Sapkowski, whose writing creates a backdrop to the game but doesn’t have much to do with the events that take place. Hardcore fans say it is nearly essential to read the books, and I plan to eventually because of how much I love the setting. However, despite this, the game starts off with Geralt on a relatively simple quest. Find Yennefer, and through her, find Ciri. Throughout these main quests you’ll meet an assortment of deep, complex characters both old and new, so having played previous games/ reading the books will help you understand just what the hell is going on. Geralt is a well known character in the world as the Butcher of Blaviken, so most characters already know quite a bit about you. This is helpful to new players who want to learn more about the history of the world, but the amount of exposition and info dump is still overwhelming. Geralt is a character, so unlike Skyrim/ Fallout where you get more of a blank slate to work with, he is already actively partaking in the world, and will only react/ respond to situations in a way that stays in character. You’re not roleplaying as yourself, you’re roleplaying as Geralt. I see some negative reviews are upset that they are stuck with what they find a gruff, boring grey haired old man, but I really think that sticking to a pre-created character allows the writers to give him real depth and make his relationships with other characters feel real and meaningful. In Fallout you could help a village fend off a mutant attack, but instantly turn around, shoot every villager in the face and take all of their stuff. As enjoyable as this level of freedom is, it ends of feeling quite disjointed, creating a dissonance between gameplay and plot. This is avoided by letting you roleplay as Geralt instead of creating your own character.  Just because you’re playing as Geralt doesn’t mean you don’t have choices. The choices in the Witcher 3 are far reaching and impactful, more so than in any other Witcher game. Important characters can and will die, and decisions you make will impact entire cultures/ communities. It’s as if CD Project Red, seeing this is the last game, decided, “♥♥♥♥ it” and let decisions play out with terminal, and final consequences. There are many plot lines and stories buried in this game, but one of the few criticisms I have is that not everything is neatly resolved in the end. I understand that a hulking behemoth of storytelling of this size would find it impossible to tie up every loose end, and the game ends open-ended enough (depending on your ending) to make it feel things could still continue, but it would’ve been nice to have a few more definite resolutions. Regardless, I still found the Witcher 3’s storyline to be the most memorable aspect of its design. I don’t know how the developers manage to weave cinematic storytelling, deep conversations with NPCs, and quest design into a game that makes it feel as if everything truly mattered. I found myself doing quests on the side not for money/ experience, or anything other than to get the chance to meet a few more characters and make a few more decisions. It’s really incredible how well the side quests are designed.  The best quest design in the world wouldn’t mean anything if the game wasn’t enjoyable to play. The basic gameplay from the Witcher 2 of “dodge, dodge, attack, dodge” is still here, but refined to feel smoother and less frustrating. Geralt slowly strafes delicately around opponents now instead of running awkwardly, and has multiple forms of evasion that help you control his movements. The potion/ bomb making systems are streamlined, and as a result I found myself using them much, much more. In the Witcher 2 I almost never used any potions/ bombs, but since I always had them on hand in a battle I used every weapon at my disposal constantly. You’ll have to use everything you can to survive, especially near the beginning when everything can kill you very quickly. Dodging, striking, and throwing bombs/ using potions and oils are a staple of being a Witcher, and I finally feel as if I am playing as a professional monster slayer, truly a “Whirlwind of Rage and Steel.” The animations are also perfect as well, showing a graceful, swirling fighting style that perfect encapsulates what the books describe as a Witcher’s fighting style. Later on in the game, everything becomes a lot easier as both your abilities evolve and you, yourself get better at playing the game, but leveling throughout is an enjoyable experience. By the end, you’ll truly feel like the seasoned veteran Geralt is.  The characterization of Geralt is something to praise. For much of the game I found myself pitifully poor, a far cry from the multi millionaire I found myself to be in other RPGs. I could barely afford to buy ingredients for crafting/ potion creation or even repair my weapons. I grumbled as I lost all of fifty gold in a Gwent game. I found myself taking on monster contract after monster contract just to get some money in the bank. I realized later that this design was intentional, as Geralt is essentially some kind of a supernatural hobo monster slayer. I’m supposed to feel dirty and raggedy and poor, something that other characters remark on as well. This brings a real connection in the gameplay to the storyline, as I’m constantly in need of money, making my side excursions make sense. It always bugged me that in certain game storylines there is some horrible world ending event about to occur, the main character finds the time to do side quests when Armageddon is imminent. Geralt does the same thing here, but at least there’s context.   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a beautiful, expansive RPG with a deep storyline and satisfying gameplay. I’m sad to see this series come to an end, but I have yet to play through the Expansion content, which I am still itching to do. I’m beyond excited for CD Project Red’s Cyberpunk 2077, but for now, I’m so happy that this glorious series has such a great send off. The Witcher 3 is, for all intents and purposes, a must-play.",

            "review_text": "One of the best singleplayer games ever, imo.  Comparing the Witcher series, this is vastly superior to it's predecessors by basically everything. After playing this, I don't even imagine what would it take to make a better RPG than this one. I wish I could delete my memory just to play it again.    PROS:   - VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST open world to explore. It's massive. It's not filled with dull stuff. There are caves, cliffs, forests, mountains, castles, lighthouses, etc... And everything I mentioned is filled with loot, which is not easily accessible because of the enemies (there are tons of them too, all different and unique) and that makes the game fun. All in all, the sandbox in this game is insane.  - The story really immerses you into the game. You can choose what to say in most of the dialogues. You can ask non-quest related questions to most unique NPCs.  - Fighting is a bit hard to get used to, if you never played Witcher games - it involves lots of dodging, parrying, blocking - but you can easily learn to get used to it.  - Each NPC is unique. Everyone has their own personality, they scale from mean, old men and women who don't want to even hear the smallest word from you to lying two-faced ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to good, honest and friendly characters.  - You can decide Geralt's (main character's) fate. And not only his. His friends', the factions', which are at war with each other and even choose between romances. I've never seen that much choices from any other games.  - Graphics are fantastic, IF you can allow yourself a good computer. Every small detail is textured, the grass, bushes, trees move in the flow of the wind.  - The weather changing system really impressed me. You have storms, blizzards, rain which look absolutely wonderful and then sunsets and sunrises which look really colorful and are calm, relaxing.  - The soundtrack. Holy crap. It fits soooo well. There are different soundtracks for everything and they fit so god damn well. Although, sometimes they are a bit buggy (for instance 2 tracks at once), but it doesn't matter, it doesn't happen often.  - Tons of perks. Sword-fighting, alchemy, signs (magic), and you can respec all of them if you made a wrong choice somewhere.    CONS:    There isn't much bad things in this game, actually. But here's a few.  - Moving feels strange if you're playing for the first time. It's not as free as Skyrim, where you can basically climb 90 degree mountains. You can get blocked by a really small obstacle, but it's not as annoying as in other games.  - Horses. These sons of b*tches ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off really much. Sometimes you can run in a small obstacle which any other in-game horse would basically walk or if it's a bit bigger, just jump over, but oh booooooooooy, not in this game. Quite often I had a problem where you start running with the horse and then, in quite small areas, they would go off the road. And no, those roads were not made just to walk on foot, they are big enough for horses to go through, but they just don't. Or maybe I'm just really used to Skyrim's horses, I don't know.  - As much as deciding Geralt's fate is a really good thing, but I really got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when I got the worst possible ending just because I was playing it logically and safe. Like for instance, *SPOLER*    where Ciri seems like just begging for you to go with her to the sorceress meeting in Dandelion's place and you go with her. And then, at the end of the game, you learn that it was a bad choice. WTF?    Well then, I'm off for another playthrough for the best ending.  Overall, I would rate 10/10 for sure. Soooo much content for a price like that. It's 100% worth it.",

The Witcher 3 defines a new era of RPGs: One where the world truly is complete, nothing is missing, and each character, no matter how small, feels real. Very rarely (only near the end) did I feel like I was doing a quest that was pointless or boring. The game stayed fresh no matter how long I played nonstop.   There's so much depth to the game that even after 40+ hours I barely scratched the surface. I played on some easier difficulties because I had more fun just experiencing the game, so the more intricate parts of the character customization and combat flew over my head. (Yes, the game is that versatile. Any playstyle can have fun with it.) But there's also a HUGE database in the game of every character and monster you ever come across in the game. When the lore gets confusing (and it does), a quick peek at that to remind yourself fixes yourself back up.  Nobody can truly call themself a gamer if they haven't played this game.

The fighting mechanics are really easy to pick up and the spells are suprisingly easy to use on PC even. I would not say that this is a game made for PC like Half Life for example but it is a very good port as far as some games go. I really enjoy the slow down effect when you go into the quick access menu to change spells and even then you have the spells bound to the keys at the top. The combat is very fluent and it doesn't break the flow when you use spells or the crossbow in the game. The voice acting is very professionally done and sounds amazing. Speaking of amazing, the soundtrack is very good and not as forgettable as some of todays video game soundtracks. Some of the gripes I have with this game might just be with my game but I might as well say them. I personally have has some troubles with the game starting up occasionally, there have been some random crashes here and there but nothing to be alarmed about if you are thinking about buying this game, and personally I have had troubles with mods among other things but if you are planning on not playing with mods that it shouldn't be much of a problem.

As for the combat system i think this time they really got it right, smooth and tactical.  If you like a really good driven story where you decide how the game ends, this is the game for you, and you even get a mini game of cards which has really good mechanics.

I guess I can start with some basic points     Story easily picked up by new players and continues for returning fans, one so enveloping I - a serious cutscene skipper - was drawn in to watch   everything       One of the best soundtracks I have EVER heard in my entire life, music is a huge thing for me and this nails every single moment.     The world is massive and absolutely gorgeous, through several playthroughs I hardly ever used the fast-travel system     There is SO much content in this game it is mindblowing. Along side the main story, there are hundreds (no exaggeration) of sidequests including storylines with branching paths and multiple endings to nearly all of them, witcher contracts pitting Geralt against a huge variety of unrelenting beasts, and treasure hunts to delve into caves to find some extremely worth-while loot. Its all there, available to do as much or as little as you please.     Every character you come across in the main story is actually memorable - including Geralt himself (Zoltan is the best character you'll ever meet, so make sure to do every quest he offers and you won't regret it)     Mother♥♥♥♥ing Gwent, 196 cards in the game for you to purchase, win and find, THEN play with. It literally is a whole game inside a game.     The difficulty settings range from beginner at RPGs as a whole to absolutely ruthless sadism. On the lowest difficulty you can get through without much thought, but as it increases you need to seriously think about every stat, attribute allocation, potion making, armour and weapons being in top condition. Think you're good at RPGs? Try Deathmarch and watch your ♥♥♥♥ get handed to you.   Overall, this game really couldn't be better in my opinion. The base game is incredible and the DLC packs (Hearts of Stone, Blood and Wine) are both shockingly good additions, they are prime examples of how DLC SHOULD be done. This is my personal choice for GOTY in 2015, and DLC of the year in 2016 (B&amp;W)    10/10 - a serious must-buy, even at full price.    I'll also take this opportunity to personally congratulate CD Projekt Red on leaving a mark in gaming history, because they truly have created something here that is worth everyone's attention, new players and veterans alike.

I loved the world of Sapkowski even before the first game and when it came out it was a mess (but a mess with a good story). Second game made me wish the third would be half as good so I could be happy with the trilogy.  And now I fear no game will feel any good for me for some time now.   The game felt like Skyrim, but with a way less rocky start and no downtimes till the end. Sure there is not as much crafting and and playing around (housing) but there is also no grinding (leveling professions to 100), what helps the game stay in a constant flow.  There is no equal out there with 80 hours playtime to complete the story and less den 50% of the sidequests, to get one of 36 possible endings.  The game made me laugh, cry and feel for the caracters close to Gerald like no many others did in 15 years of gaming for me.",

I will elaborate as I go deeper in the game.  --EDIT: Well well, now I am 100+ hour into this magnificent piece of software art. I would not waste my time trying to compare it to other franchises like Elder Scrolls, instead treat it as what it is... an excellent game with a lot of innovation and improvement over their past versions.  I am not used to write much about reviews and I will not extend on this one either.  Summarizing my experience so far:  Side quests are compelling and interesting, hardly you have the usual kill X and fetch Y formula of old. Contracts which one could think are repetitive, are crafted to be creative and have their own charm. If real life is itself repetive, that aspect of a monster hunter would be pretty similar. Yet TW3 makes it in a way you can enjoy it. Treasure Hunts are truly rewarding, although their missions would be the most repetive of all, the rewards are very very rewarding and it is worth all the hassle. Nothing like enjoying the cutscenes with Geralt in full Mastercrafted Griffin Gear.  Main story is brilliant, its not about saving the world, it about protecting the loved ones. Of course in that path you will change the world in many many ways, and your decisions will influece the many outcomes.  I cant really talk much about the graphics and I will not even step in the dowgrade, as per my machine specs I could not run the game past medium and high settings so I do not fret about it, yet I loved the art and detail and I really enjoyed the multi region open world of the game and the hard work on cutscenes.  Speaking of Gear, the crafting systems are very nice, gone is the grinding of leveling your craft formula of other games, its all about finding and collecting diagrams and formulae to craf the stuff you need, which usually will be given as you need it and progress deep in the game.  Combat although somewhat clunky, it is enjoyable, still has space for improvement, it was not a blocker to enjoy it. Although a wider variety of weapons and fight styles would not hurt in the future.  Horses: Races are fun and it might require some strategy to win, its not only about sprinting from start to end to win a race. About Horses, horse riding is very well done, very realistic. Combat is the best mount combat of a game of this kind.  To conclude: An excellent, must have game. By far the best RPG I have played in the past 4 years :D Totally recommed it. Far from perfect, still is a incredible crowning achievement! ;)",

So yeah this a RPG i gladly recommend it give you hours of hours on content with many areas that are really large so you can basicily call them open world. The world is so beautyfull also cause sometimes i just stopped and took a picture cause i liked the scenery and colours expecially when the sun was setting down in some areas, or when you just ride in one direction and find some poor locals being hunted by a beast and asks for your help and you can be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and argue about the price of the contract. So yeah easily one of my favourite RPG's at the moment.

Pros: - Huge map to discover. - Epic fighting system, - Great RPG aspects - Great graphics (You need a good Graphics card to run it fluidly in ultra) - Great story (until now / 6 hours) - All characters are charismatic and everyone has a role in the world. - Every decision you take has an impact in your progression... be aware ;)  Cons: - Movement and fighting quite difficult at the beginning - Some graphical and collision issues (will be fixed in the futur) - euh...=)",

The Witcher 3 is worth every penny of it's purchase price. Let me tell you that this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing ambitious! It will blow your mind! You will get hooked. I'm right now on my second playthrough at the highest difficulty level and I can't stop. This is a game that sticks in your brain. It is a huge evolution from it's predecessor. The story is very interesting. The combat is very challenging but not unfair. The exploration is rewarding and jaw dropping. The characters are unforgettable. The voice acting is excellent. The music is crazy and full of energy. Look I bought a gtx 980 to play this game at high ultra settings and I'm glad I did. I preordered this game by mistake and I'm glad I did. It really is one of the best games I ever played and probably one of the best games ever made. 10/10 legendary! It is what it is! Game of The Year! I recommend this game to any open world RPG fan. Go play it and launch yourself into the oh so sweet world of the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt! Oh yeah and tons of free dlc every week! It is the new KING of RPG'S!",

It gives you a, for all intents and purposes, full heal if you're hit with 1 adrenaline point. This makes drowner manageable until your gear and skills get good enough to compensate.   2) Potions, oils, and bombs automatically refill after every meditation, and only cost a single Alcohlest. Build potions and oils ASAP.  3) 90% of the fights in the game will be won depending on how well you use the combat DODGE rather than the combat ROLL. Bind the Combat Dodge (The 'Hop') to an easy key and learn how to use it fast.   4) Live your laifu for your waifu. You know which one.",

I RESPECT Pillars of Eternity and the love towards Baldurs Gate more than most so please don't get me wrong on that.   I have played and beat witcher 1. I bought 2 but due to RL job I never completed it. (I cheated I know and went straight to witcher 3). I bought Witcher 3 and on Steam and sat on it forabit due to...RL job.   Changed jobs and had some time in between to venture forth and wade into the game to feel it out. My main computer died I think MB so I turned to the GF's comp to get my fix. Needless to say I am amazed at the coding and graphics structure of this game. The optimization is 2nd to none. Correct me if I'm wrong but they built their own engine for this 3rd game.   This should be a console best seller. So many CoD games and rehashes and then Witch 3 comes out on consoles and graphics are far superior,...it shows the rehash aspect and what consoles have come to accept as normal and par.   I'm rambling so I will shed up. This game will last you countless hours and that doesn't even count a 2nd playthrough. I played GTA 5 and have done 2 playthrough's thus far. I love that game.

All other game's EVEN Skyrim's future brother's will be compared to this masterpiece. No more rushing game's and charging for DLC. I have yet to DL all the DLC offered for free by these gents/gals.   If anyone has played the original Witcher or people intrigued by the series please jump in. It is a masterpiece. It is one of those games you come back to like a book.

            "review_text": "This isn't a 10/10 perfect game (IMO) like everyone seems to be making it out to be. It does have a lot of issues. While still a fun game that I would recommend, I felt like it had glaring issues that held back what would've otherwise definitely been one of my top 5 games of all time. They made a game that would be worth going back to each year for memorable battles and quests into something that doesn't quite satiate my fantasy open world rpg taste buds.  The combat, graphics, and characters are all awesome. Everyone knows this. I want soley talk about the parts people leave out or don’t talk about, at least not in these steam reviews.  The issues I have with the rest of the game undermine these. One of the biggest downfalls I found came with the pacing and quest load. I constantly felt overwhelmed. For every main quest I received, 25 side quests came along with it. I know that you are able to ignore these and do them as you please, but completing main quests mean that you are severely over-leveled when you come back to sidequests, even with enemy upscaling on and difficulty turned up. Characters you met are forgotten about, and I have no clue where they came into the story at or why they are there. Of course, a massive log of characters and beasts helps keep records of these persons in tact, but does detract from the immersion of the missions. If you focus on side missions, I feel like story becomes more irrelevant and less frantic than the game suggests it should be. Again, if you aren't a Witcher fanatic, or you don't have time to play for more than an hour a day, characters and stories are lost and confused. Some people may have no issue with this, I just felt bombarded and overwhelmed all at once. Before I had even completed a single story mission in a new land, I felt like I had inadvertently picked up every side quest and met every towns person that needed help.  Monster contracts, the aspect I was most excited for coming into this game, are underwhelming and forgettable. Again, before you know it, 10 different people want 10 different monsters slain. In my 65 hours played, almost every contract felt exactly the same, leaving few fights to feel unique and memorable. They all begin with you being approached by a peasant, or picking up a contract on a notice board, that then lead you to be told about a monster that is terrorizing a location. You then gather clues by asking around town or using your witcher senses to find tracks or scents at a scene. Following these tracks leads to you discover a monster that you then fight, after optionally choosing to gear up with different potions and oils (that I never onced use because of how powerful you already are) that are specifically more effective against certain types of monsters. This formula works, and while it does get a little stale, it was really the most logical option to have players begin a contract. A couple of them were alright, specifically the wyverns/forktails and the chorts (basically the big monsters). A lot of them, however, are common small enemies that you see and fight in the wild. A single water hag? Really? Maybe it was just me, but I was under the impression that side quests and monster contracts were separate to allow us to isolate ourselves from everyday scum of The Northern Realms and surround ourselves with unique epic battles against deadly beasts. A good chuck of these contracts would have been better served as regular side quests. At the end of each contract (remember, your main job as a witcher is to accept contracts and kill monsters), you receive a trophy of the monster you kill, and usually a weapon. The weapon is complete trash 90 percent of the time. The trophy (the monsters head) that grants you a small percent increase to either experience gained, gold find, sign damage, etc…) are all the same and barely vary. Larger more difficult “rare” beasts don't differ enough from a trophy you will get from a regular enemy to even justify the time. And because I was already overleveled, the experience doesn't feel worth it, the gold isn't important (as there is nothing to buy because crafting is the only way to get best items), and I come away feeling underwhelmed. The only solace you have is the memory of discovering and fighting an epic beast that the townspeople hyped up, and for me, it didn't quite happen.  Crafting is simple, clean, and enjoyable. However, it's for the most part unnecessary. You find or are rewarded diagrams that you can then take to a craftsman to have crafted. Most of the diagrams you find are for low level trash gear that you will never ever assemble or even think of wearing. At 65 hours in, one chest piece I crafted carried me at least 30 hours. I didn't get an upgrade until I crafted a piece that was only unavailable because I didn't meet the level requirement, not because I didn't have necessary funds or materials.  To sum it up, these are handful of my biggest issues with the game. They by no means make the game unplayable, unbearable, or un-enjoyable. I just think things could be tweaked to simply make the game as good as people give it credit for. They have, in my opinion, the perfect template to make what could be my favorite game ever. A great fantasy setting with the size and stature to create a memorable epic that would go down in history with games like Red Dead Redemption and Bioshock. It just doesn't quite hit the mark with me. ",

For waht this game gives you any other company would have wanted atleast 30% more on its price.  To new players, the story is part of a trilogy, so it is tides up to the other 2 games. You do not have to play it to enjoy it but to get the full experiance and satisfaction of the rich story you need to. (They are also very good).  Every little quest is fully voiced and unique. Yes, it may still be to kill the same looking monster, or even the same type of monster, but the dialog is not repeated (or even if it is because it is extreamly big game you won't notice).  The character progression is very well done. While creators don't like to see thier characters age and close to their end (not death, just potential), Gerald knows his place. He aged, he changed, he leads his persona to a conclution down the road. This is a great example of a strong protagonist and gread build of an adventure story.  If your open world and very lively acting NPCs, great story, fantastic romantic dilemas, stunning graphics and music is not enough, well we have a mini-game in as well. Gwent, the cute card collecting game, does is job well. While it does not have one of the strongest concepts and it baffles me how it can go solo, it strives to be original. You are not forced to play it, to win it, or even to punish you for missing that one card in the storyline that you will never ever get back, just because you did not loot eveyr single crate. ",

Good -Easily one of the best story lines I have ever played. The main game's story line is epic and will always keep you engaged. I would easily compare it to Skyrim in terms of epic scale of different quests and plots. While the Hearts of Stone Expansion quest feels like a very good side quest, the main game quest is the main show and the Blood and Wine storyline is a good final farewell and encore to the game. If you like fantasy, action, medieval battles, the Lord of the Rings, Warhammer, medieval monster stories, Game of Thrones, and old European folklore in general, you will sink your teeth into this game's story. Like a very good book, it will keep you engaged. In fact, I believe this is some of the best writing I have ever seen in a video game. The writing is better than many movies. -The game is utterly gorgeous. Much like an Elder Scrolls game, it is easy to get lost in the beauty of the game world. Velen provides a war torn ravaged land. White Orchard is a small farming community. The Skellige Isles are a tough, harsh, and ultimately beautiful snowy and maritime frontier. Novigrad is the ultimate fantasy Eastern European themed city. Toussaint is a beautiful fairy tale esque land akin to the French and Italian wine producing regions.  -The soundtrack for this game is epic. Like the entire feel of the game, it is rooted in old European folklore. Expect exceptionally varied tracks among all environments. You can expect bagpipes in Skellige and trumpets in Toussaint. -Combat is very well done. While not a simple button masher, it is still incredibly well balanced and can be picked up quickly yet rewards more experienced users. Arguably the best combat of the series. Especially considering the raw amount of foes you will be facing, the combat is never boring and never gets old.  -Overall, everything about this game is good to the point where it's better for me to jump into the bad, as they are the only negatives.  Bad -your ability to navigate terrain can seem chunky at times, especially when mounted on the horse. Overall, this is no where near a game breaking note. View this more as a simple heads up that you wont have as much freedom of movement as in say Skyrim. Seriously this is the only thing I can really think of as a bad.   Neutral -My biggest note of the game where I think things could have been changed is the leveling system. While not necessarily a bad thing, it's worth noting. While the game has many open world 'regions' it is still generally designed with the intention that a player follows a certain sequence of quests. In other words, some quests are locked at certain levels and some equipment is also locked until a certain level. While this provides for balanced gameplay throughout the experience, it is definitely a generally restrictive/micromanaging option compared to other open world RPG games. Skyrim for example automatically adjusts the level of all enemies and quests around the player, with more difficult enemies and quests just a tad bit higher than the others in relation to the player's skill. This keeps challenging missions challenging but allows a player to write their own story. However, it's not really a bad thing in the case of this game. While Skyrim lets you create your own player and write their story, the Witcher 3 is meant to have you writing Geralt's story.   Should you buy? -If you like action games, fantasy, monsters, melee combat games, and general top tier games (This is one of the most critically acclaimed games we have seen in a while - average score 9/10, with Gamespot giving a 10/10)... buy it. Period. -If you see it on sail, buy it. Period.",

By far this game has set the standard for new open world graphics! I would highly reccommend playing this game on the recommended settings or waiting to play it on a respectable platform in order to give it justice. It is a gorgeous game with large spanning mountain ranges and forest views. Accompanying the outstanding visuals there is a unique interaction between environment, enemies and characters makes the game so much more satisfying.  This game can be great without prior knowledge or background of The Witcher Series in games 1 or 2. There are multiple styles that can be accomodated to every adventurer's playstyle and preferences without making the game overly difficult. I would state though that this game can be very overwhelming when it comes to things to do. Plan on either sticking to the story or finding yourself lost in the wilderness simply looking for potion ingredients or crafting copmponenets for your 'OVERPOWERED' Ursine Armor upgrades!!!  After 80 hours I can say that I am completely satisfied with my purchase in all components and I am 'biting at the bit' to play the DLC content. I wish you all the best of luck in your adventure!

I 1st noticed this after finally completeing all quests that i could in velen, white orchard and novigrad. It was at this time when i decided it was time to travel to skellige as i wanted to continue building my gwent deck.  The Boat journey there went smoothly and i progressed a short while until after the funeral cerimony however after saving the game and exiting the next morning i could not load and any &amp; all attempts to fix this have been useless. the most recent save i could load was shortly before taking the boat out although now whenever i pay the 1000 required for access to the boat my game either closes without an error message or freezes during the cutscene as the boat leaves.  As of yet i have still found no additional information on how to potentially fix this as i do not wish to start again as i have yet to experiance most areas of the game due to my completionist attitude during my save, its so crushing to have such progress taken away. the feeling could be described as bitter :O   If anyone has the same issue or has any information on how to work around/resolve this it would be much appreciated.",

The witcher 3 pros Beautiful and believable world and people, even the ugly ones. Excellent voice acting. Interesting story ( so far ). Nice minigame. Horse autorun to targets. Big world.  The witcher 3 negatives. Combat and movement are unacceptably bad, really clunky, this for me is a game killer when the gameplay is so bad i stop playing and wait and hope for a patch. Walking into houses and ransacking while the AI owner standing right beside me says or does nothing. Stupid AI. Villagers speaking too much, they actually drown themselves out. Messy and confusing crafting and inventory. Geralt putting sword away in battle.  I love the world of the witcher and the witcher 3 is impressive and atmospheric, but it feels like the makers of witcher 3 spent all their time on graphics and story while not treating the actual gameplay of this game seriously enough, or maybe they just didn't have the skills.  Edit, ive played and practiced the clunky controls far more, i still stand by the statement that the controls are a bit clunky and geralt turns like a bus, but with practice you can somewhat compensate for it, and it becomes okay but could of been better affair. So i'm giving this a thumbs up now, mostly for the world and characters.",

Characters were incredible, voice acting was fantastic, facial movements were spot on, all-in-all, a brilliant experience. 59 hours on first playthrough, and I didn't even do everything I could have. I would say I am incredibly impressed, especially as someone who was, though excited for this title, skeptical, thus the hesitation.  If you like open world(-ish) RPGs with interesting, very adult-themed plotlines, do yourself a favor and play this game. Recommend you play the previous titles first, but even if you do not, this game does a pretty good job of standing on its own and making events of prior titles pretty clear.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR:[/h10 IMO, THE most immersive RPG game I have ever played. Looks really good, all the quests are unique, you almost never feel like you're just playing the same quest again with a different name. Most of all, it actually got me to FEEL something for its characters, who were really well developed throughout. It's an absolute masterpiece, at least I think it is. [h1]The Longer Bit[/h1] I honestly went into The Witcher 3 expecting the experience I got from Skyrim. A huge game with annoyingly repetitive quests and inspired not even the smallest ounce of emotion from me. In other words, a game that I would quickly get bored of and play only to pass time occasionally. Let me tell you this, I couldn't have been more wrong. The Witcher 3 was one of the very few games that actually made me feel something for the characters, made me actually grow attached to or despise certain characters. It's numerous sidequests, are possiblly to most well designed of all RPGs. Not because they're different to other games, but because they're different to eachother. Almost all sidequests have voiced cutscenes, an impact on the game and best of all, you don't go 'wait a second, isn't this the exact same as that other quest I did 10 minutes ago, but with a different name?'. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's flawless, the combat could have used a bit more work, the map/interactions too, but nothing that really got me instantly bored of the game. Also, a fair few of the sidequests are similar, obviously they can't make everything completely different, but what they have done is included small details and subtle additions to quests which, overall, make them feel completely different. One of my favourite things about the game is that you actually get to develop YOURSELF as a character. Most RPGs, I'm probably gonna keep using Skyrim for specific examples, dont really give you the feeling that you're developing as a character. For example with Skyrim, sure things you did affected the world as a whole and some people didn't like you anymore, but none of it really felt like it affected you. With The Witcher 3 it all actually feels like the choices you make affect yourself, the plot and what people think of you. You actually feel like your playing as a person in that world rather than some guy that can do whatever he wants and is really distanced from everything. Going on to specifics: Characters - Like I've mentioned they're really good, well developed and you actually feel like you have a specirfic relationship with them, regardless of what that relationship may be. You also feel like your character is an actual citizen of the world. Visuals - Really good as well, while you're running around you'll find awe-inspiring scenery evry step of the way. While individual detailing and whatnot is great, but not jaw-droppingly so, what really makes the graphics amazing is how smoothly it all fits together. Sound - There's not a huge variety of sounds, not that many games can boast this, but what's there is done really well in my opinion. Nothing too much I can say about this. Gameplay - Combat could have used a bit of work, and the map/ quest interactions too. It's quite easy to go about a quest wrong and as a result not be able to progress properly. Apart from this though, it all seems to flow pretty well. I'm sure I repeated myself quite a few times, but the point is, it stands out so much from similar games. It's just so immersive. Like I've said 3 times, I think, you ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A PART OF THE WORLD. The things happening directly affect you! In the end though, this was just the impression I got. So if you ask me, it's easily worth the money you pay for it and, in my opinion, is the BEST (serious) RPG game out there, so far.",

You are basically on a search for a person, but you're not just 'going to where the person is' like other games would do it. You start off knowing literally nothing about that person whereabouts. Neither the character you play or you yourself know anything about it, which makes the story way mor interesting when you finally find a new lead. The story pulls you into the game, you really want to continue playing.  The only things i would consider bad, or poorly made is your equippment. Let me explain. You can use two swords. A steel sword for humans and animals and a silver sword for beasts.  Most silver swords look way, way too simmilar, but so do the steel swords. The inventory pictures have very little that makes the weapons destinguishable from eachother, so you have to hover over the weapons to find out which one is the better one. But not only that, when you have the swords equipped, there's nothing that shows you that you have the 'weaker' sword equipped, because they look almost the same.  Let's take Skyrim for example. In Skyrim, you have several different 'brands' of weapon: orcish, elven, dawnguard and so on. this makes the weapons VERY destinguishable. In The Witcher 3, you have only one brand per weapon type, which means that in total you only have two brans: Steel and Silver swords.  That's boring.  But if you can look past this small, but annoying flaw, the game itself is still fun.",

How would i describe this game? In a word, epic.  Too keep this short and sweet, let's get into pros and cons:  Pros: -Horse can autopilot (you have no idea how fun this is) -Fully fleshed out, consequential main quest: actions actually make impacts or change the way quests work -Main charachters all have personality and life in them -No 'fetch me this X times', 'kill X monsters' quests, making each quest feel unique -Gameworld of believable scale -No loading screens necessary unless you're changing between the 5 different main areas -Decent/ engaging tutorial -Some beautiful endings, epic and emotional -Graphics are very good, in almost all instances. -Caves look phenomenal -World really feels 3D with caves/dungeons connected to the main map without loading barriers -Interesting charachters -A few really engaging random encounters. -Decent bossfights -Amazing cinematics -Two controllable charachters -Witcher senses -You need to prepare potions and signs for each fight- really fun little feature -Random explosive barrels, beehives, and flammable gas swamp for bonus fun  Cons: -Clunky movement at times -Combat becomes very one dimensional at lower difficulty settings -Certain charachters dissapear after game end -Sometimes you never get to finish some quests on time, then don't recieve xp as a result of being overleveled -First ten levels are hard to come by, the rest are much easier -Finding components to craft swords or armor is very difficult -I completed the game without ever crafting witcher gear, as some very powerful gear can be more easily obtained by wandering the game world.  -Very difficult to get over level 40, simply no quests are your level anymore once you get this high -Nature can feel a bit rubbery sometimes -Portals don't have depth!!! -Some 'holes' in the game world can be seen sometimes -Crossbow feels like crap  Final verdict? Graphics: 10/10  -Not going to nitpick on the small stuff here, the game has a great feel and atmosphere due to its graphics Gameplay: 9.5/10 -Combat needs some work, as does movement, but overall very satisfying for an rpg Roleplaying: 11/10 -Will cheat on Yennefer again, the control freak lady better calm the f*** down when she's talking to me. I don't take orders! Atmosphere: 9/10 -Great landscapes, but some repetitive dialogoues, faces and actions can take away from the feel a bit.  Overall, 10/10, a mustbuy, musthave, mustplay. Seriously, this game topped any rpg I've ever played, and I've played quite a few.  Word of advice- don't finish main quest until you've done most of the other quests, because you'll be making jumps of two levels or more if you do, rendering the side quests way too easy.

The game has the scope of something like Skyrim, but where that game's inhabitants are hollow and superficial, this game manages to populate its world with a cast of characters overflowing with personality. The most surprising and rewarding thing about this massive open-world monster hunter RPG is its deep humanity. This extends from the side quests and contracts (where the monsters are often given more presence than Skyrim's major NPCs) to its protagonist, who seems at first like a standard gruff fantasy hero but reveals himself over time to be a warm, funny and soulful human being.  The writing is some of the best I've ever encountered in a video game. There are at least five different scenes* in this that I don't think I'll ever forget. The voice acting (I played the game in Polish; can't vouch for the English dub) is superb and really helps sell the nuances of the script, as does some surprisingly subtle animation work in the faces.  (* Thinking here of the funeral attended by the baron, the witch hunters' compound with Triss, the ritual for Uma, necromancy with Yennefer and trashing a laboratory with Ciri.)  I will be back for the expansions. I will be back for whatever else CD Projekt does for the foreseeable future. Cyberpunk could not be in better hands.  Play this game slowly. Take the time to soak in the world, to get to know its characters. And try it in Polish; the actor who voices Geralt turns in one of the best performances I've heard in a game.",

The attention to detail is staggering, just walking around the environments, soaking in the atmosphere, hustling trees and soothing music discourages fast travel. It is a beautiful game. Most side missions rival main missions from other AAA games.  The fighting engine is what I'd like to see in a modern Zelda game. Geralt moves, dodges, counters &amp; strikes gracefully. Powerful potions, weapons and armour can be crafted by alchemy or by finding blueprints (diagrams). The game also has you playing Detective in many missions, where like Batman, the Witcher scans environments for clues and puzzles to solve mysteries and find treasure.  CDRed have created an RPG for a generation, its also the perfect adventure game - 9.5/10  When all is said and done, Witcher 3's Blood &amp; Wine DLC is my nomination for Game of the Year 2016",

Slaying them gives me a boner for murder. I have never felt so saitisified chopping a mutated creature in half before. The free roam capibilities? Well that's just it. Free roam. Go do whatever the hell you want to. Literally. No one will care. Leave the beaten path, find some loot, maybe a few bandits, get ♥♥♥♥ed by 10 wild dogs, forgot to save so you're a bit far behind again, don't care because it was amazing so why not do it again, kill the dogs this time, kill the bandits, aquire new sword, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es.

            "review_text": "All in all, I do like this game. But that said, there are some details about the game that are not to my liking. Specifically, these are as follows: 1) when you find a flower, or kill a creature, invariably you have the option to pick the flower for ingredients, or loot the body of the creature. Naturally, you want to do these things. The disturbing aspect that you ALWAYS must be facing the item to be picked up. They designed that aspect to be 'realistic'. In my mind, something that is within a couple of feet from you should be able to be picked up, regardless of which direction you are facing.  2) when you are in a battle, and one of the opponents is shooting arrows at you, you can be standing behind a tree with a 4 foot trunk, and the arrow will come through the tree as if it's not there. So much for 'realism'. At least in Skyrim, you could easily take cover behind objects such as trees and walls. Not in Witcher... those things are there for atmosphere, not for actual use. 3) There are at least 2 maps in Witcher 3. It appears that once you 'graduate' to the second map, there is no way to go back to the first map to finish the quests you missed, and/or, not finished. 4) You cannot climb trees in this game. But your opponents often do. If you try, you jump and bounce off the trunk. Yet those arrows can still hit you. Getting to creatures in high spaces means you have to find a way to get up there. In one quest, a creature is up high, and you are to throw a certain kind of bomb 'in the room', (cave), but when you try, the bomb just bounces back then blows up. The supposed smoke doesn't have any effect because the crack into the room is too narrow to throw into. (perhaps I missed something here, I do not know) 5) Most quests are pretty straight forward. You search for the creature(s), attack them, kill them, loot the bodies, then go collect your reward. But then there are those that can drive you nuts. One such quest involves going through magical gateways, searching for a couple of hours in darkened caves, burning off toxic gases with your igni power, fighting beasts that are very difficult (at that level)... all in all, I spent about 2 hours on that one underground quest, only to get to a point where I was not adept enough to kill very fast creatures in an enclosed magical dome, where the battle often ran through the dome wall, causing even more damage, etc. After a couple of hours of fruitlessness, I gave up and restored to a save game that was just before I went into that area. (and I might point out that I was at the proper level for that quest). Point is, that with so many straightforward quests, to get one that takes a couple of hours is somewhat tedious.  All that said, the game is still fun, and I'm continuing to plow through the good and the aggravating.",

Absolutely having a blast in this game and it is very large, I doubt I will be beating it any time soon.   SLUGGY-NESS: I had issues with the controls and stuff at the start, but was remedied by turing motion blur OFF, v-sync OFF (limits frame rate if you didn't know), turn ON desktop cursor, set frame rate limit to 60+. All other settings maxed on my pc but set to your own liking/ capability. [note: this is one of the few games I have ever played that I don't need v-sync on, I get zero screen tearing with it off.]   CLUNKY-NESS: After doing that most of my issues were gone, the only thing that bothered me a little was that it felt a bit clunky on PC and seemed like a Console port however after a few hours in-game I don't really notice it anymore and it feels quite fine, also I recommend pressing CTRL and walking everywhere and using shift to run when you want, makes everything feel better graphically, realistically, and keyboard controling-ly...    I stole a boat from the military, did a couple doughnuts while they shot arrows at me, then brought it back and slaughtered them all. This game is great.",

The real downside is there's very little variation in what you're actually doing gameplay wise, mostly due to the fact fancy magic spells are just far more interesting than using different proc effects on your sword.

It's very clear right from the start how you can outsmart your enemies and easy to comfortably slip into the know-how of every aspect of the game.  Cons:  - Quite often feels more like an Interactive Meta Movie  - Quests can sometimes get boring/annoying cause of too much talking and transportation - First half of the game consequences and effects are hardly noticable after decision-making - Can't exploit the game mechanics like in elder scrolls or fallout (ie. saving someone for reward and then killing them is not possible). Player isn't free to mess with the balance of the game. - Awesome swords &amp; armor that you can't have cause you're low-level.  Recommended: - if you're a fan of the series 'or' a huge fantasy-lover with a boner for semi-realism - Playing on a hard difficulty (if you're good at outsmarting rpg systems)",

I'm not saying it's hard, becaue it's not, it's just tedious. I suppose the worst thing before this was The Division, which would require 40 headshots to do a kill. Not hard, just boring.

Maybe my expectations were sky-high after reading all the extremely positive reviews and seeing how many awards it got. I liked the game, but I liked many other games much more than this.  I've played for about 65 hours, most of it being the main quests. I spent about 10 hours on side quests. I played on the default normal setting and apart from the first 10 hours or so, the rest of the game was a walk in the park. I only used alchemy, potions and crafting a few times and the impression I got is that all these are redundant. I never had to use any oils or potions. I could get by just by looting food/water and in the end I had plently food items for another run. I died a few times in some boss fights, but that's it. Fights were very easy, to the point they felt more like chores slowing down the progression, rather than challenges.  I liked the story, however I thought it was very long. The quests are pretty standard fare: go get this, free that guy/gal, kill these guys, etc. Given how easy all these fights are, I would have liked to complete the main story in half the time. Instead, at times, quests felt like filler. I understand that games should offer a decent amount of entertainment per dollar, but this is a bit ridiculous. I'd rather have 20 hours of quality gameplay, than 60 hours doing boring tasks. After completing the game in 65 hours, I felt quite relieved that it was finally over. I have no plans on getting back to it for all those side quests littering the map.  Some people will definitely disagree with me and praise the game's huge lore, character stories, huge map, numerous quests and the deep alchemy/crafting systems. But to me these are all secondary. I just didn't like the gameplay that much. Maybe I should have selected a harder difficulty level, but I mostly play all my games on the default setting. Facing more difficult foes, might have pushed me to learn and actually use the alchemy and potion system.",

Because I haven't and I couldn't care less about the characters in the game. Every single storymission or major secondary quest pays some form of tribute or revolves around characters, that it thinks I already know... I don't...

Long Answer: Maybe the storyline is for some people, but not for me. I defitely appreciate the graphics and the work that went into producing this game. No disrespect there. But with all the hype and awards that went into this game I was expecting something a little more epic. At no point, so far, did I get that feeling. It is a struggle, forcing myself to play this, hoping that it gets better.   I play max settings with the hair works on. Maybe I'm too old to understand what all the fuss was about. The graphics and the textures are superb, no doubt about that. But it is what I would expect from a game released in 2015.  Quests are repetitve: Go to _____, talk to ______, now kill _____ and retrieve ______. Rinse and repeat. The opportunity to make decisions is interesting, but the result of your decisions have very little impact from what I can tell so far. I chose to spare a guy, collected my reward, then killed him anyway. Profit?   You can reach the end of the map and it forces you to turn around. You can do side quests but they are predictable. Open the map, see a bunch of icons of tasks to do, complete them, then onto the next area. It feels more like chores but without enough action.  There's too much travelling. Get on your horse, and ride to a far away distance, oh wait, to complete the quest now ride to the other side of the map, oh wait, once you get there now ride back to the other side of the map.  As a character you're basically stuck swinging a sword and casting spells. The spells have a cooldown so you have to wait to cast again. You do get a crossbow that is meh.  Combat with the sword is kinda annoying. You attack your target, then they back up 20 feet so your next swing misses. As you work your way closer to them, they lunge at you and hit you. Basically you hit them once, then they somehow magically get out of range. I don't understand it. You can block and counter which is nice. There really is no gap closer besides your spells. I usually flame my enemies and attack them while they are burning.  I had a lot more fun with Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. If you're looking for a medieval style game full of action at every turn, then that is what I would recommend. Witcher 3 is worth trying, but I regret buying.  I will continue to play and update this review if I can make it through the game.  Update 3/24/2016 - Game is uninstalled. I could not stand to play it. Way too boring. I have no idea how this game has gotten so many good reviews.",

Performance wise even with my mid tier computer i can grab at least 30 fps which is fine for me.  However even with the great story hours of gameplay and fun there are some serious issues as of right now.  The game can be very buggy at times when calling roach 50% of the time i have to go to him instead of him coming to me it's more like the whistle was there just to spawn him near you so you can actually run to him [me being lazy].  Also the game has no option to turn off the effects in the witcher sence inside the game which is HUGE for some people including myself because almost immediately i start to feel sick when turning it on, not only does it lower your FOV it adds a blur effect to the edge of the screen that makes it much worse for me. There were mods your could get that would remove this effect entirely however with the most recent patch 1.12 no mods that i know of work so ye...  And here's the reason im not recommending the game, earlier i said this game had issues and i've already stated a few but there is one issue stopping me and that is that sometimes NPC's become invincible during quests... Yes you heard me right what happens is that they spawn with -1 hp and you can't kill them no matter what, i've tried killing them with the console reloading the save, everything and nothing works. Unfortunately this happened to me on the main story on the boat right to skellige so i can't continue the quest line at all which means i have to put the game down until the issue is fixed but as of right now they seem to be fixated more on the DLC than the main story which you have to play to get to the damed DLC  Thanks for reading and when they fix the NPC ill update the review however until then this game just isnt worth buying in my eyes",

            "review_text": "The game is a 7.5/10, nothing more. Seems like some idiots (IGN Included) want to throw out a 10/10 though...  It's up to you regarding what your interests are and what you spend your money on, but I cant honestly recommend this for everyone; It might grow on you with time, but the combat system is definitely in need of some polish, and I've tried it with both keyboard and controller...  I dont regret purchasing it and will continue to play it, but a 10/10 is an atrocious exaggeration; I've seen better games score less.  Story ignores it's logic:  Turned a demon into a spirit that was supposed to be able to find two people I was looking for since they 'shared blood'. The spirit essentially led me on a seek and find where I had to use the Witcher Sense to figure out what happened. Then the spirit ended up leading me NOT to the people it was supposed to, but instead to some NPC's who couldnt tell me much else than 'gone here'. Historical Evidence shows the Witcher should of been able to track 'clues' on his own to this location...but plot convenience right? Anyway, the spirit actually leaves and doesnt find anyone. In short, the spirit was supposed to do something it didnt do.  Later, fought some werewolf and apparently he couldnt control himself and killed the girl he 'loved', but at the good/bad choice the ending, he talked in the cutscene and was 100% in control of his actions. After which he selectively killed someone and then, on his knees, begged me to end him - all while remaining a werewolf. So ♥♥♥♥ logic/lore I guess.  The Story is typical, which is fine, but the combat &amp; movement in the game is sloppy. Sadly, the mind-numbing and boring combat systems from Arkham and Assassin's Creed did parry/dodge better than this...  I think the reason Geralt is all scarred up is not because of 'He's done and been through a lot', but more so because 'Developers designed a bad combat system and Geralt was forced to suffer'.   Combat is 80% dodging/parrying - When you fight stuff at a lower level than you, it's not as big of a problem, but you can be stun locked and killed, (even those 1/3 of your level)...Many fights take place in small areas; you constantly get stuck on small items (Candles, Fruit, Baskets, Roots, Etc).  Camera is bad in small places.  BONUS ROUND:  Geralt retained 0 information about monsters in the codex from previous games.  There are car racing games that have better handling than Geralt.  The game is not open world. The leveled system brings down the game:  I killed some level 8's in a spot. I went to another '?' not 100 meters away and the mobs were level 19; drastic climb.  If you can find mats to make stuff, you're often not the level to use it. If you have the level and mats you might not have the crafting skill; by the time you have all three skills there are good odds you dont need that gear anymore.  You're limited to 12 skill slots, skills need to be slotted in order to use. The fact that you need to 'Put X amount of points in a tree to use stronger skills' mean that you're going to waste a lot of skill points; skills that you dont slot are just skill point dumps.  Changing the game difficulty changes stat modifiers, not skills/mechanics.  There's no area loot option, sometimes it seems impossible to target the one object you need to loot behind some others. (I'm honestly not sure if it's procedural generation or an idiots deliberate placements)...  Fall Damage is insane.  Some doors are wooden and you can break them, others are wooden but you need a key.  Dialogue options are sometimes too vague.  Swimming controls are very rough; I also surfaced under a boat and got stuck in the boat.  It's not clear when you're stealing vs when you're looting.  Biggest complaint is that this game scored a 10/10 when it's clearly not perfect.",

Combat is a pointless, one on one he works fine any more than one and hes going to lose. Some badass he turned out to be game simply makes you feel like a joke. If you get hit with anything you will either be off balanced or stunned or whatever you want to call it but during this time you cant do anything block nope, parry nope, dodge nope, just take that hit like a man.....oh wait you cant since your a wuss with one or 2 hits and your dead. and you will almost never see a one on one fight ever. Appearntly his swings, either light or strong attacks, have little weight to them since enemies just ignore them continueing their attack which hits you since you cant do anything while you attack. Even parrying and counter attacking is useless since your attacks have zero effect against enemies aside from reducing their health bar.   So this game ends up taking a massive crap on the batman arkham style combat and gives you a health/dodge system like dark souls hope you all enjoy punching yourselfs in the junk cuz thats what this is.

It holds your hand like a 10 year old .. you never get to use your imagination it is all done for you with the endless cut scenes, endless npc conversations and mindless auto pilot fighting.  Character movement is EXTREMLY clunky and TERRIBLE .. i could not belive the character movement, so clunky in fact you will struggle getting him to go through a door and and get in the right posistion to talk to a npc...sad just sad..   I have to say this again about the the cut scenes and npc conversations ARE YOU F***king kidding me its litterly a movie that stops periodaclly and lets you move your character 10 feet or swing his sword and *POOF* another 5 miniute cut scene,,,EVEN SOME OF THE FIGHTS ARE CUT SCENES ..you basiaclly sit at your chair and watch a movie..again sad just sad and boring.  Talking to NPC's is depressing becouse after talking to the first few you relize they never stop talking and you are stuck in the conversation with NO WAY OUT GRRRRRRRR.. im talking about 3 and 4 miniute conversations per NPC !!! i found myself mashing the space bar to hurry through the conversations just to try and play the game, then I just stopped interacting with them all together in hopes of playing my charcter ...still i had no luck i got hit with another cut scene..  I litterly only got to play my character for about 15 minuetes in THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF ... and most of that time i was just riding my horse.. i wanted to puke   dont get me wrong here I love a great story line but let us use our imaginastion after the opening scene and have a cut scene here and there maybe 4 or 5 at the most in an entire game..  this is geared toward the 10 year old mentality wher they must have their hand held and their imagination done for them with endless cut scenes.  I wasted 59.00 of my hard earned money to watch a movie, have endless npc conversations and mindless fighting.  PROS... game is pretty  CONS.. everything else in the game unless your 10 year old or brand new to gaming   READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS THEY ARE SPOT ON !!!   ",

Made a rash decision after friends raved, watching a few demos, and reading a few reviews to purchase this 'game.'  However, I have played PC games for 20+ years and I have somehow never fallen in love with these console type games.   'Played' for 20 hours now, and I have seen very little combat - and when it has occurred was underwhelming, found little use for crafting armor, weapons, or alchemy. What I have done is sit in my chair and basically watched a very long scripted CG movie that I have had little interaction with and no effect on its direction.   I have the 'choice' of playing the only chracter that I can and tweek a little bit towards one thing or another, I have 'choices' in conversations that all ultimately lead to the same conclusion - another 10 min cut scene. About once an hour I get to swing my sword a few times, or engage in a 20 second horse race, or play a stupid card game.   After a few hours of playing, I realized what this was, and resigned myself to it. So now I just 'play' the game by sitting back comfortably in my chair with my popcorn and soda, and watch the rather uninteresting movie play itself out. The occasional inconvenience of putting my popcorn down to lean forward to hit 1 for a dialogue response or left mouse button to swing my sword is infrequent enough that it doesn't disrupt the flow of the movie too much. Sadly, my mind does wander from time to time, thinking...hmm, I could have bought any number of games instead, even re-subbed to WoW for 4 months, maybe I'll start a new Skyrim character - ooh a mage with a shield - and so on.   Thus, if you are an old school guy like myself, this is not the game for you. If you're the kind that like your games to be 80-90% scripted movie with very little choice for...well anything...then this is for you.   I've never thought of asking for a refund before, but I might actually try with this.  Update: refund denied, so I'm trying to burn thru the game as quickly as possible. Rapidly spamming the space bar during ALL conversations has reduced the movie/game time from 90/10% to about 70/30% =(  Update 2: Tried to keep going but just way to boring, quit in the middle of some quest I could care less about and went back to playing insurgency/starcraft/etc.",

So, i thought that this game would be a good one for me, however, the vision blur sucks, even though i turned it off something still feels wrong with turning in this game. I expect AAA games that i spend 60 dollars for to have refined controls and game mechanics, vision blur is something you should have the choice to turn on, not be forced to turn off.   Also, I thought that this game was supposed to be an open-world choose you own adventure type thing, like skyrim. If you're looking for that i would run because this is not it... this is the most story-based open world game i've every played, and even though the trailers would like to say otherwise these are the facts. This game is insanely linear and story based (yes fanboys, I did play past the tutorial) but if you are into that sort of thing along with fantasy games, I would recomend  Also, the games use of the xbox controller makes me wonder how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the console version of the game is. upon plugging in your controller you will find that you only have acess to 1/8 of the things you can do in the game... (there shouldnt be that many controls anyways) and I am aware that there a shortcuts included that you have to work around in the controller... but this is not that, half of the combat moves are not available, and it is hard to find the menu you are looking for without using a mouse.   Overall I would say that the publisers were eager to get a paycheck, and they knew that the hype would allow them to shove ♥♥♥♥ down the players mouths, and people would still ask for more. If you got to the bottom im amazed that you read this far.. i warn you don't get this game.",

To put it simple:  If you like tv soap operas like game of thrones...  If you are not freaking fed up of elves and dwarves in every bloody fantasy franchise (this is more of Sapowski´s fault than the game studio)...  If you think that the open world model taken from arseassins creed (basically a sea full of dots with mini events attached to them) is the best way of create open worlds... If you like really uncomfortable inventory systems... If you want to see naked women because its the most cool thing for the sake of it even if its just a way to attract nerds... If you like CSI... If you just take the graphics in consideration... If you like repetitive @nal quests involving using CSI techniques to find a chest full of w@nk or to figure out if the butler is the murder... If you like to spam (literally spam) the space bar button to skip the horrid, boring dialogues -this might be a bit of a contradiction tho since im assuming you will like game of thrones but nevermind me-... If you like fast travel, horses, goats, sheeps, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who look like clowns, lots of swearing with or without reason, wolf meat, an@l alchemy and crafting systems that seem taken from any mmo from the early 2000s, a ♥♥♥♥ ton of main and secondary quests to show the world the alpha male you are...

I completely lost clue -and worst of all, interest- of what the hell was going on by the time I arrived to Velen.   The things I liked about this game, unfortunately, are secondary characters such as Letho or Lambert, the Gwent game, some aspects of the combat and obviously the graphics (yes those repetitive woods and swamps with the ocassional spot to clean monsters).  Im still struggling to finish the main quest. Would like to add the fact that I have not read the novels and stories by Sapkowski, that they seem to be highly regarded in terms of quality etc, but as mentioned before, im sick of elves and dwarves.

So, if you buy it, do it at your own risk.  edit:  I've found out that crashing issues are pretty common with the game, as lots of people also complain about similar problems in several forums. Finally i got the game running for extended periords of time by tweaking with nvidia drivers (there is a legacy verison out there built specifically for the game) and lowering visual setting down to 30 fps. The game totally deserves the effort.  Sadly, i also have to say that i've run into a handful of bugs (uncompletable quests, swords and abilities not usable in combat, horse riding problems). Not a lot, but enough to annoy.  One feature that i find very unrefined is the game's inventory. It's counterintuitive in many actions you can perform, offers only 4 quick slots for a couple dozens of available consumables, and applying them directly from the menu is clumsy as it often breaks the tempo in battle. Also, you will end up having a lot of similar graphic potion items with different colors which you must constantly mouseover in order to remind the effects. One user here suggested that this is because the game is controller friendly.  On the bright side, the more the story advances the more interesting it gets. Very good plot and well told.",

I play at 1440P Resolution on a 55' UHD TV with settings on highest and hair works for Geralt, with FPS ranging from 55-75. I started off playing at 4k resolution, but the FPS drop was down in the upper 40's and would go to lower 30's during battles. The difference between 1440P and 4k, aside from FPS, was barely noticeable.   Battle System: 6/10 Battles in the game are fun at first, but get boring and easy as you proceed through the game. The targeting system is rather annoying, especially if using a steam controller. Rather than an auto targeting system of targeting the nearest enemy, you have to switch amongst the enemies manually with an already pre-occupied thumb. This doesn't matter when you are fighting 1-3 enemies, but when you have 20 people on your ♥♥♥, it gets really annoying! Having different types of combo effects would have been nice. Often times, I felt like I was just button mashing attacks, dropping a sign here and there, dodging, rolling etc - boring.  Gameplay: 5/10 Riding the horse sucks. Swimming sucks. Geralt's 'fast' spinning sword attack isn't very fast and leaves him open to getting attacked while in swing. Casting Signs are cool at first, but really don't ever evolve into anything THAT cool.. The interaction with other characters is fun. The game isn't very challenging for the most part, unless you attempt missions outside of your level. Boss fights are pretty lame and easy - if you've ever played God of War 3 you will understand this. Wish you could choose to play the game as Ciri, she is much quicker and more fun to play with than Geralt, at least at the end of the game :). I investigated as many Q marks as I could take, felt like I was running pointless errands and got bored, lost interest in the game. I often found myself falling asleep while playing, or leaving the game on while I did other things around the house. You could probably subtract about 30 hours of gameplay off the listed time from that alone.  Storyline: 4/10 The entire goal of this game is to find Ciri. Towards the end, you find Ciri. WOW who would have thunk? It was often just annoying and dragged on and on and on and on some more. There weren't any plot twists. None, other than deciding how you want the game to end or who you decide to romance. It was so dull that by the end of the game I had zero fracks to give about what happened to Ciri, Geralt, or anyone for that matter. Somehow I managed to push through and beat it regardless of my lack of interest..   If you like games that lack plot, go for it. It truly is a beautiful game, but that is all I can honestly give it.",

            "review_text": "I was so excited to see this coming out. I was hoping for something that would have me minimalizing my awe for Skyrim; instead, to my horror, I found a potentially amazing game that was totally nerfed. They built this game for platforms! This is the scourge of gaming! This is an issue that plagues PC gaming and this game epitomizes it. I wish they would place in their advertising what platform the game was designed for and then ported to.   This is an AMAZING platform game. I think up there with Red Dead Redemption (love that game… only reason I plug in my Xbox… worthless PoJ)… It has a massive world and a lot to do in it. The story lines are solid and carry over from the previous versions very well. I am a little annoyed with how much they break up the world; but I believe this is needed to accommodate the puny memory of platforms (my PC sports 32gb and I have been itching for a reason to increase it). I love the animations. They have put a lot into the movements and reality of the strikes. I wish they went one step further, such as Age of Conan; but I am not disappointed.   Ok… I’ll ease into my disappointments. Firstly, there are a lot of items to hunt, gather, store, craft, etc. This would be great, but it costs cash to do most of it, and you can only craft at certain locations. This means hauling around tons of junk and having to stop at each bush and shiny item. I hacked money by 5 hours in. Because they allow me to own my own game, and I can hack out these annoyances, I could begrudgingly forgive the developers. I am absolutely disgusted by the cloud based games and software.  The most egregious of issues with Witcher is its interface. An interface should be as invisible to the user as possible. The more intuitive and connective the interface is, the more immersive and, in my opinion, enjoyable the game. This game is trying to please all of the markets. This is the failing of many of the modern games. Let’s face it, I have significantly more options with a standard keyboard (102 and shift and control and alternative functions… so I guess 408+) and use significantly more muscle groups in controlling with a PC vrs controller (2 thumbs and a couple fingers vers my entire arm and fingers). All console games use cheat aim bots or console players would never hit anything; I can hit pixels with my 6400 DPI mouse.  Controlling Wither’s movements or his horse is a lesson in frustration, especially in confined locations. I wish I could zoom in and out of first person perspective and take direct control over my movements. You have to be in the right spot and orientation to loot or interact; which could have been possible without all of the extra movement animations.  I love this game and hate it. I wish I could get my money back. I will never preorder again because of these types of issues. Developers, please stop atrocities like this! If you feel that you must try to own every market, then develop a solid PC game and dumb it down for the platform versions. Yea, the platformers will scream, but they are living in a limited world in their platforms (I can always easily out build platforms, even without using top of the line PC parts). You will find that they will either switch to be a PC gamer quick, or they will buy 2 versions of the game. Games really came to life with PCs, please stop killing the gaming industry by limiting your capabilities to the boundaries of platforms. I have an old PC and still sport a 12 core processor. Please let us use it!!!! ",

Manoeuvring Geralt feels like you're steering a drunkard by proxy--precise movements are absolutely impossible.  Combat is a joke--too much attempted 'realism' with absolutely no clue what that means. I think my favourite 'feature' is when foes can attack instantly after being damaged; that or the way Geralt's hamfisted stumbling makes any kind of finesse during combat a complete impossibility.  Dialog advancement is glitchy; the entire UI lags horribly.  Some hotkeys can't be remapped, or can't be mapped to certain buttons, even when unlocking the controls.  Update: there is a quicksave, but it's not listed in the controls menu. WTF?  Having to 'equip' passive skills is a horrible, horrible idea.  All that said, if the developers actually had half a clue, they could fix all this crap; The Witcher 3 is a horrible game with a good game inside it desperately trying to claw its way out.",

Geralt on horseback feels like driving a schoolbus through a forest and the camera seems to have a life of its own. Controlling Geralt alone doesn't feel much better, especially in combat where the camera manages to do the most amazing and utterly useless things. Geralt sometimes sheathes his weapon in battle, but that's fine. Older guys like him should have a break from time to time.   Items a player can interact with nearly drove me insane, e.g. looting a corpse often ended up in running around the corpse (several times) and trying to find the sweet spot where i might be able to hit a key to actually loot the body.  Please note, that this game has many candles/lights that are unlike the lootable corpses VERY eager to react on the player and love to be either ignited or extinguished.   Oh, i also console-leveled my character, to see what combat becomes when Geralt has good gear and abilities. The combat made no difference to me, except, that low levels could no longer kill me off while i was trapped in animationsequences, which btw is another annoying thing in this game.   No. I did not use mouse/keyboard for the controls but an xbox-controller.  And no: this title is not trying to achieve the same effect as e.g. Darksouls does. Darksouls' controls are the way they are on purpose and they are precise and predictable. The controls in witcher 3 are just sluggish and unresponsive. I do not agree on using witcher 3's technique to make combat more interesting.  After 25 hours of gameplay i simply gave it up, and i probably wouldn't have, would i have been dragged into the storyline during those 25 hours. Unfortunately this wasn't the case, either. Though some characters in this game are memorable and have a certain depth, none of them made me want to learn more about the story/lore and get more involved. Who was this Ciri person again? Nevermind, i don't care. Neither for anyone else of the NPCs. There are indeed a lot of side-quests, but all quests i did felt somewhat shallow and combined with the horrible controls they were not really that exiting.  The graphics are allright for me, especially the charactermodels are nicely done. The world the player can 'explore' looks good and feels vast, although it's often as empty as parts of the falskaar-mod for skyrim. You can ride along with Geralt and his schoolbus, but there isn't much to do or stop for.   The performance is more or less ok on an i7-3770k/16GB Ram and a gtx 770. It sometimes feels a bit laggy, but not unplayable.   Overall a disappointment given the price of this game.",

Combat is sluggish and nonsensical. Overpowered enemies wait behind many turns and experience is difficult to gain so quickly avoiding them is the only recourse. Loading screens are long and drawn out and the music is repetitive and annoying after 30 minutes of play. NPCs are so generic it seems like they were pulled straight from other games of the same vain. The main character is boring and the story is uninteresting. The war-torn countryside and the people affected ought to make for a compelling story but thus far the only interaction you have with the storyline is doing the same quests you’ve done a million times if you play these types of games. Clear the monsters out of a house or rescue a brother or protect a merchant. One of the worst parts is a lack of frequent auto saves. Your character is frequently a pushover and death will come, but unless the gamer is diligent enough to constantly manually save, you’ll find yourself transported across the map and have tones of work and travel undone. This wouldn’t be so bad if travelling was interesting or unlocked cool gear or something. However, once you’ve explored the 30th village that looks the same as the last 29, one starts to wonder why?

As well as the Steam reviews of people with a handful of hours praising it to be one of the best games of all time.  Suffers with massive performance issues. Graphics were clearly downgraded and are on par with the console versions, even at ultra. Yet you will struggle to maintain 40FPS on medium, even with higher end cards.   Vegetation is terribly done. Grass and small plants are static. Small trees and bushes are made entirely of light, and pass through Geralt with ease.   Game has many bugs and AI issues too.   It's clear not much effort was put into the game performance and visual-wise. Lack of optimisation makes the game far from worth the $60 asking price.  Developers lied about exploration too. Remember when they said 'If you see it, you can go there'? Well... You can't. 'No invisible walls' ring a bell? False too. Whilst they're not invisible walls, if you stray too far from the enclosed map, you get a warning that you've 'reach the world's end' and must 'turn back'. If you fail to turn back, the map opens up and you must fast travel somewhere.   Do not trust CDPR. People always went on about Valve being for the gamer, and yet they aren't. The case is the same with CDPR.  Finally, to put things into perspective: My rig:  i5 4690k GTX 770 OC'd (2GB VRAM) 8 gigs of RAM, and all the rest.   I get 40 FPS at most with plenty of drops running on medium at 1080p. The game looks like something from 2013.   Disgusting.",

When going up or down steep terrain, the horse would rarely tip forwards and appear to be trying to walk on its front two legs. This is only a visual problem and it quite funny to see. it isn't worth worrying about as it is rare and only typically lasts until the horse has a reason to tilt to match the ground again.

Damnit! Maybe I shouldn't save that one guy, because i killed 4 to save him! What am I doing with my life? - Mobs are actually challenging -&gt; You will fear mobs hitting you - Gwent is stupid fun - The horse isn't nearly as dumb as people make it out to be (or it was patched) - Most quests are very fun, immersive and challenging. - I'm afraid of going in the water, every damn time something sneaks up on me (and again, mobs actually HURT) - I hate enchanting and making pots over and over and over and over; In Witcher 3, you make a pot once and it automitically replenishes when you rest (with material components)  Cons - Yes, there are tons and tons of NPCS - but i have seen the same model of a NPC 3-4 times on the same screen! They needed to fix the way NPC models are chosen and how many of that model can display at one time - Alot of voices are reused (understandble, there's soo many NPCs to interact with - but kind of immersion killing) - They could have done better on gear - everything feels very much the same, with maybe an extra slot or an extra stat here and there (at least there's more than 4 gear sets, such as with skyrim) - Gwent is single player only  - There is some repetition on quests, like the 'go collect this' from WoW (for example) to' go find this and likely kill it' - Cross bow is extra effective underwater (cause somehow that makes more sense than being able to use powers) - Im a Witcher and can't find receipeies for Witcher potions without visiting 1,000,000 vendors first.... - Crafting and Alchemy are much more annoying than interesting  I know im forgetting some stuff, but really this is a great game; and i don't take the time to do reviews very often  So hopefully that says something about how much i think they did a great job on this game",

But The Witcher has a magic to it all it's own. Despite not being really innovative in any obvious way, I love it dearly. It is masterfully crafted. The level of care with which it was made shows everywhere. The open world and the characters in it feel extremely genuine, and as such the game is compelling and immersive.  After three games and around 150 hours of playing as Geralt of Rivia, I am sincerely sad to see it end. I feel richer for having played it, and poorer for having finished it.

I can think of one quest where the giver asks you to go talk to someone for them but it's because you are asking for a favor and just dropped a couple weeks worth of work on them to complete in a single night. The point is that the quests never feel like busy work and a lot of them lead to interesting stories that develop the non-primary characters beyond their roles as quest objects.  Beyond the great game itself, the development team is truly amazing. From the game to the FREE DLC, they have displayed the care and product buy-in that few development houses display. I rarely invest in a season pass but I intend to throw as much money at CD Projekt Red as I can to ensure this development method continues. If I had the money I would become an investor.

The things that could use some work are: Trading - the conversion rate and prices make trading something you do very little. money is hard to come by and that means you rarely shop. Gamepad configuration - a bit annoying, buttons can be confusing, some issues when selecting items with the gamepad. The limited amount of shortcuts means that you have very little tacticle use of various potions and the lack of shortcuts or favorits for oils means you have to keep going throught the menus. Monster / battle experience - most of the experience in the game comes from quests, it would have been nice to get some more rewards for leveling up through open exploration.

The pros and cons can be viewed in any review, but for this one, I will say this: In addition to a well developed plot, beautiful scenery, and an entertaining combat system, the Witcher manages to achieve what few games can- a sense of immersion in a world that is anything but sugarcoated. Gone are the days of a joyful go-here-do-this world. In this game, you'll be required to make meaningful choices that you may or may not regret. Helping some children here may lead to political deaths elsewhere. In summary, choose carefully, and happy hunting.",

It's an ambitious beast, and it delivers its mammoth story with finnesse , and a new, very high standard to which big name RPGs will have to follow  This game is the result of hard work and dedication which started 8 years ago, in a humble small studio in a cold city. If you play one RPG this year, make it this one.  You play as Geralt, a mutated human, pushed through trials and tribulations at a young age to become a Witcher, a monster slaying machine of grey morality and silver hair, in a world that both fears him and is repulsed by his presence...a neccesary evil in a time of war and death  I'm not going to bother talking about its graphics, sound and combat because to be honest they are all up to par, and if your spending your time looking at buying the game based off those you're missing the point of it  This is a game to be felt, to be experienced, to feel alive in.   This game will shock you, move you and make you think about the decisions you made long after you stop playing it  Do yourself a favor and get comfortable, tune out the world, and experience this masterpeice of fiction in all its glory.   Forget what you think you know about big title rpgs.  Bravo CDPR, Bravo.",

You just have a good company that bring a fun game and work its ♥♥♥ off to provide fixes &amp; content post release. Here, you have the same thing, with way less issues.  - Really feels like a lot of thoughts and details was put in all the aspect of the game. Potions &amp; concotions, horse fighting &amp; fear level, quest &amp; exploration.  - You get a terrific sensation of 'wide world'. I was able to see, far in the distance, some noticeable scenery (a big city &amp; its lights at night, a huge wicked tree) and know that I would be able to go there and visit the place. It's a great feeling. The game is not fully open world, but it's the next best thing.  The game fighting system might not be the hardest one (I'm playing with the prior to last difficulty level, and it's no Dark Soul difficulty), but fighting 'bosses' still feel Witcher like : You can suffer hell or have the easiest time if you prepared yourself carrefully. The card game is a nice touch, although spending time playing card when you have an emergency such as the wild horde is ... weird ?  But overall a great time if you like CRPGs.",

CDProjekt RED made no mistakes when writing it, especially because of the fact that it is totally non-linear. All the quests are very smooth and don't drag on too long. Even if there is a lot of traveling involved, I have always found it fascinating to ride through unexplored terrain on horseback, even discovering new towns whilst in the middle of a quest, which I may do upon my own bidding. The characters, you may love or you may hate, but they strike emotion, and that is what makes them unforgettable. The world is vast and filled with a myriad of things to explore. It would take hours for me to bore myself looking around the map, let alone a single town. It is very obvious that there was some inspiration from other games, such as Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. If you have not played either of the first two Witcher games, I recommend you play at least one to familiarize yourself with some of the core elements of the game.  I am afraid , however, I must address the graphics. If you were expecting to play what you saw in the 2013/2014 trailers, then you may be disappointed. The game was heavily optimized to keep frame rates up. In doing thus, the game has become a lot less pretty and overwhelmingly realistic. The foliage is clearly not three dimensional, the hair (even with Nvidia Hairworks) does not look very kosher, and some of the terrain textures look rather grainy. There is still some very beautiful imagery, but overall, it is definitely not up to par with some of the less recent games, like DA: Inquisition. However, this does not take away from the gameplay.  All in all, this game is a marvelous experience and I highly recommend you try it out, graphical downgrade aside.",

As a Witcher veteran I can say without any doubt that this is the best game in the series to date.   As of right now, I recommend the game based on this simple fact: It is outstandingly optimized! My PC has a GTX 660 with an i5-4960. I can crank this game up to high and easily hit MY playability threshold (as a person who used to play solely on consoles) of 30 FPS at 1920x1080. CDPR has put painstaking amounts of love into their magnum opus, and it shows in every nook and cranny of the beautifully realized Northern Realms. I intend to make this far more extensive as my adventure unfolds, but as it stands today, my recommendation is quite simple: BUY THIS GAME!  **Edit: May 24, 2015**  IT JUST. KEEPS. GOING! I have NEVER seen a game so deep, rich, and bursting with things to do. Nearly 20 hours in at this point, I have played only 3 story missions. This world is massive and beautiful, yet has a strange way of feeling cramped and horrendous. Life is not easy for the Nordlings, and I, as Geralt, can only do so much to help people. The world's main city, Novigrad, is big enough to be an open world in and of itself. That this game has been defamed by some in the community because it *GASP* doesn't look as good as it did two years ago is a crime. This game is too good to be criticized for something so minute that happens to every game. Yes, it's still beautiful, and the patch released earlier this week improved performance greatly. Especially for those of us who have a mid-range graphics card.  If there is one MINOR criticism I can levy here, it's that leveling up can be quite difficult and tedious at first. Take my advice and go questing before you begin your exploration. You enter the main world at around Level 4, and can quickly find yourself outmatched. Such a criticism really is only a nitpick. This may be the best game I have ever played.",

I have been a gamer for the most part of my life, but it all started when i played Pokemon Yellow version on the Gameboy advance. Then I graduatly moved to the PC era of my life and i played many extremly well made games. Such as Tomb raider (2013), League Of Legends, Payday 2 and Battlefield 3/4. But I never encounted such a well made game as the witcher 3 Wild hunt, and be aware that I havent played previous witcher games.   But this game is truly exquised and deserve all the love it can possiblie get. even though I havent played for so long yet I have seen the glory of the witcher 3 and I adore it.   Its such a well made game it has marvilous graphics and a intreagin story to tell. And it has the Right/Wrong side of the witcher that makes it a rather spectacular game.  So if you are in to these sorts of games I think that you should put away those 60 euros that is costs and buy it.  I rate it 10/10 'best game i played'",

            "review_text": "after about 33 hours of play over the past few days I have to say this game is one of the best if not the best games i have played in recent memory. Everything works wonderfully and builds upon itself. the cities, towns, villages, woods and caves all feel natural, dynamic and the scale is immense. in comparison to the previous Witcher games this, in my opinion, is the best one and a great improvement on the other games.  Looking at the negative comments, that are actually about the game and not about crashes (i only crashed once in the first 5 hours and no problems since), many witcher 2 fans are complaining about the combat and potion mechanics. In my opinion the streamlining of combat and potions is a welcome one as Witcher 2's worst aspect was the fairly clunky combat and infuriating potion mechanic where you could only take potions before combat even began (or more likely after you died and had to restart since its hard to predict when you will enter combat). I still love the witcher 2, but the improvements to witcher 3's combat system is what has kept me so engaged in contracts (I love contracts) and hunting down question marks in the search of loot. its also not as if the streamlining of combat/potions ruins the complexity of combat and hunting, there is still a lot of thought that has to go into how you fight and use potions on the higher difficulties.  problems:  if i had a complaint it would be that the way they 'block' you from certain regions is to have incredibly strong enemies block your path which is a smart way of doing so, except that you can get around most of them very easily due to your horse and players who don't take the hint will spend endless hours attempting to complete quests/question marks they are simply not strong enough or good enough to complete. It is the souls approach to telling players they are not ready, but these regions are in areas where fairly low leveled players can easily get to and the difficulty is pretty much one hit you die, so its not really a big problem and i probably wouldn't change it because the other options is invisible walls which is even worse, but still this could have been implemented better.  another aspect i really disliked was how choices were some times (very rarely) to ambiguous and what Geralt did in response was not what i wanted to do. for example, i wanted to save this certain character but the options given were 'I can't let you do that' and 'its suicide', i thought the first option was me saying i can't let you kill yourself while the latter was letting them walk away and most likely die, however the first option started a combat section where i ended up killing the character i wanted to save. I scum saved, the first time i really felt i had to do so because the game didn't make the decision clear, and picked the latter which led me to having the ability to save the character. this is a rare thankfully as most choices are for the most part clear on what you chose and what you are going to do, but it gets annoying when such ambiguous answers are given to you.  these are the only two problems i have with the game and they are very minute, the rest of the game is fantastic from story to game play to graphics (the game still looks amazing even with the 'downgrade' and the performance more than makes up for it, it is probably more important and why the downgrade happened). i highly recommend it as a must buy, even if you are not an RPG fan, you will find something you like.  you might also get addicted/enraged at playing Gwent with NPC's who cheat like dirty....i won't get into it.",

            "review_text": "This is an update on my first review of the game which i did about 1-2 days into the release. Now that I've completed the game once (and plan to play it again) i feel like i can do better justice to this amazing epic game. Yes there are small minor bugs and there are performance issues for lower end systems but that's to be expected for newer games these days. At the same time thought CDprojekt red is doing their hardest to keep this game relevant and supported for anyone and everyone who is trying to play it on a machine that meets their minimum requirements with constant updates. At the time of me writing this the game is currently on patch 1.04 and they just released two new pieces of free DLC, one cosmetic and another a quest.   What makes this game fantastic is quite simple really, aside from the cutting edge graphical fidelity and the amazingly well crafted open world that the game exists in; the main things that really keep you going are the story and the characters. When i talk about the story I'm not just talking about the main storyline either, which by the way is top shelf, I am also talking about the game's numerous side quests and side missions. Unlike say, dragon age Inquisition's version of side missions, TW3's side quests have many different elements to them that put them well beyond MMO-style quests. Many have interesting and deep plots with twists and turns. For instance, I found a woman who was looking sister. While trying to find her sister I find out that that sister's husband is a werewolf who accidently killed his wife because her sister (the one who gives you the quest) took her to see him to try to scare her away from him so that she could take him all for her self. You than are left with a series of choices that truly beg on your morality as to what to do about the entire situation.   Each of the side quests and the main quest have so much depth that you can tell that some one sat down and put a ton of time and effort into all the minor details to make you feel emotionally invested. When you do engage in a side quest, (no matter how short), you easily get emotionally invested enough to not think its a waste of time to do so. As far as the main quest goes, though the plot is rather simple, (Gerald is looking for some one) the actual execution and story telling is very rich and non-linear making it feel very much like a sequel to the other two witcher games (which it is). If you aren't familiar with the witcher series you can easily get lost with the main story, but this isn't a bad thing because this is after all a sequel. If you haven't played the witcher 1 or 2, I recommend you start there before going on to play this game, to not do so would be robbing you self of some truly unique and great experiences in gaming.   There is a very deep and well made crafting system, a collectible card game that can rival standalone card games like hearthstone, an alchemy system that is just as deep as the crafting system, a well made skill system that makes how you level a choice and of course an extremely detailed open world. TW3 is imo one of the best open world RPG games simply because of how much attention the developers put into the details of that open world. Games like skyrim and oblivion sacrifice the depth of their main storylines in favor of having more content rather then more quality content, while TW3 strikes a nice balance between these two. Not only this but small things like bandits coming to attack a caravan on the trail while you are riding by or monsters attacking a village truly make the world feel dynamic because you can choose to deal with these problems or you can choose to ignore them and the world will keep changing either way. Also, the fact that they chose not to implement a level scaling system for the monsters really helps make the world feel more menacing and keeps the game more difficult. You can easily stumble into an area with monsters that will destroy you if you stray too far away from the path and if you are skilled enough you can still overcome some of these obstacles if you so choose to.  Overall, TW3 is an RPG that no one should miss out on and much like its predecessors, it goes above and beyond all that has come before it in many many ways and sets the bar extremely high for future games.",

All the monsters in this game are incredibly terrifying..i mean spine chilling..hair raising terrifying...the way they move, scream and stare at you! It's so beautifully made and horrifying at the same time. The creators of this game deserve so much credit for their art direction  The music wow...the soundtrack of this game is one of the greatest i have ever heard...actually it could well be number one (it's this or skyrim).   Every battle is tense and the gameplay mechanics are superb..every battle is tactical and needs to be thought out, what oil to use? Potion to drink? which signs? Play this on the higher difficulty for a rewarding experience!  Overall, i have to say that this is one of the best games ever made...i seriously recommend this to any gamer who wants to appreciate and get lost in a horrifying yet beautiful world...a world in which they must survive.",

The game still keeps its strong narrative and character development that it is known for, as well as adding open world features and refining the combat system. I'd recommend playing it on one of the higher difficulties, because at the lower levels it can be a bit easy. As far as sidequests go, the ones in this game are surprisingly good. I tend to avoid 100% completing games because of how dull sidequests can be a lot of the time, but I enjoyed them all and had no issue with going around and exploring every inch of the world map. The one thing I neglected to do was play the card minigame, Gwent, which just didn't grab hold of me because I don't really enjoy card games in general, but it's definitely worth a try if you are into that sort of thing.

It’s not easy to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing The Witcher 3’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds; feels better than Elder Scrolls ever did. There is a handy minimap that points you to where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. Though the straightforward and fetch-quest-heavy main story is a bit much, the option of joyfully adventuring through a rich, expansive open world was always there for me to wonder around in and goof off when I started to burn out. And while the plot isn’t too terribly interesting overall, the many characters that play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, it moves The Witcher 3 to a new level few other RPGs inhabit.",

The only one thing I don't understand at all is that how are these bombs are refilled with an alchagest and ♥♥♥♥? How the ♥♥♥♥? They are bombs after all! Also they said that there will be some problems with money, so i listened to the developers and looted everybody, selling their stuff has made me 10 times more money than the contracts! So what's the point of them? Cource I understand that they are very interesting and blablabla, but still how do I live on this 100-200coin salary per week? Absurd. Anyway i had 10k+ gold at the lvl 12 mark, even though I've always repaired my equipment and crafted some new at the blacksmiths. In level 30 i had like 30-40k gold, before i decided to spent it for the best equipment i've ever found. EXP is another story. When i've started to play levels were very tiresome to achieve. Killing the common beast granted you nearly 6-10 exp. and the monsters were like 50-100 exp. After lvl 15 you're like lvl 30 in seconds. Still have a feeling that developers were just tired to do something more about it, so they decided to make the storyline giving you 500-1500 exp. for doing absolutely nothing. Ofcource you have to kill some people, to resque someone.. But in normak quests you had like 100 exp. for that!? How is this real? And the point before the fight when you're lvl22. Wtf? Why would you give me 100500 exp, so i rank 3 lvls up just for watching the dialogs? Kinda strange to me. Good game anyways, hope no spoilers included.

But I don't think any number of words can truly captivate how much I enjoyed this compelling and beautiful experience.   Dislaimer: I did not play the Witcher 1 or 2. You can still pick up and enjoy this game with no prior experience, especially if you do a little reading on the previous games.   Breath taking environments. Atmospheric. Gorgeous.   Quests -- both main and side -- that make you think and make hard decisions that can shape how the game plays out. I've never been so engaged in quests. I paid attention to every single one I came across, even the seemingly insignificant side quests. Some were brutal. Some were tragic. Some were sad. Some were humorous. And some were even happy. Emotions were evoked.   Much of the dialogue is clever. The characters are well crafted and interesting. They often respond to your actions and choices with their own persona. The voice acting is great. And the colorful language used is hilarious in its own right.   Ciri. My favorite thing about this game was the vibrance and attitude of Ciri. And Geralt in the Feline armor set. And his hair. And Ciri's eyes. And the story. And the quests. And all the question marks on the map to find. And the fluid animations. And Roach. This game was my favorite thing about this game.  But truly. This is a masterpiece with so much thought and love and care put into its creation. It is master story telling. Gripping. Engaging. Provoking. Every time I took a 'wrong' turn I was devastated. At the very end I repeated to myself what I wanted the ending to be and hoped for it because it meant that much -- after 100hrs I needed a good ending!  My only gripes are minor. Some of the controls are clunky when you are in tight spaces or trying to loot boxes. Occassionally there is a graphic glitch -- like seeing people walking in the background during a cutscene with their hand's missing. Or Ciri missing her scabbard in some scenes. Or some decor on characters vibrating/jiggling. All of which are forgivable and don't break the game. The dev's release patches every so often, which is always a good sign. Speaking of signs, I will agree with others that the combat is a bit repetitive. But there are times it feels truly epic and challenging. And this combat isn't meant to be flashy with tons of flourish and effects and combo button mashing.   10/10 would spend another 100hrs lost in this game.",

Cons- -This is not quite a negative as the game has a difficulty scale but the it is pretty easy on the normal difficulty.You wouldn't be quite needing those potions and ingredients that forms a major part of the gameplay.  -Annoying witcher sense camera which locks on to an over the shoulder view. -Horse controls *facepalm*.

This is the best fantasy single-player RPG so far, the story is a strong point in the game and storytelling flows really well, characters have strong identities and show life-like emotions and the universe is heveily influenced by elements of Eastern European folklore. Gameplay wise it is a smooth experience, combat is really fluid and character movement feels great when set to alternative mode (please DO NOT use the default mode unless you want to feel as you were playing an overweight bear sliding on ice), the equipment system is greatly improved from the previous games and armor sets gives cool bonuses compared to other items. The crafting system is also improved and has been made easier for the better, some may find it too casual but the way it is really encourages players to use potions and oils during fights, which are really useful in higher difficulties.  If you look for a rich story in an open world and a solid gameplay experience you could easily spend several dozens of hours enjoying The Witcher 3 and its latest expansion Hearts of Stone which adds roughly a dozen of hours of gameplay aswell.  There is a NewGame+ mode which allows to restart the game keeping your character progression and gear including money and alchemy recipes.",

Dark, realistic world, engaging story, VERY accessible to players new to the franchise. This is how open world should be done. 9/10)  The world is dark and realistic. You are a Witcher, a monster hunter, wandering a war torn land as astride your trusty Roach. You travel from town to town collecting bounties for slaying forktails, breaking curses, and knocking off the odd griffin while searching for your 'daughter'. It's a huge, expansive world, yet it feels full rather than big for bigness sake. Each side quest has enough of a story to make it interesting and fit with the world. You are often confronted with choices, but rarely is it a choice between clearly good and clearly evil, i.e. 'A) Save the orphanage, B) Light the orphanage on fire'. The choices are more often 'You can save the orphanage, but by the way one of the orphans is Hitler.'  Not many developers could make an RPG this story intensive yet still accessible to new players. In fact, coming in on the third episode I had no right to expect to have any idea what was going on. I was pleasantly surprised. The story unfolds in an organic way that gently guides you into this world. It gets you invested in these characters, hinting at enough of the old history so you have your bearings yet not drowning you in monologues. The world is dark but not oppressive.  The way the ending you receive is revealed in a similar way to the old Fallout 1 &amp; 2 games. The choices which influenced this ending were not usually broadcast in neon lights or big signs (a la Mass Effect, though I do love those games too) but instead just kind of felt like you playing Geralt the way you thought he ought to be played. It felt very satisfying.  I'd give this game a 9/10. Objectively, I'd rate it as a better RPG than FF6 or KOTOR and that's saying something.",

            "review_text": "Updated 1/25/16 to be a little less... jaded. Now, it goes down smooth with less bitter aftertaste!  TL;DR: I found this game to be quite button-mashey and cutscene-heavy. I still call the first 1/3 of the game a semi-interractive eye-candy dispenser with a 'B movie' story; it LITERALLY feels like an episode of 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.' If you're a fan, you've already got this game, so why are you reading this review? If you're into Swords, dragons, wizards and scantilly-clad brunettes, this will do a smashing job of tantillizing your medieval receptor cortex.   The Long Version:  I recently finished a 300hour marathon of Fallout 4 (not the best game by a LONG shot; dont' get me wrong here, it catered to a different audience entirely), and was itching for something newer than Skyrim, set in medieval times. This looked fun, and was on sale, so I gave it a play.  The first thing I noticed about this game was how insanely long the cutscenes are. The first 30min of the game are nothing but boring movies. Oh, they're gorgeous, in-game-rendered movies, but movies none-the-less. Now, I don't mind a cutscene here-or-there, but I REALLY don't much care for cutscenes in games; they rip me out of the game world and take whatever feeling of immersion I had, and toss it aside. It's not just the beginning of the game, either; cutscenery is very prolific in this world. Basically, the main quest appears to be a mildly-interractive cutscene, reminiscent of the FMV games of yore, but with vastly more gameplay.   The second thing is that the names of nouns are difficult exclusively for the sake of being difficult. I'm not going to remember that Riverghaagdakstead is North of Lokriouamshijiar. I'm not going to recall that I recently acquired a Karmorgaluptilation Sword, am wearing Helengahasdiohtor armor, Jilijimijiuiniji's Boots, and need to eat a Krheim Tussel to heal. Perhaps the names are real places in history, with a real language behind them. To a yankee-doodle like me, the names are just difficult and strongly detract from my gaming experience. When my friends tell me about their adventures in this game, they always go 'I got this one sword,' or 'I found this piece of armor,' or 'That one place with the crumbled red-brick castle,' becasue the names, however authentic, aren't something we're easily able to remember. IT MAKES TALKING ABOUT THIS GAME HARD!  Gameplay-wise, it controls okay-ish. Honestly, I feel that the controls are rather clunky feeling. I rationalize 'the clunk' as the developers attempting to simulate actual human/equestrian movement; you're not just a camera on a stick, no, you're Geralt of Rivia (or a horse), and you can't just move on a whim in whichever direction you please, thanks to inertia and animation-limitations; no, you move LIKE A REAL, LIVING HUMAN (or horse)! That's excellent attention to detail on CD Projekt's behalf, but in reality, this all boils down to rather extreme input lag. Frustrating input lag. Nevermind that Geralt only walks calmly when he's in a bit that requires him to; The rest of the time, he goes from 0 - full jogging-speed, no inbetween. Obviously, that's a binary keyboard control scheme. So, I plug in y'old Logitech F310, and give it a try. On the analog sticks, he has 2-speeds on the stick. NOT analog movement; 2-speed. I sincerely hope this is/was a bug that will/has been rectified; we haven't had awkward 2-speed controls since the days of the PSone transitioning to analog sticks.  Combat is very dazzling and acrobatic. Geralt autotargets whichever enemy is within the detection circle, or whichever he is most facing. Battle, although at times requiring you to use special potions/salves/whatever magic is called in this game/items rapidly degrades into what feels like an auto-aiming 'Devil May Cry' button-mash, with Geralt suddenly whipping, spinning, whirling, dancing, flipping, jumping, hacking, slashing and eviscerating the n'er-do-wellers. Tactics (ambushing, hiding) are very difficult to pull off, since everything is 3rd person (not that this game is about such nonsense, because it isn't!) The real challenge is trying to figure out what 'trick' you need to perform to beat the baddie(s); what's it weak against, and do I posess any?   Grumble, grumble, grumble... This game is exclusively 3rd person. I strongly dislike this aspect; it serves VERY little purpose, aside to show-off the hairFX. It instantly makes any aiming or precision movement a very delicate and involved task. Geralt takes up considerable real-estate on the screen, too, so it's not just a slight nuisance, but a real problem. Most of the time is spent navigating the camera so you can see what's going on in front of the protagonist, since his gloriously rendered dorsal fin is always in the way. Goodness, imagine if you could only see things that were 20-feet in front of you, because you had something Geralt-sized blocking the lower-region of your peripherary.... that'd be awful, and is in this game, too. Just an opinion; a preference; a flavor. If staring at Geralt's manly backside doesn't bother you, or if you actually enjoy it, good for you; standing in a checkout/lunch line must be the highlight of your day!  The item system. Let's boil it down real simple-like: Sword 1a does 10-15 DMG, and Sword 1b does 9-16 DMG, and sword 1c does 11-13 DMG. They're the same sword, just different DMG, Diablo style! *SPECIAL* sword 1 requires a SPECIFIC person to forge it, rendering it almost obsolete by the time you get it, but TOTALLY gives you cred with the smitty crowd. Herbs and spices make potions, bombs, different herbs and spices, and forging materials. Master Hunter Diapers can be weaker than normal Hunter Diapers, Diablo style. It was explained to me that 'if one person made many items, they could be of different qualities, depending on how he felt at that time, or how rushed he was.' honestly, it feels like the item system is a rather early alpha test of the Diablo system, that got hacked and pirated somewhere in China, then got marketed on eBay as the latest version. The item system suits its purpose; it stops the game from becoming a grind-fest, and it gives you the motivation you need, in order to hunt down monsters. Although.... it would have been SUPER cool if it had a true Diablo item system (prefix, item type, suffix, item modifier [legendary/magic/set/unique/common])... but I can't be critical of something it CAN'T have (right?).  Overall, this game feels like it has had a LOT of effort put into it; lots of attention to details, which most games are missing these days. It Seriously NEEDS A STICKER that advertises the fact that it has at least 2-scoops MORE LOVE than the competing brand. That being said, I suppose there is some sort of triangle to be had, between gorgeous graphics, a deep story, and excellent gameplay mechanics; you can pick any 2 you like, or interpolate a tertiary mixture thereof. The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt seems to be shifted strongly towards graphics and story, and somewhere in the middle for gameply. Not a bad game; there are many, many, many worse abominations called 'games' that never should have been produced. Everyone lauds this game and CD Projekt One, but I personally wish that Rockstar had worked their GTA5 magic on this one; it might have played better and been seemless, still retaining the cutscenes and curly-haired goth gals, et al. Then again, Geralt may have been transformed into a medieval middle-aged man having a mid-life crisis in middle earth, while in the middle of his bathing session, or something to that effect. B+",

One of these are the witcher gear diagrams, which are arduous to collect (since there are different tiers of the same gear you need to collect as you level up) and the level requirement for the collecting quests dont make sense with regards to the actual level requirement of the gear. Also sometimes the difficulty seems a bit off, especially when you fight enemies above your level, which you basically cant hurt. Other then that, this game is 10/10.",

The first moment you enter the isles of Skellige and see a sunset over the snowy mountaintops is breathtaking.  The gameplay is enjoyable and fluid, far more so than the prior game which had issues with animation locks. The addition of a small sidestep helps to avoid attacks where a roll is unecessary, and allows room for brutal finishers.

In my opinion if you ever play The Witcher 3, playing through the Blood and Wine expansion is a MUST. Geralt is placed in this beautiful new world to explore and the main questline is a huge step forward from the rest of the game. The final quest is by far my favourite, so please keep playing to the end! It is definitely worth it!  To the developers CD Projekt RED I cannot thank you enough for what you have created here.

I love everything about this game except for the following annoyances. -Geralt and Roach are difficult to control out of combat. -The system of meditating to refill your alchemy items is excellent but I feel it needs some tweaking to improve it. Maybe your alchemy items fill a little bit after each battle so you still need to meditate but not a frequently. -A little less reliance of the witcher senses to progress quests ",

I really like the glossary an how in-depth the creature information is. there is good dismemberment. considering how similar it is to skyrim as far as time period and being fantasy open world, it's pretty different from skyrim. It's kinda hard to describe but it's got its own character, even with the similarities. I think it may be because in skyrim you were an adventurer but in this game it's actually your occupation. There as some glitches but none that are anything but a little comical. My to biggest complaints are that it's too short, I beat the main story and almost all the side stuff in about 100 hr. And I take my time. My other complaint is that there's not enough stats, like monsters killed, neckers killed, potions taken etc. If you side by side compare this to skyrim it just can't challenge skyrim, but it's still a very good game, I enjoyed it and will be doing a second play through.",

For me, the main grip which keeps me coming back to this game over the others within my steam library which I haven't finished already, is the way the game puts you in control of a powerful Witcher by the name of Geralt or 'White Wolf' to other witchers.

I remeber back when I played the Witcher 2 how I had hoped for an open world Witcher Game, that combines a lot of characters and plot from the previous game, while still innovating on the origional 'Witcher' design. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was not expecting this! The Witcher 3 is a masterfully crafted game, where most if not all choices affect the ending. One of my favorite aspects of the Wither 3 is the progression in how you craft items, brew potions, and increase your magic ability. In the beginning, you feel a little underpowered for such an infamous man. However, as you get farther into the game, you start to really develop your magical ability, weaponry, and armor, you start to feel your place in the world. You are not the most powerful person in the world, but you definately influence the area arround you. towards the beginning of the game you start to have to figure out what role you want to play, whether you want to focus more on magic, or get most of your power from potions, or if you want to do what I did and get everything. I reccommend taking your time with this game, as progression is slow, but very enjoyable. As for the story, the story was phenomenal. Each mission was unique, fun, and had some tie-in to how you would affect the end of the game. Now, I reccommend doing ALL of the side quests right when you can. At first I went to fast and skipped over and missed several side quests. For those who dont know, after you progress far enough into a crucial plot moment, most of your sidequests will be marked as a failure, so do them while you can. As for end game, there isnt much to do. All the sde quests are finished, and there is no way to go back and do them, unless you've been saving along the way. The only thing left to do are the monster hunts, and gwent. The monster hunts get kinda old after the first one or two, however if you are loking for that 'full game completion' they are necessary for that achievement. Gwent has just been given its own stand-alone game due to the love people had for it in The Witcher 3. I am not one for card games, although I do think it's cool that the devs actually came up with an all new game, with tons of unique cards to play with. Overall, I would rate my experience with The Wither 3 Wild Hunt a 10/10! I loved the story, the sidequests are tons of fun and are shrouded in mysterys sometimes. There is so much to do and explore, and I never had any hardware issues with the game. It has ALWAYS (from day one) run perfectly. So, if you havn'e already, pick up this game, GET IT. I know its not the $60.00 retail it used to be, and it is definately worth the investment.",

It was okayish, but not more. It flatout paled in comparison to The Witcher 3. After that, i played Dragon Age: Inquisition in order to get my RPG buzz back on. Well, it was a dud and i couldn't bring myself to care at all for the nameless inhabitants of what ever this world is called. Geralt of Rivia just showed up, suckerpunched my bland whatshisface-hero from Dragon Age and then silently retreated back into mist of that part of my brain that is usually reserved the memory of my great moments in life. Geralt probably did away with some of those too - Goodbye, Tour through North Africa, see you, memorys of Las Vegas, don't hit the door on your way out, first girlfriend - everytime i try to think of you now, i see a whitehaired dude in armor giving a frying pan to a grandma...   I played this twice. I enjoyed the hell out of it twice. I skipped work i REALLY should have done more often than that because of this game.   And what do they do? They push out two DLC which are even better than the main game at times. Just producing the best antagonist in Hearts of Stone that every saw a screen while bottleflipping.   CD Project Red, congratulations. You just shot yourself in the foot by setting the bar so high that even CJ with a Jetpack can't get over it. Have fun doing your next game where you have to meet skyhigh expectations which you probably meet and ruining RPG's of the next generation, too. Maybe not just RPG's.

            "review_text": "The Witcher 3 is an adult themed action adventure role playing open world game with some changes to the traditional RPG formula, overall this is a near perfect game that exceeds in all aspects, the map is huge with a sheer amount of content, the quests are vast and different from each other, game length wise you are looking at about 50 hours for the main story, a 90 hours for all the side quests, over a 170 for the dlc main and side quests, doing a completionist run can easily take you about 210 plus hours, there are a lot of memorable characters and moments through the game (both funny and serious), and it features CCG minigame that its becoming a thing on its own (gwent/gwint).  The adult themed part it’s something that you should really consider, a lot of games decide to take a childish but safer approach, whereas The Witcher 3 really took a risk that not only worked but separated it entirely from his competition in a good way, it’s not edgy nor it feels too serious.  The game has two expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, originally priced as $10 and $20 US dollars, both expansions are bigger than most single player AAA games on the market.   -Hearts of Stone it’s about making reality some impossible requests from a character, that has, in a way, made a deal with the devil, including attending a party while being possessed by a ghost, and making a heist in The Witcher 3 style, both are epic and worth remembering, it features two different endings that are up to your own interpretation.  -Blood and Wine, gameplay wise this is a huge expansion with a lot of content that makes you feel like starting the game again, story wise this new peaceful-esque land were honor and heraldry are part of everyday life serves as a contrast towards the previous game lands with its different ongoing conflicts, but with some twists already happening but no one noticing, this expansion also serves as an epitome to the Geralt character as well as his proper retirement (he’s 90-100 years old).  The developers of the game (CD Project Red) have delivered us a turn point of what a videogame should be, they have also raised the bar of how you should treat your customer; 16 pieces of free dlc no problem, worth buying dlc and mod support sure, delaying the game to polish it more absolutely, they even made a DRM free version of the game.  You mention near perfect, what about it? IMO there are three minor flaws the game has;  -The overall navigation of the game menus; its a huge game, all entries will be full and its going to be bloated and tedious to navigate later on. -Unbalanced Witcher gear; the game features different sets of Witcher gear with different proprieties, the problem is, that, this particular kind of gear has superior proprieties that most of the game gear, even rare pieces of equipment, however, there is a mod that fixes this. -Fast travel system (I know this one is a bit controversial); you cant just fast travel anywhere, you need to be near a sing post, and while there are many out there this can be annoying on higher levels since you are going to be carrying a lot of loot while being in the middle of nowhere, and walking/galloping towards the nearest sign post can be a bit of a pain, again there is a mod, but be careful because it breaks some quests if you fast travel on particular areas were you shouldnt have been able to do it.  TL;DR: The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece with some minor flaws, the expansions alone are worth more than a lot of games out there, its devs are awesome and delivered what they promised.",

But c'mon, it's the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The most awarded game ever to this date that this review was written. Think about that for a sec. That means something doesn't it? So, enough chattering.  Music, graphics, mechanics, story, gameplay, minigame, DLC. Just a few things that really surprised me for being really good. Well okay, graphics was obvious from the screenshots I saw. The music is beautifully made to the atmosphere in most cut scenes. As well as the voice lines. Also, surprisingly well made are the mimics of the characters in the cutscenes. However somehow Geralt never freakin blinks when you're actually plaing. What a beast.  Gameplay is very smooth. Here and there you might see some bugs, but for an open world game of this size it is acceptable. Today's standarts are still low right?  Story was hearttouching, cute, awesome... yeah just all in all really great. The overall variety of feelings I've experienced during the story were more than I expected. I mean, who cries over a video game right? Okay it was me... Ain't gonna spoil anything though.  So I just wrote a bunch of stuff that really amazed me, made me play through the whole game. Made me collect stuff and buy the GOTY edition. Seriously, if you buy it, then buy the GOTY edition. The DLCs are so cheap compared to what they deliver. Especially Blood and Wine. It's a shame there isn't a third one (yet?). Praises to CD Projekt Red. They deserved all the attention and money they got from this game. I only played it once though, so gotta have to play it at least two more times, like I did with Skyrim.  10/10",

            "review_text": "Simply put, this game is one of the best games made, ever. Some quick Pros and Cons off of the top of my head.  Pros:  * The game is quite lengthy. If you are somewhat of a completionist, it can take 100+ hours to finish just the base game! A great value for what you pay, especially since this game frequently goes on sale.  * The game gives you characters that you will be emotionally attached to.  * Your decisions in the story aren't black and white and easily chosen. Sometimes, you'll sit back and think about the meaning of an event in the game a little more than you would with other games. * Extremely beautiful game.  * Soundtrack and Voice Acting is also quite amazing. * TWO Bonus DLCs (if you buy Game of the Year Version, or Season Pass) which will add a whole lot more hours to your game!   Neutral: * Combat system is not great, but it's not terrible either.  * Riding your Horse (Roach) can sometimes be slightly annoying, but not a huge deal.  * You may or may not feel the game gets a little repetitive, as it is essentially open-world with lots of collectibles/treasures and side quests to complete. This may be something you like, or it may be something you dislike.   Cons: * The ending of the story was not finished cleanly, in my opinion. (Endgame felt rushed, loose ends hanging. It felt like the story rapidly reached its conclusion instead of slowly easing into the final parts of the game).  * Loading times may be slightly on the long side, especially after dying (usually from falls), although this is probably not a problem if you have an SSD. * Start of the game is really really slow (in terms of level progression), but QUICKLY speeds up as you progress. The leveling and item system can be a little confusing sometimes as well.   Overall, this game is a masterpiece, especially given how many big AAA games released nowadays have many issues such as framerate or graphics issues, gameplay issues, releasing half-finished games with the other half as DLC, etc.  Witcher 3 is a clean game where you'll be happy to see that you get (vastly more) than you paid for and expected. A true gem, and a great game fully deserving of all of its awards and praise.  Final Rating: 9.5/10",

After 70 hours, I've just completed the main quest, have seemingly infinite amounts of other things still left to do, and still have all of the DLC campaigns to go! I honestly cannot believe people are so talented that they can create a game such as this. The quests and new content just never end, everywhere I go I find something new, a new quest, new characters, on and on. To get the best experience, do like I do: don't fast travel much, and make it a habit to walk to the majority of your destinations. You will find so much content by doing this that would otherwise be lost by fast traveling. Seek out and explore all the question marks (?) on the maps, etc. I honestly cannot think of one bad thing to say about this game, it's the absolute pinnacle of human gaming development. Amazing.",

After dabbling a little in the great but clunky Witcher 1 and 2, I found myself back in the shoes of Geralt. I went into the game expecting more of the same, great story but was apprehensive about the gameplay and boy was I blown away. Combat flows like an elegant dance, as does the story.   Dialogue options have weight, I've become wary of how my actions might unfold later into the game and I couldn't be happier, it's what I've wanted in a game from the offset.   Graphically, the game is astoundingly beautiful running on Ultra settings on my 980ti with a buttery smooth framerate, and performance as a whole is fantastic, the game takes almost no time at all to boot up to menu on HDD and although initial load times can be a minute or so further load times (on death, large area changes) don't seem to hit the minute mark very often.   I couldn't recommend this game more and hope somebody finds this useful in some way.",

The adventures of the grim-faced double-sword toting man with a heart of gold and eyes of a... something, whom I named Poppycock, started rather meagerly. I collected every bit of scrap a monster dropped, horded like I was auditioning for Horders, and generally tried to craft everything myself. But even crafting with just a wee bit o help from crafters becomes frustrating because gold always seems in scarce supply.  'But Poppycock,' I hear enthusiasts for the game cry out, 'You can get gold from questing!' And indeed I could... If I hadn't decided to play mega-paragon and decline every gold offer I had the chance of turning down - which was a surprisingly large amount. It astounded me how many times I could say no to a quest reward. I suspect there's a point in the game where gold becomes a quest-required thing, so this probably isn't the best idea, but the feel-goods shouldn't be in there if they're just meant to punch you in the gut later. *Side note, THANKS FABLE 3 for killing all my citizens. Thought I had 100 days more to sort out the mess and become a bard made of gold, turned out I had 0*  So eventually I figured out the in-between path, where I sold everything that isn't in some way magical, or a relic, or whatever that jar of purple stuff is I keep in my pack for some reason. It works, and in all honesty I have no regrets. Only thing I ended up crafting these first 10 hours was a pair of swords that did ungodly amounts of damage, and all the scarce materials that I needed I had. Sure I had to buy iron ingots but... meh.  Anyway, Poppycock and I will keep you updated. I could talk about the difficulty of turning 180 degrees in this game, or the finnicky way the camera requires you to face just the right way and distance from something to pick it up, but I feel that others could say it better.  Chapter 2: Poppycock's Dark Age  So Poppycock left the beginning hamlet, and came upon Yennefer. Only for her to leave again. Back to adventure!   *Record screech*  Roach? When did you come back? You're... alive? YOU'RE ALIVE! OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!  *Dismounts Roach. Leaves him there forever.* Bye horse!  So Poppycock continued his adventure. He went to meet a spy, dug around in a dead man's shoes, met a big fat drunk man, and went looking for some girl. I dunno, she probably matters.  He saved his file at a friendly bonfire. Seemed familiar.  And so Poppycock went to fill the edges of his map. And so he did. The first ? was a camp full of bandits and -  Poppycock woke again at his bonfire. Go anywhere but south, he promised himself.  12 hours later, he had killed many enemies, acquired numerous weapons, and he returned to that bandit camp. With a smile. And death. Many songs were sung about the Devil's Pit. Some believe it got it's name for the big bloody hole in the center. But others whisper of a devil named Poppycock. He who slaughters all, and will kill you if you speak his name aloud.  At level 12, Poppycock found a level 24 tree man. And they fought. All went well until the tree man called a pack of level 24 wolves. They promptly devoured him.  He then liberated a fort which was quickly taken over by soldiers. They seemed happy enough, until he looted a sheepskin from a nearby chest. Then they beat the life out of him, stole half his coin, and sent him on his way. What a strange way to treat your savior. Poppycock dismissed it as a local tradition.  He then unleashed a kindly girl spirit into the world. She seemed innocent enough. I mean, if you forget the whole boyfriend-killing thing.  He also killed a talking tree. Wood don't got nothing on the Poppycock.  And finally he remembered. He had to save the girl.  Stay tuned for chapter 3!",

Hardly moved anywhere in the story. I love the way each mission is designed. They are similar yet jaw droppingly different when you play through them. The world is massive and the game is just excellently optimised. Your choices have impact! Hats off to CDPR. WB should learn something from them. Arkham Knight didnt even come close to visuals of this game and it ran like crap! As a PC gamer.....I support devs like CDPR as they set a standing example + benchmark for AAA devs. Take 3 delays or more...but make ur games like The Witcher 3 - Wild hunt.

Many parts in the story are MUCH BETTER experienced as opposed to just being 'caught up' and you'd also be missing two great games. In a summary, W3 is an open world RPG that has a very rich story line. As opposed to Witcher 2, you are not limited to which zone you are in as long as you've unlocked the others through story.   Combat: (4/5) I think this is by far the best in the series with combat. There are a few issues of course (auto-sword selection and terrain difficulties during combat for example), however I've never really felt challenged in the former 2 Witchers. In this you'll find enemies constantly trying to flank, multiples attacking at the same time, and you actually need to prepare for quite a few battles with potions and reading about the enemy type. Swordplay is pretty smooth, plus a very nice selection of the standard witcher spells, and an array of bombs and side arms is at your disposal.  Character: (4/5) Character creation is pretty detailed and you get the standard choice of Swordplay, chemically enhanced, magical, or a mixed Witcher. The game works off the usual level-up perk and armor system, though your mutagen enhancements have been changed and imo improved. I don't think the perks are as strong as W2, but that could be part of the added challenge that I've been enjoying so much.  Story: (5/5) Geralt has always been one of my favorite characters and dialog wise I would put him close to the original DMC 1-3 Dante. Not quite as spirited, but just as funny and sarcastic. This will be a rich adult rated story. There are quite a few moral decisions, though don't expect the simplicity of Fable on these. Even the most honorable intentions can lead to horrible results.   Beauty: (4.5/5) I'm being a bit elitist with this rating, but I want it to be accurate. This game is gorgeous with character detail, weather, and creatures. I playing it on my brand new rig on Ultra detail and I was very impressed, until my brother pointed something out. Unfortunantly, still on Ultra, the trees and landscape have a tad bit of 2D look to them. I personally wouldn't have noticed, but whats a good review without accuracy...  In summary I would highly suggest this game. The Witcher series in general captured me a long time ago and I am very pleased with this one now. Much more freedom in game combined with the same great story we've come to know. If you're like me this won't be measured in game hours played as much as play-throughs completed.",

The Witcher games always topped with graphics and the more mature story-telling of a world that ain't shaded in black and white only. This time it's an open world to explore and even the side quests are as entertaining and well done as the main quest (some even better).   Of course there are the usual generic map objects as in all open world games: monster nests, ruins, hidden treasures etc. but with one big difference: you don't need to collect em all to get to a whopping 150+ hours of playtime! I just did those on my way and those needed to clear for witcher school armour and weapon sets.  I assume that I cleared about 33-40% of these markers but I did every witcher contract and secondary quest (but Gwent collector) and ended up on 163 hours premium gameplay.  If you're into RPGs you probably own the game already and if you're just curious then this is the best RPG to start with.  ",

I got pretty fed up with turning candles on and off.  -Repetative sidequests. Some of the sidequests had compelling stories in their own right for sure, but plenty of contracts and other sidequests were very go to X location kill Y thing, return for a tiny unexciting reward.  -After completion of the main quest, the most important NPCs are all missing and the game world is treated like you havent completed the mission yet. Other than the cutscene after you complete the game, none of those choices have an impact on the game world.  -Movement both in combat and out feels slugish. I know that it is part of the style, but honestly if I am standing on a ledge and want to turn around I don't normally have to take 3 steps to accomplish this. The same is applied to hoarses, I feel like I am driving a tank sometimes that cant seem to navigate around rocks and sticks even though a real horse would dodge those types of obstacles without your intervention.   I am very much annoyed that Geralts story is over. I enjoyed the game immensely and even though CDPR said this was not the end of the series, it is indeed the end of Geralt.",

The change to open world atmosphere was a success in my opinion. Many sub quests to participate in. Don't forget to do your secondary quests to mold the primary ones into something you might enjoy.    The keybindings to me were a bit off and I had to remap them to Witcher 2 controls to make it comfortable. If you liked W2 combat you will enjoy W3 and its gory finisher moves. :)   I didn't really run into any glitches or graphical crashes because my computer met within the recommended specs.

Some people think the gameplay is abit stale but on lower difficulties it actually is, thought this game isn't meant to be played on like that, it's meant to be a challenge. The 'blood and broken bones' is the second highest and the way to go in my opinion if you really want a challenge and amazing gameplay for your first time.

Now for the best part of the game: the story. The story telling in this game is great. One of the best out there. It easily ranks up, if not exceeds Bioware's and Telltale's story telling. I got really attached to Geralt and the people he met through his travels. So prepare for a feeltrip in this game. There's so much content in this game that it puts other current title's content to shame. Even he $10 DLC has more content than most $60 games out there.

The amount of emotion in Geralt's facial expressions really amazed me. Also, his hair grows over time. -Big world. Skellige is probably my favorite region. It's like going back to skyrim, except everyone's scottish and even angrier.  Cons: -You will eventually finish the game. Maybe. If you beat it in under 100 hours, you're doing it wrong.",

            "review_text": "Great game, honestly, bought it a few months before it was released after playing the witcher 1 and 2 and being really content with my experience there. Controls and monsters is great and the story is gripping, yet honestly, it gets a bit too big after a while, sure it is good to have much exploration to do, but some players involunatarily spend too much time searching for worthless stuff and small quests that, as an afterthought, was freaking worthless and not worth the time. I guess the crossdressing was good enough to compensate for that though.  Being something of a kleptomaniac, even after reaching 150k+ currency I just couldn't stop stealing everything I saw, without ever buying anything or actually needing any of the normal loot. Seriously, just running around stealing stuff from under the guards noses and everything else, exploring most of what there is to explore, I probably extended the game by over 200+ hours... it gets really boring after a while though, but I feel like I'd lose something if I skip out on that box in the corner, it might contain some goodies, like a recipe or something. Damn it, towards the end I would've been ready to pay the price of the game all over again to get rid of all but the most essential boxes. The only other thing that I really want to remark on is Roach. Seriously, I can't count the times I've wanted to send the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse off to the glue factory. What the hell is up with that programming? everytime you even get close to an edge, roach neighs and stops. Every time you walk across a bridge, every time you get remotely close to anything blocking your way, the same thing happens. What. The. HELL.   So, if you're not a kleptomaniac(if you are, you might want to reconsider using your time in other games with less worthless loot) and you love ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horses that can't cross bridges without stopping for 10 seconds at every bridge, sometimes multiple times, and likes to spawn inside houses where it is warmy and cozy, then sure, go for it, you would be a hard pressed to find a better game that is truly worth the price due to the sheer playtime, story and visuals you get. Thumbs up, 9/10, too many boxes, worthless loot, crappy gear and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horses to get a 10/10...",

However, the game is gorgeous and I can see the amount of time and care the developers put into the graphics and the multi-arc subplot and the multi-arc main plot.  The characters are all relatable and have interesting dialogue choices that impact the world of The Witcher in their own unique and wonderful way, however not every choice will be a good one and will impact the world in an unique and horrible way. The best feature of games like The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, is the ability to choose. The player can choose either to give Geralt a heart, with some emotions, or a heart of stone. The player also chooses how the world will percieve Geralt and even how the game will end, by the in-game dialogue and actions Geralt can make.  I give this game 9.93/10. The game does have a bug every now and then, but it is minor and can be overlooked or easily missed if one is not looking directly at it. This game is a most buy for anyone who is a part of the gaming brotherhood, or even just starting to get thier feet wet in one of the greatest inventions of mankind.",

I have 174 hours played in it so far, including both extenstions and it's not over yet. At first it looks and feels like Red Dead Redemption set in a fantasy world with swords and magic, but then you recognize that it has way stronger plot, more features, and a lot more humor in it. I like sand-box games as a genre, and this one is as good as GTA V. Fights are mostly as easy as in Fable series, but variability of monsters and other enemies you face is absolutely impressive. And I extremely enjoyed a card game there named Gwent. Overall game is pretty easy to play by following obvious hints, but every now and then I came across interesting puzzles (no spoilers here!). If you like RPGs, you should try The Witcher 3, I strongly recommend it.",

The fact that CDProjectRed was able to make this game with a staff way less than Rockstar is insane. Yes, the Witcher 3 is a definite buy at full price and with its expansions.

Incredible, immersive story, compelling and realistic - often deeply flawed - characters, great combat and an absolute visual masterpiece.  The two DLC components are also absolutely worth the comparatively low price, and the final Toussaint DLC is long enough and complex enough that it could have stood completely alone and still been a much better game than 90% of the chaff that came out this year.  Cons: Combat isn't 'perfect'. I'm not a fan of the Gwent stuff, but you don't really need to participate in it. My only real complaints though are that a.) it eventually ends, and b.)

The game still lacks in optimization regarding dual core CPUs and causes the performance to spike to 100%, freezing the frame every minute or so.

            "review_text": "tl;dr: awesome game, runs smooth, story is solid, no creepy invasive DRM(!!!!!!!), good graphics, fun gameplay, some holes in the story if this is your first witcher game.   I will be telling you about my experience, it will be divided in little parts: A. Performance B. Gameplay C. Graphics D. Overall game  A. Perfomance wise, I would never thought this game would run on my 5 year old laptop. Well, it does. And it runs smooth. So smooth, that I don't even need to upgrade my hardware. I experienced 1 crash in 48 hours of gameplay. Unlike other popular games, fiddling with the settings actually works on even old machines. I love that!   B. Gameplay is fun, but like other witcher games it can become a bit of a mess when you accept too many missions. This game however, plays much better than the other witcher games. Everything feels refined, and works as it should. Sometimes you miss out on action buttons, or start conversations you aren't meant to start yet. This sometimes leads to frustration, or failed missions (when you're level 15 and run head first in to a level 24 mission by talking to the wrong person for instance). There is room to improve, but all things considered, this game is good. Gameplay is fun, well balanced and inviting. The missions all have stories, that are sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, sometimes just plain weird, but always a blast. Sure, somtimes you try things that you know will not work.. Then you'll get your horse stuck underneath a barn, or yourself stuck underneath a barrel in a tub. ♥♥♥♥ happens. The fact that you can save whenever, and wherever is great! Especially since conversational choices play such a large role.  C. I run this game at the lowest possible graphics, and I'm completely fine with that. It still looks better than FC Primal and the customization is endless. You can tweak nearly every little thing. The weather however, starts getting weird during winds at low graphics; trees just flip the F*** out whenever the wind blows.  D. I've never liked the witcher games. They were boring, dull, endless, you needed to read a lot.. They sucked. This game is different though. Reading is optional in most cases, and the missions are more fun to play. Summon a horse, and you'll travel around 100 meters in 15 seconds. Everything fits like a glove in this game. However! There is a big downside when it comes to the story: characters from previous games are incorporated, along with their stories. If you haven't played the other witcher games, it can be quite frustrating to not know who you're dealing with. Since the choices you make in conversations have a large influence on the rest of the game, I would like to see a proper introduction of characters in the future. This way, a player can estimate what the consequences of a choice would be. If you're a fan, you could incorporate previous witcher saved games and let the choices be made for you, or you might just remember who somebody is.. If this is your first time playing, be prepared to miss some of the story's parts. Apart from that, this game is awesome. If I had the money, I would pay the full price. But I don't, so I bought it on sale.",

There was never a moment where I thought 'ugh can we just get on with it!' The story is interesting because it does have the main focus of finding the ward but there are many encounters with different characters that were perfectly woven into the storyline to make them worth caring for. There was a characte you meet in Novigrad that became a part of the story and I didn't realize I cared for the well being of them until something happened to them.   The graphics are great and fits well as a next gen game. I found myself stopping to gaze at the scenery all the time and every new weapon I equipted had a new design to its sheath and I ended up staring at that most of the time I was running around. Even the monsters you face are disgustingly amazing to watch. When I was being attacked by the specters and the different kinds of beasts I just wanted to stand there and stare at their designs. It's just so amazing to see that amount of detail in the characters and monsters.  The audio in this game is even better. I don't have anything against reading when progressing through an RPG, but the fact that EVERY encounter with an npc was scripted and voiced made it a little more special. It just added that extra care that I was happy to receive. Hearing the water, mud splashes, snow crunching, and wood thuds as Geralt takes one step after another. I just love that extra bit, and I heard it everytime and its the main reason I didn't bother listeing to my own music while playing this game.   I personally didn't have any issues with the mechanics of the game. For me the fighting was fluid. The magic switching was not a problem and all the extra bits that come with were silk. I didn't care to use oils much but I enjoyed bombing the monsters. Being able to call Roach(your horse) almost anywhere was really nice and useful If there was any complaint I had I guess it would be in the mechanics of Roach. I found him getting stuck on tree's many times when I called him. I tried to keep the area clear when I called him but sometimes he would get stuck on a blockade of stone and I just got tired of using him. I ended up only using him if I had to get to an area far away.   Overall I love this game, I already completed the Hearts of Stone expansion and now I'm just eagerly awaiting the next expansion. Probably would give it a 9.5/10. That 0.5 was deducted because of my issues with Roach.",

And the monsters i dont read much in games i just fly through it but they were so indepth the beastiaries were just a joy to read everytime i discovered another creature.  Side quests Monster hunts and scavenger missions were well thought out and rich in story i felt accomplished after killing another Wyvern or Wraith and the spoils from them.

Neither of us had ever played a Witcher game, but we heard that the last couple were good, so we gave this one a shot.   I thought this game would be good, but instead it exceeded every expecation I had in spectacular fashion.  Gameplay - fun, challenging combat, fantastic quests (the side quests are just as interesting and fun as the main quests), and your choices matter, thanks to the game's ridiculous amount of endings.   Story - every good adjective I can think of. Andrzej Sapkowski's vision of a lore-filled and vast fantasy world filled with so many interesting characters is masterfully given form.  Music - solid all-around soundtrack that adds life to the entire experience.  Graphics and Performance - a beautiful game even on low-medium settings, and it runs like a beauty as long as you don't get overzealous and crank everything higher than your build can handle. I recommend turning the fancy hair graphics off completely, and then it shouldn't take much tweaking to get good performance.  Marketing - thought I'd include this because CD Projekt Red is the super hero of game developers. They charge $60 for a game that has a ~60 hours camaign and loads of other hours in the form of side quests and activities, not to mention the quality of all those hours of content. Then, they make a kickass DLC with about 12 hours of content and charge $10 for it. The next DLC costs $20, and it delivered upwards of 30 hours of the same quality content (plus a feakin' entirely new zone) I had already experienced from the base game and the first DLC (for some reason they called it a DLC and not The Witcher 4: Blood and Wine).  Negatives - very few, and overall the good FAR outweighs the bad. Your player does move a bit clunkily (movement is clearly favored towards consoles), and you aren't able to customize your character or do crazy, random actions the way you can do in similar games like Skyrim. Although I do not think this, some say that they feel the combat is clunky, too challenging, or just not fun. There have also been a decent number of bugs in the game, but most have been ironed out through updates by now. **WARNING: This game is NOT for you if you have little time on your hands and/or do not enjoy taking breaks from the action to engage in dialogue and story. Some dialogue scenes are lengthly, and although the dialogue itself is superb, many gamers may be turned off by the idea of dedicating so much time to the story and plot choices.**   Unless you dislike every good aspect that I have just described, do yourself a favor and purchase this game.

Mechanically the game is an overall improvement from the last game and doesn't detract from the game overall, but still has its flaws/bugs of which there are more than I could realistically list. The nice part is that CDPR has tried really hard to fix many of these. Combat after several hours in the game can seem repetitive but is overall fairly dynamic even if towards the end of the game your build becomes a bit powerful for most things.  Visually the game is stunning and if you have the GPU to run it on higher settings you won't regret it.  Some might recomend that you should turn off the soundtrack in game to enjoy the ambeiance in the game and while I do think you should try it for a bit, the soundtrack is really well done and doesn't devalue your experience.   I also highly recommend getting all of the free DLC that is available (adds extra content) as well as the two paid ones, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.

Well it wasn't overly hyped at all, this game is a masterpiece. Every bit in the story feels like it was so intricatelly thought out and is well portrayed. There are no stupid story gaps and even the various creatures in the game have their own back stories. The gamplay mechanics are great but may take some getting used to. The graphics are absolutely amazing, just check out some of the screenshots on my profile if you want to see what I mean. There is also sooooo much content in this game, tons of weapons, armors, potions, crafting recipies, and quests to undertake. This was literally one of the best games I have ever played, and I am not normally the type to fall in love with singleplayer RPG's. Yeah, the game is that good. So just buy it already, I promise that you won't regret it.  Preformance for me- GPU: r9 290x CPU: fx 8350 black edition eight core @ 4 ghz  The game preforms very very well with really good optimization on CD Projekt Red's part. The game is always stable and I haven't noticed in big drops in framerate, unless you are in one of the more populated areas of the game such as a few of the larger cities, but even then it wasn't by a lot.",

Stellar and immersive, the combat feels right after you start to understand how to fight monsters and humans with different tactics. The world just feels like a real place that you might wander through and have adventures. The casual dialogue as you pass by peasants and highborn nobles all really add to the experience.   Combat is not repetitive or boring, the game casually introduces more and more monsters, strategies, abilities, potions, and magic as you advance, allowing you a high amount of character customization and a hell of a lot of control over how you want to face down the enemies in the world of The Witcher.   Hearts of Stone was a hell of a ride, in my humble opinion a better story than the main in the end. If you reach the level required to play it I recommend dropping everything and playing it to completion.",

First off its definatly the best RPG that is available in this genre...hands down, and thats coming from an die hard fan of the TES Series .What W3 does storywise (and for me personaly combatwise) it absolutley hits right on target , right between the eyes so to say. There are loads of characters in W3 's story and none of them is shallow ,boring or unnecessary. The whole Story of the game is nearly perfectly fleshed out Mainquest and Sidequest are alost eye to eye on the quality front wich makes it easy to do the 'im gonna play every nitbit of this thing'. I dare to say other Developers have learned a lesson on what realy matters in a modern RPG after W3.  The Thing with the Witcher Series in the past was always the combat . Now this time they invested a good chunk more into that , with the NG option ,difficulty setting options ,better enemy AI ....and a more way regular patching of 'WTF' oddities .Is it perfect ? na nana nana na :), but very enjoyable   The Graphics are great and eyecatching (some moaned bout it , you know where those coming from ....owning +5k machines and hang out with the russians on the space station on weekends )  The DLC's are more or less standalone in the whole thing ...but it realy doesent feel like it . They get an extra rating because they dont feel like common DLC's ,CDP definatly raised the bar here   Final Rating   out of 10 for story = 9.5 ...and thats because 10 would be perfect and nothing is perfect out of 10 for combat = 8 out of 10 for replay = 8 out of 10 for DLCs = 9 out of 10 for overall state of the game (bugs , glitches ..patching service)=9 out 0f 10 for graphics =9 ",

I liked it initially, but just lost interest after those ten hours. I now realize how much I missed out on.  I started playing it again recently, and it his been an experience like no other. First of all, the game/gameplay itself is just fantastic. I have clocked in around 120 hours of it in the past two weeks and I have not become even remotely bored of it yet. That is a lot coming from me because I cannot get sucked into these big games like I used to when I was younger.  The thing that really gets me about this game is the story. For whatever reason I love the family bond between characters in a fictional story like this, and it is near perfected between Geralt and Ciri. The whole game is essentially about Geralt searching for Ciri, and combatting the forces that are chasing her, in an attempt to use her 'gift', that is, Elder Blood.  I have never seen such a powerful and compelling story in a video game before. Not that I'm surprised, because CDPR has not delivered anything less than a masterpiece as of yet. That said, easily one of my most favorite games of all time. So good that it has blinded me into making a review that is less about the game itself, and more about the absolutely fantastic story/lore behind it.

So characters within the game that my character has history and connections to I as a player have no interest or connection to those characters, which is somewhat of a problem as the story and some of the dialogue seems like it wants you to go with option A when I as a player don't care about option A I like option B.

            "review_text": "I would suggest this game for the story alone. Even without the solid gameplay it is worth the experience. It felt like a novel at times and had an emotional experience to it. The story is structured as a dark fairy tale. Otherworldly people hunt Geralt's (our protagonist) foster daughter. Geralt must chase her as she is chased by the Wild Hunt. Along the way a well developed caste of characters is interacted with all having their own complete stories with arcs, choices, and themes.    The experience of playing Geralt and Ceri is incredible. The gameplay for Ceri is different enough to be interesting and the time mostly spent with Geralt is rewarding in terms of Combat, Monster Hunting, and crafting. Ceri's missions are more like an action game. Ceri's section take on a small portion of the game. It is ultimately a very romantic tale about the relationshipss that a grown man has, even one who wouldn't normally have family and loved ones.   Geralt's time outside of these character moments is spent preparing for and hunting monsters or human opponents. Preparing for fighting a monster revolves around crafting alchemical potions and body enhancing mutagens which give you different edges hunting monsters. Crafting is simple and not grind oriented. I was satisfied with what I was able to make with how little effort I put into it, only sometimes having to look for something. The more I put into it also the easier the hunts were.   The next edge Geralt has in kit is his Witcher Senses, which essentially give him a detective mode to examine hidden clues which lead to secrets or advance the hunt further. Many investigations are just a way to advance the story with a simple puzzle. Somtimes however they are optional and can give you an edge in the story or in combat if you pursue it correctly.   The combat is the weakest part of the game but still solid. Selecting weapons, potions, and bombs to fight different monsters always felt interesting. Learning how different kinds of monsters behave and adjusting my tactics was important in making the gameplay set itself apart. The effects and animations were well done and never felt really akward.   The swordplay is more intuitive than in past itterations of the game. Some people will need to increase the difficulty to enjoy the game, as it can be easy. In particular the last few battle with the Wild Hunt at the end of the game felt easy. They were tedious fights that relied on memorizing simple patterns.  Over all I recommend this game to anyone who like fantasy stories, fairy tales, or romance (in the literary sense). I would also recomend the game for people who like rpgs or openworld games.",

            "review_text": "8/10 - Amazing universe, great storyline, and lots of side-quests, but also a repetitive/easy combat system and a long, grindy, and sometimes discouraging main storyline (takes a while to finish).  Awesome game, really elaborate and beautiful universe, and you never run out of stuff to do. I really enjoyed this game, and the amount of details they put into the universe consistently surprised me. I'd try to do a storyline quest, and next thing I know I discovered some monster dungeon, stumbled upon some really deep side-quest, and have yet another witcher contract to kill some huge scary monster. But, aside from the depth of the world, not to mention the great plot, the game did get redundant at times, and especially the combat system was repetitive and easy. Overall, a solid 8/10 game -- I'd love to give it more but it wasn't very addicting to me, it was just a nice game to play to pass the time and admire the plot and environment.  Pros: -Amazing universe. The amount of detail they put into the universe, into side quests, into monsters, etc is astonishing. -Great plot. It's hard to get a firm grasp on the plot just from the Witcher 3, but it's still interesting, even if you haven't read the books. -Lots of stuff to do. There's always something else to do, another side quest to try out, a witcher contract to take on. -Gwent (side game) was boring at first for me, but got pretty fun once I understood the mechanics better. -Loved the dialogue, and the dialogue choices. Not sure how much of an effect the choices actually had on the plotline (it seemed to have some sort of an effect), but it was still engaging and interesting. -Characters were also good. I mean it's based off a really good book, so I'd assume the plot and characters are good.  Cons: -God the combat system is awful. And it's not 'bad', it's just especially since it's easy to spend so much time on the game, the combat system never really changes, and so you're left with the same fighting throughout the game. And they could have made it better - in fact, I enjoyed the few times I got to fight as Ciri, but they never gave Geralt that kind of mobility and all. Wish they incorporated more diversity with the combat system and made it a bit more challenging. -This con is also a pro, but the plot line is long and the universe is huge, and so sometimes I'd just get tired of it and take a break for a few weeks. This game, on and off, took me around 3/4 of a year to finish because it seemed very grindy at times. Especially with the combat system, I'd have to force myself to progress through the story, and once I thought I was reaching some sort of climax, there would be another story development and I'd feel like I had so much left to do in the game.  Anyway, overall, great game and probably one of the games I spent the most time on. I just liked the universe and the plotline (as well as the dialogue/characters) and really wanted to finish the game eventually. But, again the combat got old fast for me, and after getting through maybe 1/2 the game I figured it out. I played on the highest difficulty since then but the combat was never fulfilling for me since it was just too easy and repetitive, so I just got through the combat as a means to an end to continue on the storyline and such. But I still would recommend the game, though I'd say don't get too stuck on the side quests because the main storyline is already long enough. :)",

I've spent 112 hours (and counting) on this game, and I would say it was and is worth every minute. Because everything you do in the main quest, and some secondary quests will have a impact on how the game will play out in the future, which I think is just soooo fun and interesting. Now, this was only one reason why I love this game, and why you should buy it and love it too, so here is some more reasons:  -Great story and gameplay  -Breathtaking graphics (especially in Blood And Wine DLC)  -Characteres you will love and hate  -The setting, place and timeperiod is just perfect for the game  -The size of the world you are in is just amazing  -If you like Skyrim this will most likely give you a similar feeling (I might be wrong, I have never played Skyrim, hehe)  -If you like open world and/or RPG games, what are you waiting for?!  Now, I have to point out the creative mind of the author of the books and the team that made the game, it's mindblowing how many different creatures the author and makers have come up with. And I can see that they have gotten inspiration from different faiths, tales and mytlologies, which is pretty cool. But I've noticed some placesand people are taken out from different folketakes and tales, some examples are on Ard Skellige (in the game) where some places/ villages has Norwegian names (I pointed this out because I'am from Norway) like Lofoten (North in Norway), Fyresdal, Sund (county in Norway), Dovre ruins (Dovre is also a county) and Larvik. This masterpiece is definately worth picking up. It is my favourite game of all time, and it will be hard to fin a better one. So what are you waiting for? Geralt Of Rivia is waiting.",

Also it has one of the best protagonists in videogames history. Geralt is probably the only videogame character EVER that I've grown incredibly fond of out of all the games I've played and even when it's you making the choices, Geralt delivers them better than anyone else you could imagine. Doug Cockle is a brilliant voice actor and really makes Geralt who he is.  Let's sum up what makes the game good: -Brilliant storytelling and writing -Every mission feels unique -The world is beautiful ( Graphical quality is top notch ), fluent, rich, alive, colorful, yet serious -Voice acting is phenomenal ( when it's not the same guy voicing the hundreds of randomized NPC's ) -Combat is varied with tons of different oils, potions, arrows and bombs -Progression system is varied, balanced and allows for lots of different styles of combat -Free DLC's that for example, adds New Game+, new armour, horse armour, new missions etc. -The expansion packs are pure bliss to play through and feel much more polished than the base game, tbh -Lots of different enemies and different tactics to take them on -Game is filled with content, treasure hunts, side missions, witcher contracts, random events, monster lairs, bandit hideouts, imprisoned merchants etc.  Here's few negative things about the game: -You'll come across few glitches and bugs every now and then, not game breaking, but annoying -The game is lacking in difficulty, even on Death March, new game+ sets the bar right, but that'll be a second playthrough -Starting a new save is always a bore and takes too long, the real meat of the game is when you get out of White Orchard -As much as there is to do, I want more of Geralt's adventures :(  As they've already confirmed, this'll be the last Witcher game starring Geralt, which is a sad thing, truly. If it were up to me, I'd love to play every upcoming Witcher game as him, but we'll see if the next protagonist will get even close.  But yeah. It's a masterpiece everybody should play through at least once along with it's expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood &amp; Wine. It's been out for long so the game isn't even all that expensive. As I am writing this review, the game is mere 15 euros on Steam. The price is LAUGHABLE considering how much worth you'll get for the price.  It's really amazing what a bunch of kurwas in a squatting position can make when it comes to videogames. I don't even have to shill for CDPR because their games speak for themselves.

CD Projekt Red took the best aspects of the previous two games and merged them into this exquisite piece of interactive literature.  The game world is massive, and not just in terms of size. Almost everywhere you can go will have something worth seeing, whether it be a beautiful scenery, an impoverished village or a bustling city full of unforgettable characters, crime, racism and power-struggles. Of all the RPG's I've played over the years, this is and will be my favorite for some time.

Even though the world is masive it feels somewhat small, and a bit hollow, though that does not stop me from recomending it, if you are looking for an RPG which you can spend 1000+ hours in, this game is not for you though.",

The first gripe I had towards the game is its wonky combat system. All I find myself doing is hitting one of the two buttons to dodge an enemies hit, or mashing my left mouse button to strike. There are potions and special abilities to use during a fight, however I always found myself reverting to my trusty sword. I really would have liked if CD Projekt Red created a combat system more similar to Skyrim, where you can block and swing with more control and precision. I also feel as if the developer could have included a first person view whilst allowing the player to switch between first and third person views, like skyrim. I have also noticed a fair amount of bugs in the game thus far. For example, people walking through each other, getting stuck on walls and ledges and holes etc. Anyways besides all of that I feel as if this game is great however it isnt the best.

About 60 hours on my first playthrough, could have easily gotten probably about 80-90ish even without the new DLC (Hearts of Stone and now Blood and Wine, as of editing). Playing through NG+ on the hardest difficulty, this is the only game I have even had any interest in the NG+ with. Graphics are beautiful, soundtrack is riveting, story is compelling and gripping. The cinematics are goose bump worthy and the completely open world and free roam feeling flows so well and is just amazing.  The rich story, characters, self awareness and the truly brilliant and believeable world is just astonishing. I can honestly say, having played A LOT of story rich RPGs this is definitely one of, if not the best - in my opinion, and many others. As well as the best in the series, having finished all three.  Over 100 hours of gameplay and I haven't even touched the two expansions or finished my NG+ playthrough. Expecting to have around 200 hours by the time I've done all I want to do. Not to mention all the free DLC that the developers provides to everyone, a truly generous and great thing to do. The free DLCs are actually worth the download as well, as there is even a few side quests included. Considering most games these days charge for special armors, weapons, appearances and whatnot, and here they are giving them out for free.  Couple cons though so this doesn't seem like a suck-up review(though it kinda is): The controls are definitely overwhelming at first and can feel somewhat clunky or unresponsive at times if you are not familiar with the series. Also, if you are looking to play this game on max graphics, you better be packing a nice PC. It is quite intensive for max graphics. However, it is flexible; low graphics don't require anything outlandish at all.  tl;dr: Amazing, fantastic game. One of the best. Couple small oddities and different approaches to controls and such that take some getting used to at first. Overall, 10/10 here.",

Voted game of the year for a damn good reason. This is the single best game i have ever played. So far I've only played the game once while not doing every single quest or exploring the vast and beautiful world of the Witcher 3 and it still was a very lengthy playthrough. I never got bored even once because the game constantly threw new things at you while still sticking to mainly the core basics of the game so it wasn't infuriatingly (is that a word?) difficult. I recently purchased both DLC has been said to contain 30-50 extra HOURS of gameplay. I've never played a long RPG before because I've always become disinterested but this story was very well written and not as many parts were cliche, far from it actually.   You thought I was done? Sorry bout that...CD Projekt Red has really defined what it means to be a consumer-based company. While most other companies only care about popularity and sales (obviously CDPR do too), but CDPR actually made a game worth playing. And playing. And maybe one or two or five more times again. They lowered the price in other countries (I'm so mad i forgot which) for this game because their government made it so they'd be paying approx $90 in their currency equivilant. Also the DLC is exactly what DLC should be. An EXPANSION. Not this crap COD or any EA game throws at you with like 1 fun or 2 small maps for $15. Instead they gave us hours of gameplay with new missions in a new extensive open world just as beautiful as the existing one for a mere $25 (bought as a pack together). Oh I nearly forgot: 16 FREE DLC. Sure most of them are remodeled characters, but how many other games makes you pay for that? Pretty much every other one right?   In conclusion: Story- 10/10 Map/world- 10/10 Voice actors- 11/10 Gameplay- 9/10 (sometimes movement and swimming was clunky) Hud/menus- 10/10  Overall this is easily a 10 on 10 game.     TL;DR: Best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, by the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs, with the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs. Spend your hard-earned ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ money on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ best devs.",

The main reason for this game being so good are the story and its unique characters i think. They are telled in nuanced and mature kind of way. There is no good or evil in this story- there's just the story; it's kind of like our life. Everything in this game has a depth which few other games have, and no game as lately-you really can see that the developers have put a lot of time and effort in creating the witcher3.

Pros: Open-world Great story Amazing voice acting Amazing music For its release date the graphics are amazing, for todays standard they are still better than average. Detailed charakters, quests and monsters No boss is repetitive each of them feels different. Rewards skilled players Challeging yet story based.  I could list lots n lots of pros for this game as there are a hell of a lot! If you are into RPG games get the Witcher 3 its a masterpiece! If you are into medival games in general it really will give you the chills and pull you into its magic beeing. I have played it trough 3 times now and its still more fun than any other game you would play more than once, in therms of storybased RPGs. The ending is never the same each and every decision could lead to a different one, there are so many of them its mental!  Cons: Without an SSD you will have loading times Vendors simply do not have enough gold to trade for all that loot you will stumble upon. The skill tree is complex but reduces you to 12 (active) abilities what I personally found less than necessary. At some point the AI is stupid but on high difficulty it gets better.  Summing up: I couldn`t give you meaningful cons which leads me to the conclusion that there are none (in my opinion) I have NEVER been so deeply into one games story and yet so facinated by its combat system. What would I be accepting to pay for this game? Tbh 60 bucks are hella fine, The Dlcs are not necesarry thoe atleast that was something I exprienced. There is no better Rpg story based game that can compete atm, the story is just magical.... My last few words are BUY THIS GAME ITS GREAT!!!  grats Henry (bad for my sorry english im not native) ",

Trodding along on horseback, I thought to myself, 'What makes this game so much better than every other game I've played?' I slowed my horse's gallop to a stop while pondering this question and spinning my camera around to admire the details of the surrounding environment. It was then that I noticed the crumbled ruins of a small castle tower on a hill close by. At that moment the answer dawned on me. The world of The Witcher is packed to the absolute brim with small details that you might simply walk past without noticing, but if you decide to look a little bit closer at just about anything you will find yourself diving head first into a unique adventure.  I decided to test this theory by deviating from my path just a bit to check out the small, ruined tower that had caught my eye. I approach the waist high stone walls surrounding the fragmented tower, which look like they had at one time been as tall as the neighboring trees. Upon walking into the ruins, I notice the laid out corpse of a dead man with blood surrounding him. Tapping into Geralt's witcher senses, I see monster tracks and claw marks around the man's corpse. Geralt then mentions how the marks on the ground and wounds on the body resemble those of a monster I have yet to encounter in my 65 hours of playing this game, a Fiend.  At this moment I hear some ominous noises coming from something very large on the other side of the tower, and decide to open up the bestiary. A page in my bestiary informs me that a Fiend is a three-eyed relict capable of hypnotism. Having not yet come across a monster that can hypnotise its foes, let alone one with three eyes and antlers, I decide I may as well see what this guy is all about. I coat my blade in relict oil and chug a cat potion as I move around to the other side of the tower to come face to face with the monstrosity. Queue an intense 20 minute battle with a monster 10 levels higher than me, ending in me cutting off its head and strapping it to the side of my horse as a trophy.  I felt validated in my reason for loving this game as I left those ruins, wondering what I would encounter next.",

Has for the rest of us... wellp... It's been over a year and hundreds of hours and I'm still enjoying this game to bits lol. Usually people my age have they're favorite game be a much older title that they view with rose-tinted glasses. But I can safely declare this my favorite game of all time =) I am simply amazed by this fact.  I understand why some may not enjoy the game... what from it being far too massive to find the time or patience to appreciate it to simply not liking Geralt has a character... it's all a matter of taste imo. This game truly deserves all the hype n praise it gets and that's a rare thing indeed. I have only minor problems with the game of which thankfully are resolved with mods such has trophies all having basically the same frigging bonuses and the bloody censorship of th-- yeah mods are great stuff =)  This game also made me a fan of CD Projekt for offering such great value in this game. They should be praised more for they're clever business practices. Particularly offering such quality expansion level DLC at such fair prices and the trivial fluff for free lol... just don't see that these days... Hope they can keep it up for their next game, I'm very much looking forward to it.",

Geralt of Rivia as the main character is not only the main focus of this story but the problem of the people of the realm of Witcher 3 also takes a great part of the whole story of this game. The are so many problems that Geralt have to solve in this game from helping local villagers to slaying a monster or finding a missing person, helping friends and his daughter from political issues, fighting against dark lord of another world and so many other problems. But the great thing is that Geralt is not some superheroes that will save all humankind (and elves, dwarves, and other humanoid lol), he just some part of this world too, that have justice and loves to help people when in need and he has some weakness too sometimes he's being too kind and sometimes being too ignorant (it depends on how the player chose). So what are waiting for, get this game and play it and I hope you enjoy it like me :D  This game is absolutely 10/10 game of all time! Good job CD Project Red!",

I know it’s not helping right away, but without going any further I will state that this is the best RPG I’ve ever played, hands down. I was mentioning that you shouldn’t consider it just a game, I’d name it as a deep immersion in a fabulous fantasy world, constantly changing, evolving, awake and alive, a little new universe inside your hard drive.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt main attributes are an astonishing sense of freedom, mind-blowing graphics, deep plot, intriguing and compelling characters, challenging, realistic and bloody combat system, hundreds if not thousands of items to craft and collect, massive world to explore (10+ times Skyrim‘s), an alive world in constant change (weather, animals, random events, etc.) and I could continue naming wonders about this game endlessly.  What’s most amazing about this fabulous experience is wandering around when suddenly you realize that each NPC you crossed you path with has been compelling to you, you feel, good, bad, sad or remorse about them, even after one week of gameplay you ride through that village again and you remember that old poor woman who asked you once for help. What I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is that each dialogue is meaningful in its own way and that’s actually rewarding, that could probably be the most important thing when it comes to an RPG besides plot, graphics or whatnot.  What about the bestiary!? My god, I’ve played for a week and I still discover different creatures each and everyday… each with their own characteristics, weaknesses, etc. not to mention that depending on the creature type and level you should really be careful, come ready for combat and be sure to use the proper signs.  Of course all this remains just a humble opinion about such a massive game in every sense. I could write a book talking about every single aspect that amazed me since the first day I started playing it, but that’s not the point, the point is that this is being such a rewarding experience that I’m desperate to let every single player around the world know about it, it’s even one of the reasons why I decided to go back writing in DWD.  The Witcher 3: Wild hunt is one of those masterpieces that will forever remain in the hall of fame of the videogame world, long to be forgotten or even matched. There’s not a single negative aspect of the game I want to talk about, if so it would be the combat control slightly, but this is such an extraordinary game it washes it away, from its best-of-films OST to its complexity in every way.  Before I go, I want you to know that I’m the kind of player who still thinks that the perfect game won’t ever exist, but in order to summarize: even if you really hate RPGs you should run and buy this masterpiece.  9/10",

Even if you do minimal research of the game, everything from a quick look on youtube, to a fast search on google, you will find lots and lots of content for this game. There is a reason for it to become one of the best games 2015 had to offer.   Take this from one who has been to every crook and cranny of this fine universe presented for us in the witcher. I have done everything from walking the isles of skellige to frantically trying to crush this one barkeep to get his one special card in gwent. Everything from slaying monsters, to human monsters, to just spending time you and Roach together on the road between villages.   Yes, it is right that I have played over 150 hours of this game, and found and completed every achievement that there is for now, yeah you're damn right, all 65, and you now what? It was all worht it! Every penny I spent on this game was worth from the very beginning of the game, where you get a chance to take a quick look on one of the many beatifull and terrifying beasts that has a bounty on their head.   Like even the DLC is great. The heart of stone DLC, offered a very different yet hughly interesting questline there both you and Geralt are put in a spot where the most interesting things happen.*spoiler 'Those donkey ears man, they crack me up every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time'   So to conclude this; Yes! Go buy the game, give yourself enough time to spend with the game, at least 100 hours or so, and enjoy every little thing that The Witcher world has to offer. Remember to take it slow, and let the ambience reel you in, and don't be afraid to take another road, or stop to listen or watch what the different villagers say or do.   But be warned, you must remember to not have anything planned for the next week or so, cause this game will drag you in, suck your life out, and don't let you return to the real world until the game is beaten.   Now I only have one thing left to say;  Happy hunting, Witcher!",

At first i have to admit that i actually dont like these kind of games, i've played Skyrim after its release for some hours, but got bored really fast. So i was not sure if this game would suit me, although i've played Witcher 2 for some hours. But god damn, its amazing, i am addicted to it, cant stop playing. The first hours were a little bit dull to be honest, but after that... wow.  Story: AMAZING Sidequests: AMAZING Graphics: AMAZING Characters: AMAZING  I am really amazed about the sidequests, usually in most games the sidequests are repetitive and dull, like 'go there, get that' or 'go there, kill that'. In Witcher 3 the sidequests are fun so far, you kinda know why you are doing the sidequests, they make sense, not like in other games.  Only downsides so far are:  -Horseriding is not fun, its so hard to control the horse, it doesnt do what you want the horse to do, you aim into one direction, but the horse goes into the other. After 22 hours i am not using the horse anymore, either im using fasttravel, or im going by foot.  -You kinda need either Xbox or PS4 controllers to play this game, ive tried it with keyboard at first, but this is definetly a game you want to play with a controller, thank got it has native PS4 &amp; XBOX Controller support.  So if you like Skyrim, i bet you either already own the Witcher series, or you definetly should. Either way, you should get this game, its amazing.",

Gripping story, suprising twists and many humourous moments that make it worth every penny. I wish it lasted longer to be honest, but none the less it was extremely well made.  Blood And Wine:  Genrally flawless story and again, worth ever single penny. This one is a longer DLC than Heart Of Stone so has more time to impress and impress it did.

Some men... just want to play Gwent.  10/10 would swindle innkeepers and merchants of all their crowns as I stomp their weak decks over and over again with my stacked deck with cards collected from players throughout the realm.  But seriously, if you like games where choices matter, where the character progression/ leveling perks are fun, combat/ gameplay is great, immersion and worldbuilding/ lore is top-notch, graphics are amazing, and like role-playing as a grizzled, badass monster slayer that by his Code never works for free, get this game. Even its little side game Gwent is more fun than Hearthstone.",
