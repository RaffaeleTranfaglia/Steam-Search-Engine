Sure its Daedalic that publish it and even when it has not the jokes of Deponia, it has its own unique funny style, cute little riddles, gimmicks to find like worms, cakes that aren´t a lie (Portal), makeable speedrun where you can test you skills or a challenge like the Rock movie (Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage) dont get hit from the fire ventilators). For me it makes fun, its short but the quality is nice, at the moment you can see a happy birthday version till 30 november. Take a look, give it a chance and hopefully enjoy it. Thanks for reading. Have a happy day. I give this game personal 82% (only because the game lenght i cant get enough from the gameplay so i hope you support the game and maybe we get a 2nd part in some years). Bye",

The cutscenes are drawings, so no movies. As a cockroach you are not limited to the floor so you can walk on walls and ceilings which makes the camera rotate with you. Puzzles are not so difficult. Achievements are easy, there are 3 difficult ones, playing the game under 18 minutes is hard to master.  When it's on sale for not much money, I recommend to buy it.",

As a roach, you can walk up/down walls or even across the ceiling, which makes for interesting navigation puzzles. The difficulty was right for me - puzzles are based on routing power to the proper place, navigating around or moving obstacles, and interacting with friendly and not-so-friendly fellow insects. The plot is fairly simple, and told through nonsense mutters and picto-grams so that subtitles/voice-overs are not an issue.   In short, recommended especially when it [frequently] goes on sale. Just don't expect anything deep. It took me just over 2 hours to complete, working on the achievements now.",

I definitely don't think it's worth anywhere near it's full price; however, if you're looking for a unique point &amp; click/puzzle game, and it's on sale, you should try it!",

The story is pretty original but isn't fully fleshed out because the game is so short. The art style of the game is fantastic and the music is great as it fits the areas and rooms well.   However, the puzzles are frustrating as you wouldn't really think of the solutions naturally. You have a do a specific thing in a specific way which I wouldn't have normally done. Additionally, the puzzle pieces are easy to miss and it is hard to tell what is what.  Overall, the art was good and the story was alright. However, the lack of logical puzzles and obscure solutions kind of ruin it for me.",

I only recommend if you can get it cheap being you will waste money but it is different to see so I guess that makes up for it.",

It has a comical, or cute, art style. Fun and interesting crawling (almost) anywhere, up and down walls, and on ceilings. Puzzles are not hard (kind of the point with this type of game), if not obvious, though enjoyable.   If you want something short (can be a positive sometimes, atleast for me), lighthearted, and that should give you a chuckle or two, then I recommend this game.  I wouldn't pay $15 for it though, too short, get it on sale. Not counting it being short, or if you play through it more than once for achievements, it might be worth that price point; even more so if it was more like $10. But yeah, get it on sale, most definitely worth it for $5 or less.",
