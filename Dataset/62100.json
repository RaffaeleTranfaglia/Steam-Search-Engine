            "review_text": "This is an great and addicting game. At first glance I thought it was someone trying to recreate Tetris, but I was way wrong. My one fart about it is the Steam version is not as fun as the PS3 Deluxe version. A lot of the fun is had in co-op, but the Steam version is single player only. Still a great game.  I would love to see the Deluxe version on Steam too, and definitely DLC expansions with more levels and songs.",

I prefer the first game because of For Silence that I discovered there.  Chime is a puzzle game where the music plays a role. Let me copy/paste what I've written for the sequel.  You have to cover a surface with blocks, so that a 'quad' (generally when you have at least 3x3) can be formed and expanded. Once it's over, the quad disappear during the next passage of the beat, letting parts of the blocks used on the grid. And after a moment, they'll glow if unused and you'll loose the multiplier and the unused stuff.  Here, you have a free mode and a timed mode. You have also achievements, some of them are challenging.  For the Steam Edition, you have also Still Alive from Portal. It's because of that song that I bought Chime and got hooked on For Silence.  The best is to try the game, because surely, while I can explain it with my memory, you'll be better to buy it and play. 4 euros isn't expensive at all for the game.",

Pros :  Every gameplay is going to sound slightly different depending on how you cover the board with pieces. It can also be fun to see if you can do better than your Steam friends as the game provides various ways of comparing scores and times.   Cons :  There are only 6 songs. You'll likely tire of them after a while and want to move on to a new game. There's a Chime Super Deluxe being released exclusively for PS3 that includes new music, co-op and versus modes, though. So maybe that will eventually make it to PC.   Replayable :  Only as much as you have patience to hear the same songs over and over again. It can be relaxing, though -- like playing solitaire for the sake of having something to do at your computer without thinking too hard.",

I wish that the game included more songs, and that even more songs were available as DLC. I wish boards weren't locked to specific songs, and that there were more boards to choose from. There is a sequel that I have yet to try, and hopefully it will have improved on these complaints.  I bought Chime on the 360 a while back, and I enjoyed it. There isn't a whole lot of content, so I burned through it pretty quickly. I felt mouse controls would be faster and more precise, so years later when I saw it on Steam, I ended up buying another copy. Unfortunately, mouse controls feel very clumsy. I never feel like I quite have control of the position of the current piece, and I end up locking it down in the wrong spot way too often. Ages ago, I played a lot of Puzzle Pirates, which includes a somewhat time-sensitive pentomino placement minigame, and in that game, I never felt like a misplaced piece was the game's fault. With that in mind, it's definitely possible to have tight, clean mouse controls in a game like this.  That said, the game is still completely playable with other input methods, and even with its relatively limited content it's worth a play.  Brazil / 10",
