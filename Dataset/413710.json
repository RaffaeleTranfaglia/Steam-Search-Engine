            "review_text": "I started as a small time pirate looting unfortunate enough small boats. Then I went on a quest in the far, far away town to find out governor's source of income. Plan was to seduce governor's daughter so she can tell me the dirty secret. She was reserved, but after few nice gestures and the night out in the inn, she opened up. Her father was arrested, but then we fell in love. so I became the new governor and formed my own faction. Suffice to say, England, my former ally, was bitter because of that.  I tried to manage all this state affairs, but it wasn't easy. Economy was weak so I decided to go pirating and gather some cash. Few moment later, I spotted ongoing battle between my allies and new enemy, England. It was rather huge battle for me at the moment - lots of galleons while I had meager one-deck-of cannons boat. I said what the heck and went straight into the battle. I waited until both parties were exhausted, then grape-shoted one galleon and boarded it. Melee fight started, my heroes and well trained boarding party fought well. We got the ship!  Now, after owning heavy galleon I started intercepting English trade convoys. I established my own trade routes. Money was flowing. My reputation grew. Then one day, while passing near the Spanish city, I saw huge English navy besieging the city. I could see fiercest ships - 1st, 2nd, 3rd ships of the line. And the Spanish city fell. So it was time for me to get hell out of there. But then I was small group of ships - 2nd and 3rd ship of line, breaking from rest of the attack force. It was time to do my vulture tactics again!   I went into the battle - and there where two ships sailing straight into me. I started damaging the sails of the first ship, while cornering so second enemy ship didn't have the clear shot - first one was blocking her view. Then I switched to grapes, and decimated first ship's crew. Turned out tactic was good - crew count fell from 550 down to 50! Then I made a sharp turn and boarded the ship. After a quick battle one of the biggest ships were mine. I didn't have enough crew to sink the other enemy, so I managed to retreat. Some of my crew weren't happy, but hey, we won the jackpot!  I wasn't home for quite some time. My relationship with my wife began to deteriorate. Meanwhile, she was fighting natives and protecting the land. So I headed to my land. In was at that moment I saw several English ship of the line convoys following me. They wanted a revenge. But hey, I can outrun then, right? So I was sailing across the Caribbean, while enemy was behind my feet. They were relentless. I reached my city, but the didn't stop. I went inland by foot, by they also did that! ♥♥♥♥, this was going to be bad. But then, I could somehow cover my tracks so they lost me. I returned to the town, got my wife, and boarded my new ship. I left the garrison in the city because enemy was still there somewhere. Maybe my only city will fall and I will lose my faction. Who knows?   ",

            "review_text": "SECOND EDIT SEP 16 Most of the original edit remains true I believe, although they've added a neat feature for ship battles. Prior to engaging, you can demand that they surrender to you, which gives you their ships, of course can only be done if victory is all but assured. One issue I have with land battles is that you can't order your men to take paces, only charge, follow, hold, retreat, minor annoyance I have not actually a game issue. During aquatic battles, its very bothering that you have to take cargo, then decide if you want to keep the ship you just captured, it seems it should be the other way, or at the same time. When you sail over a sunken ship in combat, sometimes you will pick up cargo.. If you have the room in the current ship sailing over it, which can be annoying, I was unable to get some luxury goods thanks to this, one would think it would be stored in a different ship, seeing as you can't control which ship carries what anyways. ORIGINAL REVIEW Fairly good game, I got it for free since I had originally owned Caribbean! which I had a coupon for at some point for some reason. I haven't read into it, but I'm pretty sure this is the game they care about now, and sort of just left Caribbean! in a dumpster after the prom.   If you have played Mount and Blade, it'll feel familiar, due to it using the same engine and whatever, so thats fun. The naval combat is comparable to Sid Meier's: Pirates!, though a little more blocky, and sometimes I don't quite get where my cannons are supposed to be firing, though overall its pretty good. The boarding party, ship-to-ship, trench combat is not the best. If you have a big crew/party, buckle up, especially if you or your enemy has a small ship, it gets very cramped very quick. Pretty certain I've killed more of my crew than the enemy has. If you and your foe have a big ship and big crews, it can be fun. Now for land battles, I haven't gotten far in that aspect. In Caribbean! I had cannons and the whole shabang, and that was great and all, though the mechanics were weird, and there was no friendly fire from cannon. I don't know if cannons work the same in this, but land battles are still fun, positioning units can be a little rough, but the maps are decent sized. I have helped siege a town, and those are gruesome. The enemy, in the city I attacked, had little cannons on the wall, shooting out at you as you stormed the beach. They said they would make sieging difficult, and they delivered, so well done there. The town only had 300 or so, and the people I was helping, and myself, had about 500-600 and we ended up limping away with 300 give or take. This was also near the beginning of the game, so elite troops were scarce, but even so.   The quest system is pretty neat, there is a variety of things you can do, from blowing up a mine, defending a mine, or even lighting ships on fire. The only downside to these is that you only have a finite number of troops, like 7 or so, and the enemy has 7 or so waves, consisting of 7 or so guys each. Just have to find a corner and let them come to you.   If you are a woman, and go do stuff with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you get reknown.   I haven't yet experienced the prisoner side of life yet, but when I do I'll be sure to elaborate, but I've heard its great.   Most of the other things in the game are pretty much like they were in Caribbean!, other than you need a clerk in a town to build, which is easy just annoying to do each town. I don't know how much this game is, like I said got it for free, but its pretty good. Watch out for the natives. They are crazy strong. 9/10",

            "review_text": "This is a qualified yes. I got the game on sale at a reasonable price for what it delivered. Full price I would vote down because of glitches and bugs. Some reviewers have compared it to Sid Meirs Pirates. It is nothing like Pirates, it comes from Mount &amp; Blade which it shows very clearly. Comparing the two is like looking at apples and oranges. They are both fruit, both round, both from a tree but nothing like each other. It is a fun romp in the pirate world but basically a mod of Mount &amp; Blade not something just using the same engine. Areas it does very well such as boarding an enemy ship. Ship to ship combat, not so much. Often I would close to fire a broadside and abruptly I was suddenly in a boarding action? Really? So if I can see the other ship on the screen to fire a broadside it can board me? So you need to fire blindly looking for a little marker that says the other ship is in range but not on the screen. Getting quests to chase outlaws or robbers on the islands is much harder than finding smugglers. Why? They disappear into towns, platations, or even coves never to be found. Since you can get on the island only at towns or coves, by the time you do, they are too close to what I mentioned so they are gone. Also when you leave your ships, you and your crew will be on horseback. Horses on a pirate ship? Makes sense only when you remember it is Mount &amp; Blade not a game using the same engine. Gliches are plenty as well. Walk around town and talk to anyone, their image superimposes on your own or blanks out completely. At the sale price this can be overlooked, at full price you left scratching your head what the devs were thinking. Didn\\'t they test such basic items before release? Then there are the bugs. I accepted an assignment to go to a cove to protect a shipment for a governor, fought off some attackers, and returned the governor for my reward. Abruptly I am being attacked, the daughter I supposed rescued? was suddenly there, and we were all killed. I\\'m going who, what, where? Game over. So for all these reasons I suggest getting it on sale otherwise wait until it is for it is not worth the full price as it currently stands.",

Im still a little frustrated they fixed ZERO lag problems and had to rename the game to get more customers. But I am happy they gave it to owners of the previous game for free.  All in all 9/10.

If you answered yes to these questions, then play this. Is $20 so much of a a cost in a world of $60 games with $29.00 season passes?? I enjoy this game as a fun pirate simulator, trade simulation and a good time to relax after work. Is it 100% finished and polished, no, is it better than most of the greenlight, early access that never get updated titles steam is full of, yes. If you enjoy being able to build your own strategy for dominating the Caribbean, buy the game and enjoy. The story isn't forced, the combat is definitely engaging, the game is hard if you just think you'll Sid Meir Pirates your way to the top, it takes planning and takes time to beat down the other nations.",

            "review_text": "I actually liked Caribbean, and the general thrust of the gameplay which was focused on trade and world domination, with a side of mount and blade style simulated combat. Although it runs rather slow on potato systems, the graphics are a great improvement over Mount and Blade.  If Caribbean was getting some mount and blade in Port Royale, this iteration is getting more mount and blade in Port Royale. Tons of missions, more sandbox features like blackjack and barroom brawls. There are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if you're into micro-♥♥♥♥♥ style roleplay. And there are guns and swords. Really big ones.  The mission varieties here are much greater than the original game, with more mount and blade styled quests. But to call them Mount and Bladeish quests is doing this game somewhat of a disservice. It's still weird as you're completely unable to swim (Mount and Blade's engine is to blame for that, I'm afraid.), but they've pulled off some interesting missions here.  In short, if you didn't like Caribbean, you may not change your mind for this game. Watch let's plays, look at other reviews and the feature list to decide if this game is for you before buying. And ignore the minimum specs listed, the game may not run so well on them. I can run it just barely at a steady 13 fps on my potato, but I don't know, your mileage may vary. I wouldn't recommend this game as an impulse buy, as many pirate-styled games can be. But it has been fun for me.",

Cons (listed for the developers): - Major bug, I just went to start a new game and the Start new Game option is greyed out. I deleted saved games, checked integrity of files, but can't seem to fix it. Help! [I just changed my review to negative based on this bug until it is fixed and I can play the game again.] - All the major pieces are here, however there are some pieces left out from Warband, such as sieging cities/forts, you can only assault them. - The menus get a bit tideous at times, e.g., it would be nice to be able to move troops you purchase from the garrison directly to the fort and not have to transport them back and forth through the main character's company. - I have to redistribute crews before reaching port and I can fill my ships from the other ships easily. I understand there should be a certain minium sized prize crew to sail a ship (one is laughable, but you allow it), but the others I should be able to more easily move to my depleted crews on my core ships. - the little plus sign doesn't show up on the list of crew when you click their button on the Party screen, this is annoying, having to search through each to find which ones advanced during battles, and who is the screen so small? Why not just use the regular crew/party screen? - Another item basic to all mount and blade games that is missing is that you can't choose which 'captives' you freed to bring into your company, it automatically chooses the weakest captives, from what I can tell. I could understand certain nationalities based on faction not joining, but... this sucks as it currently stands. - If you play as a pirate it would be fun after sea battles to be able to recruit sailors from defeated crews) or impress them if you are British, etc.). - The sea battles seem a little simplistic, they never seem to vary from head on encounters. And there is no way to command your other ships other than to anchor them. Needs work. - There is a very minor bug that caused a crash right after start up before I did anything (happened twice, no negative effect either time). - The game seems to be a little laggier than latest Warband.",

I mean seriously, they can't even get the rules right for for stupid blackjack minigame. Ace's count for 11 OR 1 how freaking hard is that to figure out?  The missions you can do they attempted to balance by forcing weapon loadouts and ignoring the equipment and troops what you've spent your money on. Even then they are terribly balanced, in most cases success comes down to pure luck of how well the thugs it gives you survive.  There is no way to escape from sea combat, so if you get pulled into it early on with the beginner ship then you might as well surrender. But worse then that was the fact there were no connon sounds the first time I got into one, none at all unless the volume for those sounds is about 300% less then regular sound levels.  The devs did well with M&amp;B and I hope 2 is even better, but this game they don't deserve any money for. It's an M&amp;B re-skinned with ships and it's not nearly as good. They got greedy by releasing this and it's obviously failed.",

Intro is confusing, it say that you purchased stuff to sell in hispaniola, look on map there is no area named that, go in quest tab and see that there is a tab with town listing and see no town named that. So you think that maybe it's a faction so you check faction name still no luck. So i finally sold the stuff to a random town without knowing what they usually go for. Tryed to find a way to assess the market but found no way. So i tough ok i will try a bit of fight to see how it goes. Fought a ship and we turned around each other for 15 minute firing at random (Dont think my shot was landing but it was night and i had merchant skill and ship build so that might explain it.)   So in short: Game is not built for trading. Might be good for fighting but i like to build an empire in those kind of game so if merchant part is screwed it's not fun for me.",

If you can't get it for less than you'd pay for a hot dog, get that instead.",
