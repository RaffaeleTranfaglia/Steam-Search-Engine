Unmatched when it comes to atmosphere and puzzles. I remember these masterpieces to be some of the brighest lights in my history of playing video games. So it was just a matter of time until i would pick Myst V and finally now when i found it (fortunatly being on sale, yay) there was no way around it. Sadly...I dont understand why this game wears the name 'Myst'. The story is flat, the puzzles are somehow boring and they didnt pull me into the game. I miss the once so excellent leveldesign and its awsome surreal enviroments who seemed so alive and fascinating. I also appreciated the real actors...its was one of the key features for me. Myst V at the other hand looks dead and flat. I dont feel any interest to go 'deeper' into this. What a shame...",

            "review_text": "Myst V is plagued with the same two things that made Myst URU unplayable: puzzle sadism, and bad dialog. First, the sadistic puzzles. Here's an example (spoiler!): at some point you come across controls for a cable tram connecting two points. One switch controls the direction (point A to point B, or point B to point A). A nearby lever gives the tram a push in that direction. When you discover these controls, you are at point A and the tram is at point B. Point B is so far away you actually don't know that the lever is doing anything, but 37 (seriously) 5-second pushes of the lever later, the tram is at point A. You get on the tram and discover a floor lever...that doesn't work, because the tram is powered from the other side. Fine. After more wanderings you get to point B via a completely different route, only to discover that the tram has to be in point B's dock in order for you to proceed, which requires you to go back to point A and hit that leverl 37 more times. What was the point of this puzzle, Cyan? To waste time on a mindless clicking goose-chase? What part of this did the design team sit down and decide would be fun: - that the tram is not in the screen when you're pumping the lever, so you don't know what it's doing? - that it takes *37* lever pumps to get the tram across the gap? - that the tram doesn't actually work when you finally get it to point A? - that after all that, the tram actually needs to be at point B to proceed, so the player has to run all the way back and manually reset it?  Similarly, there are more 'guess-and-run-for-a-while-and-check' puzzles -- things that require you to try random combinations and then spend a substantial amount of time running somewhere to see what, if any, effect it had.  The dialog also greatly detracts from the game, because most of it is vague, stream-of-consciousness wistful regret that's not related to the puzzles.  Overall, I'm very optimistic about the upcoming Obduction game, because Rand Miller specifically said they're trying to harken back to the days of Myst and Riven. Those were good games that had far more puzzles than sadism. As for Myst V, I gave it my best shot, but the poor design of that tram puzzle warranted nothing less than a rage-quit. ",

This was has a dizzying fish-eye lense type of view, and it's rather frustrating to move around in. I'd be more immersed in the game play and riddle solving if it weren't for the ever-present distrations.",
