This game is not worth any of that. 1: The entire game is in pretty much russian. Any and all servers you go to will have russian players. You will have no clue what they're even saying. Which hurts a english speaker such as myself. 2: Minecraft clone, It's not even a medicore Minecraft Clone such as Block Story. 3: The game is way to confusing for new players. All the help you will recive is in Russian. Meaning if you can't read russian, your going to have to play the game to figure out this game's controls. 4: Getting into a server with your friends is impossiable. This game doesn't have Steam invites or Steam joining. Which also means no VAC. Which means hackers. 5: The free to play mechinics. Need I say more?  All in all, this game isn't worth 10 dollars. Heck, H1Z1 will give more play time than this piece of broken programming. So, DO NOT SPEND 10 DOLLARS ON THIS GAME. Save it. Buy yourself a actualy GOOD game.",

Pros: 1: It's a small file ( Takes no time to download and install and none to be deleted) 2: It's a poor man's Minecraft (Free) 3: It's good for new or young gamers and can introduce them to the sandbox genre.  Cons... 1: The games menus are hard to navigate due to the menus being in russian. (This can be changed) 2: Even on the english setting the instructions are in russian 3: It's hard to build anything due to a lack of 'Nerd Poleing'  Conclusion... It is a good game for a New gamer who has limited funds or is new to the P.C however is limited due to microtransactions for items and the menus being in russian at heart. This would be a great game with the following proposals: 1: Translate the instructions and place them under a controls tab. 2: Add more variation to the starter blocks and make the blocks you have to pay for free but hard to aquire 3: I am unsure if the feature was in place at the time of my review but perhaps add a free flying ability 4: Something to set it apart from the other block placing games like customizable vehicles or even a more exploration based theme. I know that game development is hard, especially in small groups but I believe that with some fine tuning this game could be a winner. The only improvement I can suggest that I truly hope makes it, eventually, into the game is that it takes a step away from minecraft and loses the blocky charm in favour of a more rounded theme just to give it some edge over the competition. Overall it is a fun game with only a few small issues and is fun to play alone or with friends. I give it a 2.5/5 so your half way there. Keep up the hard work and I hope you take my reconmendations on board, Nuke_Dwarf_",

But from close up, it looks like crap Music- 0/10 THERE IS NONE. NO SERIOUSLY, NO MUSIC. Sound Effects- 8/10  They are actually pretty decent, the sound effects fit and they sound okay Community- 2/10 It's crap, people destory your buildings, spam, and just act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s Some problems- First, let's start off with language, this is a problem, because i set my language to ENGLISH BUT EVERYTHING ELSE SOME OTHER LANGUAGE I HAVE NO ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA WHAT IT IS. Second, the game doesn't even tell you everything, there is a bunch of other stuff you can do, like talk or some ♥♥♥♥. And finally, it's boring. This is because A- All the other 'Fun' minigames has severs with NOBODY playing in then (Execpt for one or something) B- The commnutity is ♥♥♥♥ (like i said before) C- You need to buy like 70% of everything in the store to make a good inside of a house, which is hard considering the game doesn't even give you ways to even GET MONEY.  This, this game is horrible. Don't even click that 'Download' button  Overall, in total, this game get's a 4/10. ",
