Montaro is funny and worth spending time on, of course it does take a while to collect all 802 Pantsu, but it's worth it.

All you have to do is click click, check out all the panties and collect coins that will unlock adorable outfits.  I personally appreciate the art and I think that 99 cents should not even matter if this little game makes a rainy day happier. I strongly recommend it!  + Cute art and animations; + A bunch of adorable stuff to unlock (also as motivation to keep playing 'till you get them all!); + Steam achievements; + Nice trading cards, badges and backgrounds; + Lovely music (that kind of 8-bit game music without making you feel annoyed); + Unique idea ♡ collecting pantsu.  - Repetitive gameplay; - No pause button (?); - I wish we had some sort of super powers that could be unlocked aswell.",

Crows can be defeated if Illiterate Internet Dog bounces off a banana to strike it!  Be warned, though.   Bouncing off banana peels to strike crows costs you half of a pair of schoolgirl panties. Naturally. The only way to replenish your supply of 'Six halves of school girl panties' is to literally jump under their skirt and take it.

The costumes are 10/10 and the soundtrack is pretty decent to be listening too.  The only things that are a pain is the tedious grinding for 802 pantsu (if you're an achivement hoe like me) and the fact that you can only use your mouse (left click) to make doge-chan jump.

            "review_text": "Another shovelwave title to add to your Steam library. For .99 cents wouldn't be a bad price if the game wasn't so broken. It's a shame too because I think it could have been a fun game if it weren't for a few things. Now the graphics are really nice, the soundtrack is not bad and the objective of the game is simple. However there are a few things that really bog this game down. You have almost no control over your character other than jump. It is not clear on what will kill you and want won't. For example there are some cats in the background, they don't hurt you except one type. How was I suppose to know? It blends in with the background. The hit detective is off. Sometimes you can kill the crows but most of the time you can't? Why? The worst thing is they cause permanent death. Hordes of chickens also cause permanent death. You trigger them by hitting the one chicken on the fence but most of the time you will hit it because it's unavoidable like most things in the game. If you were to move your character left and right this wouldn't be a problem. I only bought this because it's a game about the doge meme and I wanted to get the achievements because of it but you can't get the achievements. Either they are broken or very cryptic to get. It doesn't explain how to get them. This game needs a lot of work. As of right now it's a 1/10.  UPDATE:  I revisited the game. The dev has put in the achievements. After a few gameplays you start to notice what kills you and what doesn't. There is still a problem with lack of controls. It'd be great if you can move doge but you can't other than jumping. A lot of objects are very unavoidable and you have to time it right. This game still feels like it's lacking. This game feels like one of those generic app games you find free on your phone. It's just a time waster for easy achievements and cards. 4/10 is my new score.",

            "review_text": "This game has doge, really good graphics, varying environments and great ideas. But it doesn't have anything fun.  The randomly generated levels just don't work. Sometimes you can't do anything to doge obstacles, you can decide between falling into a sewer and jumping into a crow. Or you can decide between walking into a banana which catapults you into a flock of chicken or jumping over the banana and landing in the flock yourself. Every obstacle except for the bananas which can be used as catapults instantly kill you even though you have 3 lives. Sometimes you're lucky and survive for 2 minutes, sometimes you already die at the first obstacle after 10 seconds.  The game also has lots of tearing.  The only thing worth playing for is collecting coins which are scattered on the roofs you sometimes can't even reach. But what for? So you can enjoy not having fun with new costumes.  Seriously, this game could be really good, but it needs a LOT more polishing. Sure, it costs less than a dollar, but in the era of indie games you can get way more for that amount of money. Don't get fooled by the positive reviews, the game only gets thumbed up because of the doge meme. The gameplay isn't worth the mention.",
