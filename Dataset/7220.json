            "review_text": "Well... Here is the continuation to Runaway series,  Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle , made in 2006. Aside that little bit of factual definition, there is not a single good thing to say about this game. If you've played the first game and declared it a tasteless, tacky and overcomplicated little adventure full of character stereotypes as I did, be warned: This is way worse than the first game. At least, the first game was working properly!  Adventures of self-acclaimed genius Ken doll Brian Basco continue from where we left him: on a vacation in Hawaii with the oversexualized bimbo stereotype Gina who he ended up as lovers beforehand. Thanks to a series of unfortunate - and mindlessly obvious - wrong choices, Brian ends up surviving a plane crash to only get stranded on an island invaded by military forces, missing Gina without a clue to her whereabouts. How...very...convenient. As before, his story will start with a destined accident and progress to become ridiculous, fast pacing and needlessly complicated over a short period of time. Buckle your seats, and be ready for alien conspiracy theories.  First and foremost, I really have a problem about the story execution in this game. In the first game, we went through a series of absurd events and got blessed with miraculous luck so random strangers with extraordinary talents and means ended up helping us regularly to get a happy ending. Brilliant. Here in this continuation, the same dynamic applies - but the game is needlessly extended to present the illusion for the presence of a game time. The first 3 chapters that take place in Mala Island are somewhat consistent with the main story if not harbored with annoyingly superficial humor and aroused teenage level sexual remarks. The rest of the game is an unbearable story anchor for situational comedy purposes mostly. The whole chapter 4 is only there to serve as a situational comedy during a supposed intergalactic emergency! Look, I can appreciate absurd humor, I loved every single moment of  Monkey Island  series, but there is nothing funny about deliberately feeding a complete stranger to a polar bear's sexual frustration, just because Brian decided to icefish at the spot the bear's standing! It's plain disgusting.  Aside a slight improvement on graphics and in-game animations, the game uses the same character design, 2D environments and a combination of 3D modeled cut scenes alongside 2D dialogue sequences among characters. Gosh, even the design choice is over complicated here! Fair warning: 3D cut scenes where Brian talks to Sushi, beginning from the start of the game, are spastically slow for some reason. Speaking of bugs, first 3 chapters of the game work fine, but the game gets unbelievably slow when you reach 4th Chapter. It takes a couple seconds to even move the mouse from one point to another. I think it's a problem with the snowing animation. I tried everything in my ability but couldn't find a way to mend it so I ended up closing the game and finding a YouTube playthrough to watch the rest to learn the story. This bug occurs with both Windows 7 Pro and 8.1 Pro. Be warned.  As before, game logic is flawed - not letting you go for the obvious solution before trying everything else to be rejected properly is our main thing. But ask yourself this: what kind of dimwit of a protagonist gets snow shoes to his inventory in a tropical island and leaves first aid kit behind, after a plane crash??? Such is our game logic. Puzzles are somewhat simple, but story progression and dialogues are a pain to go through. I'd vote for 'nope, surely there is something better to do'.  If you enjoy crass humor and are fond of 'It was aliens!' skets - and able to forgive not being able to play half the game - sure, go for it. Otherwise, avoid it. Yeah, I will still play the last part of the series to get done with it and write a review. I know, I know. I love my community...

            "review_text": "This game is just... absurd. It tries to be funny, Monkey-Island style, but fails miserably. The puzzles are sometimes really annoying and there's that thing I hated in the first game as well - you can clearly see an object A, but Brian (main character) will refuse to take it. However, after having a completely unrelated dialogue with another character, Brian WILL pick up object A because it now makes sense (does it?) to pick it up. I'd call this a poor game design, even though it may look logical at first glance.  Overall, I did complete the game but I got frustrated too many times. Unfortunately :(",

The puzzles are difficult enough, the story is all dreamlike insanity, the graphics are colorful and the humor is well done. It is truly unfortunate that the third and final game does not run on in the same vein.",

            "review_text": "Runaway: The Dream of The Turtle feels like 6 separate poorly designed point and click adventure games strung loosely together by extremely dated racism and sexual 'humor' that culminates to a cringe worthy cliff hanger that was clearly intended to hype the next game but fails miserably.    First, the game suffers from some critical design flaws. Namely performing tasks requires flags to be triggered. Say you search a trunk and find nothing. Go fish some goggles out of a puddle and suddenly that trunk has everything you need in it. Sometimes talking to other characters will suddenly allow you to see the random item that will be useful later on.  The game was also buggy, Snow fall halted the game to a near standstill, I had to use a DirectDraw wrapper to get the game running at full speed.  There is also some unusual cut scenes that add nothing. Near the end, we see main character Brian go scuba diving about 6 times in 1 cut scene, repeatedly getting in the water, getting out, talking to another character then repeating the process with slight variation in the animation. It doesn't make any sense WHY the extra-long animations were included when so many have nothing to do with the main story or are just inflated for no reason. Worse yet, the game has a tendency to crash during these cut scenes, so hopefully you saved before they started.   But all of that is just design, I haven't gotten to the story. Story is nonsensical. I feel like it is trying REALLY hard to be Secret of Monkey Island and portray Brian as the second coming of Guybrush Threepwood, but he is not. He's an extremely unlikable and unfunny character that I tried to click of a cliff more than a few times. The game takes place in 6 locales, and with every shift in location the grip on the main story lines slips further away. At the start of the game you are searching for your girlfriend you kicked out of a plane, and by the end you are a mighty pirate. In between all that, you cheat on your girlfriend, get a man ♥♥♥♥♥, and finish that off by getting drunk.  Yeah this is some real frat boy humor. It is filled with stuff that might have flown in an 80s sexcapade movie, but here it is just painful to sit through now.  Like I said in the start to this review, the game ends on a cliff hanger. You go through each stage of the game looking for the next McGuffin, only to be rewarded with a To Be Continued.  Racism is just annoying in this game. They have a 1950s Japanese stereotype running around being annoying. He was in the last game but only for a few scenes, now he is a major character.   The game doesn’t seem to know what it is trying to be. Whether it’s an Animal House parody, a Spy like Us parody, Indiana Jones parody, or Secret of Monkey Island parody, it just fails at all of them. None of the little throw backs amused me. With that in mind I can’t recommend. I played the Runaway game that came before this, it had a ton of issues too, but it benefitted from a more humble character and more diluted sexism and racism.   This game is just bad.",

            "review_text": "This a great step up from the first installment in the Runaway series in many ways. The improvements are enough for me to say that I would recommend this game to a friend. Before I talk about what really worked for this game, let me say the big issues I experienced.  I broke the game in Act 2 by using the butter on Joshua while worked on the bull, before I greased up the chain and untied it. This made it so I was unable to progress and it wound up taking me about an hour to finally consult the walkthrough and find out that it was impossible to continue. This is a really unfortunate thing to happen so early in the game, but I wish that was the worst thing I experienced. All of Act 4 was laggy beyond playability. I had to go through it with a walkthrough next to me, because every action took double the amount of time it should. If I did this legitimately, it probably would have taken a day just to play this one Act. Also, Joshua felt a little too much like the racially charged Mickey Rooney character in Breakfast at Tiffany's, which got overbearing at times.  The story is pretty good, and it definitely keeps you guessing with the inclusion of military and alien things. There are some great characters that you'll remember like Knife, O'Connor, and Archibald. I didn't understand that I was playing through a 'To Be Continued' game though, which can be upsetting when you see it. I feel like Pendulo could have stated that better in the description on Steam, because after 20+ hours of figuring out puzzles, I want to see Brian save Gina!   All around, it's a great game, and I enjoyed all of the parts that played well. The logic through the game made sense, and it was fun to get the rewarding moments of successfully solving a puzzle. The cutscenes were also fun to watch, and it felt like they greatly added to the player having empathy to the characters.",
