            "review_text": "A psychedelic drug trip through the 50’s or so it seems, Jazzpunk is packed with many little humorous things to discover, weird people to meet, and fun levels to visit. So put on your crazy hat, sit back and enjoy.  You are Polyblank who is sent on missions to recover some stolen goods and discover some things are not what they seem. There is voice acting while words are projected onto the characters and areas around the screen. You can do weird things like clean out a guy’s bat ears with a giant q-tip you find on the ground. Many funny stuff happens in this game that had me laughing many times. My kids watched some of it too and really got a kick out of it. Why not get in a pillow fight and knock the girl out the window or spray pigeon perfume on someone and watch the pigeons attack. These are just a few funny things to see.  The game is short though and can be finished in about 3-4 hours but that won’t take away and fun or experience. The $15 price tag is a little high but if you catch this on sale pick it up because it is a great game to experience. I would have loved to play more and hope maybe the devs will put out some add-on content or maybe a sequel. Probably won’t happen but I can always dream. It reminded me of Thirty Flights of Loving with its art style and somewhat similar story telling. Also if you are an achievement hunter they are all pretty easy to achieve and also fun to earn. Don’t miss out on this must play game.  Bear Rating: 9/10",

You'll have a few consecutive thoughts while playing this game:  1. Wow, what a silly, quirky and unique game.  2. This is getting kind of repetitive, but the NPCs say amusing things. 3. How long is this game? 4. Oh good, it's over.  The game started off well but quickly fell into a funk of bland. It's good that it's short, but that hinders the idea of paying $15 for this. If given a chance, I wouldn't have paid more than 5.   Also, I ran into a few bugs. Stuff like getting knocked off the map, having to restart a chapter because I did something out of the linear order, and the game completely locking up.",

In the 3 or so hours of actual playtime I've finished the game twice and gotten all the achievements, the only way you can take a long time on a mission is by over analysing an objective. This game is too overpriced for it's content and should only be gotten on sale or in a bundle.",

Shooter isn't the right word here I guess, because you won't be shooting anyone here, and when you do (maybe 2-3x) it's just for the fun of it.   This game parodies a lot of games and movies from the 80's and 90's and does it in style. I must admit that I wasn't impressed by the graphics of the game when I first saw the screenshots, but after having played it it looks really sharp and clean. The NPC's are still roughly modeled, however, and I think they could've done a better job here, but that's debatable.  There are so many little details, scenes and easter eggs to be found that you can't help but smile if you understand a reference. I don't think a lot of people will be laughing out loud, it's just all too random.  There are, technically, 4 levels to complete (if you count the mini levels it's a bit higher, of course) and each of them can be completed in around 30 minutes. So it isn't a long game. In fact, I think you can finish it within an hour if you just rush through it, but trust me, it's worth it to touch/activate/etc. as much as you can, and just play around with stuff. For a game this random I was surprised to actually find a semi decent story here. It won't blow anyone away, but considering the context of the game it's kinda fun.  If you like weird and random games play Jazzpunk. It's also good if you want to relax. You can take your time doing things, and you're not being pushed forward every 2 minutes. Yes,... yes, I think I like Jazzpunk.  [Rating: 76/100]",

As in within the first few minutes of booting up the game, their first few jokes already had me chuckling it up.  Just remember to think of Jazzpunk as an old-school adventure game, what with you going around touching and grabbing everything in an effort to trigger progress. But in the meantime, as you do that dreaded thing adventure games often make you do and  touch - EVERY - THING  to make sure you don't miss anything, Jazzpunk throws lots of great jokes and gags into every nook and cranny to fill your search.",

And that's actually kind of surprising, seeing how jokes about computers, video games or old detective stories aren't exactly new. Some examples:  -your chief asks you to sit down in a stern voice...but there's a farting pillow on your seat -cyber sex if you insert a coin in a fembot -WEDDING QUAKE! -(from the credits) 'stunts performed by...unpaid interns'  And so on. About the only game that comes close to comparison (that I know) are Wario's minigames, but those who've played that know that these sorts of games are unique in and of themselves. So all I can say is that the building quality is decent and that the jokes are good ones. Sure, it's not very long. But on a game like this, one shouldn't expect that.",

Gameplay is inspired by spoof comedy films and cartoons of yesteryear, with a focus on weird gadgets, exotic locales, and open-world style exploration.' -Please read the entirety of the review for all considerations-  The Cold War era and corporate-espionage themes are nice and not common in games. There is, mixed in, a world where technological integration and a feeling of publicity in every action taken is felt. The locations visited in the game, especially if they are actually named their alternative national names (in a 'mission' where you fly to your location) are a nice variety. That being said, for the gameplay; there is a good amount to see on each level and a nice artistic style. While the levels are decent, they tend to be relatively short considering how many levels there are in the game. With a dozen or so levels (there I told you how many there are): some can be completed in a manner of minutes- even one that can be completed in seconds (the 'mission' where you fly to your location). This game relies on the side-missions or exploring the locations to add gameplay, as doing the objective straight-forward results in a even-moreso short game. The game story is spy-ish and that's nice and all, but with little context as to what you are actually doing and an ending that says 'this could be explained later' but, as of September 2015, has no additional missions or follow-up.   For 15 US dollars, this game is short in gameplay and (frankly) not a high gameplay-to-dollar ratio. I have, as of this review, 3.1 hours into the game: and that includes two runs of the entire game, exploring the entirety of each map; playing the joke mini-games, like Wedding Qake, several times; and replaying select levels to do all the mini-games over again, like the 'boss level' and the 'vacation resort' locations.  That being said, for the good quality and detail and fun this game has, for 15 dollars I would not recommend this game until, either, there is a sale or some sort of additional gameplay bundled with it.

I would pick it up when its on sale. but all in all its great game and one you should pick up. 9/10",

I am going to give it a thumbs down because: 1) It takes no effort or thought to play. I have clicked everything, played all the mini games, searched every corner, gotten all the achievements and feel like I didn't do anything worthwhile when all is said and done. 2) The humor was not my kind of humor and it's unrelenting. That's a problem since humor seems to be half the game content (the other half are the visuals). For the most part, it is a continuous stream of computer-geek puns. IE: You go into a restaurant and the waitress says 'I will be your dedicated server.' Lots and LOTS of that. There is almost no dialogue per se, just a lot of word play. 3) The game made me feel ill which really surprised me. If you play for more than 30 minutes in a go, especially after the first chapter, most likely you will end up with a degree of motion sickness no matter how rarely you get it in real life. This game could probably be weaponized for that ability. 4) The game is very very short, though given everything else, that is sort of a plus.   I kept expecting something in the game to wow me, to grab me mentally at least once, but nothing ever did. It's colorful fluff. If you like computer puns and pure silliness -- you'll probably have a great time. If you want more from a game than just being taken on a ride, or if puns make you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance -- then you probably want to give the game a miss.",

It's a game where you feel rewarded by looking at every little detail because so much of it has extra things to offer. It's not all in your face either, constantly forcing you to be in a typical funny situation. In fact a lot of the comedy in the game is quite subtle and you have to steer from the path in order to find it, but it makes you appreciate it as you play through. The attention to comedic detail is quite marvelous.  The gameplay is nice and simple. You walk around, interact with objects in often fun and ingenious ways to complete puzzles and make your way through the story. The graphics are very cartoony but still maintains a great atmosphere with all the music and extra sounds going on. It suits the tone of the game perfectly.  It's something nice, different and random. Nothing like I have played before and definitely a great experience. Would recommend.",

The game itself is really more about the funny* hidden jokes than the silly storyline. So I only recommend this game if you have the patience to examine every little thing you come across.

            "review_text": "Jazzpunk is a comedy in the burgeoning sub genre of first person games like Gone Home or Thirty Flights of Loving that seek to tell a linear story in a non-linear experience by shepherding the protagonist with incentives. This review is the hardest review I've ever attempted to write. Being a comedy, and a video game, many of the jokes are deadpan and are uniquely structured to the levels of the game. Because of that there were levels that hit the mark, such as Wedding Quake were hilarious. Often times though there were jokes in levels that matched that were nearly identical to each other in structure, cadence and delivery right after each other that were not only not funny but actively served to make subsequent new jokes in that level less funny.  This fault of the game seems to be a result of the non-linear structure. Due to it being a non-linear game there are many chances to miss things. Due to this they would reuse minigames and even types of jokes. That said reused jokes can be funny. There are multiple instances where you are sent through a zombie pizza hut minigame trifle, and each time it gave me goosebumps and it would cause uncontrollable laughter. Most of the jokes are not given as much car as the pizza hut gag or Wedding Quake and are mere stand-up routines. There are instances when multiple non-player characters in levels will give similar routines but not quite the same, and these jokes fall flat.  Jazzpunk in many ways is a stark realization that game developers growing up playing Nintendo 64 games are now making games of their own. It’s a weird artifact from an era that went in a different direction, when minigames dominated and there were a torrent of incentives deployed at the player character to get them to complete a non-linear environment in a linear way. In the end, what this boils down to is a unique refreshing experience that's comedy doesn't hack it the whole way through.",

Sometimes I found the game to be quite exhausting, because you get bombardeded with hilarious/senseless jokes/references.  The camera placement and moving gave me headaches and made me sick (I'm ususally not the type, that has problems with mostion sickness).  It's like one of these joke-books with bad jokes in it and quite a waste of 2 hours of your time if you can't connect with the type of humor. The Gameplay (simple mini-games) isn't very enjoyable either.  Even for the 9 € I've paid it's quite pricey :/",
