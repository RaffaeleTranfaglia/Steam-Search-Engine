Nice ambiental music, beautiful graphic, precise cursor moving, without any single bug, achievements perfectly work, quality made HOGs, interesting puzzles and also nice ending story for this trilogy. I really enjoyed in this one...",

            "review_text": "You know how you have something you enjoy doing that you feel maybe isn't the thing you should really be doing? Like maybe you like eating at McDonalds, or jacking it to videos of Swedish weightlifters. That's the way I feel about Artifex Mundi games. I have them all, I've finished them all, but as much as I like them, I feel like I should be playing somehting more substantial. Somehow I just like the calmness of it all. The bland, monotone female protagonist, the puzzles that pretty much repeat from game to game, it's a simple, familiar formula, and it's comfortable.   I can't really complain, I've gotten many hours of gameplay out of these point and click games featureing the same woman who for whatever reason cannot stop losing her daughter to various demons and ghosts that seem intent on kidnapping her. Personally, if I was this ladies daughter, every time she wanted to go on a trip, I'd be like 'Um, no thanks, but I've been kidnapped by demon ghosts the last five trips, I think I'll sit this one out.'   Overall, I really have a good time, or at least a relaxing time, playing these games, as the puzzles are not really challenging, and the scenes are well done. If you are looking for a game that won't stress you out, or are someone who values bland voice acting, I would suggest that you try pretty much any Artifex Mundi game.",

            "review_text": "'Nightmares from the Deep 3: Davy Jones' is probably the best Artifex Mundi game I've played. It's definitely the best of the 'Nightmares from the Deep' series, and that series is one of their best. Just about everything in this casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG) is better than it is in earlier works: graphics, voice acting, and story. Best of all, we aren't forced into a second full playthrough to get 100% Achievements. A single playthrough on Expert plus doing the first three HOGs as Majhong in a second partial playthrough can get us everything. Yay! My only complaints (and they're very minor) are that I hate the daughter (which has been true in all three games of the series) and they have too many Fractured Object Games (FROGs). I defnitely prefer HOGs to FROGs.  It took me 7.3 hours to get through the main story and an additional 1.9 hours for the Bonus chapter. So, 9.2 hours of very good gameplay makes the game worth buying even at it's list price. Of course, I bought it on sale :) .",

Developer Artifex Mundi once again delivered polished puzzles, challenging hidden object searches, and an engaging story. This time the skeletal pirates stole the show, with some great voice acting that had me smiling. This game by itself was lot of fun, but I'd also like to reiterate just how much I adored the trilogy as a whole. Thumbs up!",

            "review_text": "This game... kind of spoiled me for hidden object games. The story isn't great, the graphics can be kind of weird, etc etc etc. But it's got a great amount of variety - the fact that you can play mahjongg instead of do the actual hidden object puzzle was a godsend when I was just rushing through to 100% the thing. There was a consistency to the story progression that made everything feel logical in terms of where to go and what to do. It never felt like I was being subjected to cheap tricks to drag out the gameplay and create the illusion of difficulty. I wouldn't call the voice acting inspired, but I never felt driven to mute the thing.  A note on achievements: if you're going to collectibles, use a guide. Especially for animals. Interacting with animals is the easiest thing to screw up and there's no going back on them. If you're going for the 'never use hint/skip' you can't use the 'play mahjongg instead' feature because that doesn't count.  Despite the occasional weirdness when things were moving, the art in this game was very pretty and showed a lot of attention to detail. And was sparkly. Everything sparkly, always. It was pretty and I like it. The music was also nice.  I never played the first two games and don't think it's obligatory to enjoy this game.",

Standard Mundi fare - HOGs, puzzles, collect the trinkets for story fragments, creepy character animation, and extra hidden stuff. On the plus side, there are no 'phasing' secrets meaning you won't have to stare at rooms for long, waiting for the secret to phase into reality; if it's to be found, it's in plain sight.  You would think that after two romps, the daughter of this series would learn how to not be stupid. Sadly, nope. The mother is too busy unleashing horrible piratey ghosts to be a decent enough parent to tell her daughter to you know, stay out of it. But here's counting on her for being stupid yet again in the fourth game.",
