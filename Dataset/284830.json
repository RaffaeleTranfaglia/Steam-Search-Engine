            "review_text": "I've played a handful of Artifex Mundi's hidden object games, and I think this may be my favorite one yet. Based on a popular series of Polish children's books, Clockwork Tales is an imaginative, fun, curious and enjoyable title who's emphasis is more on casual adventure than hidden objects. Set in a steampunk version of the 1700's, you play Evangeline Glass, an intelligent young protégé to the brilliant Dr. Ink. With the help of Ink's clockwork companion, Matthew the bird, you must save Hochwald and the doctor from the machinations of the evil Grand Engineer Barber.   One of the things I enjoy most about hidden object games is the beautiful and imaginative artwork many have, and this game is no exception. Everything, including the characters, have a hand-painted look which gives it a storybook-like quality. Even the characters share the art style, which looks so much better than the oddly rendered/animated 3D models in other games.   The game play is your standard IHOG/HOPA, adventure game lite with hidden object scenes mixed in. I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game play, but I found Clockwork Tales to be quite easy, even more so than most games in the genre. This isn't a horrible thing, but considering how much I enjoyed the world that was created, I wanted to spend a lot more time there than a mere 3 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even so, the adventure aspect was very fun with nothing jumping out as being crazy illogical, and the many puzzles were moderately challenging despite most being reused from previous games. One nice touch was being able to utilize Matthew to collect out of reach items and perform certain tasks. Most of these aren't too hard to figure out, but it's a nice bit of flavor added to a genre that is very 'cut and paste' in most gameplay aspects.  The hidden object scenes are very well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden. Mixed in amongst your standard HOS's are a few FROGs (fragmented object scenes), adding a bit of variety to the gameplay. I noticed, however, that the regular HOS's tend to get more plentiful the further you progress through the game. This wasn't an issue for me as I really like them, but not everyone shares that sentiment. For those who do not, the number of these scenes are quite low overall compared to other games.  While the setting is one of the best parts of the game, the story in the beginning feels a little rushed and can be a bit confusing. But once things get going and you move out of the village into the castle, the storytelling smooths out quite a bit. There are no dark, disturbing themes here (unlike so many others in the genre), and the story isn't deep by any means, but that doesn't detract from it's enjoyability. This is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone but makes a particularly good family game, especially for parents who are looking for less macabre fair to share with their kids.  One of my biggest issues in previous games from this developer has been the voice acting, but Clockwork Tales is a vast improvement overall, especially with the main characters. Now I'm not saying these are award winning performances, but they're not jarring nor do they sound out of place given the material, and they don't pull me out of the experience as they would in other games. Funny enough, the one game in which I find the voice work to be pleasant enough is the one in which we get a toggle for the voiceovers. The option is still appreciated and I hope we continue seeing it in the future.  This is the Collector's Edition of the game and comes with the bonus chapter (a short prequel to the main story), replayable puzzles and hidden object scenes, wallpapers, soundtrack and collectible 'steambugs' that are sprinkled throughout the game. I'm usually not big on having to find additional hidden items in these types of games, but the steambugs were a treat. Aside from their imaginative and adorable designs, they're generally not too hard to spot, although it may take you a couple of play throughs to find a few you missed.   All in all, I enjoyed Clockwork Tales immensely and am only disappointed in it's short length. But the little time that I spent in the game world was time I completely enjoyed. I will definitely come back to this one again and again.",

            "review_text": "You defeat an evil German steampunk engineer in this casual hand-drawn hidden-object adventure lasting approximately 4 hours, with the 'collector's edition' bonus chapter adding another hour.  The writing and voice-acting is competent if not exciting, the gameplay is linear to the point of having items in the scene disabled whose time has not yet come, there's an extensive help system: on easy, the map is marked where you need to be to progress in the story, and n the scenes there are golden sparkles on the puzzle you need to solve next. There are a few manipulation puzzles and some hidden object puzzles, and they're all fairly small and well integrated into the storyline: for example, with the hidden objects, you are always looking for something (or parts to something) that you'll need to progress in the storyline. I especially liked the dollhouse puzzle: 4 puppets in a dollhouse are looking for pairs of objects, and once you find the objects, you see a small animation where the dolls actually use them - very satisfying.  The storyline has voiceovers, the hints do not: I'd recommend the game for anyone age 6 and up if they can read or have someone who can help them if they get stuck (but with the hint system, that should hardly happen). Also, if you ever wanted your very own steambug collection or find the recipe for the Steam Horse drink ('I'd give up my helmet for a Steam Horse!'), this game might be for you.  The included bonus prequel is about an hour, with the professor in the village using the bits that you could look at, but not use, in the main game.  Some small gripes like light beams colliding instead of passing through each other or minor inaccuracies in the 'evil German' grammar (the German subtitles are very well written!) do not detract from an overall experience that is well crafted, even if it doesn't reach the scope or the immersiveness of a 'big' adventure like  Machinarium .",

The game can be completed in under 5 hours, on expert mode, so it's not too demanding where you can't still play it casually. Does that even make sense...?   The story begins in a small town known as Hochwald - presumably somewhere in Germany. While a once peaceful town, you will quickly find that that is the case no more. Agent Evangelie Glass is summoned by her friend and mentor, Dr. Ink, who is on a mission to uncover the mysterious secrets of the Barber family. Hochwald has, ultimately, been plagued by increasingly powerful tremors, and Dr. Ink has landed himself in trouble by attempting to sabotage 'master inventor Barber', the latter of whom does not have the town in his best interest. With the help of a little mechanical bird, named Matthew, do you have what it takes to thwart Barber's evil plans?   Pros",

I found it amusing though the puzzles were not very challenging - this is not necessarily a bad thing because sometimes I just want a mindless game I don't have to stretch my brain muscles too hard to beat. The storyline was a bit convoluted but not the worst I've seen. And despite the 'hidden object' tag, it's not a hidden object game. Rather, there were a few hidden object puzzles scattered throughout but the vast majority of the puzzles were of the 'make a pattern' or 'solve this' variety. I'm not sure I would have paid the full $8 price for this, but if it's on sale, it's a decent value.",

            "review_text": "Hidden Object games do get a lot of flak, and I must admit to being one of their harshest critics. This is primarily because some companies who once made standard point and click adventures have instead jumped ship to these games. Focus Multimedia are an example taking the Art of Murder and Chronicles of Mystery series from point and click to Hidden Object games in their later instalments.  The trouble is that a lot of these games are made on a budget, one that is very tight and they often look it. The gameplay is often usually a few scenes and some random objects in a list. There are exceptions however in this genre and I'm please to say Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink is one of these. DON'T go in expecting a point and click, it is still an HOG but at least it appears to be of decent quality and the game length isn't bad.  I got hold of this in a sale on Steam and it was worth the money.",

The most of the puzzles were pretty simple, but still held my attention. The plot was fairly interesting, but I would have enjoyed a bit more character interactions.  Be aware that this game was really short, so I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale (like I did). Overall, playing 'Clockwork Tales' was a pleasant experience, and I'd be willing to try another game in the series.",

The hidden object segments were easy to the point you could just click randomly on objects that stood out and it was usually something you were supposed to be finding anyway.  I was also expecting too much from the writing based on the descriptions and other reviews. The few characters you meet and talk to are just plot devices. It's worth mentioning the way they're animated gets into serious uncanny valley territory at times, too. Their faces move and warp while the rest of their body remains perfectly still, which takes some getting used to. The storyline turned out to be just an excuse plot (an evil man has a machine that he uses to create earthquakes, because...well, just because). The world has a few interesting details, like having patron saints for different scientific advancements, but the steampunk here was really more of an aesthetic than anything.  I can easily imagine others enjoying this, so if you're just looking for a pretty world with lots of soothingly easy puzzles to tinker with, by all means pick this game up. It would also be great for young kids. I'm afraid it just wasn't for me.",

            "review_text": "Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink was the first HOG I have ever completed in my gaming history. I was beginning to feel attracted for the genre and decided to try this one out, due to it's reviews. I must say, I was surprised. This title shines in so many ways, from the art, to voice acting, soundtrack and puzzle originality. The art utilized in Clockwork tales is beautiful and lines up perfectly with the steampunk-ish universe where the story is set up. Voice acting is of high quality and never fails to impress.  As I mentioned before, this is the first HOG game I've finished, but from the puzzles I completed, I was mostly pleased with their originality, never making gameplay repetitive in any way possible. I was also awed with the animation style and how movement actions are carried out.  At your disposal, you have a mechanical bird, Matthew, that can be used to reach objects located in, otherwise, unreachable places. the main characters are interesting but due to the small playtime they aren't deeply explored, which leaves you, the player, to acknowledge only superficial information about them.  Replayability is encouraged due to the existence of achievements such as: complete the game in expert mode, find all hidden bugs and don't misclick in any HOG segments. The bonus chapter, also a prequel to the title's events, is a nice addition and provides background on Professor Ink.    Conclusion: A must have for gamers who enjoy the HOG genre, and an excellent option for some who never played any titles of this nature. Low playtime, but high replayability. Great story, beautiful art and pleasant character design. Interesting steampunk-ish universe, and expanded by a bonus chapter (prequel). Recommend!",

It's more of a puzzle game than a hidden object one, which suited me fine. Al]though there are bonus hidden object screens unlocked at the end of the game, if you're left wanting more.  Pros: - Great art, especially the backgrounds and that clockwork bird. - The story is pretty light, but the writing is good. I felt in safe hands. - I found the puzzles to be just right. Professor Layton level, although simpler in setup. - Enjoyably competent female main character, but one who doesn't suddenly start shooting people or killing them with big swords out of nowhere. - Emphasis on solving problems through intelligence, not violence.  Cons: - If you like hidden object games, you might be a little disappointed since the game is mostly puzzles.  Definitely recommend, and I look forward to seeing more in this series.",
