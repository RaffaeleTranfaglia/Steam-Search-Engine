I started playing it for the Playfire/GMG rewards, but it turned out to be a nice arcade shooter and I'm enjoying it way more than I thought I would. I recommend you pick it up if you're old enough to miss Duck Hunt... or if you are just plain cool. :)",

So, my Steam stats don't reflect my actual play time with Major Mayhem.  PROS: + FUN! + Easy to pick up, difficult to master. + Tons of unlockables. + Cheap at only $5 (USD). FREE for iOS, Android, Windows phones, and Kindle Fire. + LOW hardware requirements. + Cross-platform; Windows/Mac/Linux compatible. + Fun graphics are easy on the eyes and not intimidating to casual players.  CONS: - No online multiplayer, yet. - 'Hardcore' gamers may be put off by Major Mayhem's 'accessibility'.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those much-maligned mobile ports, but in this case I think PC gamers got the better deal. This plays so well with a mouse that the thought of playing it with a touchscreen baffles me. It does, however, suffer from some of the usual port problems and occasional bugs, though I am happy to forgive those here. It also chooses not to explain what its various game modes are and how they work, for some reason.  In terms of gameplay, this is enormous fun and surprisingly clever. It just feels so satisfying to play; it's addictive and has plenty of levels to replay and achievements to unlock. I really like the way that most enemy projectiles don't hurt, and those that do give you just enough warning for quick and clever dodges. You can even deflect them if you're quick! It all makes you feel like you're in a dumb action movie, in the best way possible.  Thematically this falls square into the category of the traditional 'hur hur 'murica' joke, complete with cigar-chomping commando and 'ironic' racism. I think that's a little tired now, and probably doesn't stand up to deeper scrutiny, but to be fair it does mix it up a bit in later levels. I'd like the game better if it had a different theme, maybe, but it's hard not to love it anyway!",

            "review_text": "Wax on... Wax off... Kill d Ninjas!!  This is a fun arcade type game. It's a point and click shooter. Side scrolling with a bit of platforming. I believe it originally was meant for tablets and phones but it's just as good on PC.   Arcade style shooter. I would compare it a bit to duck hunter for the NES but of course duck hunter 30 years later with some pretty fun and addictive game play.  In the game you kill the ninjas. You start out with a pistol but as you rank up you can get get all sorts of armaments in the armorary. You can also customize your Mayhem's character -- I bought the pink camo helmet just because I'm cool like that.  The levels are fast which makes this game great if you just have a little bit of time and want to have some fun ... but be warned, it's one of those addictive, 'just one more...' games.  It's a simple enough concept executed amazingly. I have no problems recommending this game.",
