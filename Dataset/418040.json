It's a great puzzle game that can be frustrating when things don't go your way (Especially if you're like me and have to plan your route rather than following blind luck) but it's still pretty fun to play. It's simple design and music fit well and complement the games more complex shapes. It allows me to focus purely on the objective in front of me, which is what a good puzzle game should do. The level editor is just as simple, just click where you want lines and they appear. You can save your levels as a code or an image to send to your friends, who can then in turn load and play it. Overall I think this is a great game, especially considering the low price and amount of content and replayability.",

It evolves your brain, makeing you think in 3-D.I t s not an ordinary puzzle game. it starts with simple shapes -giving you the time needed to adjust and understand.Then it gets more and more difficult and that means it makes your brain work harder and harder.In just FOUR words IT MAKES YOU SMARTER!
