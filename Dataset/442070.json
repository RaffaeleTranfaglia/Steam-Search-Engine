Beyond that, not much has changed, though I think the audio for the narrator is better normalized.  Just remember, you cannot undo what you have done. There is no eraser.",

Draw too simple or too complex, and the drawing becomes a complete, useless mess. One of those party games where you laugh at your own and other's complete failures. Really nice accessibility, since everyone nowadays has a smartphone.",

New features are great, and in the latest games they've started catering for streamers. The Draw-skip feature is a God-send. It would be nice to be able to maybe kick people entire people from the game in all jackbox games, going forward?   In all, the new features are great, for 6/7 quid you can't complain as Drawful was by far one of the best games. If you play drawful, you need to pick up this.  Suggestions: Kick players, and a way to incorporate the latest games as DLC, instead of launching them all individually.  If you want to play it:  twitch.tv/LeftResponse   Why: #SellOut",

            "review_text": "I was super excited for Drawful 2, and it delievered on its promises! This is the sequel to the original Drawful which was part of the first Jackbox Games collection. This is a great standalone version that expands a bit on the original. They added some features that make it worth the price. For ten bucks, this is a pretty good deal. I would recomend it to anyone that enjoys game night with friends and/or family, or likes to twitch stream to a big audience.   The game is super simple and easy to pick up, and anyone can play since pretty much everyone has a device that can connect to the internet. I love the new option to create your own 'episodes'. It turns it into a more personalized experience with inside jokes and references maybe you and your friends would only understand. Makes for a really great time.  I love that you now have two colors to work with. You cant erase, which makes the game that much more rediculous. The music, sounds, and voice acting is great. Pretty much everything is spot on. Big fan of the Jackbox games and this is a good one to add to the collection.  TL;DR: It's drawful but better and more of it, it's worth the small price tag.",
