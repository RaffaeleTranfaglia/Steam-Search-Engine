            "review_text": "There's a really good story and some very nice ideas in here, unfortunately wrapped up in a game that trips itself with those same ideas. Definitely a case where less would have been more.  Starts off well enough, the introduction to the four central characters is well done with a couple of mini puzzles to work out and an introduction to the idea of timed segments. Unfortunately the game goes awry shortly after as we meet the most annoying janitor ever and he actively gets in your way with his incompetence.  This wouldn't be unusual for a game like this and would be forgivable were it not for the simultaneous introduction of 'short term memory', which basically means dragging environmental cues into your memory so you can talk to people about them. A nice idea, but it overcomplicates the game far more than it needs to as you work out that the item you need to talk about is 3 screens away for the fourth time. The game would be much improved by dropping the STM idea (it largely gets forgotten later in the game anyway so maybe the devs worked that out for themselves) and just including the relevant option in conversation. Other daft complications such as asking which way to turn a wrench when there is only one way it can turn at any time offer more pointless frustration for the player.  On the more positive side a few nice puzzles (if you like cryptography and maths) are very satisfying, unfortunately they lead in to one f the most frustrating parts of the game in Anna’s second timed scene. Not being happy to be a point and click game the devs saw fit to introduce the need for fast mouse wiggling, which wouldn’t be so bad if it were not for the fact that one slip sends you all the way bad to have to re-listen to Anna shrieking over and over again each time. This is an annoyance that reappears at various times as the rewind sends you back way too far.  Some more lovely little puzzles, including one that really makes the most of the teamwork between all four follows before the story really kicks into gear, I won’t spoil anything but suffice to say it is worth persevering this far for it. Unfortunately the final notes are a few more frustrations born form the need to pixel-hunt and trial-and-error conversations round out the game.  Overall the devs at XII would do well to look at the Blackwell series(from the same publishers) for cues on how to add a little innovation and variety into an adventure game without going overboard, more restraint next will definitely help to prevent the game from getting in the way of the story as it does here.  I'm recommending it because there are some nice ideas and there is a good story in there, just be aware before you play it that you will get frustrated and you will question why on earth some design decisions were made that way as you play.",

            "review_text": "This game is overlooked. It puts a new spin on the adventure game genre with a 4 character mechanic utilizing both long and short term memories. Basically you use the character's prior knowledge (memories( as tools in the environmental puzzles, as opposed to relying solely on contrived or forced inventory items that might be included in other games.   It is highly innovative which deserves praise in itself, but one of the most amazing feats of this game, is in spite of having 4 characters with various memories, I used a walkthrough maybe a single time on this game. To say a little about me, i'm a fan of adventure games, many classics (too many to list, but to give you an idea: Gabriel Knight, Sam and Max, Day of the Tentacle, Broken Sword, The Longest Journey, Monkey Island and many, many more. However, most of thet ime I resort to a walkthrough to varying degrees when I get stuck.   The story was compelling all the way through and art style really captured the mood. I wanted to leave this review for long time adventure game fans, to not overlook this game.",

            "review_text": "To be honest I was rather sceptical about this game at the beginning: I thought it would be another point-and-click quest with tons of pixel-hunting. Well... It is actually one. But it is not a disadvantage! Not here. The game has much more interesting benefits then the average quests. First of all, it has somewhat unique mechanic of long-time and short-time memories. Saw a homeless in a subway? Why not to remember and talk about him with a neighbor on the car? Was a witness of a blackout in a whole city? Well, that is worth remembering and discussing weeks after. And so on and so forth. Pretty much memory combinations you can make to proceed further. Secondly, you can operate four different characters at the same time. Not so surprising for a quest game of 2012? But how you unite the characters with their abilities - it affects the story. Much more impressive now, huh? And one last thing, the game has an amazing storyline and a wonderful voice acting that helps you to live a story of 'Resonance' like you are an important part of it too.  So, my opinion: 'Resonance' is one of 'must have' and 'must be played' games.",

Back when they were in vogue and Sierra was a household name, point and click adventure games were some of the most desireable games out there.  These days, only small indie developers bother to make point and click adventure games and with very few exceptions, the games are not that great. Usually the story is lackluster as the indie developer is usually one guy who is wearing too many hats and isn't really an expert with any of them.   This game is a bit of an exception. The story is pretty awesome. It's fresh and exciting and the ending is twisty. I have to admit, I really enjoyed this game. If you are a fan of point and click adventure games, or if you just want to try one out, this one is certainly worth it.   Well done!",

Puzzles which is normally not my cup of tea was rewarding to solve with a tiny drop of challenge in the mix.  The story immediately had me thinking of the upcoming 'Watchdog' game by ubi as a lot of the themes play into it. If your an old school adventure gamer get this, if your an avid gamer all about good games regardless of it's age..get this.",

But after all in a game like this, without graphics, without much innovation, it is a plot I am mostly interested in. And this plot is very weak.  Aside from one twist (that can be seen a mile in advance), it is as naive as a bad Hollywood movie. Characters are flat, setting is not really believable, and half of the problem they face felt like retelling of r/politics. I feel niche games need higher standards.",

At the end of the 2nd act, there's a huge plot twist that hit me like a ton of bricks.The voice acting is really good. It's a long game. I got stuck in one part where I had to cheat multiple times to get through it. Except for that part in the middle of the game, it was a solid challenge, but not overwhelming. There's multiple endings and optional, hidden things to do. I really liked how any object in the evironment and even memories along with inventory items can be used as a topic of conversation with npc's. Also, there's some more hands on stuff besides all the point and clicky stuff. There's a part where some goon is climbing a rope to get to the chick and the mouse needs to be rapidly pushed up and down to simulate the cutting of the rope. Also, there're a couple of 'hacking' parts where a reporter needs to get information from computer systems that were really well done. Adventure fans should play this game immediately. I highly recommend. Resonance is awesome!",

So you wont constantly face the standard 'here's a list of dialog options, hammer at em till you pick the right one' situations. You're actually required to do some logical thinking. Also you're not forced to be completely linear. In the 'act 2' of the game you get the freedom of choosing in which order and (to some extent) how you complete your tasks. And hey, 2 different endings. You'll come across with some optional puzzles too, that'll flesh out the game world and explains the stories of the characters better for you, which I found awesome.  Great adventure game about science and conspiracy with heaps of good plot twists.",

The music and voice acting were good. There were some new and interesting game mechanics. The first is the short-term and long-term memory system. Second is switching between the four main characters in order to solve puzzles. The character animations are good, each character has their own set of expressions. Some animations like walking around are jumpy like old 16 bit games. The biggest negative to this game is the graphics resolution, about the same as an old fashioned Sierra title from the early 90's. Since some of the puzzles and game mechanics rely on visual cues, this detracts from the overall playing experience. What is most impressive about this game is that it provides a good experience in spite of this primitive graphics resolution.",
