            "review_text": "To sum it up, open world Isaac. You will like this if you also liked Isaac. But you may like this even if you did not, since it has some unique properties as well. But, it does not feel that complete yet, although it surely is fun.   (the game is not an openworld game though, but comparing this to Isaac the feel is there)  Features: - The world is less randomized than it is required to be a roguelike. Actually, only order of the subquests and enemy types changes each time. While the map is also randomly generated, it does not do anything to the gameplay. - Mojo Mixer is a well thought mechanism, really adds to strategic depth. And feel of shrines whether it is a risky choice or a gift is well done. - It has a story, and a mild sense of humor. - Gameplay-wise actually this is better than its counterparts. - Just tried two of the gods, felt really unique. This is how it should be. - There should be more achievements and rewards for completing each quest for different gods etc. - Daily quests is useful to continue to play. So is endless mode. - Even though the gametime is short, it is a hard game even at normal difficulty. And there is 4 more level. So it would have long gameplay. - Use of wands is too shallow, since there is not any seperate wands inventory. Found a good wand but killed the boss already? This is sad, since it wont be with you for long. - Persistence between lives is not overdone, so it does not feel like grinding. - Item designs are good. But there are a few to be considered a roguelike. In my current playtime (6 hours) I saw more than half of them.  -i forgot one thing. optimization with this game just sucks. I am playing at 1280x720 resolution and medium level of graphics, and it barely is okay with my newly bought laptop. (I played better games with better settings) Since this is a roguelike, and roguelike players are not into graphics that much, this is not a big problem.  -UPDATE(03.02.15): This game's last content update was in May 2014. If this attitude of developers continue, I may change my review into a negative one, since being a roguelike requires randomness, and randomness requires lots of content.",

The setting is nifty, but nothing else really stands out.  It's a roguelite that doesn't pick up after a few hours, and the actual gameplay is more like a twin-stick shooter with upgrades. Some people might compare it to Binding of Isaac, but I've put dozens of hours into Isaac and still enjoy it—I was bored of this one in less than five hours.",

            "review_text": "If you didn't think there was enough 'Gauntlet' in 'Gauntlet', you should probably invest in this. I will mention Gauntlet rather a lot in this 'review', btw.  The first point, and it's a reasonably large one, that this game scores over Gauntlet is that it has genuinely random (thus replayable ad inifinitum*) levels and a fairly expansive character customization section make this a far more worthwhile purchase. Gauntlet promised randomised, limitless levels and failed to deliver, preferring instead to rotate a level through 180degrees or make you do them 'the opposite way round' (from start to finish in a 'death' level, for example). It's obvious, woeful and does nothing to hide the fact that you're always playing from a small group of levels that can easily be remembered, no matter what way round they are.  There are also more 'world types' than in Gauntlet.   The player upgrade system is somewhat similar but, again, full mojo rampage has a better one. There's more to spend your ingame currency on and the prices of everything gets quite high so you need to take time to find cash. This isn't annoying, however. Also, found items can be sold in the shops ingame, which produces a lot of extra cash. Item drops are random and there are a LOT of different items that you can find. You can also mix together 2 items to get a single item with all the effects of the 2 individual ones. This is a fun way to make interesting 'charms' to equip and also an interesting way to cause a sort of 'inventory game' to arise, wherein the player must decide what stuff to keep/dump in favour of potentially more useful items. You can also expand your inventory, too, so it's possible to carry more. I liked this aspect of the game as, again, it adds another random dimension to things that makes each playthrough different.   I've put a fair amount of time into the game and I still find it fun to go back and play more. Also, I have yet to complete all of the levels on 'hardcore' difficulty, which requires a more levelled up character. I think, beyond that, there's 'nightmare' or 'insane', something like that, so there's plenty of reason to return and play more*. I will be trying to finish all the levels at all skills and will probably wind up doing so at some point. I see this definitely as a game I can return to in future as I've enjoyed it and it does a lot of things that I, personally, like in games.  Some people have said this is tough but I think it's reasonably easy, it's far easier to solo than Gauntlet, for example, which is easy enough but you have to adhere to a plan/play style to get through. You have much more option to just 'muck around' in full mojo rampage, as a result of the levels being more open and monsters spawning/wandering randomly instead of coming from 'summoning stones' in closed rooms (another bad point about the new version of gauntlet).  Finally, it's not really a roguelike, tbh. There's a lot of games called Roguelikes these days but I would say this has much more in common with something like Gauntlet or Alien Syndrome. Neither of which are roguelikes. Unless you count Gauntlet 4. People seldom do, despite it being by far the best version (genesis cart, have a look if you like Gauntlet). HOWEVER, I did play one game where I was transported to a random dungeon that was made of ascii and I had to fight various 'G' and 'M' symbols. This was excellent and I would probably play the whole game in this manner if the option existed. There are some nice little diversions like this in the game. As I've mentioned, you're never quite sure what's going to pop up and, for this reason and the others above, I rate this as a really good and fun game.  The online works well, too.  *If you enjoy the premise and play style of the game, of course.",

            "review_text": "8.5/10.  My reasons are:   I have never enjoyed a game of this genre very much. Until this day. It is quite addictive, every death and failure you experience makes you want to beat the string of dungeons more. It has a great mini-shop theme to it, in most dungeons there are two shops. #1 is just a general store type thing, allowing you to buy a randomized four items. #2 is a place that allows you to merge two items together. That is a really nice touch and I love the idea! The stat system I found quite good. It included all of the basic information I believe a game in similar style needs, although I do wish the stat system would be more consistent and/or more dependent on stats. Sometimes you get low level to medium level items and other you get high level to godlike level items. It doesn't happen often, but when it does I would consider calling your character overpowered. But, it isn't that much of an issue. Onto the music, graphics and storyline; The music is spot-on. I have no criticisms there! The graphics were also well done, style and otherwise! Things like rain were a nice tough indeed. Now, storyline... It has a small part in the game, and is mostly apparent at the starting cinematic. Bits and pieces are glimpsed rarely in-game. There is a lot of un-used potential there. Possibly another game mode? From what the cinematic and in-game things you do see, I can see no flaws.   Tallying up the scores!  - Basic stat system (+1 | Could have gotten a +2.5) - Music (+2.5) - Graphics (+3) - Storyline (+2 | Could have gotten a +3.5)  A grand total of 8.5 out of 10!  (Did I miss anything? Leave a comment! I recommend this game, grab a copy definitely! Thanks for reading. Steam is only saying I have spent 5 hours in the last two weeks. Keep in mind I played this for 5 hours today.)  ~ Galen.",

You can only take 1-3 hits (depends on the enemy and difficulty)  Overall it's really good and I suggest you to buy it if you enjoy Rogue-Like games like Risk of Rain, The Binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy. I might edit this review, since the game was only released a week or so ago.",

This may sound like a minor thing, but I am most appreciative of the devs choice to make this WASD. I don't know what has been up lately with the trend of point and click games. But this game is a breath of fresh air. Super fun and challenging. Woot!",

It is fun, relaxing, nice graphic, fun 'story'-more or less- and easy to learn. It is typical dungeon game and would be so much funnier with more people, since it does have multiplayer, the problem is, there never is anyone. Im giving this game a thumb up and I hope they will work on it a little more and make it more popular, because this game earns it. If you fancy magic and smooth, colorful graphic while you shoot green balls on chickens and ghosts, you will like this!",

I definitely think some enemies seemed to hit for a lot of damage, but it never seemed unfair, I just felt really bad at the game, which is probably true. I have only tried it briefly, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing and after my campaign to at least try every steam game in my library I will come back and try to experience everything this game has to offer. Easily one of the best games I picked up this steam sale.",
