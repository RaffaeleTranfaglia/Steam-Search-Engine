            "review_text": "Meltdown is a fun, pick up and play, isometric shooter that lets you level up, buy new equipment, play with other people and upgrade. It has a lot of things going for it, great look, easy controls, great enemy diversity, randomly generated maps for each mission, drop in cooperative play and accessories that affect your stats. If you want to play alone, there is a quick setting for that, but I think it adds a lot of fun having some random stranger drop into my game. It breaks up me vs everyone. Enemies get increased stats when people enter your game, otherwise it would just be easy and robbing you of fun and challenge. There is an easy list of games to see, so you can drop in on someone else.  The controls are easy and combat is fun. A roll to dodge or move quick. A melee button that will get you more experience for close kills. Change between two different equipped guns and of course a trigger to shoot. Your character automatically aims at the nearest target, which for the most part is exactly how it should be. You can't miss.  You have a shield and health. Your shield regenerates, but your health doesn't. When you're dying, you feel it the screen gets more difficult to see as you go all woozy. There are also random objects to use for cover. If you walk up to cover and just rest without shooting, you're hidden as long as nothing flanks you. When you shoot or melee, then you're standing so enemies can shoot you. Its an easy to use mechanic that has a lot of use further in the game where the sheer amount of damage. Some cover objects can get destroyed, but they are pretty rare. There are even walls that move up and down to take away your cover. Humanoid enemies will also use cover to hide behind. To get over cover, just get up next to it and hit the roll button to vault over. Jumping over cover into an enemy can hurt them, just as they can hurt you. Its such a nice system.  As you kill enemies, you're rewarded with coins, upgrade parts, the occasional mystery box and power ups like double damage or nuke'em that hurts all active enemies. After every completed mission, you'll open all the collected mystery boxes which can contain coins, extra experience, nothing, upgrade parts or even the rare extra life. These extra lives are hard to come by. When you die on a mission, you can use an extra life, but once you're dead, you either restart the mission or quit. One and done with this game, so you need to pick where you use your extra lives to get thrown back into the action where you died.  There are 30 missions, but there is plenty to do even if you don't take on an official mission. There is a death match where you compete against other players. A quick play that generates a map just for you based on your current level and because you're special! A wave battle, where you just keep fighting wave after wave until you die. I usually get bored playing other horde modes, but this is one of the rare times where I kept having fun time and time again. What makes Meltdown interesting is that everything is randomly generated. Even if its your tenth time playing the same mission, it will always be different.  When you're not playing the game, you're upgrading. You have items and the abilities. Items unlock as you level up, but you still need to buy them. There is a selection of five guns (shotgun, flame thrower, SMG, pistol and grenade launcher) that can get upgraded with 9 improvements out of 6 slots in 3 different tiers. Once you get to the 9th or 10th upgrade it unlocks better version of the gun. So you can equip both the shotgun and its better counterpart the spread gun. There are different melee weapons to buy, but it only amounts to more damage. Then equip your four different accessories from armors, headgear, shoulder gear and face wear. Its not just cosmetic differences, but things that change combat stats. Such as a cowboy hat that improve shotgun damage. Armor that regenerates ammunition or a ninja mask that improves move speed and dodge speed. Its all up to you. All the wearable items can get upgraded too!  Every time you level up, you get an ability to use. Each of the several tiers has three different abilities to unlock. Health, melee and guns. Each slot can get upgraded 3 times before it lets you go up a tier. The abilities are subtle, but do a lot, especially the health. They make enemies have a chance to drop shield charges or health. You can get an ability that lets you regenerate health if your shields are full. I would say stick to the health, but you'll have everything maxed out by the end of 30 missions. When you do have everything maxed out, you can chose to rank up your prestige which gives you more health.... but resets your character and missions. A game this good, I enjoy that extra replay value. It also unlocks new items.  With the need to upgrade, level up and buy things, this might sound like a grind of a game. You can grind, but I never did except for the rare times that I wanted lives from mystery boxes. I didn't have to make this a job to level up.  The game feels like it has limited map assets and rarely changes its blue metallic look. As the missions progress, blue and green are thrown into the mix, but its all the same. Since everything is randomly generated, the areas get remixed and while everything all looks the same, it doesn't feel familiar outside of the boss battles. A few times there are cars here and there, parked on platforms that seem crazy to have cars, but whatever. The sad part is that you can't make the vehicles explode. The music is techno or dub step and it seems to fit the game, even if I'm not a fan of the music, its still great game music in this case.  Since the levels rarely change the look, its the enemies that stand. There is a wide array of enemies, tactics and weapons they use. It starts with simple bomb spiders that come to you and explode. Then goes up to small cannon tanks. Stationary sentries that come in a wide variety: fire, machine guns, cannons and even walking electricity sentries that can zap you through cover. Red light hover pods will shoot at you, blue ones will electrocute you exposing you up from cover.  Then come the androids. Easy wrench melee droids that run at you, machine gunners that find cover and shoot, shot gunners that won't just kill you close range, but dash to stab you, grenaders that hide and extra deadly snipers. As the missions progress, some of the robots like the machine gunners and snipers will roll to find cover. If you jump over anyone's cover they'll find cover elsewhere. The enemy intelligence is really nice and every weapon from every enemy seems effective to kill you. Grenades knock you down, electricity stuns you, melee enemies break through your cover so the others can advance closer. They all have their limitations though. Snipers fire one at a time and after a few shots need to reload. Machine gunners are slow to follow your movements, but the number of bullets will melt your health. Cannons do bigger damage, but fire much slower.  Most missions offer some unique gimmick where at some point of the map, the game locks you in an area and forces you to defeat either a giant pink boss version of a normal enemy, a unique boss, a wall or a simple wave battle. The wave battles are the easiest. The unique bosses are pretty difficult and you can tell, because they're the levels that everyone joins you to play. The walls are far more difficult. There are 3 plungers that regenerate their health, 1 wall and 3 sections of force field. Damage the plunger will remove a section of wall for you to take out the sentries behind the section. Why is it difficult? Because you're always aimed at the nearest target. So even if you want to shoot the two machine gun sentries about to annihilate you, your character turns to take out a different plunger.  With all this said, I highly recommend this cheap game. Even if the scenery doesn't change much, the combat is excellent.ThanksRybcka!",

            "review_text": "Since I'm one (broken) achievement shy of completing this game, I figured that I might as well review it.  This is an isometric shooter. It is composed of thirty stages along with wave-attack, level-attack, and deathmatch modes. You blast robots with a variety of unlockable and upgradeable weapons, and level up to acquire numerous abilities. This game supports up to four players locally or online.  Well..that was an exciting +1 to my review count wasn't it?  What? Not good enough? Sheesh. Alright then.  Meltdown is the kinda game you play, when you want to free your mind of pesky questions such as: 'What should I wear to work tomorrow?' and 'Should I go to work tomorrow?' and even 'Will I get fired because I didn't show up for work today?' It's addictive, and there are enough hooks in place to keep you on the hamster wheel for quite awhile.   The enemy robots are decently varied, and it's important to adopt a play-style that suits your loadout. Sure you could commando your way through everything with rockets and grenades, but extended fire-fights will require that you take cover. Expect to do a lot of rolling as well. Equipment introduces other variables such as bonuses to specific weapons, better shields/HP, or speedier movement. It's not totally in-depth, but that's probably why I appreciate it. You get an idea of what works and what doesn't immediately.  The stages are standard fare, with a few boss-fights, arenas, and shielded walls to mix things up. It's a bit on the padded side, but they go by pretty quickly. It can get frustrating sometimes with cheap enemy spawns. There have been more than a couple occasions, where two shotgun-bots spawned next to me and immediately fired. Also the last couple stages are a slog, because of all the freakin' snipers. That could be on me though for using underpowered weapons.   Everything is better with a partner and this game is no different. It's rare to see online co-op so well-implemented. It's almost as good as if you were playing an arcade machine and somebody walked up next to you to join in. Joining an online game is very fast and smooth, and connection drops are fairly rare (even with my overpriced crapfest Roadrunner internet). Admittedly, most of my co-op time was spent in wave-attack (easiest to grind for exp/money/upgrade-chips). Running the regular stages with partners tends to make them a bit too easy. There is damage-scaling depending on how many people are playing, but it's not nearly enough due to the overwhelming weapons, knockdown effects that keep robots inactive, and so on. Plus, even if you die you can just use a 1up to get right back in the fight(unlike arcade games, these aren't rare at all).  So there it is, a more fleshed-out review of the perfectly serviceable Meltdown. Play it until you unlock everything, play it until you get bored, but give it a shot. I think it's decent enough, even if it's a bit too safe.  For a potential sequel I'd suggest:  -Higher enemy counts (especially in co-op) -More varied builds (Classes? Maybe hand out some unique abilities) -Limit the number of available lives -Better stage variety (Plenty of classic arcade shooters to pull ideas from)",

            "review_text": "I had never heard of this game before getting it, so it came as some surprise to find just how fun a shooter it is. The game is fairly straightforward in an arcade fashion, and as such is pretty repetitive. However, I've found the best part of the game is the 'wave mission' where you get enemies in waves and see how long you can last (though 1ups feel a bit like cheating in that spirit). I feel this probably works best in a quick pick-up game fashion. So far the two biggest gripes I have are on standard missions you can get unfair mechanics such as a sniper spawning in front of you and a rocket launcher behind you so you're pretty much dead, and that the game seems to freeze and stop responding when I try to quit to desktop.  So, if you're looking for a simple, fun shooter I would recommend the game. Depth and story are not present, so if you need those this isn't your game.",

More of an arena shoot 'em up type of game than plot driven shooter. I won't be talking about variety of enemies and gear - you REALLY should check them yourself. All items in game give some bonuses. No cosmetics. The most fun thing in game is the upgrade section. You got limited upgrade slots for each weapon. And this means... You can customize each gun just the way YOU want to use it. Want a short ranged heavy machine gun that pierces enemies? Sure, why not? Want a ranged flamethrower that ignites bots from afar rather than a classic variant? Take one, please. The char skill system is neat too. You will spend hours of shooting things with joy and anger to collect everything. Also, the music. Cheers!",

Once you get to max level 55 you can enter the newgame+ish Prestiege mode - you lose all your equipment, levels and map progression in exchange for some minor health and shield boost, access to restricted equipment (which you still need to meet level requirements for buying), and 'leveled up' enemies. You keep your current money &amp; chips though, so it might make sense to grind a bit to give your level 1 Prestiege character a head start :)  Because there's never enough money to buy what you want....

Where it wins: The short missions make it perfect when I'm just killing some time. I can pick a mission based on anticipated time to complete if I have something I need to do soon. It's also nice to see that the Steam version is a complete game, unlike the mobile version. The gamepad setup is nice, and the aim assist makes it easy to work with. Multiplayer is fun to play as well. Well worth the $1.74 I paid when it was on sale.  Where it fails: It is made for mobile and there are some nonfunctional remnants left over from that, namely the leaderboard buttons. The multiplayer doesn't let a set or group of players to follow eachother through missions. It also said that if you are having trouble on a level, play multiplayer to make it easier, but when additional players are in a mission, there are more bots that can take much more damage, making it more than twice as difficult, so it more than negates the concept of getting help. The aim assist, while being handy, can also hinder your play. It automatically targets things for you. When there are power nodes, it's difficult to get back on target with bots, or the bots you actually want to target.  Overall, it's worth playing, if you catch it while it's on sale, but I sure hope the devs are planning on making some improvements, especially with the aim assist, multiplayer, and benifits of being Prestige 3 Level 55.

And I have to say, I've had way more fun than I was expecting.  The progression kinda feels like the free Flash games I played several years ago. There's a sense of grinding for the necessary coins or chips to purchase or upgrade the things you want. But- unlike those old Flash games- the music and general sense of fun keep the grind from feeling too much like a chore.  I've yet to try the multiplayer, so I cannot attest to connectivity or lag issues. But I still give Meltdown a solid recommendation even as a casual single-player game. :3  Pros: - Music is wubby (a con, if that's not to your taste) - Cover mechanic adds a bit of strategy - Weapons feel nice (I've only unlocked a few... more on that in cons)  Cons: - Music may not be everyone's cuppa tea - Gear Progression can sometimes feel a bit grindy... - Especially when it comes to initially unlocking weapons/accessories, as they require increasingly larger amounts of coin (Multiplayer would likely help in this case, but as stated previously, I've only played solo thus far.)",

Upgrades feel a bit grindy at times since you unlock items faster than you get money to actually buy them but since you can replay previous levels again to get some cash that's fine.  The tactical part really isn't as big as claimed, however for some enemy types it's indeed helpful to cover and get the timing right (Sniper Bot!). For most other moving enemies a combo of circling and retreat seems to be just enough.  The multiplayer system is quite nice and even enabled by default so any singleplayer mission may become a multiplayer mission at any time.",

All the weapons and armor are upgradeable, and there is a limited prestige system to increase your character slightly if you reset a couple of times at max level.  There are 3 main boss levels that are different, and a few miniboss levels in small arenas. The music is great, but the levels look almost all the same.  You get to play a rambo-like character in an arcade game setting. On each mission, your weapons and armor can be customized to your playstyle (SMG, Shotgun, Rocket, Melee, Xbow). All the ranged weapons and armors are upgradeable 3 times , and have distinct graphic appearance.  Reccomend getting the 4-pack and playing with friends for a cheap fun time.  The developer is active, and adds new features and fixes bugs.",

Cons:   Upgrade and level system in general. I mean, what is the point of upgrading your weapons and completing missions just to have it all reset when you prestige? I can understand resetting the skill tree (that's the point of prestige), but this is just blatant padding. Besides, what do you get from prestige? A whopping +5 health and +5 shield and the ability to upgrade your weapons one level higher! Oh, and a golden nickname of course, because everybody wants to be special! And you have to do it three effing times, btw.  Enemies. They lack in variety and some of them are just a pain in the Ð°ss, like the bot that will chase you down and if you ever stop mashing the spacebar or run into something, you get immobilized, and then the other bots come and rip you into shreds.  Game mechanics. I get that only humans can trigger the mines, but why explosions don't affect the bots? Your grenade launcher damages them and the mines don't. Also the bot that throws literally the same grenades at you and nobody takes damage (except you, that is).  Oh, and about mashing the spacebar. If you don't care about drops, you can complete some of the levels just by infinitely dodging the enemies straight to the end.  Overall, don't bother buying it if you don't have a group of friends that can play with you and contain your frustration.",
