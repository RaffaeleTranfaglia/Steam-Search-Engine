The fact that its linux compatible and full controller support is great. Runs very well on ubuntu with a wired usb 360 controller. It isnt super short either. So you do get plently of game play hours out of it. Overall the game storyboard is well thought out and put together. It is a bit violent but kids over 8-10 should be fine playing. But use your own judgement. Every child is different. This game has not disappointed. I would recommend it at 9.99 but when on sale its a steal of a deal. I hope this helps anyone on the fence about getting it.",

            "review_text": "I'm really not the one to write negative reviews about anything, but this game sure deservers a hell of a warning. Since I know that many of you have this game (bundles/sales/free giveaways) I just want to spare you the trouble of ever starting this below-par platformer.  First I would like to start with the good things, because it's not all that bad. Shooting is fun. Humour is OK. Political conotations are appreciated. 'Brain bugs' are a decent mechanic all around.  Now with the bad. Level design which is so tightly crammed leaving you no room for outmaneuvering your enemies - meaning the games is linear as linear gets. Really, no paths to chose whatsoever. Puzzle sequences, which are actually not puzzle sequences at al as all you need to do is move some boxes around - going from A to B, then from B to A, then from A to B again, try to jump up a few times and flick the switch that leads to C... Checkpoints, which will often leave you between a rock and a hard place. Lagg in online co-op. Sometimes gamebreaking (probaly not everyone has experienced this, but we did).  Co-op was the thing I really hoped will save this game from it's mediocrity. But it didn't. Infact, co-op is probably the worse segment of Rocketbirds. Why? You see, there is a unique mechanic that is essential in co-op mode, the one featuring one player jumping on-top another mostly used for reaching high ledges.   There are two major issues with this. The first one is that it is not optinal - you just jump next to your partner and you are automatically on-top of him, which leads to HUNDREDS of falls, fails, repeats, backtraking instances. Second one is that there is virtually no room in those tightly squeezes corridors for this mechanic to actually work properly, leaving you with a sorrow grim on your face time and time again. You know the game is bad when you and your partner laugh about how bad this really is.  If you allready own this game, sure, give it a try, why not. You might like it, you might actually love it for some strange reason. If you do not own this game, you are not missing out on anything. Even for 7,99€ (in the time of writing) you can find dozens of better and more polished platformers in steam store.",

This game has so much going for it and yet somehow it just falls short of its own vision. The graphics are great (saturday morning cartoon anyone) and the voice overs and music (especially the soundtrack-its amazing) are great and the gameplay is fun and entertaining,but its just to short.On the multiplayer side of things i never seem to find someone to co op with (anybody want to let me know). I really do like the gunplay and moments when you fly a jetpack but its all over far to soon and your like 'COME ON I WANT MORE' So i do reccomend this game but i am close to the border line on this one as like i have said whats there is amazing but there is just not either A-enough of it or B-no one online to co op with. So enjoy but play in small bursts as its all over just as you want it to continue. (can you get the soundtrack as i would love it,as its one of the best i have heard)",

I tap right and suddenly I have moved a quarter of the screen length. - Puzzles are pretty poor and enemies do not provide any form of a challenge. The game uses the classic 'collect cards to unlock X part of level' routine.  - I know it is the style of the game, but the snapping between different scenes to represent a different sector of the level is done WAY too often for my liking.",

            "review_text": "I really wasn't sold on Rocketbirds when I started playing. It was a lot of style and not a lot of substance, and I was worried the whole game was going to carry on in that vein. But as I got further in and the gameplay started deepening, I found myself more and more interested in seeing it through. It might not be a perfect platformer, but it paves over a lot of the rough spots with some unique flair.  Rocketbirds puts you in the role of the titular Hardboiled Chicken, a Stallone-esque supermerc on a mission to assassinate a sniveling, dictatorial penguin. The journey takes a number of twists and turns, through military prisons, museums, and jetpack jaunts through the clouds, all while dispensing bits of backstory in rock opera cutscenes. I'm not kidding in the least, here... the developers enlisted the musical talents of New World Revolution to provide the soundtrack, and they're used to the most at every turn. Everything in the game is set to vocalized tracks, with the cutscenes completely choreographed to the music. It gives the game a strange feel, like someone set out to make a music video and ended up with a video game instead.  Part of this feel stems from the simplistic gameplay. Rocketbirds plays like a more fluid Prince of Persia, with jumps carefully measured and having to keep your character facing the right direction. Adding guns to this formula is historically not the best idea, and indeed the gunplay in Rocketbirds is basically a race to pull the trigger first. Your shots juggle enemies and they take loads of bullets to kill for real, so each foe requires several seconds of constant attention. When enemies approach from both sides, this is a problem that requires a careful balance of shots. Enemies can also bullet-juggle you, so by the end of the game failing to service an enemy can make you dead very, very fast.  Luckily, Rocketbirds doesn't hinge its appeal on the gunplay. Combat is less a feature of each level than platforming, keycard hunting, and gimmicks. New systems get introduced almost every other level, ranging from jetpack fights to mind control. There's enough to look forward to to keep you trundling through levels, even if the core gameplay is simple and frustrating at times. There's even a pretty entertaining co-op mode and I'm not usually a big co-op guy. I won't say Rocketbirds is for everyone, but if you ever wanted to play through a 90s animated metal music video, it'll hit the right notes.",

The elements of this game are similar to Abe's; it is a 2d platformer where you solve puzzles and quite often control the minds of your victims. The shooting feels powerful, the flying levels are incredibly fun and the soundtrack is amazing.  Some of the puzzles are quite difficult, but not excessively so. Most of the time you can figure out the puzzles almost immediately.  The only issue I had with this game was the movement. You have to wait for the movement animation to finish playing every time you move, so sometimes you overshoot the spot that you intended to move to. I sometimes would have trouble getting to where I wanted to go.  Overall, this game is a good game worth the low price point. ",

            "review_text": "  -Quick Review-   Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is an “arcade-indie shooter” you could say it’s an “arcade shooter-indie”, or even an “independent shooter arcade”. Regardless of what you call it, this was the first game I’ve ever played on steam in this genre. I enjoyed the unique game play, the game did force me to play through the story three times, but it’s a pretty short story so I can forgive it. (Thank you for letting me select specific levels, that made my achievement hunting much easier.)   -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  The story of Hardboiled Chick is revealed through the gameplay, I don’t want to spoil the story, you play as “Hardboiled” a Rooster who sometimes has a rocket strapped to his back. The game makes many cliché references to “macho first person shooter games”, or movies in general, however it’s all in good humor. (I don’t think it took itself too seriously, thankfully)   Game Play:  The controls on the game took a bit of getting used to, you shoot the direction you face. There are some controls that overlap, like trying to get up from a crouch and getting on top of a box. I learned how to work my way around that type of cumbersome mechanic, as a whole though, the game played very well.  (note: I play all my games with a keyboard and mouse, however this is one of those games that would play much better with a gamepad, I’m sure of it)  The place the game shines is when you’re in jetpack-mode thus the name “Rocketbirds”. Then the game plays like an arcade shooter, but that requires the use of your mouse to control the direction you fly. I found myself enjoying the flying more than the rest of the game.   Achievements:  As with any general game, there are the achievements you get for playing the game, in addition there are many achievements you will miss on your first play through, which may require a second or third play through. As I indicated in my quick review, “selecting specific levels, made my achievement hunting much easier”.   Price:  Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken’s standard price is $9.99 I could almost purchase Starbound with that money (inside joke directed at Vinehugger &amp; Zauss – whom never read my reviews) as I keep saying, my value system is (Cost / Time = Value), I played this game for 8 hours, I’ll probably put in another hour or two playing multi-player with my brother Jett50Two, (thank you in advance, my poor achievement tagalong) I think that a dollar an hour is a very good quality. As usual insert comment about games are better on sale, blah blah blah, humblebundle, blah blah blah.    Conclusion:  I think this game did a very good job telling Hardboiled chicken’s story, I LOVED the music (it was rock, how could I not love it?) the game play was par for the course. At a dollar an hour, I think that’s a reasonable price as well.",

I thought the visuals and mood were a lot of fun, and there were some surprisingly solid tunes on the soundtrack. However, the controls were imprecise, and the online mode seemed a bit unoptimized and laggy. In some of the later levels, precision was often needed (having to run past an enemy and turn on a dime to shoot him in the back, negotiating turrets which often killed your character outright if you were caught in the line of fire, etc), which compounded these issues. The checkpoints were not overly punishing, but being felled by clunky controls never feels good.",

            "review_text": "You know what the best thing about this mess of a 'game' is? The soundtrack...it's awesome. The aesthetics are also pretty nice...a bit different from the usual, so kudoz on that. Let me think...nope, can't think of anything more. What I really don't get is how this game can get reviews like 5/5 or 9/10...on the store page...this is ridiculous. Even if it wasn't so bad, it would never be THAT good. I read ♥♥♥♥ like 'plenty of content'...I beat this in 2.8 hours!!!!!!! And most of it was being stuck...lol. A pro can beat this ♥♥♥♥ in under an hour...this is NOT plenty of content...jesus christ.  Why you should NOT buy this game, not even during a sale, as I did:  You are a chicken...this is cool. You have guns...also cool. This is where cool ends. You can either run or 'roll'...funnily enough the roll move is also the best way of locomotion for 95% of the game. Running was only useful for 1 or 2 precision actions. Rolling can be chained together, it is faster, more responsive, you need it to bypass enemies with shields and 95% of the time whenever you encounter an enemy they will immediately drop down and shoot at you. If you are in 'run' mode this means you will simply shoot over their heads, miss and die a gruesome and quick death.  By the way...enemies. There are a few generic enemy types. Enemies with guns, with bigger guns, with shields and melee weapons and those with rockets. None of those is even remotely challenging on its own, however they have the annoying habit of appearing suddenly BEHIND you, which wouldn't be that bad, but for the following:  The game has no continous scrolling background...you move through fixed backgrounds, after about 2-3 seconds you reach the end of a screen and a new screen is instantly loaded. On this screen there can be a number of enemies...you can't know, so I found it best to just be rolling around all the time and instantly shooting as soon as I entered a new screen. Often enough enemies will then enter the screen behind you, while you are already fighting an enemy before you, meaning they will shoot you in the back, which more often than not results in your death or severe health loss and subsequent death on the next screen. The only way to prevent this is to either stick to the very end of a screen, because enemies will not shoot you outside of the current screen or roll behind an enemy and make sure to not have enemies in both directions. They will not shoot one another (the shield guys are an exception, somehow they can be bypassed by enemy bullets).  Enemies are also bullet sponges. No matter the weapon, pistol or assault rifle, they will take a whole lot of punishment. This only changes with the final weapon, which does not have a continuous firing mode, but a burst mode...you get that weapon after you have completed 90% of the game...or even more...have I mentioned that you can only shoot left or right? no up/down...nope.  Puzzles...this game has 'puzzles'. These puzzles look something like this: There is a Tower with 4 sections and 4 levels or so...the puzzle involves you going from Section A, level 2, to Section B, level 3, collect a card, go to Section C, level 1, collect another card, go to Section D, level 3, mind control a minion, activate some elevator, go to Section C, level 4, ride the elevator down to Section A, level 1, collect another card, lalalalsakgnjfdajkgndfjksgndsjknagjksdnjkganfdgk   I can't even! I understand backtracking...what I don't understand is senseless prolonging of levels. I completed this game in about 2-3 hours on normal...most of that time was spent dying randomly or trying to figure some stupid puzzle out that has you going around the whole level multiple times...I especially loved the crates in level 11...♥♥♥♥ you. All the levels are built like this famous ziggurat puzzle or whatever it's called: move the top layer to an empty space, move the next layer to the next empty space, move the first layer back and forth and so on, until you have moved thy ziggurat/Pyramid whatever from 1 place to another...it's horrible design. The final level has you ride different elevators up and DOWN a rocket again, as the villain tries to flee from you!!!!!! WTF? And that after the most boring boss fight in history that lasted ages anyway and didn't even have music...you have to experience this ♥♥♥♥ to believe it.  Between those levels you can use a jetpack...you might think this would be fun...it's not. The level are literally always the same. There are 2 enemy types, each wave spawning more of each. That's it...survive a few waves then blow up the airships with the same procedure as explained above.  You also have grenades, which are pretty useless, because to throw them far you have to stand up. Standing up in a fight usually means you die before you even threw the damn thing. Even behind 'cover'...You also have a sort of brain control thing...this isn't a tottaly useless feature but most of the times you can only use it at fixed points in the game to control an enemy and open a door or move a box or activate an elevator...lame, boring...also sometimes it takes 1 hit, sometimes 3...lol weird.  The check points are also a joke. Sometimes you start right after you died, sometimes you have to navigate half of the level again. They are just really awkwardly placed at times. Especially before the final 'wave' fight...man those are stupid...if you die at the first wave, you have to ride the elevator upwards again...this takes about 10 seconds or so...it's unnecessary. After the first wave though the game saves after every wave and even respawns you with additional health and ammo...lol.  The voice acting and writing is so bad, that I almost had to switch the sound off. Luckily they did not use a lot of voice acting. They even have some kind of wannabe Schwarzenegger accent in there...wtf. It's so bad. The writing itself is extremely boring. You do not care about most of the stuff. The best you get out of the story are the cutscenes, which evoke at least some kind of emotion. The soundtrack also helps...  You're also being objected to several superfluous text bubbles that you have to endure...nothing really matters but you also can't skip it.  The sad part is that I wanted to like this game...but the more I played the more I hated it, so my final voting if I had to would be 5/10, because the soundtrack and the art and the general aesthetic is pretty nice. Gameplay wise this game is junk...sorry.  Summary:  + Awesome soundtrack IF you like Alt rock + Nice setting, different types of birds acting as 'races' + Nice graphics style in general  - bad gunplay - bad movement controls - horrible level design - boring enemy design - at times unfair save points and general situations - no continuous game screen, instead multiple screens per level - boring game mechanics - shallow game play - cringeworthy voice acting - extremely boring story - annoying writing and waiting and elevator rides...so many elevator rides  Do yourself a favour and do not buy this game. Instead by 'Mark of the Ninja' or 'Shank 1/2'. Those are games that do everything a lot better, have great gameplay and a cool story, while being similar enough to a 2D killing simulator...

That being said, I would agree with the other negative reviews in saying it's not quiiiite worth a full $10. That feels really cheap of me to say, with indie games already being so low cost in most cases compared to AAA titles, but as other reviews have pointed out, the mechanics of gunfighting and the platforming are just not really 'there' enough. The controls are sluggish and the platforming and a few of the puzzles are kinda frustrating as well. Gunfights in particular are really frustrating, espeically the final 'boss' once he puts up his shield. You're literally either trying to roll past him (because you have no way to take cover in this particular battle,) or running the opposite direction until you loop around and can fire off one or two bursts before repeating in the opposite direction. For that matter the 'cover' you CAN get in some areas is pathetic. 'Let me hide around this corner, but no matter how I time it, whenever I pop out of cover the penguins are going to shoot and i'm not going to have enough time to pop off some shots before I die.'  That all being said. The game has good heart and some good humor. I'd pay up to $5 for it I think in it's current state. The ending kind of alludes to a sequel. We'll see how that turns out.",

The other combat is pretty enjoyable, although can get a bit repetitive, especially if you suck like me and keep losing a fight and having to redo it.   As for time spent in game, I was able to pick it up and beat it in roughly 3 hours. Granted, I didn't find all the hidden signs in the game which would have added some more time, but I also didn't feel a need to find those signs. Often when I would find one, I couldn't figure out how to get it so I just left it behind. The reward for getting them all isn't anything too special as far as I understand.   Regardless, I had this on my wishlist and as soon as it was on sale I purchased it. I don't feel like I wasted any money here. While short, it was still enjoyable.

Some of which is the fact that the game is just no fun at all. I dread opening the game and starting it up. I totally get what this game is trying to do, and that's awesome, but this game doesn't do it well. The controls just feel loose and wonky, certain parts of the game aren't as well thought out as they should be (namely the jetpack sequence), and the game presents no real challenge apart from frustratingly dealing with the game itself. For instance, when killing enemies, just crouch and hold the fire button until they die, because once you shoot an enemy for the first time, they get juggled and cannot break from it, giving the game no challenge. I will say, the music is alright, if totally repetative. If you want a sidescrolling game that is a parody/love letter to action films of the 80s, just invest in BroForce.",

Controls overall are a little slow or even delayed, which could be due to gamdesign. But in a game whose combat system focusses on shooting, it rather causes frustration than immersion. And the story appears nearly absent so far.  I have now pushed myself for some 5 to 6 hours into the game (in offline mode, therefore not equal to my registered playtime) and I am still failing to find the fun in it.

The puzzle sections are not too hard, but just right to get your brains tinkering a bit. There was never a puzzle that got me stuck, which is very uncommon and I have to salute the makers of this game for the good job.  Just like all the good old games, this game has a cheesy storyline to follow(in a good way) except this is a 'real' storyline that actually makes sense unlike the old platformers.  Controls are simple and easy to use and there's no special tricks trying to control your character which makes it easy to just start playing. The Game worked flawlessy with linux as well. The only annoying thing was that switching the weapons with a mouse wheel was sometimes a bit of a pain, especially in tight situations where you are surrounded. But this of course is also related to what kind of mouse you are using.  Overall if you find the trailer funny at all and like platformers, this is definitely worth your time.",

However: the areas with waves of enemies in a locked room are broken, with enemies being 'human' (penguin) shields to your bullets but not to each others. I kept getting killed by enemies that were behind other enemies who could shoot past their allies but I was instead shooting the dead, juggled bodies of their allies instead of them. Also, the jetpack sections are a mess, with a huge zoom-out effect and screen scroll every time new flying enemies appear, making it harder to see the ammo or health pickup you were aiming for or the rocket that is still chasing you (fired from a previous enemy) that you're still expected to avoid, even if both you and the rocket are off screen. Both the waves of enemies and the jetpack sections checkpoint frequently, so they become a battle of attrition rather than skill. These two sections are also where the game showcases its' soundtrack. Short sections of uninspired music looping endlessly. On first hearing at the title screen, it got me in the mood for an action game. But repetitively looped in frustrating, cheaply designed action sequences (the waves and the jetpack), both these sections and the one to two verse or chorus songs had both gameplay and music making each other worse. There are also some ridiculous puzzle sections involving playing around with box stacking and elevators that do nothing but artificially lengthen the game. One section had me chase an enemy up a set of elevators, back down, and then back up again, requiring a floor change at each of about six floors on the first two of those runs. I was not amused.  Other than the above, quite an enjoyable game. But if the come out with a sequel, I will not be buying it, given the amount of cheap time-lengthening and unbalanced gameplay of this game. That, and the story of 'Rocketbirds: Hardboilded Chicken' (what there is of it) would hardly support two or more games.  I doubt I'll play this game again, because there's no way I'm putting up with that nonsense again.  Oh, and if you get stuck on how to proceed, like I did numerous times (minor SPOILERS), the answer is ALWAYS one of: run past it, use one or more crates, or control an enemy through brain bugs.
