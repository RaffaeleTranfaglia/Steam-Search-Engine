First of you cannot change the resolution, my resolution is 3840*2160, and it fills most of the screen. It would be nice to have the ability to choose the resolution.   Next of and the deal breaker for me is that when entering the castle to buy something, it zooms to the item, if you cannot afford it, it never zooms back out. So I need to close the game, and load it again.   Oh well.. they are updating the game along the way, so hopefully they can fix it.   Even though the gameplay isn't as enjoyable as Battle for blood, so I hope they would add some more levels to that instead.",
