    "description": "Heavy Bullets is a randomized FPS dungeon crawler where players make their way through a colorful maze, while protecting themselves from aggressive creatures and malfunctioning security devices. The goal lies at the end of the 8th level, where they must reset the security mainframe to restore order and reap the rewards.",

            "review_text": "As enjoyable as the gameplay is, I can't recommend it. Many people (even with powerful rigs) have huge stuttering issues that get progressively worse as the levels go by. The final bossfight becomes impossible because of them, since at that point of the game the stuttering evolves to at least a second long freezes every 3-4 seconds. For a rogue-lite that punishes death pretty heavily, that's a pretty big issue, yet the developer has abandoned trying to fix it.",

            "review_text": "Heavy Bullets. Where to start? At first, I'd like to say that this game is nothing for people who expect to finish the game within the first or second run. Death is permanent in this game and one of the essentials in the whole gaming concept itself. Once you're dead, you have to start the whole game again. However, the effects of death can be overcome by thinking of a clever strategy and planning in advance.   But what is this game even about? You start with a normal revolver filled with six heavy bullets and three bombs at the first level. The main mechanic of this game implies that you have to pick the bullets up in order to keep your revolver full to the brim. However, as you wander through the maze-like generated world, you encounter many sorts of enemies with their own and unique weak spots which you have to find out in order to make up your own way of beating the game. The game gets progressively harder and you'll be facing boss enemies at the fourth and the eigth level. Of course, you cannot beat them without proper preparation. That's when shops come in handy. You gain money by killing enemies, items by purchasing or finding them throughout the whole game (they can be both, passive or active) and special perks by upgrading your skills. With the right combination, you'll be able to finish even the worst enemies off.   This makes the game amazingly challenging. If it seems like you can't get past a level, you have to try harder. Don't stop until you have successfully beaten the stage. If you do stop however, then you're in bad luck because you may never get past said stage. The game forces you to play extended sessions which makes you come back for more. Furthermore, I do have the feeling like the game is adjusting to your style of playing since the more you play this game, the harder the earlier stages get. (If someone could verify said assumption, that'd be great.)  This is not just a FPS game where you are supposed to kill every enemy in sight. It's quite the opposite once the gears are running. With every death the game teaches you about the things you did wrong. Being in a tricky situation doesn't mean that the game's random generation is trying to outsmart your tactics, but you may want to think about a new strategy then.   The art style is very simplistic but still neat to look at which adds a bit of friskiness throughout the whole game itself. One thing I greatly acknowledge is the game's soundtrack. Although the game makes you think that you're in a serious situation considering that your inventory space is limited and you have to make choices wisely, the music emitted from the medbays, bullet shops and banks knocks you out of the skies and shows you that you may need a second to recover and think about how you're going to progress. It's not all about guns and bombs, you know?  However, there are a few minor bugs in this game which will (hopefully) soon get patched, but influence your way of playing heavily at some points. Sometimes, enemies recognize and attack you although you're not in plain sight (or/and if it's not declared in their attacking scheme), but hidden behind a wall. Sometimes, the game seems to lag out for a few frames periodically which can delay your actions significantly. However, like I said, those are minor bugs and will eventually get removed some time. They are no reason to consider not buying the game.  After all, I'd like to say that Heavy Bullets is a nice and refreshing twist for everyone who wants to take on a new challenge. The key to success is to never give up no matter how impossible a certain situation may seem. Everyone who thinks that this game is about blindly killing enemies is out of position. The game requires good reactions and a strategy to fulfill. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then this game is made for you.",

            "review_text": " In a heavily flooded roguelite FPS market,  Heavy Bullets  fails to rise above to anything memorable.  Is it terribly bad? No. Would I tell all my friends to run out and buy it?  Absolutely not.   Every FPS roguelite has a gimmick or some novel mechanic. In this case, I would say its having limited ammo and having the ability to pick up/retrieve your bullets. The artwork is also fairly interesting, but then again thats true for most of this titles competitors:   Tower of Guns ,  Ziggurat ,  Eldritch ,  Paranautical Activity , and  Reciever , just to name a few. The list goes on and on, right?  If you want to compete in a flooded market, you MUST really bring something special to the table.  As I said before,  Heavy Bullets  is not bad per-se, but why do I need another one of these titles?   Pros:  +Artwork is interesting enough +Controls work fine +Its cheap   Cons:  -Not nearly addicting enough for me to keep playing -Everything is too standard, down to the vending machine 'shops'. I know this is a roguelite and we need those elements, but I am asking developers to start thinking outside the box more. Its no longer enough to add one or two different mechanics to these indie titles. -I hear theres not much content as far as game length, but I didn't finish it.   Get it in a bundle or on the cheap, but otherwise I'd check out any number of other alternative roguelite games - I've reviewed several of the ones I listed above.    Peace,  ",

        {
            "review_text": "Without a doubt, heavy bullets is probably the most stylistic 'rogue-lite' (I refuse to call it a roguelike) on the market right now. Does that make it a good game?   In Heavy Bullets, you're basically playing a person whose goal is to do something about the security system, but honestly the story pretty much ends there. Other than some really strange flavour text that pops up whenever you start up the game, there's nothing else to the story other than you're going around shooting spiders and turrets.  The 'music' (more like sound) and graphics are beautiful. I have heard some people complain about the colour palette, and while I sort of agree at some parts mainly I think it's pretty to look at and the sound fits perfectly. There's usually no soundtrack in the background unless you beat a level or walk up to a vending machine, which even then is only glitchy ambience instead of actual full on audio tracks. When you're almost dead, a intense drum beat starts playing which amps up the tenseness (is that a word?) of the game.  That's where my positives mainly end. While graphics and sound are a big part of this game, the other is the gameplay- which unfortunately is not spectacular. The picking up bullets mechanic is at first, very interesting and fun until you realize that you're either going to be stuck at basically swimming in bullets, or no bullets at all and no way to proceed (which is amplified even more by another thing that we'll get to later).  But what's wrong with the mechanic? Isn't the point that you get punished for bad aim, and that you have to risk your life to go grab more? That is all fine and dandy- until you realize that it forces the game to become a slow, methodical almost stealthing game rather than the fast 'shoot or be killed' shooter that the game's movement speed and controls hint towards it wanting to be. Moving fast and shooting fast FEELS good, but you get punished for it so harshly by the enemy design and the nature of dropping bullets that you are forced to camp behind pillars and take your shots slowly- something that would work better for another game, but for the twitchy controls of Heavy Bullets it just feels like it bogs the game down to unplayable levels.  In turn, this all creates a loop of camping and inching to preserve bullets and then running out of bullets because you're camping, making you have to camp harder and be even more careful as you try and make a sneak attempt to the bullet you dropped, probably ending up in your death unless you got a bunch of health to camp with or bullet magnet+ to grab it from afar. Overall, I don't think that this mechanic is pulled off well mainly because the dangers that are presented to you are too high to make the game that fun 'run-n-gun' game it wants to be so much.  Other problems I have are more nitpick and personal preference- I honestly feel like the banking system kind of encourages grinding and money grubbing more than actually enjoying the game the first times through; although you don't have to play the game like this, and there's even an achievement for ignoring it altogether. I feel like also some of the items are death sentences, I've never used running shoes without me running into a snake and killing myself and bombs seem like they're kind of on the useless side of weaponry even though you get a lot which ends up balancing them out somewhat.  So, do I recommend it? Well, if it's on sale as it currently is for 2 dollars, I'd recommend it just for the graphical and audial experience, but otherwise I'd say no. The trailer of popular LPers screaming at snakes attacking them is basically all this game boils down to- being killed by hidden things as you camp in corners trying to hold onto your bullets.   TL;DR:  Heavy Bullets is an extremely pretty game game that adds a few innovative features, but squanders them by wanting to be both a slow stealth-like game and a fast run-n-gun, making your twitch based controls and movement basically useless as you inch around levels hoping a snake or turret doesn't kill you around a corner as you camp behind pillars. Get on sale for the graphics/audio, avoid on non-sale price because the gameplay is kind of bad.  5/10",

            "review_text": "Cautious lack of recommendation, I'm sure there's still content to discover, but so far I'm a bit disappointed by how thin this nevertheless very interesting FPS/rogue-like feels. It succeeds as far as atmosphere goes, especially on a sound design level. It's retro chip-tune design feels threatening in an almost abstract sense, with some hidden monsters in the grass only being given away by the little blip noises they make, though of course you also have sounds to signal uncollected items and jaunty tunes to tell you a kiosk to make purchases is nearby. It's a really terrific use of sound design to fill in the visual holes.   Gameplay wise, the hook is gripping. Instead of collecting masses of bullets like most FPS's, you have to make due with a limited number of bullets that can be recovered after battle, and only one kind of gun. You can also collect bombs, but run out of both and you're basically done for. The problem I have is that there's really only one strategy for each fight; run out, listen for enemies, run back, wait for them to follow you around a corner, dispatch them, then poke your head back out and deal with turrets carefully. It's possibly an inherent flaw with smushing rogue-likes and FPS's together, since the former is based on randomization and making due with what you have and the latter is much more dependent on strong level design. I feel a lot of those flaws could be compensated for with stronger RPG elements, but leveling up is so far not that involved. You can buy or acquire more bullets, upgrade health, purchases a backpack to carry more than just one item, and of course find items that make you run faster, heal, or give you a melee attack. But in a game called 'Heavy Bullets' there's no way to upgrade your gun or your bullets. Certainly I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the game's creator being a single individual, but I wonder if scaling down to a top-down shooter or even just making it a survival arena shooter and focusing on the gunplay wouldn't have made for a better game.  In any case this is by no means a bad game, so give it a try yourself, and I'll keep chipping at it to see if there's more depth than is immediately apparent.",

GOOD - Very original, you wont be able to find a game which offers the same experience as this one! - Great atmosphere, maybe the graphics are not very realistic but that's oke. Everything is 8-Bit style including graphics and music, totally different from other games in this genre. - High replay value, becouse the maps and item positioning are totally random. - Challenging, you won't be able to finish the game within 15 hours. - Every enemy has his own strenghts and weaknesses, which add some strategy in the game. - Cheap, it's below €10,- and I even bought it in sale ;) .  BAD - Most of the maps are almost the same, which can be repetive. - You loose your progress when quitting in the middle of a level, exept when you quit when you finished a level. - Limited amount of enemy types.  CONCLUSION Just buy it, it's totally worth the full price and for that small price you get a whole new game experience you never met before.  8.5/10 I'll recycle my bullets again.",

The simple graphics, fast-paced and devilishly challenging combat will pull you in with the incredibly simple underlying plot; make it through level 8.

Simple dynamics, fairly random levels, and seems pretty easy at first. But no, it's actually quite hard. Assuming you don't go read a bunch of walkthroughs, it'll take you quite a few deaths to start piecing together the important stuff, tricks, etc to make it more than a couple levels.

I understand the game is supposed to be hard but spamming enemies that poison you from accross an entire room (which take more than one shot to kill, not to mention their poison attack is instant) is almost making me regret buying this.
