            "review_text": "I initially did not buy this game due to Friggleswitz's review. I couldn't find much data about Halfway; not from reviews online, not from videos on YouTube. After he revised his review to be more positive, I decided to buy it. I'm really glad I did.  The 'complaints' about this game are doing it a grave injustice. For 11 dollars, I have zero complaints. The storyline is interesting, the characters each have their own personality and abilities, and I love the music. Thematically, it reminds me of System Shock 2 or Dead Space. What irritated me most was the complaint about characters not leveling up. Every game nowadays seems to include xp and leveling simply to have that mechanic in the game. It doesn't matter if it adds anything, gameplay-wise; it's just a matter of having numbers that get higher.  The way Halfway handles progression is by giving you better weapons -- plasma rifles and flak shotguns -- and it works well. I don't feel a lack of game without experience points.  If you're on the fence and NOT expecting an AAA title, but rather a solid and fun game from an indie developer, then I strongly recommend Halfway.",

            "review_text": "Good but frustrating.  Game started out great, was challenging, had to manage supplies and decide what role characters will play in missions. The further you get into the game the more often you'll find yourself with unconsious teammates waiting until the battle is over if you win. And Squad Sizes are always no more than 4 to start the mission with, even though you have 8 people to choose from. There is also a 5 level limit to how often you can safetly level up your characters, after that it will either make them stronger or alter another stat entirely for better or worse.  But then the unthinkable happened. A boss fight requiring me to play as four set people, with two other squadmates I barely used during the game. So I ended up with one person who could aim decently, two shotgun guys that couldnt get close enough to anything before they died in an open room, and another girl who I was thankful she could just shoot bullets in the enemies direction. Top that off with enemies I had to use my most powerful sniper rifles just to put a dent into and it quickly became disaster. The game throughts you for a loop as at this time your so used to only having four members on the team on mission, but it allows you to play as all eight, the mission may actually be doable now.  The music is excellent, story is decent. My only complaint is a steep challenge, but game is fun playing a couple of missions every day.",

            "review_text": "Hi guys,  If you were ever wandering weather you should get Halfway game or not here is my humble recommendation of it. I hope it will clear your mind from all kind of hessitation.  I know the graphics is Pixel-ish and my 5y old son calls it ' fizzy' but graphics for me is not essential.  The thing that drag me into this game is :story ,music ,and greed for adventure that Halfway promisses.  I absolutelly have dived into this game .From the very beggining I got drag in a story that minute after minute got more excited and unpredictable. I have played a lot of tactical games but this one is a gem. Everything about this game is perfect for me ,this is the game I would love to design If I was a game dev. The action menu as I call it is design very neat ;when you press right button a pop up menu appears around your main character and here you can choose your actions.  The dialogs are good and dont sound shabby ; loot is important and by all means don't skeep any lockers ,boxes or crates cos you may loose a very significant piece of armor or weapon.  If you go further in game you gonna get new members willing to join your group .Every one of them has different attributes that will help you go through rough times. Your temporary 'base' when you get to it will offer you medical center ,shop ,general store room ,and  a map where you can plan your missions.   I am still discovering this game but I have wanted to share with you guys my humble opinion...  Do not hesitate ,Halfway is worth to buy it...   Love it .   Dan.",

            "review_text": "In space there is the creation of Jump Drives, a system for jumping from destination to destination, but what happens if the jump takes you to a between state of being, and in that state you are no longer safe. What if in that state if you have a specific type of neural implant you can survive this type of jump to all those who don't they either go crazy or get killed? In this game you will need to take a truly rag-tag group of individuals and somehow find a way to take control of a ship that seems to not only be in a 'halfway' state, but seems to continue to jump to other 'halfway' states. Halfway is the creation of the development team at Robotality.  Graphically you are going to be transported back to an era dominated by pixels, and I'm talking about the games that had pixel art that looked amazing. You will have to get through many different levels, all with different layouts, there will be some of the same stuff population the levels, but overall you are going to have to keep on your strategy hat as you try to map out your actions across the levels. Every character has a different look, and they have a different personality that I think kind of shows in the way that they look. I can definitely tell you that that also applies to the enemies as well, though its more of a, 'okay I can take these guys' vibe all the way to 'well I better get EXTREMELY lucky if I'm going to survive these guys'. I also appreciated the fact that you got to see your Home Base change throughout the game, it makes it feel more realistic, and it also is more accommodating as you gain characters through the game. The last thing I would like to point out is the map, it did exactly what it should do, it told me where I could go next and then also showed me the amount of progress that I had made by showing completed areas.  Alright so the soundtrack is nice to listen to for a while, but it really starts to grate on your nerves if you are stuck fighting battles over and over again. I also really started to dread the sound of certain shots being fired at me from enemies.  The controls are pretty straight forward. This is a turn based game so the majority of the time you are going to be using just the mouse, but there are a couple of hot keys that you can use if you want to pull up inventory, or do an special action.  Alright lets get right into the game, shall we. At first I was very interested in the story, the mystery of what was going on, and the different personalities as they clashed during the game. The problem was the battle mechanics. At first it was middle of the road in difficulty, you could take a couple of hits, or accidentally not be in cover, and survive, but late in the game it became OVERLY difficult. I do not understand how 4 straight times when I have a chance greater than 70% to hit a target I miss every single time. I also don't understand how I can have the best weaponry I could find and I only take away 30% of an enemies shield and they release one shot and I have no shield. I feel like the developers were looking to have a very tactical/strategy game, but forgot to take their finger off the difficulty piece. This is one of the few games where I have actually had to give up playing because I can't get any further. It takes an enemy 4 well placed shots to take down even the strongest of my party members, but it takes 15 shots to take them down. I wish I was exaggerating, but there are some enemies that if you don't hit them for max damage every time you are going to be reloading more times than they need to kill you.  There are some other mechanics in play, such as inventory management. When you have a gun that only has 4 bullets, and then you have a maximum space of 8 in your inventory you now have to factor in the fact that you are probably not going to be able to heal yourself if you want to be able to fight for then entire area. There's also the fact that the loot is randomized so there are times where I received 5 pistols in a level, I've never used a pistol the entire game, and they are much lower in every stat than what I already have equipped.   Another mechanic is the stimulant piece, this is kind of like leveling up your character in a specific attribute, be it aim, agility, or life. Funny thing though, even if you have the best aim, apparently you can still be handicapped in comparison to other players when it comes to percent chance to hit. There's also a limit of stimulants that you can apply to a single character, if you go above that number there's a chance that you could really mess up the character's stats.  So in the end I think the story is great, the art is great, the feel of desperation is real, and enhances the game, but there are too many inconsistencies, and some really bad logic behind some of the mechanics. This is why I have to say that this is a game that I hope can be fixed, or given a little make over in a couple of ways. If they do that they have ONE HELL OF A GAME, but until then they have a game that gets a 6.4 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "I'm recommending this, barely, if you get it at a discount.  There are many good elements. The overall structure will be familiar to anyone who has played the recent XCOM. It's fun for a few hours, but gets a bit repetitive toward the end. The final boss fight is somewhat tedious.  Things that would have made this game better:  - A decent tutorial. If you've played XCOM, you'll understand the basics of movement and firing, but there are many details that aren't apparent. Case in point: I read a number of reviews that stated sniper rifles are the ultimate weapon, and based on the numbers the game presents, they are. But if you *try* an assault rifle, you'll discover that the base to-hit is much higher, so you don't have to spend an extra AP aiming. Which means you can fire it twice in a round and generally hit both times.  (Another example: you'll figure out pretty quickly that every unit MUST have a weapon and armor at all times, so if you sell off the last spare gun or suit you will be unable to swap equipment around. But it would have been nice for a tutorial or (gasp) manual to warn you to hang on to the spares.)  - A save game feature that recorded more than what level you were on. I had to leave the game running while away from the computer for a few hours because I didn't want to lose my progress. Most of the levels aren't terribly long, but it's not obvious where the save points are, and you don't want to re-play some of the drawn-out battles.  - Better indications of cover. If you're going to steal XCOM's full/half cover system, you should probably steal the part where you show the current cover status of the unit.  Not a great game, but it's sufficiently entertaining to merit a run-through. ",

            "review_text": "Simple and good turn-based strategy game.   On board the Goliath, you gather the remaining crew members and figure out what is happening on the ship. Once you gather enough members of the ships crew, you pick out which ones to take with you on a mission, each offering unique skills. It is important to stock up on supplies, which can be purchased at a kiosk. To earn credits, you will need to 'recycle' items you collect from missions. Basically, you turn in armor, weapons, or items for credits.  Although unique in the beginning, the enemies begin to run dry on the unique skills. Most either charge at you to attack melee or will keep at a distance to fire at you. This was one problem I had with the game, it stays like this until toward the end. However, I do feel that this gave the game a bit more realism, as the creatures you fight were human members on board the ship, not four arm, five legged beasts.  Enemies also have a bad habit of appearing in random places when the ship goes through a jump. Only in a few instances can this be a problem because you may have set your crew to physically attack one enemy, kill it, and suddenly have four more appear right where your crew are, placing them in a tight spot because it would be ideal if they were further away and behind cover.  Some other small issues I had was the occasional 82% chance to successfully hit only to miss, twice in a row. This is rare and not something that breaks the game. The other issue is the text is difficult to read when selecting missions on the right side of the ship map. Again, not game breaking, just slightly annoying.  Overall, I would recommend this game. It is simple that you can play a mission or two if you have 30 minutes to an hour to spare. Not many lengthy game conversations. Each character provides a unique skill to be of use in combat. And the story is interesting.",

The main activities of Halfway are TBS fighting, running between fights and observing the linear story progression. No options in dialogs, no choice, no consequences, like reading a book. So only fighting includes actual gameplay. To win a fight you have 2-8 units and ability to give them simple orders. In theory that is enough. But there is a problem. You see, you can't actually develop your units. Every unit has 2 predefined abilities and 4 predefined stats. Stats can be slooooowly changed with equipment. A certain piece of equipment can be found in a certain crate/locker on a certain level. No random generation. And there is no vast variety of loot, you will take from mission at best 3 new pieces which are slightly better than your current. Also on most missions you have to take fully or partially predefined team for the plot's sake. So unless you have the full game guide you can't predict and plan your unit development. But who needs fancy pseudo RPG babysitting when you have tactics! Not here. Here you usually open a door and conveniently placed enemy spots your guy. Enemies as equipment are placed in certain places on certain maps, no random at all. And there is no way to predict what is waiting ahead, only try and error. Also often you get local special treatment: your guys enter certain small area, trigger cutscene, take bad positions without your control, bla-bla-bla, then enemies appear from thin air, take a turn, take good positions and only then you are given a chance to react. So here you are on a pretty tight prebuilt level with predefined units wearing predefined gear standing in disadvantaged predefined positions against preplased predefined set of enemies which corner you if you run and get to point blank range if you don't within two turns at best. Under this circumstance no tactic is involved. Basicly you must perform only one specific for every battle set of actions. Thereby Halfway genre is not RPG or TBS but point and click adventure. Don't buy Halfway if you love TBS or RPG, buy if you like quests.",
