            "review_text": "Although I have been a Nancy Drew game enthusiast since the fifth game was released, I have to say that this game left me sorely disappointed. The plotline of the game is stale and short. Most tasks are not part of solving the mystery, but rather errands and chores given by other characters. The game is also disappointingly short. I finished the game in two short sittings (Steam records that I played 11 hours but this is incorrect; I have been experiencing some home IT issues that increased my calculated gameplay). Other ND mysteries have at least held my attention through a few difficult puzzle series. The 'size' of the environment was also far too small. The whole game is spent in three small areas: a house, a barn, and a shop (3 rooms in the house, 2 rooms in the shop, and 1 barn area). The only exceptions are the outside area (where 2 activities are held) and driving on the roads (which was more of an annoyance than a fun game element). Trail of the Twister is unfortunately my least favorite Nancy Drew game yet. I hope Her Interactive can step up their game and bring back the excitement seen in games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and The Curse of Blackmoor Manor.",

            "review_text": "Not since the time of Alfred Hitchcock has a thiller so enthralling graced the prescence of mystery-lovers everywhere. The gritty, in the fray writing style draws you in and the character development keeps you wanting more. Indeed, during the climatic fight scene on top of the empire state buliding i found myself locked in my seat, heart pounding, sweat pouring down my face as i gripped my seat in expectation. The true message of the story; that of marxism in german society in the 1920's, is subtly conveyed through the prowess of some of the finest voice actors of this century. The character dynamic was excellent, each cast member playing off of the other in an intense waltz of cinematic quality drama. This game has set a new standard for mystery thirllers, the emotional up's and down's it evokes can be found nowhere else.",
