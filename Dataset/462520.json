            "review_text": "This game is great. It sucks it's not popular enough atm. I played with my friend and had a blast. The singleplayer is surprisingly really fun. When you have all the cards unlocked (which don't take much time to get) it gets really hectic especially when you play with friends. You can also unlock different kaiju's which and they all have different special weapons which I found cool. Again, it sucks that this game isn't popular enough atm, and I really hope it does because I can see this as a competitive strategy game.",
