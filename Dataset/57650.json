I'm not the Diabolo fanboy, but Dungeon Keeper is a way better game that this one.   The good: visuals, some scenarios in campaign.  The average: gameplay, magic system, skill system, in-game jokes. The bad: controls, building system (there are a lots of build items which are essentially the same). The ugly: launching the game (you need to pass 3 screens to simply launch the game). The verdict: I'm not going to play this game ever again.",

Example: I setup a small dungeon in sandbox mode and opened my first gate, only to find that as opposed to spawning single hero it spawns parties of heroes. As a result my forces were quickly overwhelmed and I had to restart. Gate itself didn't have any marking to distinguish itself from other gates. This is just one example but I keep running into similar scenarios. Could be that it is my noobery but then again after giving this game couple of tries I feel like its just a waste of my time. Let me know if you had a different experience.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Dungeons is a game with an interesting concept, however once you get past the excitement of something different to your usual RTS... It just becomes repetitive. Don't buy at full price.  Dungeons is a game where rather than building up your lair, recruiting forces, and ultimately taking over the 'upper realm' by force, you instead aim to coax heroes into your dungeon, increase their happiness through them finding gold, fighting (and beating) your minions, finding weapons, and research. You then kill them to take back this happiness as soul power. The game starts off slowly as you try to become accustomed to this, but then accelerates into you having to manage all of these, as well as ensuring your main objectives are met, to prioritising spending on dungeon improvements or objectives. Which is all well and good, except it's the same formula, and as you get towards the end of the campaign, all you dungeon building is taken care of already.  I blitzed through the campaign and as it is an older game, did not try the multiplayer. Buy this game on sale for a bit of enjoyment, but don't expect to have your mind blown.",

Despite what you may have seen or been led to belive this game is not related to Dungeon Keeper at all...except maybe roughly similar humor (though not as funny or effectivly delievered). However, what Dungeons is, is a Tychoon game, like railroad or rollercoaster or themepark tychoon. It's a humours game where you get to customize your dungeon keeper (you play the big boss basicly) and you build your dungeon in order to give heroes a 'good adventure' inside of it, once they are happy and fat and pleased with themselves you beat the hell out of them and throw them in prison, sucking their soul energy, witch lets you build and further upgrade your dungeon. It's been threw enough patches to where it runs fine now, and it's a decent game for a on sale price (i wouldn't pay fll though). As long as your not expecting it to be Dungeon Keeper 3 you might actually enjoy the game.",

It feels almost like a tycoon game at times, creating the perfect dungeon arrangement that satisfies all heroes, at a set distance to your dungeon, at a set HP remaining so they're not an actual challenge to slay. The only two downsides are Champions are really boring and I would have liked to see them have more personality, abilities, or effect on the game itself. The other is that the campaign bosses are a complete joke and they tried too hard to make scripted experiences - I would have loved to see that effort put elsewhere into another mechanic or feature.  If this game didn't have Dungeons in the name, it probably wouldn't have gotten so much crap for not being a clone of Dungeon Keeper. It can stand on its own!",

            "review_text": "I won't complain that this game isn't Dungeon Keeper. No matter how much I really want it to be War For The Overworld.  This game is, however, more like what would happen if someone decided to try and mix Dota 2 and Dungeon Keeper. You have a physical pressence in the game you have to manually direct to attack, activate things and generally progress. While games like Baldurs Gate may spring to mind. this does not have much in the way of combat other than 'go attack that person... right, they died...'. There is no customisation of your 'keeper' further than leveling up to gain spells with real-time cool-downs... This might be better likened to Overlord, but without the cusomisation of your weapons... or the thrilling gameplay.  I don't like games that have me watching for seconds, checking my mana, waiting for a specific moment between the slow, repeating combat animations and then unleashing some spell that i'm going to have to wait another 00:40 to use again. This is not Warcraft!  The game quickly gets pissy and overly picky about what you need to do. The dynamic of 'let heroes in and let them get real happy to farm their souls' comes off as a little strange at best. Let them walk in, slay your creatures, then plunder the convenient piles of gold lay around? oh... kaay? kill them on their way out so you don't lose the gold and do gain their souls. Right? Ok, let's do that while trying to dig out some more rooms of your dungeon, expand your area of influence with pentagrams that summon enemies and need population points to build and build some decorations to give yourself prestiege. Don't forget to complete the challenges on each level to level up your guy to get better combat spells and that... did I forget to mention if you take too long, the next b*gger comes in and starts plundering somewhere else? Oh, and you're being attacked by someone else on the other side of your dungeon, better get back there. Better still, teleport somewhere even further away if you want to get there faster! uuh... no!  There is too much fiddly, useless and over-complicated systems. I can't compare this to dungeon keeper. that would be an insult to both games. This has multiple 'currencies' to constantly keep an eye on as you're building. Lacking tutorials that leave you not entirely sure what you're supposed to be doing and, I hate to be mean, but if you're playing a game about managing a dungeon, i don't need to tell myself to walk over here so the hero doesn't see me before i kill him... honestly, it does not seem very well thought out.  I would love to change my review, but this is too under-developed to be an MMO, far too far away from being simple enough to play casually and, to be frank, no fun.",

Well this game lets you find out exactly what that is like. Based off the classic Dungeon Keeper games, this RTS/Tycoon game puts you in-charge of your very own Dungeon, allowing you to build hundreds of rooms and corridors, decor them with items to bait curious adventurers, and create many traps and monsters to ultimately finish them off! The goal: make your dungeon interesting enough to please adventurers til they are content, thus fulfilling their wishes and maxing their soul energy, and then killing/capturing them before they escape. Tons of fun, a must-have!",

I can actually kinda compare this game to the Sims, which is not good when you are catering to a complelty different audience :/.
