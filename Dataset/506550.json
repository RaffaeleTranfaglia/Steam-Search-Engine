            "review_text": "Wow this game is pretty fantastic. Def one of the better VR games I've tried.  Your player moves pretty fast along a rail as you shoot enemies out of the sky, like a roller coaster. Intense! Really like the music. The bullets lag behind the player a bit so sometimes it's hard to tell you are firing and where you are aiming, but the hit detections is pretty generous. Graphics and effects look really nice. Decent amount of content, 2 worlds with 5 tracks each.  Lots of fun, very much worth the low price.",
