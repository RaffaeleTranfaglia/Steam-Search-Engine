I expected more or different elements to the game compared to Tropico 1. - Building roads is a hassle in this game.  - Experienced some CTD's - its a bit light if you are looking for a serious city game.

You guide civilization on the island down multiple paths based on playstyle and choices you make leading to a variety of different cultures taking hold in your society. Does your nation become a capitalist industrial powerhouse? A (not so) peaceful theocracy? Maybe you give rise to a Communist paradise! Its pretty much all up to you in Tropico. Can you lead your nation to success, or will you end up a failed state?    Overall I would give the Tropico games a recommendation if you are a fan of sim games. That being said, even if you are new to the genre, there is a very good chance Tropico 3 SSE could make a great addition to your library.",

            "review_text": "Ah Tropico, where the money is so colourful, you'll forget it's worthless :D  Tropico 3 is a mix of city building, (Tropical island themed) and The Sims franchise, where as filling happiness factors is key to smooth gameplay. It does well enough to fit the atmosphere of the title with radio broadcasts, spanish accents and the lavitan background music. As 'El Presidente' you must get enough votes to remain in power which makes it sometimes satisfying to win the election after some hard citizens to win over, however not much else is done to deepen the voting system in the game. Once you lose an election it is game over, If you win you may continue on until the next election rinse and repeat. You are a leader of a small island nation that seems to be soverign in it's own right, owing no alleginace to any superpower. You can however do dealings with Russia or America, building favour with the Communists or Capitalists, respectivly.  It boils down to how you would like to run your nation, (in each mission or map scenario) leaning towards communism, keeps your citizens happier and housing cheaper, albiet loss of export profits. If heading towards the Capitalist end of the spectrum, favoring infastructure, power plants and of course export profits. As an island nation, the economy relies on exports whether or not you are predominatly Communist or Capitalist.   Much of the game is spent setting up enough housing for your population, building structures to keep certain politcal groups on the island happy enough to vote for you next election and on occasion, defending your buildings from rebel attacks. Tropican citizens turn rebel when thier satisfaction levels drop too low, clicking on an indivdual citzen will show stars next to factors that determine his happiness. These stars usally 3 factors are noted, represent what is most important to this indivual, for expample job secruity or relgious satisfaction, if these needs are not met for a while he will cease to be a citizen of Tropico and join others hiding out in the island's wilderness.  Special buildings can re-educate captured rebels, turning them back into a useful workforce.  Another important factor in the economic stability of the Tropican islands is tourism.  Tourism can be a huge boost to your government treasury, however care should be taken when you are planning your constructon phase as location of buildings is important, an ideal resort would have garages which produce cars, readily available for quick transport, hotels, entertainmt buildings and other money making buildings found under the tourism tab. Also of note, is the tourism industry can at times cause a flood of people to land on the island, causing traffic jams and lengthy, expensive, holdups, not good for any busy island nation. Take care when expanding.  This may seem like a detailed review, however I have only covered some parts of the game, there is still more and I think continuing would only create a bigger wall of text and uncover all things best left undiscovered until one actually buys this game.

            "review_text": "Today, I will be reviewing Tropico 3. I have been playing this game for over 50 hours, however in offline mode, I recently had a holiday.  In terms of gameplay and generally enjoyment, it is suprisingly fun, I only got the game because I found it going very cheaply and I thought it would be worth its price. However, looking back, it is highly worth the current price tag, and to be honest with the knowledge of what great game it is it would be easily worth up to £20.  Now, moving on to the actual review, this game through my eyes is an easy pick up and play, going through the tutorial will sure, make your life easier, but to be honest it is not required.  In terms of graphics, it is suprisingly good in comparision to what I thought it would be, considering the game was made during the time of Windows Vista, XP, and very early variants of Windows 7, this game was as good as most games I play.  In terms of the type of game it is a bit of crossover between a city builder like Banished ( a lot newer but you get the point), and maybe the Sims, purely because of the different groups.  Now, I'm just going to throw in a quick memo about groups, and that I think they are so brilliant executed, yet beautifully straight-forward.  In terms of the political system I love the alliance with the U.S/ U.S.S.R, I also think the Capitalists/Communist groups are well matched with a real life system. And the huge amount of diplomatic options.  In terms of replayability, the sandbox mode gives you that easily, and the campaign will keep you coming back for more every time.  Finally, my last opinions of the game summed up: A brilliant game, provides hours of entainment of such a great pick-up and play, the controls are easy to remember, and the gameplay is quick and fluid enough, with a good insight towards to welfare of your citizens.  9.5/10  I hope you enjoyed this review, apologies for any bad English, I am not fluent. Thank you and have fun!",

However, Tropico 3 plays less like a city builder and more like a political simulator. Buildings aren't built to make money for more buildings or to create a better life for your citizens. No, buildings are built only to please the various factions and citizens of Tropico so fewer people consider having El Presidente retire to an 'undisclosed location'. The dictator context is mined for its laughs though and the game uses that sense of humor and a very helpful radio show to establish an instant sense of immersion which falls apart entirely when its variety is quickly exhasted. These extras go from endearing to repetitive all the way to obnoxious in the space of two or three missions. Character creation is where this lack of variety is the most glaring. There is a reasonably wide selection of appearances and traits to choose from, allowing for a real custom character. But with the text of those traits and the introduction of the missions being so specific, the character you've crafted floats away in the contradictions. This is not helped by the fact that El Presidente only has two sound sets, male and female, with the female being so cringe-worthy I only used it once. It is also worth mentioning that, as of the writing of this review, the 'Special Steam Edition' is thoroughly un-Steam. No Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Cloud Saves. Nothing to indicate that this is a Steam game past the title. It doesn't change the way the game is played and Tropico 3 does have in game achievements to scratch that itch, but the lack of Steam features on a game so named seems a little strange. Complaints aside, I enjoyed playing this game, but I don't have plans to come back to it anytime soon. I recommend giving it go, but maybe play through the demo a few times before dropping any money on it.",

The game works well as you can easily play without getting bogged down in details, but you still have to option to get fairly in depth to optimize your strategy. The politics, while not to advanced, are decent, and good enough considering the the main point of the game is a city builder anyways. The game is quite fun, however, and has some humor, although not all of it is very good. Overall, I find the game enjoyable and would recommend it.",

I bought Tropico during 2013 Summer Sale and I only got around to playing it after playing several games ranging from action and racing to casual and stealth and I felt it was a good idea to play a city-builder game. So...  GAMEPLAY TROPICO 3... is a fabulous and addicting game. It's all about being 'El Presidente', managing an island banana republic and making it prosperous while embezzling some of the money for your Swiss bank account (which is non-crucial, it only serves for high score). You start every game by choosing your avatar, either pre-configured real ones like Che Guevara, Evita Peron and Voodoo Pizzaman or you can create your own. Then you start (always) with a banana republic which is in shambles and then you can do whatever with it by issuing edicts, constructing, pleasing different factions (like socially aware communists, hypocritical religious and more) and you rise through the difficulties and build a prosperous nation based on ore/coffee/rum/whatever exports... Or you pass a martial law and conscription edict and build a giant army... or ♥♥♥♥ off USA and make it invade you; the choices are many.  CHARM Next, you have at first charming and humorous, but then repetitive Juanito who keeps Tropicans up to date on current issues, passed edicts and humorous event reports. The soundtrack is short but so sweet, you won't help but shimmy to the infectious salsa rhythm and graphics hold up pretty well (but it's a 2009 game, so it's kind of expected). The humor in this game is terrific and well though-out so you will definitely giggle at some of the event reports (like a llama assassinating El Presidente's favorite hat) and you will grow to curse at least one faction in this game. All of the mentioned elements make for a really freaking addicting game.  MODES I first recommend playing the campaign mode, it is great to keep you occupied as you try to get through different goals and finish each island. The campaign mode definitely has some variety however even then, it will feel repetitive doing the same thing over and over again, just with a different end. The sandbox mode is great and there you can develop your island however you please and where you have your own ways of building a rich Carribean country.  ITERATION Now, it seems that this game is simply a remake of Tropico 1 and while I feel that's a good thing for newcomers, it brings nothing new to the table if you played the earlier games. Also, after a while it feels repetitive doing the same thing over and over again, you will eventually grow sick of it as every scenario you play starts the same.  CONCLUSION + Highly addictive and gratifying + Salsa soundtrack + Great humour  +/- Remake of Tropico 1  - Brings nothing new - Repetition  8/10",
