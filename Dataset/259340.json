            "review_text": "First off let me say I came into this game with low expectations, but after ten minutes I was hooked.the story is on par with greats such as Call of Duty Global Offensive, Raider of the Lost Shark, and Glover.The story revolves around a farmer who I could not discern if he was pig or man, but that's the beauty of the game YOU the gamer get to choose.The shooting mechanics are some of the most fine-tuned and realist seen within the last 12 years.The evironments are 100.1% interactive, gone are the days of battlefields 'levelutions' which were drab and bland.The only negative I can see in this game is that I felt physically assaulted when an egg flew at me and a chicken gave me the double bird, but seeing as how I did have these feelings they left a huge impact on me and left me pondering my life days after, so you could take that as a negative or positve depending on what you decide to call art.overall this is a great buy for anyone looking for an emotional rollercoster, and deep reflecttion. 9.9999/10 ( I would give it a ten but nobodies perfect. rip Hannah Montana.)",

            "review_text": "The difference between Chicken shoot Gold and Chicken shoot is quite astonishing. This game is a must buy, it brings together the full package which the original just cant. The orignal barely lives up to the sequels glory.   Story: The game throws you into an apocolyptic scene from the get go, which makes for a very engaging start (+1). The universe is set in 1934 Nazi germany... BUT WITH A TWIST!!! Instead of Nazi german humans the villans are actually portrayed as chickens, which, i believe, gives the game a deeper poetic meaning (+1). Perhaps the Nazi's have been portrayed is this manner to hint to the fact that not only were the nazi's villans they were cowards too, but its all open to interpritation (+1).  The protagnist of the game is a nameless man, you may be wondering ''Why isnt the protaganist a chicken too?? And Why am i reading this review??!'' Two very good questions. To answer the first one i would say that the devolpers of the game have tried to use the nameless man to represent the allied forces as a whole (+1). Now i know this game may seem slightly xenophobic, but you must keep in mind that this game was released in 1936 as a propaganda method for the allied forces to brainwash the minds of the succeptable younger generations (-1).  After a few levels into the game we meet one of the co-protaganists of the game 'Jesus Christ'. The introduction of the son of god unlocks some new interesting features to the game (+1), but we will get to that later. The game then goes onto an amazing twist, i wont spoil much, but the story turns into a battle against time as you and 'Jesus Christ' go on a perilous quest back in time to stop Hitler from coming into power (+1). Ill leave the rest of the story for you guys to find out.  STORY POINTS = 5 Next up is the Graphics.  Graphics: Not much to say here. Sure the visuals may not be as amazing to games such as call of duty and Kick ♥♥♥ 2, but you must keep in mind that this game was released in 1936 which makes it quite revolutionary in my opinion. (+5).  GRAPHIC POINTS = 5 Lastly up next is gameplay.  Gameplay: The way the game plays is simple yet genius, alot like minecraft its a 3rd person side scrolling adventure. The game then sugar coats this with the addition of magic, you may remember me mentioning 'Jesus Christ' earlier in the review. Well after a few quests you earn his trust, and in return you revieve the holy bible. This alows you to cast spells which really spices up the game and kept it fresh for me. And personally this game comes under both of my faviourte game genres (FPS and RPG) and i would recomend anyone else who enjoy games under the same catergory to pick this up immediantly. (ONE BIG +1)  GAMEPLAY POINTS= 1  Overall id give this game an 11/10 Phenominal",

I try to give CD activation key when the game asks and then press OK but nothing happens. There is no error message or nothing, nothing happens and nowhere I can find solution to what to do and how to get to play game. Same problem is with Chicken Shoot 2 so both are very bad because they don't work.  Waste of money, I am sad.",

Serious review: Game is annoying to set up, what with the reg. key and copy/paste not working ingame. Game doesn't like to be alt tabbed either. Takes a LONG time to start up.  More importantly, steam interface does not function. That's always a minus.   I could see myself wasting some more time playing this, but good god don't pay full price for this, are you nuts?  PS: When you buy this, it also comes with Chicken Shoot 2, so I guess you're getting 2 games for the price.",
