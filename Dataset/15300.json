Whenever i play this game it gives me memories of so long ago, the gameplay is just awesome so realistic in a fun way one shot and your dead, commanding your teams, hiding in the bushes with a sniper rifle i could play this game over and over it just never seems to get old one of my favourite games of all time :)",

And of course recon element is the most interesting part for me here. Good franchise...'following your lead, right behind you, kill confirm'...it's a few voice acting that can we hear along we playing on.  One of the best tactical shooter game ever had.

And I'm assuming real-life terrorists have weapons experience, so the AI in this game should too.

I played this when I was younger and I can honestly say that this is a lot better than the newer ones, not saying the newer ones aren't good I just prefer this one. First off if you go in thinking that this is going to be like Call of Duty you can't be any more wrong. Essentially this is based on how you build your 6-man army, you will die in a max of 3-4 hits if you're lucky usually you'll die in one hit along with your enemies. If even one of your character dies you can call it game over because you might need that extra sniper of demolitions, and make every shot count because you can miss pretty easily though. ",

Co-op for me, but deathmatch is also very involved and a good laugh.",

A game where being able to tell if a person is an enemy or on your team was nigh-impossible because by the time he came out of the fog of war, you were already dead if he was an enemy, or dead anyway because he didnt know if you were an enemy or not either. Also if the fog density wasn't bad enough, theyre was foggy levels dedicated to you being completely blind for an hour.  The best ♥♥♥♥ing shooter of all time.

This one is diffrent then the other FPS games THIS is was Tactical FPS should be like Battefield? Call of Duty? PFFFT! those are kinds game against this game    You are put up into 3 teams (which can be customised to around 50/90%)  Alpha Bravo Charlie There is 3 diffeculties  Normal  Veteran  Elite   Sinse i have finished the game on ELITE with out loosing a single member in my squad i can say that this game... is freaking hard even on normal   You have 1 life you cannot generate HP OR! revive your teammates so if you plan your move wrong... then you are dead.   trust me you will plan your moves wrong so many times SO!! many times unless you cheat...   This game takes tactics to a compleat new level  you can go guns blazing thinking you will hit everyone no the enemy AI haves a fast reaction to like a real life trained military man   Nope you will die from that!   Tips is to go sneaky  sinse you can uppgrade your soliders and stuff so they can be better at stuff.   I highly suggest getting both of the DLC's when you get the game to get more missions and maps  ",

The game shines in the non-linear, non-restrictive gameplay that has plagued many linear corridor shooters (to include Ghost Recon Future Soldier). Players have a map, and a team of men, and must apply critical thinking through mission analysis in order to be successful.   The game also has an outstanding damage model that still outshines most shooters; A single 5.56mm round will kill, and players can sustain arm and leg wounds that affect their ability to shoot and move. Third person animations also reflect player damage in the form of limping and visible blood stains and gunshot wounds.  There is also an RPG-like system that allows players to develop their Ghosts and apply personal attributes that will improve their performance.   My only big gripe is the use of a reticule system instead of a first person weapon. Unlike Ravenshield, there is no on-screen, first person weapon. There are only a series of recitules that can be zoomed in to simulate weapon sights.",

The enemy is as clever as though it's a real person playing against you! Also, your teammates can think for themselves whether or not to shoot, and when to stay in recon mode. The teamates have excellent leadership skills, too! As for Multiplayer, servers don't exist anymore. However, if you have a friend who also plays Ghost Recon, it is fun to host a server and play with them! Though an individual ordering system isn't available, group-ordering has never been easier! Teammates choose the shortest road when given orders to assault or suppress, and choose the safest road when given orders to go 'Recon.' A cool part is that the team-leaders show signs with their arms and hands when giving orders, instead of talking! This may be the first Ghost Recon, it may not be as advanced as 'Future Warfighter,' and it may not show a gun on 'First-Person View,' but it's still an investment that is not bad to make! My opinion: Buy the game! 'Long Live Tom Clancy!'",
