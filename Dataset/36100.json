Definitely good for killing a few hours if you can figure out the combat. It feels a bit poorly balanced to me but I'm probably just not trying hard enough whoops",

When Sandlot Games came out with this game me and my father bought it, We played the crap out of tradewinds so we tried this one next, and then the next one. It might be dull to todays crowd because of the fact it is older, but for the people that played it since its birth, this game is great.   If you are interested in getting it, get it when it is on sale. Better yet get the collection, this franchies for Tradewinds is just that good.",
