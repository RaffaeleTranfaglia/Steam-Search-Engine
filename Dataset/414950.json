            "review_text": "Short version : If you like Space Rangers 2, SPAZ, Escape Velocity (tho not that story driven), Starpoint Gemini 2, Starsector, you will like this game (and it's price).   Star Nomads 2 basically is true to its store description: 2D sandbox simulator, with meaningful economy, good space combat, leveling trees for perks and abilities (for you and squadmates), a good variety of ships and different weapon types and weapon levels (mk1-mk4), interesting quests, and different playstyles.   What I enjoyed the most is the way the game combines space roaming, with trading (also trade crysis) with pirate and zerkers (alien) invasion.    The easiest way to explain it is to give an example : pirates invade a system, they scare/destroy the incoming traders; the planet doesn't have food input from traders, so a food crysis starts; you go in, destroy the pirates(getting the bounties) then proceed to unload your cargo of food on that planet( at a high price), resolving the crysis; meanwhile all the fighting has atracted the aliens; their prolonged presence creates an invasion crysis- weapons and defense robots are needed; you wait/kill the aliens and save the day with a shipment of milspec robots(while lining up your pockets with fat credits). Also you can influence faction ship production through trading. A very dynamic system that involves pirates/trading/conquering planets.    You can have up to 3 squadmates, you can ally with one of the 3 largest factions in the game (Empire -humans, Starborn Federation- humans+alien, Omni Collective- borg-ish humans ), you can conquer the galaxy OR maybe you want to play a pirate and yaharrrrr the cargo out of the traders. Total freedom of choice. The game will end once a faction control the universe.   The space combat is well done: the ships have different speeds and turn rates based on race/size, the turrets have different turn rates based on size and weapon type, the projectile/beams can miss; the different weapons are fit for different enemies/roles. You can go full drone carrier and watch the beautiful drone AI swarm the living shiats out of the enemy, or you can go torpedo heavy+guns blazing, or you can mix it up. There are a lot of ships, to fit almost every role. ALSO...no matter how strong you get, if you jump between 8 enemy ships you will get shreded. No rambo mode in this game.   There is way too much to talk about so I hope at least I piqued your interest, because the game is GOOD. With future updates I think it has the potential to be a GREAT game. I wouldn't have beta-tested(for free) and gave so much input if the game was bad. If you look up my reviews, I gave SN1 a bad review because it was bad. Review still up. SN2 is another story. You can easily get 40-50 hours of enjoyment playing this game. Also very low price/content.  ps. What I love about the technical part of this game is that it works very well on crap laptops and pcs (aka dual core, hd4000 and reports of hd3000 performing well). I almost always game in window mode; I put in on pause and do other stuff, then I come back. Game did not crash once while alt/tab-ing, having youtube/twitch streams on, having multiple IDE on, or virtual machines. ",

Hell yeah. I got so much more out of it. The whole universe really feels like its shifting around you, right from the begining. The Conquest AI features are fun, challenging, and rewarding. Smuggling is risky, thrilling, and rewarding. Combat is fast-paced, fluid, action-packed, and loads of fun. Even playing as a Merchant, trading resources, abusing the market to make bank, and even solving Planetary crisis' like food shortages and rampaging xenos! The fact that this game is developed by one guy (who is very, very active with his players!) blew my mind when I learned. You like space games? HARD space games? Must buy. Get it now. Do it.  Word to the wise: This game is HARD. As diamonds. On Jupiter.",

I can be unforgiving at times even on the normal difficulty, what i mean quick death if you arent carefull enought (even it wont be as bad in roque like mode). But in time learning how to play and what to do it start to unfold as fun game. Its essentialy a sandbox so you make the best of it. There random 'events' and dynamic world around you.  Can be be overhelming at start but give it little time. There bit story behind and random quest have got few good random event like funded mining corp what send me ore time to time, that is used to buy better ships / equipment.  So if you like quick deaths but you what push on its your cup of tea. ",

            "review_text": "I've been playing Star Nomad 2 for the last couple of days, and I must admit I have really enjoyed the experience. The game presents itself as an open-world sandbox, which I think it does accomplish, since it allows many different activities to be done. Moreover, I feel like it is a seamless world, where I am just another piece, not the main hero which destroys anything in it's path without any difficulty. Improving both the character &amp; the ship are time-consuming tasks, but at the same time I don't feel it's a grind, since I find the game's combat system to be entrhalling. I also enjoy the dynamic trade system. I've got to admit that although very enjoyable, the game could do with some aggregates &amp; new features, but as it is, the game has a very good base from which to expand &amp; improve, and it must be taken into account that the game has been developed by only 1 person (Halfgeek).  Highlights: ----------- -Somewhat open-world game, with different activities to be done. -Immersive atmosphere, soundtrack, music &amp; characters. -Amazing work for having been developed by only one person. -Halfgeek, the developer, is the most dedicated indie developer I know. He really works a lot for the game to thrive, answers extremely quickly &amp; takes into account all bugs reported, as well as suggestions and comments. -Fun &amp; enthralling experience. -Trading &amp; combat systems that aren't too simple nor complicated, they are just right.  -As it is, the game is a great foundation from which to expand, since a lot of features can be taken into account &amp; added to open-world sandbox type games.",

For 12$ this game is worth every penny. Many of the reviews will tell you the Pros and Cons of this where I will simply say this game scrathes and itch I didn't know i had. I highly reccomend this game and if you run into any issues and tell the Dev he will fix it pretty quickly.",

            "review_text": "I'm not a masochist, but I think being whipped for hours while strapped on a cross will be funnier than playing this game.  You start as a nobody with a crappy ship while everyone else will outclass you massively. It wouldn't be a problem if you were able to level up by trading, mining, exploring or doing quest like every kind of similar game. But here the only way to gain xp is by fighting. Which you can't do from the start because of how powerfull everything else is. The only way to gain xp early on ( and in most of the game it seems ) is to give the killing blow to a ship attacked by another NPC. No matter how hard you hit the ship before, only the killing blow will give you xp. BUT NPC will become pissy at you if you steal their kill. Do it one time too much and they will attack you, funny ... Another thing, there is no gun safety, so you need to fire carefully, because if you hit someone you will damage them. And usually a second hit will take a huge chunk of reputation from you and turn them hostile. A third hit? The whole faction is at war against you. And gaining reputation is SLOW. And mostly combat based. Oh and NPC can fire at you by mistake and you just have to shut up, doesn't work both way. Ah a last thing, avoiding friendly fire while dealing the killing blow is really hard when most battles are done by mutliples ships at once, with beams and missiles flying everywhere right from the start of the game.  Can't really comment about customizing ships and items, because I was unable to level up and I think most items are hiddens behind a level requisite. And a faction reputation requisite. It's the only explanation I have as to why every station is empty of items and why capital planet only got base weapons and items to sell. But it wouldn't really matter because you also need rare material to BUY weapons and items. Yes, you need to provide money AND materials to buy more stuff. Because you have to provide bricks, cement and money to have workers build your house I suppose. It's another ridiculous mechanic here to gate and slow your progress because these materials are priceys OR mostly mined in system full of pirates.  The game isn't fun at all because the only way to progress is to hide far away from the action then have to be lucky enough to find a mostly dead ship you can blow from afar. It's really not my conception of fun at all but it's the main mechanic of this game, you suck and need to kill-steal to progress.",

            "review_text": "After playing through and getting a feel for the game I decided that I do not want to waste hours and hours of my life grinding special Ore and faction standing just to progress and earn the right to buy a better ship. It's not fun and the videos and positive reviews make it seem you can do all these epic things, fleet battles, grand adventures...  All of it is repetitve and very slow. You will waste lots of time trying to 'have fun' because all the tools you need to 'have fun' are gated and restricted- the bigger ships like Frigates, Cruisers, even better weapons require atrocious amounts of credits AND large amounts of two special ores that take a lot of time to get.  In addition, you have to grind faction rep too and the game has this bounty credit system where it doesn't matter how much you contribute to a fight, just if you get the last hit in to kill so it wastes even more of your precious time.  Terrible game and if you play this, you will waste more than just $12+ dollars, you will waste precious hours of your life that could've been spent enjoying better things or learning a job skill, new hobby.",
