No video game makes the tennis more real and challangeing. You can't walk in and expect to start winning everything. If you do a world tour it will take you time to build your character up to adaquate level to be able to compete. Also the system isn't arcady, it will certianly take some getting use to. However if you want the most honest tennis experience then look no further than Tennis Elbow.",

Just proves looks can be deceiving because this is by far the best tennis game out there. Very realistic and great customization. Only caution I may give people is the controls take some getting used to, it's not like Virtua or Top spin tennis where you can just button bash. On this game you have to time your shots, along with the movement of the player.   If you can persevere with the controls Tennis Elbow 2013 proves to be the best Tennis game out there, well for the time being anyway. Highly recommended!!",

The learning curve is rather steep at first but after practice the game is magnificent and with continued mod support keeps improving. Thanks to the developer also who is very helpful on the games forum.  10/10   ",

I have been playing tennis games since the early 90s and have been suffering from the lack of good games of that specific genre. Sadly, this game has not helped.   - I do not care much about graphics but they are just ugly. Animations make me feel like it's 1994 again - I have never played a game with such annoying audio. The sounds are of low quality, do not fit and break the game - ugly UI &amp; akward controls  If this would be open source, it would be an ok game. Demanding 20 Euro for this utter piece of software is just outrageous. I really tried to like it, but this game is just no fun",
