            "review_text": "Pretty solid VN so far. E-mote does indeed make it look really smooth. There's a lot of body movement for VN characters (think hands, arms, boobs) and facial expressions as well. It's very lively and aims to be funny. The dialogue may seem a little bit childish at times, though. This game is comparable to Go! Go! Nippon! in a way that they both tell you some informational/interesting stuff about Japan's culture or history inbetween character interaction, but it doesn't go as deep. For example, it doesn't tell you how to get to certain places, how much certain things costs, where to get a Suica card, etc. The main focus are the three girls.  What's nice, though, is that it has multiple text options as it says in the description. If you're learning Japanese, this is extremely useful. What's even better is that the 3 main girls are fully voiced, so you can hear them talk Japanese and at the same time have the text in the chat menu display in English or Romaji and the additional text (in the top left corner of the screen) display in Japanese or hiragana (or any other combination of the 4).  However, if you're not learning Japanese, or you're already extremely good at speaking/reading it, the price might seem a little too high. Overall, as somebody who recently started learning Japanese, I do recommend this game and I'm very sure I can learn quite a few things from it.",

            "review_text": "When I first started the game, the overly light and downright silly tone initially turned me off. But I figured I'd play it through to see if it got better. Before you select a designated 'route', the game isn't anything good. At least, not to me. I found the moving/talking sprites to be a bit much and a tad odd, and your character is an oblivious weeaboo not likable one bit. And the three characters you interact with are the only ones you ever meet in the game, which in a way is good as there are no surprises, but if you're not fond of them then tought luck.   This is all in the first act though. The game poses a very neat system for selecting your route; each character whose route you can take represents a location you can visit in your school trip; Okinawa, Osaka or Kyoto. The choices you make in the first act determine which of them you are able to take, and then you can choose which you'd like to play. This is good as you're not forced to take a route you don't want to take. Not that getting the right route is difficult; this isn't a very 'interactive' VN (the route I played didn't have a single choice) so the choices are rather easy.   After I chose my route and the 'real' game began, it vastly improved. The story wasn't that different, but it seemed to be less... overly happy/silly, which is good. I hadn't expected to really enjoy it, but by the end I was invested in the story and it worked well, and it did a marvelous job at tricking me with a false ending.   One of the game's weakest aspects is the soundtrack. It's not overly 'bad', rather than underwhelming. The main theme is really poorly-done, and it seems the game had so little tracks to work with it even repeats the main theme. It's to the extent that the game's best moments take place in the absence of music; rather than having it emphasize the current events in the story, which is a shame.   One playthrough, of which there are three, took me about 4 hours. A decent length, but regardless felt a bit on the short side. I didn't really mind since the game was strong and never overstayed its welcome, but if you're looking for a really long and deep story, don't come here. What's here is a short yet sweet visual novel. Although not really educational or informative for anybody looking to travel to Japan, it's still enjoyable and a good play.   Of course, visuals novles are not everybody's cup of tea, and I'm not just talking about the 18+ ero ones either, but as a whole, some people like them and others don't. If you're considering getting into the genre, this would be a decent start if you can get past the inital parts of the game. If it's a bit too 'cute' for you (as it almost was for me) then there are lots of other great VNs out there to try as well, so don't let this one form your opinion too much on the genre. Despite some missed opportunities, it was still an enjoyable experience and one I would recommend.",

All right, to lay off the hamfisted poeticisms, this is a pretty sweet little vn that's worth the money it asks for. It does nothing revolutionary. It sticks to the tried and true paths sometimes even to its detriment (it lambasting common tropes only comes off as kind of cringey). But, the important thing is that it very successfully gets you to care for the three main ladies. In that sense, when it throws things at you (even if you may have seen them coming) you cannot help but feel, and feel terribly.   In short, prepare your ♥♥♥ for a feels trip.  (slight spoilers ahead)  For my own part, I adored Sakura the most. She claims she's an otaku, but I see in her a more general archetype of which I am a part as well: a lover of stories. In particular, someone who learned many important life lessons from those stories. I instantly felt a huge connection with her for this reason, and as such was hooked for every twist the game would throw at me. My thinking the past couple of days has been filled with thoughts onn the gaps that the story leaves (intentionally and not to is detriment) and thinking about how I would handle things (as opposed to the nice guy weeaboo we're meant to insert ourselves into).  So yes, definitely worth the money. Do recommend.",

You play as a guy that goes to Japan for 2 months through a student exchange program. When you arrive you live with 3 girls all with very different personalities. Through the VN you get to learn all of their stories and go around Japan with them. It's very cute, well paced and WONDERFULLY animated. It's very similar to Nekopara. It's not static images, it's animated models with voice acting. It looks amazing! I can't reccommend this one enough. It's not pervy nor is it very childish. It's a nice slice of life story. I loved it far more than any 23 year old male should have. I should also note that one route took 3 hours, If I had to guess all 3 would take around 5 (6 if you're a slow reader).  Other things to note:  -Not Kinetic. About 7 or 8 choices that will shape which path you go down during the game  -May die from the cuteness that is Karin-Chan.  -Probably not the best for those above the age of 25-30. Even that's pushing it. Ya might feel a bit creepy trying to conquer high school girls at that point EVEN IF THEY ARE EFFIN CUTE! &lt;3",

The game is fully voice-acted as well. All of these things are a major plus for me in a VN.  The three girls all have a very different personality and getting to know them was interesting. I finished all three routes myself, and I liked all three of the stories.  The music is pretty nice too, matches the moods in the game, and the theme song is upbeat and cute.
