With very little knowledge or understanding in how computers work I was able to get every achievement in only a short amount of time. EVGA has truly outdone themselves with this software, it is so easy to use that you can bring high voltage over clocked fun into the real world with an amazing array of sensory stimulation. To increase the amount of power that goes to the GPU I made sure to set my fan speed to 10%, this way no electricity would be wasted on powering useless peripherals. From loud grinding to high pitched hissing and screeching and the eventual flash of lights, sparks, and smoke it was an exceptional experience.   If you are like me and like to get the most out of your hardware and Steam experience this is the program for you.",

I recommend this to the very few that except the price. Now that I take no blame for this tool . I can say this one rocks its the masterblaster. The end all be all.

MSI's Afterburner is a great overclocking program but...I've had it crash a few times with these wierd sudden spikes in the info screen, nine digit numbers for temps and fan speeds. @.@. Enter Precision X, its based on the same Rivatuner foundation as Afterburner, and it lets me have a /real/ fancurve not the  simple steps that OC Guru II makes you use. Also, it doesn't have those crashes Afterburner has given me. PrecisionX 16 will give you all the functionality of Afterburner as well. As with any overclocking software there is a learning curve and you should take your time to understand it and do your oc right. If your here using steam though I can't reccomend this enough. Oh! Those 'achievements'? Thats a joke. Fuggedaboutit! =D  Update: I stand by this review with the new X OC version, it has more bells and whistles for the 1000 series of cards but still works great with all other cards.",

MSI Afterburner is better, but I've personally got used to this interface so, yeah. It does what it is supposed to do, but if you have never overclocked with this tool, get a friend who has (successfully) overclocked with this tool, or take a tutorial online. You can burn down your house, but I'll tell you what to look out for, so you (maybe) won't.  What you will need to know: -The safe voltage for your graphics card -Your actual graphics card -How many fans in your comp you have -How hot does your comp get? (here you will have to change the fan speed)  Look out for graphic errors, and if there are any, lower your voltage.   btw im not taking responsibility for your comp, these are just some tips.",

I've already read reports of users ruining their graphics cards due to chasing achievements associated with this software (a rather silly feature).   Second, many reviews are stating that a con of this particular steam version is that it requires steam to be running simultaneosly with the software. This isn't worded clearly though. Here is a direct quote from the EVGA website, from their FAQ regarding this software:  'Q. Does EVGA Precision X need to be running in the background to set clockspeeds and settings? A. No, EVGA Precision does not need to be running, just make sure to select the Apply button before exiting.'  So, while it's true that steam needs to be running simultaneously in order for the actual software to be running, neither have to be running in order for any changes/tweaks you've made to be in effect.  Overall I don't recommend this product on steam, because it's not user-friendly enough for the people using steam. The achievements should be removed, and the FAQ should be posted in the steam description.",

Firstly the steam achievements encourage you to overclock your hardware to reach certain points to unlock achievements rather than encouraging safe overclocking practices. I would hate for someone to OC their hardware for a steam achievement just to end up damaging their GPU. Secondly while using the tools to test overclocks on my monitor I discovered each time I tested an overclock setting Precision X was writing a new resolution profile into my monitor drivers with no way of removing it. This ended up causing issues for me when trying to set up custom resolutions using nvidia control panel later.",

Running the game first then starting EVGA-X is not an acceptable solution if, like many others you have custom fan controls or play games not on steam.
