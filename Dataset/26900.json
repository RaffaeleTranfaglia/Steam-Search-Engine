            "review_text": "Crayon Physics Deluxe is a fun little indie game that, at its basic level, is a physics puzzler. You're goal is to guide a ball towards little stars placed around the play area. To get to the stars you draw various shapes that perform different jobs to move you towards your goal. You can make bridges, hammers, golf clubs, and even create chain devices to move pieces around. Even uniteligable squiggles can have purpose! It's rather fun, but extremely casual, not that there's anything wrong with that. I'd recommend this game for children or for use in an educational setting. If you're looking for a puzzler to kill time with there are many better alternatives on Steam; however, if you have a mobile device or tablet capable of playing this game I would highly recommend you play this game on such a platform. The drawing mechanics seem to be made for touch controls and that's where this casual game with an educational / emphasis on younger players really shines. I could easily see myself sitting down with a toddler and playing this with them on a tablet, and I really believe that's what this game was made for. At least in the beginning - later on the puzzles get pretty hard so if the game mechanics really draw you in you can find additional depth for this game. Unfortunately, I got bored of it after a little while and even though they threw in unique features such as rockets to move objects I didn't see the need to continue. I got the gist of what the author was trying to convey and enjoyed the game for what it was already without having to force myself through puzzles that I found uninteresting. Perhaps I just lacked the imagination to see a solution but towards the end I had no idea what to do. At the start, however, this game is a shining example of teaching the player to play as they play, with handy on-screen instructions and logical puzzles that utilize new mechanics that you've just learned.  Pros: Fun, casual game Unique mechanics Works great on a mobile platform Teaches the player while you play Level Editor and free Downloadable Player Content adds endless 'fun' if you feel like digging through maps for good releases  Cons: Uses up its gimmick rather quickly Perhaps I lack imagination, but some of the harder puzzles didn't give any hints on what to do - it was just a blank screen with a star floating somewhere for example  This is a nifty little game that's pretty gimmicky but does what it tries to do pretty well. I'd recommend it for a casual gamer or as an educational game, especially on a mobile platform. If you're looking for a serious puzzler I'd look elsewhere (especially on the computer) but if you enjoy the mechanics this game does offer depth if you continue with it. B",

            "review_text": "Crayon Physics isn't a BAD game, it's just not one that I can really recommend. The pricipal mechanic (drawing objects that help a ball get from Point A to Point B) is novel at first, but quickly grows repetitive.  You'd think a game like this would reward creativity, but it's really just a victim of its own flexibility. Instead of coming up with clever or elegant solutions, you're heavily incentivized to draw crude, formless objects that fling or nudge the ball in the right direction until you eventually do something that achieves your goal. The game gets difficult at times, but you never feel like you're being forced to think much; it's just that moving the ball from one place to another is so unwieldy that it's hard to implement a real solution. In fact, I'm pretty sure that even the creator didn't have elgant solutions in mind for some of these puzzles. Every once in a while you'll do something neat that feels rewarding, but it's a very rare occurrence.  Weirdly, the game actually feels like it's a little too long. You're introduced to a couple of new mechanics along the way, but by the end of the game all of the puzzles start to feel the same. There's actually really not much you can do with the engine, so it's not long before the game gets stale. In the end, it doesn't feel much like a physics sandbox at all. I finished the game, but I didn't want to; I'm just a completionist.  If this game were $5, then yeah it might be worth picking up for a plane ride or to play with your kids. In fact this game probably gets a bit more fun if multiple people are 'playing' it together at once, huddled around the screen. But at $20, I really can't recommend this at all.",

It brings new life to the classic Crayon and how you use them. The physics in the games are great and you need to understand how to use physics to solve the puzzles.
