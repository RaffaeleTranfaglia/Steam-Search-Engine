            "review_text": "My God! It has been 15 years since Michael, the Shadow Man, took up arms to fight the so-called Five (a group of serial killers) in order to stop Armageddon from happening. Back then it was a rather interesting concept - travelling from the living world to the dead and vica versa, if need be. Emphasis was on the latter (Deadside) as Mike's powers did not work during the day.  This is a horror game - Deadside has blood instead of water when it comes to the rivers and you fight zombies and all kinds of demons. You walk on the corridors of an asylum that certainly gives everybody the creeps.  It is my understanding that the game is based on a comic book with the same title. I do not know how well this was adapted but I certainly remember this game as a classic. It was creepy and it was haunting me for days.  It was also difficult not like today's casual games. Beside the fight there were puzzle solving tasks, as well. I downloaded and installed it not long ago and was positively surprised to see it running quite well via Steam.  The game, unfortunately, did not age well (in fact, it looks quite ugly compared to today's games) but if you can see it as a 15 year old software and you have all the time in the world and nothing else to play you can easily purchase this classic.   I heard there was a sequel which was never released on PC but that is another story.",

            "review_text": "I grew up with the N64 version of this game long ago. Unfortunatly, I was never able to beat it because my N64 memory card corrupted. I see the PC version has a lot more in it. More enemies, more secrets, and maybe it's just spots I missed or don't remember, but it seems like there's more areas too. While exploring deadside, I found a few spots that just didn't look familiar at all. The quality is a lot better too. The default controls are a little crappy, but they can be changed. This game has many many hours of gameplay to it, especailly if you want to find all of the dark souls and secrets.  The gameplay itself is kind of like a cross between Tomb Raider and The Legend of Zelda. The platforming and controls being like Tomb Raider as you explore open environments, finding items and going through dungeons.  This is one of those really good games that nobody really ever knew about. It's more than worth the $5 and a great game to check out.",

While confusing as to where to go next sometimes, it makes up for it in the atmosphere and level designs - each uniquely crafted and different....and all scary and unnerving. This game does not hold your hand in any way so if you expect and need to be lead along by a leash don't play this.  If you want a challenge this is the game for you.",

And now i have purchased it on the pc via steam. I have no regrets of any of those purchases. Its a great game with an interesting story with a ton of plot twists, Its an older game but i feel it has aged well compared to some other games out there. The dialogue in this game is hilarious at times and down right creepy at other times. Really wish there were more games like shadowman out there.",

In hell meanders'll face hordes of psychopathic monsters that are in defense of wicked souls, collected and locked in govi to be exploited as a weapon of destruction. Indeed, they are immortal. Shadowman is the only person who can travel between the worlds of the living and the world of the dead. He will face the mysteries and horrors, evolving into strength and magic, solving puzzles and facing increasingly difficult challenges. You will be able to follow it? You'll be able to not die of fright? The fate of the world depends on Shadowman but especially yourself. ps: although of steam appears that I played little, in fact, when it came out in 1999 I played there a lot of PCs, replayed at least 4 times and each time I discovered something that I had missed the previous times  In italian tetro, oscuro, infinito. Shadowman ti trascina nell'orrore più profondo. Nei meandri dell'inferno dovrai affrontare orde di mostri psicopatici che sono a difesa di anime prave, raccolte e rinchiuse nei govi per essere sfruttate come arma di distruzione. Esse infatti sono immortali. Shadowman è l'unica persona che può viaggiare tra il mondo dei vivi e il mondo dei morti. Egli affronterà misteri e orrori, evolvendo in forza e magia, risolvendo enigmi e affrontando prove sempre più difficili. Sarai capace di seguirlo? Sarai capace di non morire di paura? Il destino del mondo dipende da Shadowman ma soprattutto da te. ps: anche se su steam compare che l'ho giocato poco, in realtà, quando uscì nel 1999 ci giocai moltissimo su PC, rigiocato almeno 4 volte ed ogni volta scoprivo qualcosa che mi ero perso le volte precedenti :)",

Have also tried all the recommended patches and fixes. Looking at the forums, I'm not the only one having problems with the Steam version of Shadowman. Steam needs to offer the 30 day money back gaurantee on older games like the GOG website.",
