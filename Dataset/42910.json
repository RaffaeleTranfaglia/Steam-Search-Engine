            "review_text": "Updated Review.  One of the most fun spellcasting systems I have ever seen! Knowing what to cast in what situation has never been more satisfying. The concept itself of combining elements to make spells had me sold, and the game itself managed to value that potential.   The freedom of doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want whenever you want is amazing. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mana bars. No crappy skill trees. No cooldowns. Pure, unaltered, raw power, scaled with your skill level. Some DBZ style ♥♥♥♥ here.  There are downsides though: - arrowhead did one of the crappiest netcodes in existence. Crashes happen. Connections don't. Hosting doesn't work most of the time. Multiplayer is such an amazing experience, be it Adventure, Challenge or Versus and crap like this stands in the way. If you can overlook that, this game is easily a 88/100, but with the crappy 1998 multiplayer, the score is rightfully dragged down to 74. - latency in this game is on steroids for some reasons, probably bad optimization - too few people play, and because of the crappy matchmaking system you need to know people's numbers and have friends that play - they pump out a ton of DLCs, something that I hate on principle - the devs aren't really fixing much. They're adding more stuff and grabbing lodsemoneh - limited to a max of 4 players per game (and I think having way more would've been so much fun; game is not made for this)  The PROS: - the combinations you can do with those 8 elements is mindblowing - so much fun in all 3 modes: Adventure, Challenge and especially Versus if you are at a high skill level and monsters are too weak - skill level can be INSANE. One guy can take out 100 other wizards and 1000 mobs, without getting a scratch. - single player is a lot of fun: comedic story, fun missions, DLCs aren't bad, they're just short - various robes you can put on, with various abilities - at high levels of play, the PVP aspect is balanced, but at low-med levels, you can spam a few spells and always win since people don't know how to counter them - Versus mode is LODSA fun at high skill levels - huge skill roof - great physics and offense-defense mechanics - intuitive effects of your spells  I recommend it a lot, especially if it's on sale. About the DLCs? I'm not sure. Having the base game is enough imo, the DLCs are really worth it for the extra robes that you can have fun with.  GET YER ROBES ON",

That said, I suppose it might just have been better that they didn't try to make this serious.  Nevertheless, with my complaints aside, Magicka manages to make any group of friends have loads of fun for as long as the story lasts, and the whole element combination system is really, really amusing to use, moreover with other people to do it with. I can't praise the comic relief 'plot' or the presentation much, but for what it's worth, I don't really regret buying it!",

This game makes you create plans and adapt to what kind aof fighter you want to be, ie what spells your want to use. But the thing is its very hard to do that becasue you want to use them all.   This game is brilliant for how it makes the player think. There are hundreds of combinations of spells and enchantments, it makes you experiment and train yourself for combat with your new discoveries. And after every little skirmish you will fell satisfied, because you taught yourself new techniques that make you stronger in battle.   It also teaches you to be more precise with your inputs as the enemies play more aggressive, which would be bad in other games but not this one, the dragon shout of a right click allows you to blast back any foe that gets to close to a comfortable distance where you can quickly recuperate and put in the inputs you want in order to defeat it.   No matter what, enjoyment will be had. Whether it is from the story humor, the classic video game reference humor, or the satisfaction of walking away from the battlezone as the victor and getting excited for when the next challenge approaches.

Magicka offers you a great deal of spell combination,a lot of customization and tons of enemies to kill! I feel like Magicka has too many DLCs but the game itself has a lot of content already.  As a singleplayer game...it's kinda boring after awhile.It's the Multiplayer aspect of it that makes it a great game.It is a okey-ish experience as a singleplayer game but I really feel that it was built as a multiplayer.  Magicka is a fun experience either way and you should at least try the base game.",

This game is fun with friends and alone, especially given how easy it is to hit your friends with a bit of 'friendly' fire... and or accidentally kill yourself. There are also a few special spells that can be learned via items found, these spells require the combination and are then executed with a button press. Such as reviving one of your friends who you probably just blew up a moment ago...  I think it's got lots of replay value, the story is cute and funny with tons of references to the genre. The game is in and of itself a bit of a parody.   I personally don't have any issues or criticisms of the game, it's not perfect, but the quirks are all part of its charm. I would recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humour, especially if you have some knowledge about other games in similar genres. It's especially fun with a group of friends (up to 4) but is still very entertaining on your own. I personally found it pretty additive.  ",

The game suffers from a lack of control, gratiuitous amounts of bugs, and non-wizard characters. The problem is that Magicka plays like a weak beat-em up. Wizards run around and beat up non-player non-wizard non-characters, eg: wizard. but instead of fast pased action filled wizard baised action baised fast pased wizard wizard combat, we get something less.

It's the kind of game with a Vietnam expansion where you use a M60 on goblins. Awkwardness of that expansion aside, this is a rather geeky parody of the RPG genre, in the vein of games like Munchkin that find humor in the genre itself. It's also in Swedish, which gives it an unusual feel.   The game features a unique magic system, in which eight elements are used in combinations that create spells. Combining some elements create new elements (such as fire and water making steam), while others cancel each other out. Learning the combinations that create spells is the key to the game, and it becomes vital to learn to enter them quickly. While the game can be played with a gamepad, a keyboard and mouse are more effective because they allow faster entry of spells. Up to four players can play in co-op.",

I found the game to be (mostly) bug-free and quite enjoyable, with the only serious issue being multiplayer is absolutely lacking players and those that do play tend to have agonizingly high ping (European and South American players maybe!?). The single player is a good experience and worth the price of entry, yet entirely too short. Note that ALL of the DLC is for multiplayer, which is basically unpopulated. Shame really. One thumb up, two if there were more people playing multiplayer.  A month later, and I'm still playing this game almost obsessively. The reason: Challenges. SINGLE PLAYER challenges, because multiplayer is still as crappy as it has ever been - i.e. non-existant. Most players / servers have +300 ping and quit all the time. This game needs drop-in play like Mario needs a jump button, but it doesn't have it. The combination of spells and enemies makes the single-player challenges a worthwhile time-waster, so I keep playing. If only the makers would fix multiplayer, this game would be a 10/10 indie game. Otherwise, even as cheap as it is right now (75% off on Steam), it's still only one thumb up and one way, way down. Single player only for the time being, even during the free-to-play weekend.",

I got the game and the DLC free from the group   AccidentallyReviewed  , go check them out, they give 100s of free keys away, no trading or anything stupid like that; this isn't the first game I've gotten free.   PROs -     Unique battle system.    Nearly every spell can merge with another to make fights range in difficulty, and can give you a combo for each scenario.    Spells can also combine to cast different powers on yourself, such as revival or haste.    Multiple characters to play as, such as the Reddit alien (my personal favourite)    Each character has an ability custom to them, which can change when picking up a new weapon/staff.    New combos to try out as you progress!    A hilarious and intricate story, which genuinely gets you interested.   CONs -     Barely any customization in settings for low-end computers, leaving 'meh' computers at 9/10 frames.    Controls are not easy to master, and if you need to spam heal, you may accidentally Reviewed  use your staff's ability, which can end up putting you at a disadvantage and possibly making you loose.    Barely any times you can save. After some deaths you may have to go really far to get back to where you were, as most/all of the saving in the game is automatic, and all enemies will be back, meaning you'll end up spending hours on small areas.    Hordes of enemies get boring, as they're all the same. Once you find their weakness, it'll be way too easy to get through.    Lots of running then shooting has been involved so far, and it gets pretty boring. Battles need to be more diverse.   All in all, despite the flaws, I have enjoyed Magicka greatly. I'm sure to finish it, and then buy/play the sequel. I rate it 8.3/10.     Danke again to   AccidentallyReviewed  , the game + it's dlc came to quite a lot of money, and I got it free.  ",

Unlike some other games, adding more than one other player can actually make the game harder rather than easier as it is very easy to loose track of / kill your teammates. The good news is that bringing them back to life is just three button clicks away.  The main game revolves around casting spells via summoning 8 different elements. The combination of elements summoned determines what spell is cast. This leads to a lot of button pressing and trying to remember what does what. Some of the fun though is in accidently casting something that works out brilliantly. There are also fixed Magicks (spells) that can be cast by summoning a certain combination of elements in addition to the normal spell system. Overall this end up being a lot of fun though it can get frusterating when your fat fingers can't seem to get the spell you want to cast off correctly, or you drop a boulder on your own head.  In the end, the storylines jokes and humorous references to other games and pop culture and the overall fun of the magic system trump any frusterations and I'd highly recommend this game.

MANY nods to many famous nerd moments, from the recent 300 kick(literally) of 'THIS IS SPARTA!', Captain Kirk's famous yell of 'KAHN!', to having pet Beholders. The whole element system is awesome to use, although frost is used too much from what I've seen. Need more fire, and lightning out the ♥♥♥. And a certain 'melee' weapon is over-powered, and only fun when in single player. There is always SOMEONE who wants to kill you for it. And will keep on killing you if you kill them to get it back. So, the real fun factor on this game, in multiplayer, matters more on who you're playing with.",

The bugs that crippled the game early on are fixed now and it's time to put on your wizard robe &amp; hat. Be warned: the single-player game does have a bit of an initial learning curve and is challenging even on the tutorial level. Once you get used to the control scheme for casting spells, though, you'll be having too much fun turning goblins &amp; beastmen into chunky gib salsa to notice. Where this game shines, though, is in the multiplayer modes: Online Adventure (read: Co-op), Survival, Arena &amp; PvP modes provide variety and the frenetic pace of dodging enemies (and often, your own teammates' attacks) makes for a great, quick multiplayer experience. The base game is a good deal at $9.99, but catch the Complete Pack on sale if you can, since the Vietnam and Marshlands DLC's extend the game with new missions &amp; stories. Great, addicting game - I give it 9/10.",

            "review_text": "I didn't quite know what to expect from Magicka when I first went in. By the time I took the plunge, a friend had already bought it, the Vietnam pack had been released, and I was - and still am - doggedly determined not to buy any fantasy games. It didn't take long after I dove into its wizard-ravaged, cheese-engorged, napalm-slathered world of chaos and insanity that I came to a very sound conclusion; Magicka is easily one of the best games I've ever played.  The hectic and accident-prone flow of the game is quite easily its biggest draws to me. A finger off by a key can turn a powerful death ray into a disappointing puff of steam or an ill-advised fireball into a mercifully harmless pebble. A slight miscalculation in conjuring a lightning bolt could very well result in a puddle of blood where your friend used to be instead of the warlock you had meant to strike.  Despite the potential tragedy waiting in each of the many, many ways a wizard can go wrong, mistakes are part of the fun. In keeping with its story and atmosphere, Magicka has been the subject of comedic timing again and again. Lightning bolts, crossed beams, and black holes have all been followed by 'whoops' from careless wizards and unfortunate bystanders alike. With how surprisingly fair and balanced this tornado of a game is, someone's always to blame - and, usually, with a giggle instead of a glare.  Lightning storms and meteor showers aside, Magicka, as said before, is unusually well-balanced for a game of its nature. Whenever a mistake or tragedy happens, it is a learning opportunity. All enemies have their strengths and weaknesses, all magickal elements have their roles, and nothing is a perfect solution to everything. There are no random damage values, no arbitrary restrictions on spells, nor guarantees of the player's power - every fight is a test of your spellcasting knowledge and swiftness with many potential solutions.  Knowledge is power in Magicka and a creative mind will trump a quick finger more times than not. As a wizard, you have at your disposal a tidy number of elements that can all be combined and exchanged in nearly limitless combinations. From electrified steam jets to fiery rock walls, from arcane ice shards to healing frost beams, there is always something new to try out, one way or another.  One of the things that shined in my time playing Magicka was its charm. The game, its story, its world, and its atmosphere have no intention - and likely never will have any real intention - of trying to enthrall the player with serious tones and deep plots. Instead, it treats you with borderline insane characters, comical gibberish voice-overs, and many opportunities to kill goblins and orcs with an M60 machine gun. The story it does deliver, while not fundamentally comedic, is often the chariot of its rainbow of jokes, some of which are even major plot points.  Unfortunately, nothing is ever perfect and Magicka is no exception. Despite all its offerings, many have fought long and hard just to get the game to work. Its technical difficulties are the stuff of legend and unluckily overshadow its strengths for more than just a handful of buyers. Be sure that the game will run before you consider picking it up or it may well end up the best game you never played - and, even then, be ready for a bumpy ride even if it works.  All in all, however, I share the opinion of my fellow moon wizard, Melonious Monk. Magicka is a fun, interesting experience with variety, charm, and a complete disregard for physics. If you've bought this game  (and managed to get it running) , you didn't pay enough for it. If you haven't bought it  (and can actually run it) , why haven't you bought it yet?",

I recommend playing with at least one more person since the game experience is easier, much funnier and more enjoyable with more people playing.

This game is FUN!!  Whilst it is fun, it is also the most FRUSTRATING and ANNOYING game I have played to date. It goes from being a casual easy indie title to having a dificulty curve of a square angle. I can put this entirely down to two reasons. The first is level design and enemies with knockback. You will absolutely discover what I mean about 4 hours in. The second is the fact that I play with a gamepad. It is fully supported in game (and is actually quite clever) but makes the game 700% harder. Do yourself a favour and play with the keyboard.   Those faults aside, the mechanics, story and music are fantastic and I just generally had a great time with Magicka! It made me laugh and then throw my controller through the wall.  6/10",

( This game doesn't like when you Alt + Tab either. )  There is quite a bit of DLC for the game as well, but most of them are quite short and probably not worth the money, in my opinion. The base game consists of 12 chapters, while the longest DLC ( The Stars are Left ) contains three.  There was much fun and laughter while playing with my friends.

In addition, there are lots of wizard robes to choose from to further specialize your character to your magick preferences.   What's interesting about this game is you have all the magick at your disposal from the start. Becoming more powerful happens intuitively as you gain more experience with the magick system and learn what spells work best in different scenarios. There is no stats or leveling system. The only form of character customization comes from choosing different wizard robes and equipping different wizard staffs and melee weapons, which each have their own flavour of effects. For example, the Electrorobe makes you be healed by lightning spells, but in turn you become more vulnerable to water and earth damage.  I will give warning: I played this game exclusively with a friend over 40 hours. Throughout this time we experienced  countless  bugs and crashes - while most of these can be considered minor, several times while playing one of us would crash and we would have to restart the campaign. In addition, occasionally while playing latency would become an issue.  For achievement hunters looking to 100% this game, note that 3 particular DLC (Stars are Left, Dungeons and Daemor, Dungeons and Gargoyles) can be challenging to complete on their hard mode without any deaths. They require practice, dedication, and use of specific strategies using a variety of spell combos you'll come to learn.   If you purchase this game, I recommend you purchase Magicka Collection when it is on sale. The collection includes all the DLC which has a fair amount of new content after you complete the main campaign, as well as a variety of robes that really add some cool customization to the game and several pieces of DLC.  I would recommend you purchase this game if you have at least 1 friend to play it with and are a fan of Action RPGs.   Reviewer Stats : 43 hours played as of review | 88/88 Achievements",

Probably because the game is poorly optimized and buggy. That makes the combat with the spell system hard and frustrating at times. And that too bad because this concept has a lot of potential.

However, what can be observed, most prominently in multiplayer, are game breaking glitches and terrible optimization that makes gameplay frustrating, accompanied by a shallow and obvious plot. In this sense, no one should be recommended to play this game.  This game makes it clear that its developers completely neglected the testing and bug squashing phases. Frequent game crashes, often when minimizing the window or loading stages, are followed by camera glitches and unbearable lag that render the game experience frustrating and not worth the stress. All of these problems are extremely pertinent in multiplayer and chances that you'll come accross them are very high. The game can glitch over ten times in a matter of seconds, most notably at Chapter 6 and onwards, where the game becomes unplayable due to how much the camera can glitch. The game is riddled with performance issues, even when running on bleeding edge computer hardware. The multiplayer lag is aggravating: frequent desynchronization and spells that often don't work are common and present even when all of the players have less than ~50ms latency. Thereby, this game has an inability to provide a stable and enjoyable gameplay.  Although, if you're aware of every bug, it's possible to avoid some of the programming amateurism and try to complete the game, except it's difficult to gather any motivation to do such, as the campaign story does not compensate for the broken mechanics. The plot is obvious, full of inconsistencies and has almost no depth or sense to it. It's unclear whether it was meant to be a joke, but if it were, it wouldn't be funny. The evil magician is the villain and you have to fight him, and along the way you'll be participating in a lot of filler events that add next to nothing to the story; things that are just there to make the game drag on for more time, combined with minutes of listening to characters speak gibberish, because for some reason the devs decided that it would be a good idea for the book narrator to speak English, and the characters, Simlish. In conclusion, there is nothing interesting to it: everything in the story is clear from the start and no use of your wit is needed to figure anything out. And thus, the broken gameplay is followed by an uninteresting storyline, making an unholy combination and deducting major points for Magicka.  And still, with all these problems mentioned: instead of fixing all of the problems in order to deliver a quality game that lives up to today's standards, the developers decided that it would be a better idea to release thousands of DLCs, of which some contribute nothing to the game and others only to breaking the game even further. Facing this, it's difficult for me to recommend this game to anybody.  Avoid.",

Well, it is a unique cooperative gameplay experience, players can slaughter their team mates and revive them in a snap for more or you could actually play it the way it was supposed to. A drastic step away from what PC players would usually expect in terms of controls, an innovative combination system where the player can combine elements to create devastating spells.  But the game itself was released in such a broken, unplayable state that I could never entertain the thought of reinstalling it. Yet another sad example of how potential is ruined by sheer stupidity and laziness.",

Here you have fireman's robes that give you +20% fire resistance but -20% something else. It's boring! Where are my cool weapons? Crossbows, Machine guns, Lightsabers? Nope, you again have your boring weapons that have boring small bonuses. The game is small there are way less levels and the levels are way less varied and crazy. I've been in Mexican hell and ancient dwarven ruins in Magicka 1 but here - forests and the castle from the previous game. There wasn't much more than that. The game is short has a few more mechanics (not too many though), has less than 30% the amount of magicks the previous one had and you are really limited by stupid things such as focus regeneration or spell nerfs. There is almost nothing that Magicka 1 didn't have but it's balanced which also means madly limited. I don't recommend buying it for more than the price of a Magicka 1 DLC.
