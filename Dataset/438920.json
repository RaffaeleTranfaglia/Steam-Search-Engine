            "review_text": "This isn't actually F2P, it's a small sample of the full game which is actually full price.   However, the game itself is quite entertaining, and very easy to understand. I'm considering buying it, and likely would have already had the game not be marked in such a deceptive way.   Nonetheless, if you're a fan of strategy games, you'll likely enjoy it, which is why I'm recommending it.  EDIT: It looks like they changed it from 'free to play' to 'play the demo'. Good on them, and it's good to see that they're listening to the people playing their game.",

The game does NOT claim to be free-to-play! It requires a one-time payment to unlock the full contents after the first mission, and that's what it says it does!  It is categorized in Steam's free-to-play section because that is the only place where its intended business model could be implemented: pay once, and unlock the game on all systems.  Why not think twice before throwing some hissy fit of anger and undermining an otherwise good game, in which it is apparent that a lot of effort has been spent?",

I'll surely keep it around and perhaps purchase it at some point when my payment arrives. Keep up the good work developers, and please don't turn this into a cash grab through the micro transactions - cause I love the style and concept of the game, a lot.",

            "review_text": "Hail lords and Ladies   This game is amazing and I encourage you all to install the demo play through the campaigns and then get in on some multiplayer fun.  At first glimse it looks and feels mostly like playing Risk with more depth. At first the learning curve may appear to be overwhelming but trust me if you take the time to play through the free demo you will soon get the jist of things fairly fast.  There is alot of really good things to say about this game and its definately a step forward for those strategy game lovers who are wanting something casual but competitive at the same time.  Pros   PLenty of depth a great feel and easy to get use to when handling your heroes and troops. Great community which is slowly growing and in time will provide for a solid multiplayer base. Gameplay is solid and at this point is well polished and very playable with few bugs to note. Multiplayer is where this game starts to really shine community and players fight battles and create for epic games. Devs are involved with the community and are supportive.  Cons  Combat can be tough for new players as you get your huge forces wiped by more seasoned players... however ask them why you got wiped ive seen the veterans explain how the combat lines work and most players are really helpful and will give you tips on how to improve.  Sales alot of people have had trouble purchasing this game during the summer sale myself included. the devs have promised to rectify this in the coming days so please no more bad reviews on the sale the shop was broke and it in no way reflects the game itself however i know people like to see things working when you pay those dollar bills.  Lobby is not the best its hard to have good chats with people due to a pretty basic lobby. Players would like to be able to make a game and still advertise games for people to join while at the same time seeing who is actually active in a lobby. I suggest the devs take a look at this area becos in truth the lobby needs to feel like a tavern where people can chat in groups without disturbing everyone but also inviting enough so that new players can meet vets and ask questions. People hate waiting for a game to start with nothing to do so a lobby that is inviteing and gives players waiting would be a great idea to improve the building of a gaming community.   Matchmaking option would be cool where players can enter as a 2v2 1v1 3v 3 4v4 of course this will work better once we have 500 players looking for a game at present on a good night we have 10 -20 and most nights 4-10 the community is growing but like i said until the lobby is a good place to wait most will be afk    Buy the game it is def worth the moeny and the replayablilty is spot on.  Would love to see a toolset version of this game so players can make user created maps and units   then we can get a civ type or game of thrones mod going and avoid all the red tape.. . Just like lord of the rings total war and crusader kings game of thrones mod ... I definately believe that the strategy community would just go nuts on this game with the ability to mod like other games. User created content is definately the future for strategy gamers as those games which have generated this have sold far better then most other games.  Hope to see you on the battlefield  ",

I have no problems with dynamically generated maps but getting to play on these is a treat with intelligent, interesting and challenging layouts across many, many different maps.",

The use of heroes makes this game something like a combination between Risk, Heroes of Might and Magic, and WarCraft 3. The multiplayer is quite good and it is very fast paced. A single game doesn't take very long, and can be resolved within 20 minutes or so. It supports up to eight players, so diplomacy plays a bigger role in bigger games.",
