            "review_text": "I'll be honest, the description and reviews of this game are terrible. I'm going to try to describe it properly. Ignore absolutely EVERYTHING else you have read about the game, including the official description.  I don't know who Fork Parker is at all and you don't have to either. He's a crotchety looking bald guy in a suit who has to climb a mountain and will probably die a lot, but has loads of checkpoints along the way and infinite lives. Yep, it's an indie platformer.  But wait, wait, wait. There's a gimmick here and it's actually quite clever. Fork can shoot pitons. Wherever they land, a rope will immediately connect the two pitons, up to about three ropes. He slides along these ropes with his cane, so momentum along the ropes is important to consider even though you can jump jump jump to climb a downward facing rope.   So you are making your own platforms generally. And it's good fun too.  The game is about an hour and a half long, with speedrunning, no death, full collection achievements out there. It's quick, to the point, and good fun, so replayability is solid. The difficulty curve is slow and steady, but it definitely ends tougher than it begins. At the base of the mountain you can climb without even firing a piton and toward the top everything is spikes so you are leaping from rope to rope.  The controls aren't perfect. The rope sliding physics are a bit irritating, but for the most part it is a fun game. It is definitely worth your time.",

I stopped by -100.000. Maybe you can enjoy this game if you really learn the Controlls, but I simply think its unfunny.   I mean, it's free.
