I really hope this gets more work, the original was so well done that this is just nothing be disappointing at this point.  I will change my review if the game is improved.",

            "review_text": "I wish I could un-buy this one. I figured I'd give it some time to work out the bugs, only to find out they will never be fixed. By then, I tried to get my money back but was told that too much time had expired since the original purchase.   - Nothing works. - No sound. - Full of bugs. - Unplayable. - Not Fun.  That pretty much sums up how much this game sucks and how much the devs suck right along with it. Next time, finish a game if you're going to sell it, even if it's on early access. If I could vote 1000 times on how much this game sucks, it wouldn't be enough.",

            "review_text": "Worth every penny. 3D Works. I updated my Windows drivers and I recently randomly gave the 3D mode a shot and it worked! Update your Windows Drivers and then give the 3D a shot. My rig is a Windows 10 Surface outputted to a 60 inch TV display. I took offscreen screen shots with my Iphone and uploaded the shots to my Artwork section if you want to see them! The 3D looks very good actually! I noticed some after effects and HDR that I did not know this game even had. Just update your Windows drivers for your video card and take another look. As far as the rest of the game goes - I figured out what worked and what didnt work. I was able to build a winning team built on the Run Game and Defense. I figured out that you can actually sign Free Agents after the first week of Pre Season games. I was able to replenish my roster every season to more then 53 players. I didnt have to sign my draft picks. I just abused the FA after that first pre-season game and then built my roster that way. My winning strategy was Pro Set balanced attack offense with Weekly Meetings held with my best HB every week - that gave him bonuses going into the games. My HB would have 275 yard rushing games. My defense was a Multiple Formation Set and built on balance and held 3 Scrimmages every week on all defensive formations. I beat the number one offensive team in the Championship game. The old adage - Defense wins championships holds true again! Fun game. Its not stupid Madden. I would highly recommend this game for those of you looking to GM and Strategize your way to building a winner! Check my Public Artwork in My Profile to see my Screenshots proving that I did in fact play this game and did this.",
