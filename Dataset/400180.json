I reccomend Okhlos if you like pikmin or rogue-likes. I honestly don't have much else to say about Okhlos except that I'm very much enjoying my time with it. By the way I got to the Final boss and the game crashed so that sucks.",

            "review_text": "Very funny and original gameplay. Strategy, role-playing, I am not sure how to tag this one. Graphics are really cool and 16 bit inspired, which is almost always a plus for me. Texts are smart and amusing, and there's a lot to learn from ancient Greece and if you already know, it'll be fun to go over it again during the game. Control are a bit hard to learn at first but you get used to them quite fast. I'd recommend keyboard and mouse, but that's me (I am still learning the basics of gamepad gaming).  The GOOD: - Get rid of gods and rulers with this anarchist revolution simulator in the craddle of modern democracy. - Indie game, retro style. - Smart and original gameplay and concept. - You would think there is not much to do besides the basic movements, but you'll find a lot to improve and to learn exploring the game.  The BAD: - No cons so far.",

The developer was very responsive and helped me figure out how to fix the problem on my computer.  I am now able to play the game!  I played for about a half an hour last night and enjoyed what I've seen so far. The game can be pretty difficult but it does a good job of walking you through the basics to introduce you to the different mechanics.",
