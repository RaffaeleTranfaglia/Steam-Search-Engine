    "description": "Steel Eagle is a reference to the 80's and 90's shooters. Your task is to reach the landing pad at the end of the level, destroying as many enemy units as possible, for which you collect points that can be exchanged for force and strength, which allows you to upgrade your “Steel Eagle”.",
