I tried to enjoy this game and be able to go through.....but, it's really not working, I don't judge a book by it's cover, but the graphics don't take you to a good start, the controls are buggy, the hit detection is very faulty, till then I'm going to have to give a negative review, this game needs an urgent fix.",
