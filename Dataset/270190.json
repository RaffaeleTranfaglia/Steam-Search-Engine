    "description": "Soviet City is a city management game in a totalitarian economy. In Soviet City life is not the purpose, it is a resource - just like coal and food. The totalitarian machine needs to keep running and that is all it matters. This economy needs a leader that can master the art of terror.",

There is an amazing mysterious and strange climate , game is hard (in positive way) it don't give us too much tips (and it's good for me). It is creepy. Some could say art design is 'unfinished' or that arts looks like concept arts, for me this arts make untypical climate. As fan of adventure game and as indie developer I think this game is worth the purchase for every adventure game player or hopa player who likes horror/creepy games with interesting story. I wrote it after 40 minutes of play so I will update this review when I'll finish game. I hope it will give me hours of great fun and thinking :)",

Also great riddles and puzzles that really put to the test the player.  The story is intriguing but linear with a noir touch that never hurts. Keep it up!  And thanks to this great game, I missed one of those thrilling old-school games;)",

I would say it's only worth picking up if you are very patient, are interested in seeing more of the unique art style, and are willing to accept an abrupt and anticlimactic ending. Otherwise there are definitely much more rewarding horror/atmospheric point and clicks out there.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. The style, the atmosphere, the designs, all of the above roped me in immediately.   However the dev missed something important when they made 1heart: If your going to literally HIDE crucial parts of a puzzle in your game, make sure that there's a notification on your cursor indicating that something is interactable, otherwise you'll be wasting hours backtracking rooms and environments trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ to do.   This could be remedied by simply clicking on every ♥♥♥♥ing pixel in the game to find said puzzle pieces, but oh, that's right, the game doesn't allow that. By that, I mean that if you click in multiple places in fast increments, the screen will freak out and literally TELL you not to do that. It even forces you to stop whatever you're doing and not click on anything for 5 seconds until the game finally settles down so you can resume.  What sane person would think that any of these things are acceptable in a POINT-N-CLICK adventure game? I've never used guides for any puzzle games that i've played, but for this game it's a necessity if you want to progress in this game.  Unless you want to play a game of 'guess what the dev is thinking', go waste $10 elsewhere.",

Because if you are, then you're just as sick as me.'   No, I didn't enjoy it. And its not because you crossed a line. You're not a pioneer on this side of the line, buddy. It's so well traversed over here that the locals have already set up cheap tourist traps. No, this game is much much worse than shocking. It's boring.",

(For example, putting a random CD in a machine used to crush large objects, and then fitting its shattered pieces perfectly into a puzzle to disable a machine keeping you from a key item. The CD just HAPPENS to shatter into perfect little chunks to complete a man-made puzzle? Puh-leeze.) It was at that point I gave up on the game. I enjoy puzzle games, but this game is one where it is nearly impossible to progress without a walkthrough because the puzzles are so unrealistic.  That being said, I do enjoy the art style, and admit that it is at least visually pleasing.",
