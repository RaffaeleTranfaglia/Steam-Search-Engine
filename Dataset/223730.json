The challenges in this game ain't that easy to deal with even the boss fight need skills. There's also a time-trial level where you must race with time and you must not die. If you die you have to restart the level.  As an Indie Games Enthuasiast, I could say this game is a great platformer game.",

            "review_text": " Fly'n  is a beautiful game and in this context beautiful is referring to the visuals of the game. No matter how you look at the game and even if you don't like platformers you have to admit that the complete game is looking fantastic.  The story is told fast: A hairdryer called Dyer is attacking the world trees in order to rob their energy the 'Helys'. To prevent this, the world trees have created the buds to stop Dyer polluting the trees even more.   Fly'n  is a platformer. You are trying to reach the top of the different trees and fight the specific world boss there. Every world consist of 7 levels plus one boss level and three bonus level (exception is the last world with only one bonus level) so there is a lot to do and the game is gradually getting harder. You have four different buds and every bud has its own special ability. Fly'n can sing and activate the Helys and revive the inhibitants of Helica, Lyft can stick to any (unpolluted) surface and crawl on them, Ywok can transform to a ball and bounce around and Nyls can propel himself (up to three times). And all Buds can jump, double-jump and glide. You can not change the buds freely everywhere, only in the specific checkpoints which is a good thing because you don't have to think too much with whom you have to solve a specific part of the level. Additional to all the abilites the buds can also change between two visions which may make different parts of the level solid and/or accessible.  As for the difficulty: If you only try to reach the exit it should only need patience since you may die as often as you 'wish' and you will restart from the last checkpoint. But you should notice that the game has been tagged as 'hard' so keep that in mind. It may look cute but you need to know what you are doing. For those looking for a higher challenge there are different options: You may try to 'complete' the levels which means you explore more and collect all the Helys and pollen which are hidden. If you are still not satisfied you can try to play the levels without dying. And for the motivated there are the Leaderboards where you can compare your points to the rest of the playership.  All in all I think I can't recommand this game enough. I bought the game on release day and never regretted it. I put more than 100 hours into this game which says a lot. The buds are lovable and each world has a different beautiful design. If you like platformers you have little to no reason to not buy and play  Fly'n . All this is rounded up with a beautiful soundtrack which you can and should buy aswell.",

            "review_text": "Beautiful and challenging.  I've played a lot of 2D platformers and I can say that this one is unique and stimulating. You can play as 4 characters, each one with a different ability: one can activate objects and open ways, one can stick to surfaces, one can bounce and pass through lethal obstacles and one can dash in the air. Also, all of them have a dream ability that makes the level switch to an alternate 'dimension' where some objects appear and others disappear: jumping from one to another while switching repeatedly will require precision and reflexes, and in the last levels the game will get intense. Several levels are nonlinear and there's a bit of puzzle solving. There are many hidden collectibles and some bonus levels. The game lenght is 5-7 hours for just finishing the story and around 40 hours for completing it at 100%.  The art is gorgeous, the music is engaging and the style is charming. The story is very simple but cute and has imaginative characters.  The flaws of the game are the bouncing ability which is quite unpredictable and a few collectibles that are too hard to find or get (remember to notice the 'flowing sparkles').  I give it a 8.7/10.",

One needs to get used to the protagonists' special skills, but once you find out (and calm down :D) and catch the rhythm, it'll be more enjoyable and fun. When you've beaten the game, you can still replay several times to catch all the bonuses, save all the buddies or improve your playtime and you can also compare your results with others' worldwide.",

Not child oriented not adult oriented... just different but, lovely, cute, harmonic, colorfull environments and charcters. Music isn't a mess (like in most platformers) and, you are not stressed because your avatar wil inmediatelly die if you miss something. Has a DOWNLOADABLE DEMO so... just try it. Recommended to remove the stress over you.",
