            "review_text": "This is so close to being an amazing game that it causes me physical pain. It's that close, but there are a few crippling flaws that just ruin it. First, there's the combat. There are different ranks of creatures, one through four, one being weakest and four being most powerful. The problem with this is, after a certain point, anything below rank three will die in the first turn of battle because the enemy AI consists entirely of 'KILL WEAKEST CHARACTER'. The combat maps are tiny so forget any sort of strategy, mid and end game opponents can hit you anywhere you stand. Oh, and those opponents are almost always all one to nine monsters, plus nine to twelve wizards. There are three wizard types, and you will see up to a dozen in every single combat.  There are dragons in the game, and you can find them as random encounters. That isn't a problem. A single low level dragon can be beaten, but it's fairly tough unless you come loaded for end game critter hunting with high end, high level units. It's cool. You get an achievement. What isn't cool is that the dragons can spawn in groups of up to six, and all of them in the level 15 range. There might be worse groups out there, but this is literally what invaded one of my provinces in my current game. This isn't something you can fight. I also mean that Literally. You can not defeat these multiple dragon encounters. It isn't possible. You can build an arena in your home province and send heroes to battle in it to gain experience. Why am I mentioning this? because as soon as a hero reaches level ten, the enemy heroes you battle in the arena can also spawn with dragons as minions. It goes about as well as you'd expect.  On the plus side, your units can level up and improve their abilities, but it really doesn't matter, because a lvl 30 tier one unit will still be instagibbed by a lvl 1 tier four. And the upgrade system is utterly worthless as well. Why yes random number generator, I did want to improve my crossbowmans hand to hand skills for the fourth time in a row. No, he doesn't need better ranged attacks, he needs to be able to swing that butterknife he has like a man!  There are hundreds of items you can find, which is nice, but there's almost no storage space for them. You get a tiny little vault that can't be upgraded. It wouldn't be so bad but on the same screen you have access to the merchant window to sell stuff, and hey, if you guessed that had a scroll bar and infinite space in it, go get a cookie or something. You can build an artifact shop so you can buy artifacts, but unfortunately it doesn't cycle through different ones. You get the opportunity to buy three randomly chosen ones and it never changes for the rest of the game. Those three items are pretty much going to be terrible and I really want to chalk it up to being a bug that it doesn't refresh every so often, but it's been like that since release so probably it isn't.  There are four types of hero you can recruit, but you shouldn't bother getting anything but a warrior. The warrior is so much better than the other three it defies belief. Scouts can be useful for the rare encounters designed exclusively to kill warriors, but that's about it. Oh, and yeah, there are encounters designed from the ground up to murder warriors. packs of medusa will petrify you and then poison you, giant spiders will web you down and poison you, giant slugs will poison you if you hit them or vomit poison on you from a distance if you don't.  Edit: Okay, so I finally managed to grind a mage high enough to use a specific spell named 'white magic', and basically, it lets you break the game over your knee like a rotten twig. Two casts will clear virtually any combat encounter of critters, barring the two (the latest update may have added more) creatures who are magic immune. Once you get one cast per combat, better beleive that mage is going straight to lvl 30 since he can now effectively obliterate entire armies. Unconquerable foes turn instantly into big, meaty sacks of free XP. Just load up every unit slot with lvl 1 swordsmen, the enemy creatures/mages/whatever will go and kill them while your mage, free and unharmed, fires magic nukes that hit EVERYTHING ON THE MAP FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE. This is a well balanced, well implimented ability that reduces multiplayer combat to 'whoever goes first wins'. Casting it does a small amount of damage to the mage, but a couple of healers can fix it easily before any monsters that made it to turn two kill them for being a weaker, easier target than the wizard FIRING MAGICAL NUKES AT THEM.  Oh, and I hope you like really, really really loud TING! sounds, because the game plays one over and over at random for no reason I can discern.   Edit: I also hope you don't like loading saved games, because doing that while the game is running will cause the entire thing to crash. Not always, but often enough that I had to mention it.     Shouted at by a dev and I didn't even get an acheivement for it.",

            "review_text": "The idea is interesting but the implementation is lacking. Highly random starting positions can vary the difficulty from 'cakewalk' to 'impossible,' and strategy games should be decided more by your decisions than by randomness. Hero units drive the game, so if your starting area is good, you steamroll the map; if not, you may be able to grind through, provided the enemy hero did not get a steamroll start that lets it one-shot your troops and two-shot your hero. 'First OP hero wins' is not an interesting strategy dynamic.  Before each fight, the game evaluates your forces versus your enemies and gives you a difficulty estimate from 'no casualties' to 'no chance.' Whatever math is being done does not compare the units' strengths and weaknesses. You will regularly find impossible 'easy' fights and 'run away!' fights you can win without taking damage. Between this and the highly random elements, you can see why so many places on the forums advocate save scumming.  I encountered fewer crash bugs than other reviewers did.",

            "review_text": "Highly Recommended by me if you like Fantasy style Civ games, It plays similar to my favorite mod of all time; RiFe for Civ 4 - mixed with turn based Might and Magic type stuff. The elements of being able to Explore every province is pretty darn fun, and allows for alot of time to sink into a map. But by far the biggest pull for me in the game is the campaign; Imagine starting a game of Civ with a tech cap on most buildings/units. Choosing which 'shards' to attack allows you to get new bonuses and slowly unlock everything. It's pretty awesome to have that sort of Metagame aspect to it. seeing as i can easily run through a million and and a half games of Civ that extra layer of progression was really fun to me. If you've got time and enjoy that type of game i'd recommend it to anyone. it's a grade A droning game.   It's more a game of unlocking and and collecting items to upgrade your hero/buff your armies that civilization upgrading, but it works well i feel. and the different spells and unit types definitly give you the ability to mix it up a bit and find whatever is fun for you. That's the best part about this game is it tends to just let you go whatever path you want (beacuse most all paths will eventually let you win lol)  But, Pick it up if it's on sale, and Take care all!",

Finishing the campaign takes really a huge effort (estimate 600 hours). And after, I immediately started playing a new one. When making comparisons, Heroes of might &amp; magic comes to mind. But me, I like this game better.  + The game has personality: a lot of random events - tied to the personality (karma) of the master you play - and really adding flavour and also the opportunity to develop that personality further. Also pretty funny. + Challenging: rather difficult. Different scenario's take a different approach. Also, the technologies you develop add to that. On normal difficulty an experienced player might need several tries to conquer a world. + Strategic: resources are scarce. Investments in your lands take a long time to pay off (10-30 turns) and are nicely balanced to investing in units. + When comparing to Heroes of M&amp;M: the units, spells and choices to make are just more interesting. + Lots of replay value: because of the above.  - Mixed feelings about the Allied forces DLC. I think it distorts the balance in the game. Because of that it is even more difficult.  +- The game did have a lot of bugs. But most are fixed and it is stable now. Nothing gamebreaking.",

Add in the fact that there's almost no strategy to any of the game.  Here's the strategy on how to win: Move as fast as you can to conquer sections. That's it. If you can do that, you win. It's another game that's more about rushing around than actual strategy, or building up defenses, or dealing with an economy that makes any sense. Add in the fact that the mood metrics of the game are very convoluted, and you end up with gameplay that you'll be trying to skip rather than playing.  Eventually I just got so frustrated I gave up. It's trying to be HOMM with a bigger veneer on it, but it's nowhere near as fun. Shame, because if they fleshed out the overland map part, it could be fun.

Once you've bumped off the enemy commander a couple times YOU WIN.  though it can be fun to maintain and manage a huge kingdom, exploring your lands etc.   it's worth the price, it's worth putting a good 100-150 hours into, and it's a 4x game I'll be coming back to at some point.

This game is a lot less forgiving, to the point that even with all the right moves, you downright have to be cheating to get anywhere at all.

Going up against 3 giant spiders may seem somewhat easy for an archer who has gained several levels and found a decent bow, but 8 or 9 may be overwhelming, so getting a sense of what is and is not achievable, and when, is a real skill here. Should you decide to play at a high enough difficulty that the advice is turned off, then skillfull decisions become crucial, because it is there that the handholding is truly gone.  The discovery of what unit types complement one another is also quite fun to explore, especially on the occasion when you may acquire a unit type that cannot be recruited in your own castle. I am dying to mention some of my favorites combinations, but it is the joy of these discoveries that makes them satisfying, so I will leave it at that.  True, there is still an occasional crash, but I have not had to begin a new game because of them in well over a year, maybe longer.

            "review_text": "Okay, I enjoy this game. I enjoy it alot. I have dumped alot of time into the game. If you like Strategy/RPG mix overall I think this game is something to look at. I won't hide the fact that the game is still buggy even after being out for a year, but the developers have been patching the game non-stop since it came out April 2013.  The Ugly:  Okay this game still has bugs, for some people game breaking bugs, and for others bugs that are iritating enough that can make it painful to play the game sometimes. The game was released last April almost completely unplayable, and over the past year it has improved for the major part. Yet I won't gloss over the fact that their is still alot wrong with the game.  The Bad:  The game probably is not all that balanced. Their are 4 tiers of units, and some T4 units could trample an entire army. Not all of the Hero classes are balanced. Their are 4 of them, but they all are playable. It will be nice to see what the game is like in the future.  The Good:  Did I mention patching? The developers still care about the game. They have been patching it a while, and still patch it.   There is alot in this game, alot of units, alot of choice. Alot of lore burried deep within a rough exterior. The game does not look half bad. The game is not fast paced, but is the type of game you can start playing, and come back between turns as you do something else, but will also keep you wanting to play 'one more turn' when things are getting good or you near to beating another map. The developers have recently added a boat load of new units and spells, and have dropped hints are future expansion to the game.   Is the game, worth $19.99? Its a hard sell considering how buggy it can still be. I do thing its a hard sell, but I've enjoy the time I've dumped into the game and I do appreciate the patches that have gone into it. The game has gotten good, and hopefully it will cotinue getting better.",

Gameplay balance remains an issue, and it inherently leads to a very grindy game.  So it remains a diamond in the rough.  ---  After almost a year, this game remains a bug-ridden hellhole, with very little tactical or strategic balance at most levels of the gameplay. I'm almost tempted to say the bugs are worse now than they were a year ago.  Some bugs include: - if more than one battle of any kind occurs on the map, no other battles can occur. They immediately auto-resolve with both sides being listed as dead despite not being dead. - The AI cannot conquer any terrain where it has to fight player guards. Neither the guards will die nor will the province be conquered.  Some gameplay issues include: - In campaign mode, it is entirely possible for the capitol of an AI to be guarded by 9 centaurs. Centaurs are powerful tier 2 units. If this occurs in the first or second mission, you have been given a near-impossible task, as the gameplay elements that allow you to defeat centaurs are not available until later in the game. You can, of course, surrender, and keep playing. This, and similar balance issues, remain a frustrating element of the game. - Starting units are worthless and unless you follow certain strategies or know what you're doing, you're likely to be stuck in your home province for many, many turns.  All of this is incredibly sad, as the game's core concept is pretty great. The programming and game design, however, are lackluster and poor. A great game marred by poor design.",

There is all the right pieces there for a awesome RPG tactical strategy game, but for some reason it just falls short.  The hero characters aren't very balanced and just feel kind of blah. The game gets very repetitive very fast as you keep running into the same thing over and over.  While playing I just couldn't help but compare it to Fallen Enchantress which is a similar style game. In pretty much every way it feel short. Maybe not fair as Stardock is a larger company. But still the point is there.  You may love this game, you may hate it.

That's a good thing.  But you have to feel this good feeling tons of times. I mean, whenever you conquer a world(or shard), you have to restart from the begining, YES, FROM THE BEGINnING. While this is not a bad idea, I mean it, but this kind of game IS very long, the campaign IS very long, and after sometimes, you will think, 'What, I need to do it again? All right, I will do this, I will chose that. Come on, let get this war end'. And BAM, after this, you have to that, again.  Don't get me wrong, it's up to you, I just show what you will do.

You are told you are a God, and you feel like you'll own this world. You laugh at the tutorial, thinking 'please... this is not my first barbecue here, enough with the holding-my-hand gameplay, give me a real challenge.' And surely these goblins are just cannon fodder for xp right? Think again. They will tear you apart. On your first battle. It's like getting slapped in the face and get told to get back to your seat. You slowly realize how dangerous this first world is. And then it dawns on you : 'Wait... I... actually may lose before completing this tutorial world...' Careful planning, pacing, and never under-estimating choices become a necessity. For survival. After a few hours, just when you think you're starting to get the hang of it... you have this strategy all prepared... you have this old units getting tougher and tougher... Then the game crushed you again. It never takes much : it takes one wrong move on the battlefield ; it takes one daring click during a random event ; it takes one management mistake for your equipment or fortress...  Soon you're back to the main menu and a lesson in humility has been learned. You click 'expert' difficulty (default gameplay stats) wishing you had the guts to click 'beginner' instead... but there's always a bit of pride left in you, isn't there? And then you're off to another b*tt-kicking. This is not a bad thing. This is actually a great thing. Your choices matter. All of them. Because each time you're wrong, you fail. And each victory, each captured shard, is a real hard-fought battle. It's an endeavour. A real achievement. Overcoming the odds.
