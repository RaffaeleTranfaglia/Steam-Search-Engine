            "review_text": "I bought all SH games and decided to start at the beginning, and I'm very disappointed. And yeah, I know this game is old but that is not a very good excuse. You can only play it at fullscreen (in which everything is pixelated and hard to look at - and I only have a 13'' screen, which is considerably small), you can't alt+tab away from the game unless you're in for restarting it (you can't even access the Steam layer) and it happens a lot that the game crashes at cutscenes (that stuff you spent the last hour working on? Lost!). If that is not enough to harden your way through, items are very very well hidden, which is not a bad point per se, but I found they were just overly hidden for it to be fun. I don't know whether this was made on purpose (since Sherlock's primary skill is observing it makes sense to make it hard to 'see' useful stuff) or not. Also, the puzzles are really difficult (difficult enough they're no longer fun) and most of the time will require you take paper and pen (since you can't alt+tab out of the game) and spend some long time on them, which could be fun if you like it (like I do), but, in this case, it just isn't.  Yes, the story is fine, the way you can get letters (backstory) is well thought of, moving through rooms/levels is a very good mechanic, but the bad points weight, by far, much more than the good points. So, unless you enjoy very difficult and time-consuming games, don't spend your money on this. If you get this in a SH bundle and need to check it out just because you're a fan, don't be afraid to have a walkthrough ready on your phone!",

            "review_text": "I started Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series in chronological order of the games. Even though this was the first game made; the silver earring is a prequel to this game, just to be confusing. This game has really dated graphic capability, game mechanics, and puzzles that only the true Sherlock Holmes could solve. The PC version of this game requires external software which is very obnoxious because the graphical issues are only mostly solved. Even though the first person point of view would be a smart move to see everything Sherlock Holmes would see was poorly implimented. Instead of a FPS shooter it was more of a point and click adventure to move around a room.   With the frustration to get the game running, playing the game, and seeing the game. I suggest you either find someone to play a different version or buy this on a sale if you really want the complete experiance of Frogware's excellent series. Otherwise give this game a miss.",

Windowed mode only, no meaningful changes to the graphics settings.  Gameplay is fairly run of the mill point and click/puzzler, not terribly complicated or fun. Bad voice acting and sound.  The technical hiccups, being forced into a tiny window for the gameplay, etc etc just makes this game unplayable. It's not worth the disk space unfortunately.",

So if you like a game of finding puzzle pieces and solving the puzzle to advance Sherlock Holmes case...I would recommend this game, otherwise, let's hope the next instalment engages us somewhat more hey. :/",

            "review_text": "It is flawed. For an old game, the least they could do is to improve the graphic texture, it's appalling on high res screens.   The other problem is the control. Although it's simply point and click with only your mouse. When you have a high spec pc expect near uncontrollable mouse movement. The pointer moves so fast, it's like you would on FPS you have to be accurate. Moving around the place is frustrating at times when you wish they would just simply have something/anything that gives you quick access to rooms instead of moving you pointer accurately just to click to move.   This is compounded by the fact that some levels have a time limit. Imagine that you're in a life/death stage and you need to find objects to save yourself. But the pointer moves so fast, it's terrible that you also have to move you pointer ever so gently just to access the inventory or the menu. Yes, there's no shortcut keys. It's atrocious that while you can't see the item that you're looking for, very well, you need to be accurate. Oh, and there is a puzzle near the end, where you have to be accurate, gently and slowly, but there's a time limit in that entire level! Oh for the love of..! *Breathe*  For a point and click adventure game and Sherlock Holmes for that matter; you would think that you would go and find clues and solve mysteries through deduction, not using items just to get you from A to B of clues. It's like playing an escape game.  As for the puzzles... What a joke! It's either mind-numbing or pure frustration. I am definitely disappointed, if not by the logic then definitely the requirement of finesse with you hand. Even if you set your mouse speed, it will make a bit of difference, but it will annoy you if it moves too slow for you to move to a different room.  For the other aspect of this game. The music is dreary and the voice acting, rubbish! Even some horribly dubbed anime sounded better than this actor voicing Sherlock Holmes. It is an insult to the English character.  You're better off just watch the entire game on youtube and then add this game to your category of completed games, because this is simply not worth it no matter the price.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I do *not* recommend buying this game. If you get it via the Sherlock Holmes Collection, you don't miss much if only playing the two first levels or skipping the game completely.  Sound: The music is okay, especially the track in level two is quite catchy, but there is only one track on infinite repeat per level, making playing one level 10+ minutes in one go a bit dull.  The voice acting is terrible, though. Both when it comes to most of the game's voice actors themselves as well as to the rather amateurish recording quality.   Graphics: Mystery of the Mummy uses a Myst-like 3D-ego-perspective with pre-determined points-of-view. It does look worse than the ten years older Myst, though. Washed-out brown and grey tones are dominant, in later levels smoke, which is basically illustrated by a transparent grey layer above everything else, makes this even worse. To be fair, Myst had static frames while Mummy allows the player to look around with the mouse freely in its 'frames'. The possibility to look around freely is implemented badly, though, seriously hampering gameplay.   Gameplay: Surprisingly for a Sherlock Holmes game there are only very few logic based puzzles. It has ome stereotypical adventure puzzles: f.ex. the old 'get a key from the other side of the door with a pointy item and a pice of paper' trick makes a return and it has the infamous sliding puzzle (twice!). Unfortunately most of the puzzles consist solely of finding and combining the correct items. The free camera together with the washed out graphics make those puzzles utterly frustrating. Making places in the gameworld that Sherlock can interact with more apparent would have helped making this game a lot more enjoyable. Instead you are supposed to find things like a tiny hairpin (seriously, it was only barely visible after I *knew* where it is) in a room with lots of broken stuff and junk in it, without even knowing what exactly you are looking for to begin with. Having a time limit in one of the levels doesn't really help either.  Some of the few better and more complex puzzles which usually open a new frame to solve them, suffer from the somewhat arbitrary way of ending them: Some end automatically as soon as the right solution has been achieved, in others nothing is happening after getting the solution until the puzzle frame is exited. This results in situations where little oversights in a overall good but very tedious puzzles leads to the player exiting a puzzle, thinking it's solved, only to be forced redoing it from the beginning.",

It was impossible to notice it, due to it's tiny size and high pixelation. It literally was the size of 2 white pixelated dots and was simply unrecognisible from all other pixelated junk on the room's floor. I had to refer to online walkthrough. Also, already, in the first rooom (the hall), high pixelation of textures made it very hard to correctly read out the number on plaques, hence to find correct hints.",
