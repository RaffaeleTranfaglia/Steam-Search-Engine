            "review_text": "Wow. Quality artwork. Great story. It's short but what a journey.   This is a point-n-click style game. A few puzzles, not very many and not very difficult. And a few 'battles' as well. Awesome graphics. There are voices but it is a nonesense language just for background effect, but it does portray the emotional state of the characters well. (Reminds me of an exercise in drama school where we had to do a scene and the only words we could say were 'Mary had a little lamb'. IT's amazing how much you can portray by voice inflection and stuff like that)  You help the main character become a reluctant hero. He just wants to sleep instead of doing his job. You have to literally drag him with the mouse to the edge of the screen in order for him to move on. He complains all the way through the game. He has to deliver a message scroll to a hero in order to save the land from impending destruction. Along the way he meets other characters that become involved in the story. I won't spoil anything for you, but there is a neat thing they do in the game after you reach the 'end' of the story they do a flashback and show what happened earlier but from another character's point of view. It gives a different twist to the story. Very nice storytelling.  One of the main puzzles is to create a path across a chasm by choosing small pieces that will fit together. Then there are the battles. You have to battle by choosing from a few options, like damage opponent or heal or defend, but they are not written that way. They have phrases that are specific to the characters. There are some battles where you have to do more strategy that just attack and defend. There's also an option to increase attack or increase health. So spend some time alternating between those and healing and then once your attack is high enough you can go for the kill. Though you don't actually 'kill' anyone. It's more like you defeat them, they give in to your demand.  There's lots of humor in this story. Sometimes it even breaks the fourth wall and talks to you, the player. I love that kind of stuff. Oh, and the game is kid-friendly. I dont' think there's anything that will offend anyone. It's really a game for all ages. It's not neccesarily aimed at kids but it's not aimed at adults only.   Graphics are cute, charming, kind of like stained glass or woodcuts or mosaics artwork.  Total playtime: about an hour or so. There are a few hidden things if you want all the achievements, so you might have to replay some sections.  tl;dr version:  great story great art point-n-click gameplay some puzzles (easy to medium) voices but not in a real language (like the schoolteacher in the old Charlie Brown and Snoopy movies) 1 hour playtime",

            "review_text": "Message Quest is a game where you must help the characters save the world. Wait that's not entirely right. Message Quest is a game where you laugh at while helping the ridiculous characters in the game and solve puzzles in order to eventually fight the Big Bad namely laziness and fear!   This game has cute art and funny little characters. It combines several different types of tasks, from jigsaw puzzling &amp; wave forming, mock RPG fights, to tetrising. Explore this world while helping characters achieve their true potential. Just beware, because not all may be as it seems.   Sound: Quite funny, but appropriate. The music is rather soothing, and the voice acting is ridiculous... but funny.   Graphics: Everything is made to look like stained glass, which is an interesting route for a game to take. Quite different and cute, the art is nicely done. Very unique in this case.  Story: Quite ridiculous. Actually made me laugh out loud a few times while playing. The characters have such weird motivations and interactions, but they tend to be amusing though they are ridiculous.   Overall: 7/10 - For an hour of fun, try to get a copy of this, it's definitely worth playing at least once. The price tag isn't too bad for what it is and you'll likely get a good laugh out of the game at least once. It was in a few Greenlight bundles and if it ever comes up in a new one, snag it. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "Message Quest is a casual adventure/puzzle game done by Royal Troupe. Message Quest is done with entire stained glass art that's fantastic. It's about a extremely lazy hearld, whose the last to do a job after the location he's at has issues. He tries to find ways to be lazy about everything he does, but eventually comes around.   I recommend this game highly to anyone based on it's graphics, story and humor. When fighting the NPC's, I recommend muting the sound, it was a bit aggervating to hear repeated often. The game is incredibly short, but leaves you with a desire for more, more, more! It's a point-n-click style game with some puzzle elements that aren't incredibly difficult. For the price it's set at, it's a steal. I hope to see more from this developer sometime.",

It's not that the game isn't beautifully made, the stain glass style is very beautiful and fully represents actual stain glass. I also like the idea of a young lazybones being forced to go on a journey. The parts I have issue with is the story.  It is a bit cliche to send the hero on a journey to save the world, but I could have looked over it if I didn't finish the game in less than two hours. This might just be my opinion, but saving the world should take longer than doing a load of laundry. As I played, I found myself getting bored not only in the story, but in the entirity of the game play. It is highly misrepresented as a point and click adventure when 90% of the clicking is so you can get through the dialogue boxes.  Another thing that I take issue with is the lack of answers I got at the end of the game. So many things were alluded to and just glossed over and then never mentioned again or explained that I actually felt relieved when it ended instead of satisfied.   It is not that this game doesn't have massive amount of potential, but it is far to short to be a satisfactory adventure game.",

The puzzles are quite easy, but sometimes it just takes time to figure out how to solve them because there are no hints on what you should do and how you should do it :).  I enjoyed every moment of playing it. The finctional language it's using is really funny to hear, dialogues are also really funny. Cartoonish graphics but in a good way.  I can recommend this game.  Indeed there'll be no replay value, but that's the same for all these point'n'click adventure games. It's definitely worth 1 playthrough though. Also bought it in a bundle, so almost got it for free.",
