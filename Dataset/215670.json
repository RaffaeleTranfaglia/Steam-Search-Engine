            "review_text": "Home is an intensely unsatisfying experience, because at the end it feels like the developer didn't actually have any idea what the plot was about himself.  The gameplay mostly consists of walking around and finding vague, uninteresting clues to hint towards what's actually going on, as well as some very simple, very easily solvable puzzles. The focal point of the game comes at the end, wherein you're brought to a place where the clues of the game start adding up, forming the hints that start showing the big picture of what has happened.  The problem with this is that the game's ending clues are determined by your seemingly arbitrary actions and choices. Even worse, the changes that are possible barely even change what the game's purported ending is supposed to be. To top it off, at the end, you're actually directed to an online forum where you're encouraged to share your ending and what you think it meant.  This makes it feel like the game doesn't actually have any story at all. Nothing is resolved, nothing is explained, the game literally just gives you a few hints and goes 'hey you figure out the plot, because I sure as hell am not.' It doesn't feel smart or creative at all, it just feels lazy, like the dev wanted to make a game that has lots of interesting symbolism but isn't nearly creative enough to write anything interesting. If I'm just supposed to use my head and think up something myself, I see no reason to pay some pretentious dev money to do so.",

You will buy silly little apps for your phone that you will use once and never turn on again that will cost more than this and give you NOTHING. This game must be played with headphones on, at night, when you know you won't be disturbed.   It's brief, but somehow that plays right into the charm. This adventure will make you feel like you've been sitting at your desk for hours, and it's only been 30 minutes. You're never sure what's lurking behind the next door, but you know you'll never like it, and you will usually be right. The atmosphere is amazing. The sound is perfect. The story is devastating. No two people who play it will interpret it the same way, and that's just fine. You can discover 50% or 100% of the paths, and it will not detract from how the game is played at all. So satisfying, so discombobulating was this game that after I finished it in one sitting, I've not opened it since.  It's not bloody, and it doesn't use cheap scare tactics. But it thrills you just the same, just like if someone tells you Slenderman is standing behind you. You know he isn't. You'll look anyways.",

            "review_text": "I bought Home at the same time I bought Lone Survivor when they were both on sale. Lone Survivor was good, Home not so much. Once you start Home, the game informs you that it is best played in a dark room while wearing headphones and that it should only take an hour or so to beat. Suitably prepared for jump scares after the recomendation to use headphones, I dawned them and turned off the lights.  You begin by waking up in a strage house with no memory of the events prior to falling asleep, so far so standard. After stumbling around the house looking at things, the game's first piece of horror comes in the form of a door slamming somewhere in the house. This did startle me and now made me feel unsafe in what I had hought was an empty house. For about the next twenty minutes the game makes me feel tense. The sudden noises and clostrophobic amount of light you have to see by do well to create a sense of atmosphere and tension.  However, this didn't last. Around the thrid time hearing a noise I was on the edge of my seat; expecting something to leap out and tear my face off any second. By the eigth time I heard a noise, I realized 'any second' wasn't ever going to come. All too soon I realized that all the game had up its sleeve were noises, creating the illusion of being stalked by something that never shows up. Indeed nothing much happens at all in this game.   Starting from the most generic opening, the game never solidifies. You are searching for a way out of you initial location and get home to your wife, stumbling through the wake of some monster or killer that is presumably present. Along the way you come across a bunch of seemingly unconnected murder victims and personal effects of your wife, all of it remaining a huge mystery up until the end. But instead of there actually being any form of resolution the game down right expects you to choose your twist ending; blatantly asking you which twist is the one that happens. Then you must choose how you rationalize the events with the ending you chose. This ends up creating a jumbled mess of meaningless atempts at symbolism and rendering pointless any build-up you might have felt as you are forced to choose the meaning behind every mystery in the game.  Admittedly I missed one or two things. I never found out what was on the tape and I missed one or two rooms in the factory because I didn't realize the door that required a key card would lock behind me and force me to exit the level. But I don't feel like any of that would have helped. Even if the game weren't a pile of random environments and situations that might be considered spooky, anything they might have lended to the plot would all be rendered meaningless by choosing your ending anyway. All in all, both the horror and the story held no weight and left me feeling let down.",

            "review_text": "Home is a difficult game to evaluate and I'm struggling to decide if I would recommend it or not. For what it's worth, it has a really pleasing visual style. I didn't come across any bugs while playing - the whole thing functioned pretty smoothly. It was atmospheric enough, sound design was okay, controls were intuitive despite minimal instruction. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to play it.  But - and this is a big but - the game was predictable and unchallenging to the point of being boring. The (potential?) twist was apparent early on, and the level of control over the outcome that was promised honestly amounted to little more than some contrived yes or no questions at the very end of the game, and a resulting pretty vague text summary. I wouldn't have minded this so much if the gameplay was interesting but it really wasn't much more than just walking from room to room. The puzzles were hardly puzzles at all, no critical thinking (or even just plain old trial and error) required. I spent the entire time feeling a little bit like I was playing a tutorial, just waiting for the game to start.  Ultimately, it's an interesting idea, with great visual design, but the story needed more time to incubate and mature. I just didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't feel engaged at all; I didn't feel like the story was even really trying to engage me. Though I appreciate that this game wasn't aiming to be an amazing platformer or adventure game or anything, I still feel that better gameplay elements were needed to justify using this platform to deliver this story. I don't particularly understand why it had to be a game as opposed to perhaps a visual novel or a short story. I don't understand why the only thing I was given to do between tiny dribs and drabs of story was slowly walking through often repetitive environments.   This game was purchased for me as a gift during a steam sale, and while I don't regret playing it, I'd hesitate to push anyone to spend money on it.",

It tooks me 1.8hs on a first run, and i'll certainly replay it very soon to explore some possibilities.  The story is good enough, giving you doubts from start to end. Although i easily guess what's going on from the very beginning, i finished this first run with some minor doubts and things not very well explored.  Closer to the end, you're asked about what things you believe that happens, and these options may influence the ending. So, i have not confirmed my version of the story, probably because of these not explored things. But in the absence of at least one more run i can't say if it's one of more endings or just an open ending, i'll see it soon, but i think it worth the mystery and it's better to not talk about.  Gameplay is very simple, and the atmosphere is just average to me. No scares or something like that, just a mystery mood.",

The player character is mysterious as well as he can't recall waking up in a strange man's home, whom he finds dead. Home is a game about choice, you ultimately decide the ending and that's why it's so ambiguous. It doesn't exactly clarify everything, specifically who the dead man is that you find once you start the game. But other details are cleared up, about Rachel and Norman, and other stuff.  While all that is interesting, the game is rather basic. UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and SPACE are your controls when walking around and looking at clues. The graphics are supposed to resemble retro games from the late 70's early 80's, but the pixels are so big that they're not retro, but are rather odd. The sound is nice and eerie though.  Pretty decent game.  7.5/10",

            "review_text": "(Warning: I discuss spoilers. Play the game first if you're interested, it takes 90 minutes.)  My approach to this game was wrong.  I had a restless night to kill, I had only my Macbook, and needed something graphics-lite I could play with my keyboard. Home seemed like the perfect fit.  It seemed set up as an adventure game with an easy interface. Great! I found myself quickly analyzing clues, trying to piece together what was happening. That being said, the game doesn't challenge you to *actually* understand much of anything - and so my character's frequent questions about what he was looking at just fed the sense of mystery.  I was expecting answers. That's not a good start.  The atmosphere is generally unsettling because the game teaches you very early on that the game's volume is on 5 and the game's audio jump scares are on THIRTY MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TWO. I turned down the whole thing and ruined the atmosphere just to save myself a heart attack. But it's a cheap parlor trick - nothing ever comes out of the shadows, it's just noises.  There are many choices you can make. Do I pick up the bloody knife or leave it? Well, I seemed to be an amnesiac in an unknown environment with dead bodies everywhere, so yeah, I'll take the knife. I'd hate for something else to take the knife and kill me with it. My character then muses, 'Did I really need this knife?' ..... Well now wait a minute, I thought I was being practical. Am I just being paranoid? Does the game think I'm a violent person now?  I picked up the knife, I picked up the gun, I picked up most objects that seemed useful. And some objects I decided seemed pointless wound up being typical adventure key items. Why am I given the choice to pick it up or not if I need it to progress? Seems strange. What do my choices even mean?  So I get to the end, ready for the story to come together. The game asks me if I find my wife. For some intuitive reason, I just don't get the feeling I do. So I answer no. I'm comfortable with that choice. But then the game asks me another 15 questions about the items I've collected and everything else that is going on. Well I mean, I'm not sure, I've only been playing for an hour. Is there a right or wrong answer? If I'm not sure, do I really have to pick yes or no?  I didn't have any solid understanding of what was happening throughout what I was experiencing, and I'm sure most people would agree with that - it's designed that way. So why then is the game quizzing you on this understanding at the end of the game? I never answered yes or no - I only answered,  'Um...yes?'  or 'Grrr, pff, I dunno, no?' It would take a clearer narrative to expect any clearer reaction, wouldn't it?  I mean, what arrogant self-assured idiot would go through an obtuse series of unrelated mysteries and think, 'Dude, I know EXACTLY what's going on here'? There literally is no right answer, so attempting to decide what your choices meant within a meaningless context is itself an utterly meaningless action.  And of course, the few paragraphs of text that serves as the game's recapitulation and conclusion was the confirmation that I didn't know what I was talking about, because my choices as a whole didn't make any cohesive narrative sense, even for the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator. I remain just as confused now as I did while I was playing. Actually, more so.  I suppose that's the risk of an open-ended story, but it would have been nice to see the developer take the time to script his endings a bit more to ensure that most or all players would reach a conclusion that makes sense. I understand that western storytelling relies too heavily on clear denouements, but when it's the player dictating the storytelling, the ending feels more arbitrary than artistic.  So just to be clear, my recommendation is based on the fact that it's a cheap, interesting, and unique experience that you might not enjoy, but that's okay. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad I played it.",

I like that it went for an open-ended style, and maybe I just didn't play the game close enough to a solid conclusion, (I picked up certain things, left others, thinking some items would lead me to get a more incriminating ending, not as though I knew what the game actually had planned or how picking up those items affected my playthrough).  My main problem is that the game sets up a pretty obvious twist that your character is probably going to end up being somehow responsible for the disturbing discoveries he keeps making (and enthusiastically questioning as though he's never seen them before since he has amnesia/sleepwalks). Then the game just throws the choice to you in the last minutes of gameplay as to what happened. As soon as it hit this point I thought maybe the ending would be really dynamic, and hey, it's cool that I'm taking a small hand in the storytelling, but the choices it gave me were actually pretty unsatisfying, they changed some of the main elements of what transpired but that just made me feel like it didn't really matter much what happened, anything could've happened, there's no shocking reveal, I'm just writing the ending and then it ends, which as a mystery just doesn't work well. The ending was nothing more than a bunch of text boxes explaining my playthrough, and really hazily describing some of the decisions I made along the way. I just played the game, Home, this is old news to me and your summation doesn't make the story any less asinine.  As a Horror game it really doesn't succeed in much. There's some small amount of atmosphere but very little ever happens. I experienced a single jumpy moment when a very loud spout of steam came from a pipe in the sewers, and then nothing else happened the entire playthrough. Discovering bodies here and there was not very impactful, and I'm not even saying subtlety is bad, it can be very good, but at no point was I really given incentive to care, more often I just thought to myself 'Is there going to be a cheap twist ending where it turns out this guy I'm playing is the bad guy?' and just because I can Choose My Own Adventure (Ending) so that he's not, that doesn't make the ending any better, it just makes it so neutral that I could hardly be arsed to even try to be invested in what was going on. I would try playing through again once or twice to get different endings, but to be honest the amount of walking and mind-numbingly simple button pushing puzzles and item-fetching bouts are too monotonous for repeat trips. I'm gonna call it here and say I don't recommend this one. It's a promising concept, but I'm pretty sure much more could be done with it than this in terms of storytelling and delivery.",

I don't know if I played it wrong and didn't figure it out right (though I don't have the interest to play it again even though it was short) I swear I had it figured out in the first 15 minutes of the game or so, but the ending didn't confirm that or not as if the game wanted to hide it from me or make my character truly dilusional in his role in the game.  Further, the very subtle effects like music (there was a little only at the very end) are really effective even when they're simple... this could have been a lot better with more of that.  In conclusion, I'm glad I played it, but there are too many negatives to me to recommend this to anyone. Despite that, I will be following this developers work and hope to see his future projects increase in quality.",

No, but somehow a brutal charm was found in Bill Moseley's character madness, sure, he may have been paraded in gore but something sinister &amp; evil beyond the basic tropes copy &amp; paste mold used (and improved on with the sequel, The Devil's Rejects) saturated the entire film reel.   Did I believe the Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue was going to be one of the stellar titles of the zombie genre? No, but it stands as one of the creepiest and doom funneled films I've seen. Slowly twisting familiar stories into a new mythos, calling back to days of voodoo and speculation on how science melds with myth.   Home is not filled with gore or sadistic action, this game is understated, it is basic, it's simple, it's atmospheric, it rides on the cinematography of the camera and the ambience of the audio. For what the game may lack in terms of buttons -Home only uses the directional pad and one button- it makes up for in what it makes you see in your own mind.   Is something following you? Are you hunting someone down? Are you condemning yourself wrongly? Is there a monster in your shadow or is it all a fever dream?   Spectacular, I could not recommend this enough.

Pros: Great atmosphere - The game makes good use of the pixel art style, and the sound design is excellent. Narrative crafting - The core game mechanic is that the choices you make alter the backstory. Gives a real sense that your choices matter. Strong writing - Not great writing, but no false steps that took me out of the experience.  Cons: Limited Replayability - Though you can play through with alternate choices to see different takes on the story, I found I'd had enough after the second playthrough.",

            "review_text": "It was okay. Maybe I just didn't make the right choices, but I didn't find this game particularly fun — I got pretty bored, to be honest. Nor did I find the ending satisfying, interesting, or impactful.  I also didn't appreciate how they executed the choices that determine the details of the ending. Asking the player what to have the player character do is one thing. Asking the player what the results of those actions were, or what someone else did — which is what it started doing near the end — is something else entirely.  There are many doorways and branching paths, so I got lost a lot, which wouldn't have been so bad if I'd been given the freedom to explore fully. But sometimes I would go through a certain door only to be told that I couldn't go back, or that the character didn't want to go back. That would have been nice to know  before  I went there, that way I could have gone back and explored the rest of the area. I understand that a story where your choices determine the ending is one where you will have to forego one path in order to take another, but I would have appreciated some warning before the game made those decisions for me. Otherwise I'm not really the one choosing what happens.  The game did not make it clear when my actions had been effective. An example: Turning a valve. If it needed to be turned again, I'd expect the character to state this out loud, without my needing to examine the valve again. I don't think I've ever played a game where this wasn't the case. But in fact, it wasn't until I went where I was trying to make the water level descend and saw that it hadn't worked, then went back and examined the valve again, that the character told me that there was still water running through the pipe.  Lastly, as I approached the end, the game made sure to make me regret my choices by bringing up things I could have done but didn't. It felt like the game was giving me the finger for not doing 'the right thing', which feels unfair when the point of the game is creating your own journey. What's worse is that one of those things that I didn't do, was not because I didn't want to do it, but because I didn't realize at the time that I  could  do it. The game didn't make it particularly clear at the time that it was something I could do there, and I had been under the impression I had to find another place to do it. Nope, apparently not, and by the time I discovered this it was too late.  But, I won't say you  shouldn't  play it. It's only $2.99, it's a nice time-waster whenever you have an hour or two to spare, you might like it better than I did, and I'm sure it might be fun to play it several times and see what other kinds of endings and details you can get. But I personally don't have much interest in doing so.  P.S. The only technical gripes: 1) The cursor didn't disappear the entire time I was playing, which got pretty annoying. 2) The game doesn't tell you at the beginning that you quit by pressing Q. Esc did not work, so I had to use Cmd+Q. I thought this must be a bug, until I finished the game and it told me to quit by pressing Q. I guess I should have thought to try that, but the game also should have told me at the beginning. Not to mention they might want to consider having Esc also quit the game.",

Could Rachel and I have been attacked here? A bloody piece of cloth on a crashed train! Did Rachel flee her would be killer? Is she okay?  And then things started to kind of...fall apart. Could I...could this man I was controlling be the killer? Of these two girls on the other side of the river? Of the security guard, of...Rachel?  I thought it was rather meaningful, at the end, when it asked me if Rachel was beneath the rags. I didn't want her to be. And so I said no.

Back before games became all about high poly counts and over the top action, there was an elegance in their simplicity. Obviously this wasn't always the case. There were plenty of terrible games back then as well but there was something about the style of video games back then that made for a memorable experience.   Much like a good mystery novel leaves you with more questions than answers and doesn't give away the entire story, the video games of my childhood were entertaining during play but often left you with plenty of things to ponder long afterward. You'd wonder about that one-off robot with one line of dialogue and where he came from. You'd lay awake in your bed trying to figure out if there were more secrets hidden in that dark cave you just finished passing through.   Home feels like an homage to that era of gaming... an era where one's imagination was as much a part of the experience as the production itself.  I'm not surprised to see a fair number of people giving Home negative reviews but I hope the developer doesn't take them to heart. I've read several of these negative critiques and to be perfectly honest the bulk of them simply have no appreciation for games that aren't multi-million dollar titles produced by teams numbering in the hundreds. These are the same folks who can't appreciate most indie films because they don't know how to process a movie that doesn't spoon feed them the plot between explosions. I don't fault them for it. They simply don't know any better.   I tip my hat to you Benjamin Rivers. Well done. What we have here is a unique piece of retro-styled choose-your-own-adventure story telling and it is beautiful in its simplicity and originality.",
