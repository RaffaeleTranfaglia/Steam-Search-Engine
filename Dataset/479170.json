Revoked after a few hours due to of.....a mistake of the developer (???) Anyway...no single player, no servers, 2+players required even to start a game, a 'baby-boy with pencils' graphic in the main menu, no achievements, no trading cards.   NO, NO, NO. Stay away and avoid the developer(s), such a mistake might only means bad games...",
