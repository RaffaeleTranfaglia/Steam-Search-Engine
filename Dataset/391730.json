Pros: - Surprisingly responsive dev team for only being 3 people - You won't starve to death or go insane (in the game..don't forget to take breaks) - No permadeath, items are easily recoverable from your graaaave - Teleportation system for fast travel around the massive maps - The infinite auto-managing inventory is GREAT  - Hilarious and creative dialog/item/npc names compliment the bright vibrant world really well - RNG stats on your gear and ability to recycle/recraft them - The synching to my phone and tablet (Android) has been flawless - Combat is fun, scales well and is balanced as you explore and craft - SO MANY ITEMS - Baconweed  Cons - Can only track one item recipe at a time - Wish there were more hotkeys - No controller support (yet?) - Pets can be leveled up but other than that are just kind of “set it and forget it.” Wish there was more to do with them. - I’m trying to come up with something else but…I love this game  The Butterscotch guys went through quite a journey to launch this game. With their plans to combine all of their games under one universe, I’m happy to support them. They plan on releasing a world creator/workshop thing AND add even more content if all goes well. People have issues with the split PC/mobile pricing and extensive (and logical) responses have been made. Basically, they consider this a $20 game and I’ve enjoyed playing it on both platforms.  Edit: yet?",

            "review_text": "They have Baconweed  THEY HAVE FREAKING BACONWEED  It's like a weed... but it's made of bacon  Ok, I appreciate that did very little in selling the game to you. But what it does tell you is how seriously Butterscotch Shenanigans takes their game...  Answer: Not very  What we have here is the aim to take out everthing tedious from world-sprawling RPG's... and just make them all about  fun . So the guys blasphemously ripped out many of staples we're sick of... Letting us focus on the important things: Beating up the local wildlife and collecting stuff to make bigger stuff to beat up bigger local wildlife. So we no longer have to manage an unweildy inventory and angrily raid about 50 chests for that 1 item we know we picked up somewhere, but likely left in an outpost in God-knows-where (yay). The map is littered with teleporters that let us hop around the place on a whim (yay). And if you die, you can just go back, pick up your stuff and carry on (yay)  On the surface, this might seem worrying. By removing all this, does it leave a rather shallow game? Not really. What it ultimately does is make it exceptionally approachable and give you the freedom to muck about and just... enjoy it. Seriously, I could just mill about the Savannah for ages - it was just so relaxing. That's not to say it's easy (you will die... a lot), but it's laid back and easy to dip into.  The only real weak point is the armour crafting. Basically, your kit will randomly have special effects when you craft them (poisoning, going berserk, resisting damage...) - but it cannot be carried over when you upgrade. This sucks big time, as you'll repeatedly end up with Excellent Level kit... then have to forge like 30 items of the next level in the hope that one of them will actually have bonuses worth upgrading to. And you're forced to upgrade A LOT (the enemies scale quite dramatically). It ironically adds a lot of tedium to a game hell-bent on removing it. It's frustrating and can detract from the enjoyment - but there is at least enough enjoyment to be had to mitigate it to a degree.  Other than that though, it's great fun! The combat is reminiscent of the old Mega Drive platformers: Studying the attack patterns and finding the sequences to best get a hit in. The pets are an inspired (and fun) addition and the writing is utterly wonderful. It's cheeky, playful and there are tons of laugh-out-loud moments to be had. The characters are brilliant and the item descriptions equally funny. The end is charmingly sweet and rounds it off perfectly.  All I can echo is the same thing I said to my partner smack-bang during my first boss fight: 'Holy crap this game is so cool!' - (then buying her a copy immediately after)  Little tip... pay attention to the names (especially the Polari) - They snuck in a lot more jokes than meets the eye...",

            "review_text": "It reminds me of a sci-fi version of 'Don't Starve' - Very similar mechanics, but without a lot of the tedium like inventory management. May be because it's also a mobile game, so they did away with a lot of the extra button/menus. And it's truly cross-compatible. I play it on my PC, got to go to the bathroom, bring the tablet or cell phone and play it there. The game keeps everything sync'd up.  Loving it so far.  Edit: Wow, this game is amazing and with the addition of WASD and Gamepad support it's even better. Thank you!  And now the ability to re-roll weapons/stats is amazing. Perfect, thanks again. I've played for 48 hours and have just started the 3rd biome. The story and environment is good enough to keep the game from getting stale, in my opinion. Sometimes I don't want anything intense or punishing, I have plenty of roguelikes for that, and this game is just a great title to play and advance in while progressing through a great story.   It's like 'Don't Starve' but not depressed.",

You won't starve, or go insane, your backpack can always contain more than you can gather, and your furniture do not burst into flames. However this does not mean this game is too easy. The death penalty is forgiving, but mobs are not. A mob can one hit KO you even if you are equiped with gears 10 levels higher or so on insane difficulty. Die dozens of times defeating a boss or sometimes a mob feels very good for me. The building system is very nice as well, containing a huge varities of different furnitures to make, just like in most sandbox games. The story is most interesting, I feel pity for those who can't read English but still like this game. And the soundtrack is great too, you can even sleep with those background music on. This is a game really worth to play.",

The art is very charming, although the humor is a bit lost to me, but I'd still highly recommend it if you want a fun time killer.

This game contains: * Alot of mouse-clicking (click to move, dodge attacks on the ground, attack) * A long repetitive story (took me about 30-40 hours for each playthrough, and I played it on normal and insane setting) * Silly dialog (alot) * 1-hit death enemies (everywhere, it's how the game scales with gear) * Freedom and slow pace, can easily be played 15 minutes at a time because you start where you last stopped playing. * Checkpoints everywhere, so even if you get killed it's fast to get back to where you were.  I like this game.  If you only want a fun game for the story, I suggest playing it on an easy setting. I did not feel any difference between normal and insane setting. Died around 100 times on each playthrough.  Protip; Range attacks rule everything, since you cannot soak damage very well while you progress.",

The brothers always wanted to make a game that combines pokemon, diablo, minecraft, and so much more. One more game, a game of there dreams, before the cancer fully developed on one of the brothers. Butterscotch Shenanigans really put there heart and soul in to Crashlands and I highly recommend reading the full story on how this indie game came to be.   This game though is a giant meme. By no means is this game sad, in fact it is the exact opposite and it pokes fun on religion, politics, and life. One of the most interesing story lines I have ever played.   ~Gameplay~ Easy to grasp. Click an enemy and you hit it. You also get 4 possible ranged/buff item slots. Most of the enviroment is interactable. You can also reroll gear alot.  ~Graphics~ Nice and crisp.   ~Music~ It feels like I am space! The soundtrack is absolute shenanigans. Just get a pet and evolve that thing.

The story line also dragged out a little bit and became something I'd roll my eyes at, it was too predictable ...

            "review_text": "I thought this game would be fun, but it is AMAZING. It is one of my favourite games because everything in it is excellent. With other games I tend to get bored if I play it for too long, or I can't just play them for 20 minuted and then do something else, but with this game, it I have 10 minutes of time free, this game would be perfect, and I can play it for 4 hours straight without getting bored.  -----Game Progression----- You gradually progress through different levels of armour, weapons, and decorative items, each which come from a different workstation. Each workstation has a set of materials that you need to build pretty much any item for it, meaning that when you unlock that workstation, those items are super valuable, and you need as much of them as you can get. A while afterwards, you unlock the next workstation, and then you don't care about those items anymore. To craft some better items you need to do a bit of hunting, sometimes for a little while, but it doesn't reach the point that it gets tedious.  The crafting and inventory system are quite useful, as you don't have to try and drag items around and sort them and try to find the items that you need in your inventory. (Just read any of the promotional material for this game, they do a better job of explaining it)  -----Pets----- After a while of fighting a specific enemy you will eventually get an egg, which you can then hatch, name, and then it will aid you in fights. You can also craft items that make the pet become more powerful. Pets are really useful in taking out difficult enemies, because you dodge their attacks whilst your pet kills them.  -----Enemies----- Every enemy has a unique look, sound, and attack. meaning that fighting them never gets repetitive. with each enemy, there is also a specific technique that you need to use to kill it without getting rekt.  -----The World----- The whole map of the game is quite large, and as you explore it, it is added to your map, with specific goals for missions marked on your maps, making it easy to find where to go next. There are teleporters scattered around the map, which you can teleport to from any location, whenever you are not in battle.  -----Building----- You can create your home using a paintbrush tool, which you can use to put items down anywhere in your vision. The items you can put down are also grouped by categories, meaning that you can easily find what you need.  -----Audio----- The music is gr8, as each area has different music used, and the biomes also have different music that is played at night. The sounds for enemies are unique, meaning that with each new enemy you can enjoy some new weird sounds. The sounds for other things are also good. (esp when 'embiggening' a creature).  -----Visuals----- The graphics are just amazing, and it never looks plain or boring, due to how detailed everything looks.  -----Performance----- I play this game (along with all my other games) on a surface pro 3 i5 with an integrated gpu (no dedicated graphics). It can easily run this game, at 2140x1440 at 60 fps, which is very good (I'm not sure about the performace with other 2D games, but with fps games I am used to 20 fps when playing at a much lower resolution)  Two thing that I would like would to be able to see a list of all your items and recipies, and being able to track multiple recipies at once would be useful. I bought this game when it was on sale, but it is definitely worth the full price",

It feels like a single player mmorpg whereby you need to hit damn a lot of monster and same monster just to farm to the next level of workshop. It is easy to craft certain item but it is also very hard to find those rare material for faming. Do not be despair whereby certain item is totally optional. I never get a single hair louse at all even though I finish the game. Also, try not to overfarm certain item, just get enough of it should be fine. There is more than 300 items in the game. Fastest way to win this game is to...   1) Learn not to get hit at all. They practically 1 hit KO you if you don't have full set of armor, but the dodging is easy once you have 100% damage range weapon or more stun. Try get those eventually. There is a lot of different type. 2) Aim for the next workshop/upgrade. 3) All armor is optional once you learn (1). Just focus on weapon. I skipped a lot of armor building since it is a hassle to find those ingredient. 4) MIssion is important, even it looks optional because certain recipe only can get from the quest. There are two quest I remember mission stucked is the Nitro(1st map) and the Thrombopump(3rd map) because I thought those are optional quest. So I ended up running around the map for no good reason thinking that the recipe will drop. It won't...  I really like the pet system. It is so damn strong...",

Just a few pros/cons that i have so far (will update later once i've accumulated more hours)  Pros: Infinite inventory - No need to worry about 'Chests' or losing items. Easy access of map - Tons of teleports to go anywhere on the map super fast. Amount of items/recipes - So many items to build and create. Tons of stuff. Map - The map is HUGE. IT SEEMS ENDLESS  Go at your own pace. - No need to rush a quest, do a side quest from the main quest if you feel like.  Automatic save - Don't worry about saving ever. Quit the game anytime, it saved for you.  Cons: Esc key - Exits the game. So don't accidently press this. No settings - Its not really needed, but there isn't a settings option for the game. (Not sure if some people prefer that) This game will take away my social life. (If i had one in the first place...)  Great game, totally worth the buy. Would HIGHLY recommend.",

            "review_text": "Imagine if Don't Starve and Terraria had a child. Now imagine that child grew up and got hours more content than its parents, and got rid of all the emotional 'inventory management' baggage their parents were carrying. Then he joined a comedy club and acquired an actual storyline that doesn't suck.  He also saw his parents involved a lot of walking across half the procedurally generated map just to collect a few things or to retrieve your inventory after dying, so decided you can teleport freely wherever one of the generously spaced warp pads are, and that death (which if you're playing on Insane, will happen A LOT) doesn't mean dropping literally everything you own.  The child then decided being only on PC sucked, so it visited iOS and Android and was smart enough to get vaccined against the dreaded 'IAP' disease that was endemic there.  That child is Crashlands. It has a few flaws (like why don't more people know about this game aaargh) and minor bugs, but this is one of the most flawless indie sandbox releases I have seen on Steam, especially with all the pre-alpha early access nonsense going on lately. Right off the bat it has content rivaling Terraria and Don't Stave, with combat and gear resembling an aRPG, without the micromanagement chores of either (although if you are playing on higher difficulty levels and want to min-max your gear you will have to grind some).  It has an infinite procedural map, easy building, tons of crafting recipes, sensible progression, a long storyline, quests and side-quests, farming, fishing, pets, interesting combat, boss fights, rare loot and unique legendary gear, a unique social platform called BscotchID, achievements that unlock side-content IN OTHER GAMES, and WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE GO BUY IT ALREADY AAAAAHHH.  This review alone doesn't do this glorious child-comedian-genius justice so check out the other reviews if you're not yet convinced.",

Crashlands keeps changing and keeps you really engaged because it's not just repeating the same things over and over.  The music is a great compliment and the creature noises are *rarely* annoying.

So much that after I bought here it I bought the Android version and another copy of the steam version for my son. I am an old codger and I don't usually get the appeal of games like this because they are always so tedious; limited inventory, item decay, starving/dying = game over. Not in Crashlands. They basically streamlined the process for people like me who think 'I would like to play a crafting game that has a story and focuses on discovering new items and not annoying ♥♥♥♥ like having too much stuff to carry and needing to eat and stuff'. It's like Don't Starve but not as unforgiving for people like me that are casual noobs with a limited amount of time to play every day. I think you should buy this game.   Side note: I'd like to thank the makers of this game for having MADE A TRAILER THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT INSTEAD OF A BUNCH OF STUPID CUTSCENES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH GAMEPLAY.",

Even Fallout 4 is just laying around and not getting played at all. Then Crashlands happened. A game that isn't my most favorite genre and didn't peak my interest until TouchArcade shed some light on the game including the touching backstory (developer with cancer) fueling the entire creation of this very game together with his two fellow brothers. This is also why I decided to not only purchase it for iOS, but also Steam.  'Yeah ok,' you might be wondering '...but is the game any good? Especially when it's not really your genre?' Heck yeah it is! This game is so incredible that I've already played almost 12 hours in total and only just now I've finished the required quest to move on to the second biome in the game. If you love the art, music and humor presented to you in the trailer speaks to you, then please don't hesistate. Buy it! Personally, I just can enjoy spacing out endlessly whacking away at resources and enemies. The game works for any mood you are in, which makes it so accessible. You can play it for minutes, or hours, also a key feature to make a game accessible. And perhaps the most exciting part is the extra polish and features this game is going to receive over the next few updates to come. Not to mention the Campaign Creator tool so that users can create their own campaigns for the game! It's already fantastic in it's current state, and both the creators and users are going to make sure this well won't run dry anytime soon. My iOS GOTY 2016 already!",

It reminds me of an old-school Gameboy era RPG with elements of Diablo. Although the character progression is a bit linear the crafting and building combined with the simplistic combat makes the mechanics almost buttery smooth.  There are two major things that make this game addicting for me; the first being the pet system. It's challenging to grow your pets but easy enough to not frustrate you. Secondly, the freaking cross platform play is absolutely wonderful but no where necessary to fully enjoy the game. The fact that I can lay in bed and continue playing is huge and seemless.

I just recently bought this game, it's appearance and play style can be compared to that of Don't Starve,another game in which that i've played. This is a fairly good sized review but it's worth it if you consider to know more before you buy.  Assuming all possibilities i started it up, you start on a ship, a delivery ship in fact and play as the character Flux, someone whos appearance is like deadpools but in a goofy/ cute kind of style, and you have your robot Juicebox, who believe it or not looks like a robotic juicebox, and you're currently in progress of delivering several packages to it's destination until you are visited by this just plum like floating head alien Hewgodooko, who at first doesn't seem that bad while asking for an energy source until Flux and Juicebox tells him that its on the ship but in order to get it it would result in blowing up the ship. So he then shoots your ship with a giant laser, blows it up and takes what he needed leaving you (flux) and Juicebox to stumble off of the ship, while along your way to get off you learn basic combat knowledge and health maintance which again is similar to that of Don't Starve, but it has its own special touch to it but i'll tell you more about that in a bit.   So you make it into an escape pod and go to the planet below where you 'Crashland' *nudge* *nudge* and start to explore, and that's where you learn the collecting/crafting mechanics. Very simple to do and kind of fun, you start getting neccessities to make what you need to survive i.e saws,armors, weapons, etc. All doing so with an infinite and self maintaining inventory system where it'll make crafting super easy. Now on to the enemies, the first actual creature/animal you meet is a cute donkey/cow like creature with one leg by the name of Wompit, one of the many creatures that you'll come to meet and learn about along the way with different appearances and strengths. Now combat system, again I'll relate it back to Don't Starve and how its point,click,attack but what seperates is how the enemies react to it, each creature and being has its own attack, I'll explain the wompit's; it's attack is a stomp creating a circle of splash damage to those within reach, now when an enemy attacks it'll create a blue colored highlight (circle,line,line then circle) and when it goes on the attack that path/highlight will turn red, giving you a chance to dodge that attack and deal damage at the same time which honestly takes a bit to get down especially when no two different animal species attacks are the same, so watch out!   On top of everything else there's quest's and villagers that you can help and work with and complete to get extra stuff.   For my rating of this I would flat out give it a 10/10 for at this point i've only played 5-ish hours but yet have merely scratched the surface of that which is Crashlands. I hope that my review was helpful to all those who eye gaze at this game and like me, choose to give it a shot :) you have my honest word when i say it's worth every penny, enjoy!",

The game is a major grindfest. I absolutely love Terraria and thought this game might be somewhat similiar with all the crafting and bosses but it is not at all.  Here is a quick rundown of what I've come across so far   Every enemy has different attack patterns which is cool. Problem, all the enemies pretty much 1 shot you. The 'bigger' versions of your enemies, which are just larger recolored version of the basic enemies will legitimately 1 shot you when you're 'on par' with their gear. Meaning no matter how much you grind for weapons and armor you will most likely get killed instantly if you're where you're suppose to be story wise. Absolutely ridiculous and it is pretty much the main reason I'm falling off this game.   The combat like I said is frustrating because of the 1 shot thing but apart from that I'd relate it to Don't Starves mechanics. Hit and run hit and run. Which can be fun but when the majority of the game is to get materials from enemys (and the enviroment) it gets really dry to hit and run all day.   Grinding is tedious and extremely boring and this game is pretty much that. Just mine mine chop chop mine pick mine chop pick mine. blegh. No thanks. I felt like I was getting nowhere.   The first boss I ran into was cool but my character was so slow it was very difficult and annoying to fight her. Still haven't been able to beat her because I can't outrun her spam.  There are a lot of fetch quests. I'm a not a fan of go here do this come back to me. I ran into a lot of these quests and it seems like most of them are not optional because its how you unlock higher level gear.   Haven't dabbled in the creation part of this game but I'm not sure there is a point to it other than solely looks. Your base doesn't really matter, it's just your crafting hub.   I'm going to give this game more of a chance and hopefully my opinion will change but as it stands it is boring.  ",

            "review_text": "Mechanically this game works perfectly well - Everything it tries to do works exactly as it's intended to.  Unfortunately it's also slow, tedious, grindy to an  absurd  degree (with literally hundreds of resources needed to create some objects - resources which are only available in certain areas, cause nearby enemies to attack you, with each node giving at most three and sometimes  none  of the resource you need), and most egregious of all:  Horribly  unfunny.  Imagine that guy at the party with no social skills whatsoever; the guy who thinks shouting and making silly noises are the same things as humour, the guy who gets on everyone's nerves, but you stoically endure his screeching voice and braying laughter as he quotes last night's episode of Family Guy for the third time in five minutes. You endure it because you know that if you don't, he'll either sulk and ruin the mood or wind up screaming his head off before lashing out or smashing something in a fit of autistic rage, then finally storming out leaving everyone to awkwardly shift and shuffle around trying to avoid each other's gazes.  This game is that guy.",

            "review_text": "This isn't a bad game. The basic harvest/fight/build gameplay is good, though it gets a little grindy and repetitive. If its kind of humor is up your alley then it's really funny. There are some irritating bugs and ridiculous load times but nothing major. The main thing is that it's not worth $15, not even close. The $5 it costs on phones is much more reasonable though still a little high.",

            "review_text": "Devs said that WASD was 'on the horizon' but unfortunately now they've changed their mind and will not be implementing it.  [EDIT: Devs have changed their mind AGAIN and said they may look into this - only time will tell..]  Combat consists of clicking on the enemy then clicking on a safe patch of land when they attack. Due to their fast attack speed you will only get 1-2 hits in before you have to move. So you're constantly clicking from side to side.  Combine this with the fact that some enemies have an enormous amount of hp that takes a few minutes to wear down, and abilities that kill you in 1 shot, and you have a very frustrating experience.  Further combine with with the fact that you only have 1 other ability (a short stun on a long cooldown), and combat gets very tedious very quickly. You can craft bombs that do 75% of your damage which is useless on single targets (and you can't fight more than one with the speed of their attacks and the dodging required).  The rest of the game is running around collecting things and crafting.  That's literally all there is to the game. Tedious oversimplified combat and lots of padding. There is no real game here.  The humor is great and really drew me in, and there is lots of grinding/padding/crafting/upgrading to keep players looking towards the next big thing, but the game itself is not fun to play.  Also, the game suffers with controls designed for mobile.  I didn't have any crashes and the graphics are colourful, although there is almost no variety in the ground types or mobs. and no real biomes to speak of. I ran south for 1 hour and everything was basically the same except some of the mobs changed colour and got larger. In terms of stability the game is mostly good, but it does freeze for up to a minute when you open the map if you have not opened it in a while which is really annoying.  Overall, the game is polished, looks nice and has humorous elements, but is a padded grindfest with no real gameplay to speak of and ultra tedious combat. Grab it on sale to relax with but don't expect too much.  Right now I cannot recommend it.",

First it worked fine, well at least the menu screen worked, I don't know if anything else worked, but then I got this - now really terrible - Idea to get a BscotchID and after I logged in it instantly crashed. Kinda Ironic a game called crashland crashes hehe...  I will update the review when it's fixed  Really dissapointed  *Update*  Switched profile to guest and now the menu screen doesn't make me crash :D   but...  When I try to make a world it does... I really don't recommend this game but I will update the review again when and if the problem is fixed or if I can fix it.  If I can, I'll tell here how.  *Update*  Sorry guys it didn't work, I tried with login in and I crashed instantly then I tried to make a save in guest mode but that crashed it to and the forum post solution doesn't apply to my problem because I have always had those settings. thanks anyway guys, for trying, I really appreciate it and good luck with the game development",
