    "description": "What if you had to get a hole-in-one on every hole? Fantasy Fairways is a golf game where you design your own path to the hole. Bounce the ball off trampolines, zoom through different power ups, even take it through wormholes -- several gizmos let you express yourself. The game is all about balancing your own creativity and skill.",
