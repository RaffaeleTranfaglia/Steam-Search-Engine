            "review_text": "Where do i begin? From the moment that I began the game, I knew i was going down ♥♥♥♥ Avenue. Not only does the game not let me turn down the video quality, but it starts in a 2008 style launcher, giving me little to no customization of the game. Upon entering the game itself, the menu at the start had no choice for any options at all, not even audio (which ♥♥♥♥♥ my ears upon launch). Once i finally loaded the game after what seemed like countless screens beforehand, the game actually looked very nice. This however, was just a cover up for a horribly designed piece of ♥♥♥♥. Taking my first step in the game i knew that the game was going to be dogshit. There was a simulated headbob that was quite unrealistic to real life since i am not a bobblehead. Next, like every other scary game, the lights sudden 'go out'. This is quite unoriginal and i expected nothing less from a 3 dollar dog ♥♥♥♥. The 'scary' aspect of the game wasn't even scary at all. I encountered the antagonist twice, and neither times did he scare me but I could have assumed this due to the fact that the main enemy of the game is an unevolved primate. All in all, this is the biggest waste of 3 dollars. I would ahve much rather given the money to a prostitue for a hug. Thanks Bernard Nicolas, for making me realize there is something worse than the holocaust. My warmest reguards, BigWeinerJenkins.",

It takes some getting used to at first in order to get the basic mechanics down and get a technique. But other than that it is awesome and there are new updates constantly to keep the game interesting.",

Things that I would like to see in next updates: *In-game options *Pause  *Co-Op version with 6 generators to find (WOULD BE SO COOL!!!) *More information about what you need to do to win the game And the thing I think would be the best: 1v1 with your friend when one of you is the monkey and the second one the guy who finds the generators :-) I know it would sound so hard to do but It is just my opinion for that what I would love to see in the game. Cheers. I hope the game will develop quickly and goodly (whatever that means) Btw. love the developer for giving me this game for free :* &lt;3",
