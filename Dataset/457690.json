            "review_text": "UPDATE UPDATE: They have removed the new achievements as of this writing.  OLD UPDATE: They have recently added four new achievements, making the player complete 100 of these rooms in order to get all the achievements.......... AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE BLACK DEATH!   This is what's considered a 'game' these days?  Horrible. Absolutely horrible.   It's just a black screen, no music, around 10 total text notifications, with brief stock sound effects. Even with this minimal amount of 'gameplay', it's still frustrating; you tend to get stuck on objects in the room, and I guarantee you will sigh frequently as you hunt for the last thing you're supposed to do, just waiting for it to be over.  Speaking of the objectives, let's talk about those... you get a list of objectives that don't change each time, just the locations of these objects in the small, black room. They are boring things such as 'brush your teeth', and 'sleep', though why you'd need to sleep when you're trying to brush your teeth and seemingly get ready to leave is beyond me.  Now for the only positive this game has: the achievement. This game has one achievement, for finishing the short, short game (around 3-5 minutes), but even then you have to beat this nightmare twice in order to get the achievement, as it seems to be bugged the first time you complete the room.   So yeah, this is obviously someone trying to throw together the most minimal, bare bones of playability and put a two dollar price tag on it in hopes of making any amount of money that they can with this throwaway garbage. I'd say it's a scam, but it does function, just in the most basic way that would be embarrassing for even a student project. Trying to charge money for this heap is where I draw the line, however.   So if you simply MUST get this game, just to pad out your perfect game number, just make sure you idle it for over 15 minutes, so that it will count on Astats. And remember that the dev is laughing at you (and me) for purchasing this, while he sips on Cristal from his ruby-encrusted goblet.",

As a university student learning Tourism and Leisure Management, this game was kind of fun and insult. :D Even thought it was just 18 minutes I enjoyed it but wouldn't recommend it for that price, maybe if you want to prank a friend or something. (Loved the new Update with all those invisible achievements added...xD)",
