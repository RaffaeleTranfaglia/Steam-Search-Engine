            "review_text": "Most of the negative reviews here are because of technical issues that are solvable on most systems. Fullscreen works by pressing ALT+Enter (maybe not while in the menu or title screen or cutscene, but ingame), widescreen support is available via a hack. On some systems, the resolution may be limited to 640x480 or 800x600, but that is not the normal behaviour. You should get the highest 4:3 resolution closest to your native resolution without a patch. XBox controllers are not officially supported because this game uses directinput for controller support, which is the predecessor to xinput. If you have one of the recent Logitech gamepads (F310 for example), you can choose between directinput and xinput via a hardware switch on the controller, then map the controller keys correctly (setup controller) and the game works out of the box. If you have to use an xbox compatible controller, you have to fiddle around to get the trigger keys working. This is because the trigger keys are analog and on the same axis on the xbox compatible controllers, but are two seperate digital keys on the older standard. Please note that this game was developed before the xbox compatible controllers had been invented! It would have been nice of Capcom to have this version revamped like they did for PS3 and XBox, but they have not. It is not optimized for the PC and it is an old game, but I still think it is awesome.",

I have a guide on how to fix the shotty controller settings for MotioninJoy, so that isn't much of a issue if you have a ps3 controller for the game.   So if you get this game, and not a cry baby about 'my game isn't always at 60FPS!' then this game is for you..   If not, There is the DmC HD collection for console. Which is also nice when that doesn't glitch.(which only happend once to me.)  Kinda amazed steam allows the game to have so many bugs though, and still be sold. Felt it should of been fixed long ago.   ",

            "review_text": "before you read my review or buy the game remember DMC3 is a amazing game I highly suggest you buy it, I have bought it three times now but DON'T buy the pc version if you don't want to tear your hair out in frustration but more of that later.  Lets start the actual review now shall we?  First the story - The story takes place a few years before the first devil may cry, Dante who has yet to pick a name for his shop is just hanging around when a man named Arkham enters and tells Dante his brother has a invitation for him. Dante is then attacked by lessor demons but quickly (and stylishly) kills them all and this starts the events of the game and overall the story is pretty good best in the series has some insane motioncapture and good voice acting (compared to DMC1 and DmC this is oscar worthy)   Second the styles - You can choose between four different styles which are Swordmaster where your melee weapons have more moves, do more damage and let you combo in the air easily, Gunslinger lets you use your guns in extremely stylish ways from spinning in mid air while fireing down to curb stomping a demon while shooting him in the head and its a pleasure to watch the animations, Royalguard works as a block button but it doesn't stop there sure you can block and take reduced damage but if you perfectly time your block you can absorb all damage and release it in a extremely damaging attack that if you build enough damage up you can instant kill some of the tougher demons, Trickster gives you another type of dodge, a teleport, a air dash and the ability to run on walls, Trickster can be used to create insane combos if you know what you're doing. There are two other styles quicksilver and doppleganger which let you slow down time and create a copy of yourself and thats about it but if used right are deadly (doppleganger unlocks a hidden two player mode to)   Third the combat - The combat in this game is insanely fun with a total of 5 devil arms (melee weapons) and 5 fire arms (guns) for Dante and the ability to bring any combination of weapons (two devil arms two fire arms) and one of 6 styles to choose from this game has a crazy ammount of depth in its combat especailly since all weapons and styles (except doppleganger and quicksilver) can be upgraded and gain more moves.   Fourth Extras - With the special edition you are able to play as Vergil who has 3 devil arms and no fire arms but shoots summond swords instead and a single style (he has less depth then Dante but is fun to play) After you beat the game once you can start a new game as Vergil you will be given a cutscene that takes place before DMC3 but don't get your hopes up he ends up going through the same levels as Dante (from the Devil May Cry all the way to hell) The style switcher mod does work on Vergil but you can only use dark slayer (Default style) and Dante's quicksilver style (due to the other styles not working right or them already being a part of Dark Slayer)  Fifth should you buy it - In short yes you should buy this game...... if you have a playstation 2 the pc version is a extremely bad port and it is fixable (I fixed it after spending over 10 hours configureing it) it just takes a lot of time and a lot of reading user guides on how to fix it. On the brightside of the pc version is the ability to mod and the famous style switcher mod (go get it now) which lets you change to any of the 6 styles at any time in game without having to stop at a statue to change them (it also comes with other features that let you customize the game further but I won't get into that)  If you use a controller be prepared to break it in half with your teeth out of pure rage when you find out the triggers don't work and the sticks are reversed (right stick moves you left stick turns camera) there are fixes for this but they don't always work and if you are useing Motioninjoy be prepared to just quit (I made a discussion post on how to fix a ps3 controller with motioninjoy but if you are useing any other controllers good luck to you)  I also hope you have a somewhat decent computer cause this game runs like hell the framerate is subpar and requires you to delete audio files (really?) to get the framerate up but it stops the badass soundtrack from playing if you do so (luckly for me my computer can handle it)   Final - Do i recommend this game? again yes if you can get a console copy or if you are willing to spend 10+ hours fixing it, if you have no choice but to buy it on PC buy it when it goes on sale it usualy drops down to $7.50 but this is one of my favorite games of all time it just has a bad pc port   Let's Rock!",

            "review_text": "You REALLY need to want to play this game if you want to fix everything in this terrible port. You need to download the style switcher mod and/wide-screen mod (and delete some songs out of the soundtrack) to make it playable at least. With the style switcher mod you can have 1080p/60fps gameplay galore but be warned it can become a hassle to install.   Now to the game.  This is still to this day the king of the character action/spectacle brawler genre. The trifecta would go as dmc3, bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden Black. To this day no other action game has the complexity and freedom that this game provides in its more or less 20 missions. This is no 'dial-a-combo' action game, you're free to create your own combos as you wish, just remember that with that freedom comes the weight of complexity as it is no easy game. The skill ceiling goes through the roof, just look at any MAD combo on YouTube. The good thing is that this game is constantly challenging and if you're willing to put the work it will grow with you abilities. There's a lot of difficulty modes which you unlock by beating the game in the difficulty that comes before it and with each new difficulty comes new challenges, a more aggressive AI and even a mode where you cannot get hit. Seriously...this amount of depth has not yet been rivaled by any game in the genre.   TL;DR : if you like action games, tough bosses, depth in your combat mechanics, freedom to play as you want, a difficulty that has a pretty high ceiling but eases you up into it this is the game for you. Be aware that you have to be willing to pull off the mods to make it work correctly and also be aware that this game asks a lot from you as s gamer. If you're up to the challenge and you're willing to put in the time this is s sure recommendation. Just like crossfit or a pretty long book, this isn't for everybody but if you're up for the challenge I assure you you'll love it.",

It will make one of the boss fight unable to be attacked with a melee weapon.  Also, you don't want it to drop below 50 fps (this may be possible even on a relatively powerful rig; it's truly a bad port). DMC3 requires good timing and good reflex - low fps will screw you up.  And perhaps contrary to most people, I did find playing with a keyboard to be more convenient and reflexive, especially when it comes to changing weapons, and going 'full assault' with Vergil. Do try playing with a keyboard, seriously. ",

Pros: - Vergil's fancy, badass combos. - Dante's usual personality.+Combat. - Dat music. - Bosses are fun to kill as well as challenging. - The mod fixes make the game even better depending on your tastes. Either remain with the single style, or play like DMC4 with the instant style switching.  Cons: - Weird screen resolutions. - XBOX 360 controller takes a bit a meddling to fix and get going. - The music and sound can sometimes cause the game to lag.",

            "review_text": "One of the best video games of the character action genre, one of the best shallow popcorn action movies you'll ever watch, and the true 'start' of the Devil May Cry series as far as I'm concerned (and I don't mean chronologically, though it is also the earliest game canon-wise). I've played this game many times over the years on the original PS2 and in its HD re-release on PS3. I've loved it each and every time and I still love it now.  Things you should know about this PC port: Yes, it's a shoddy port, but no, the PC version in its mod-less state is NOT unplayable. You just need to muck around a bit and you'll be fine with the game as-is (though the game will still run at much less than the natural 60 fps sometimes without mods, but it's still very playable under 60). (EDIT: Looks like after installing the K-Lite Codec Pack Mega and its Updates that I mention later on in this review, the number of drops in the framerate have reduced quite a bit. I guess the issue was tied to system codecs somehow. END EDIT)  Some tips to get it running without mods:   - Run the gamepad setup app that comes with the game before playing if you want to use a gamepad (and for a game like DMC3 that was designed with a gamepad in mind, you REALLY should). You'll need to disconnect any XInput gamepads (like an Xbox 360 gamepad) before using the setup app or playing the game; this game was made before XInput, so it's just not supported properly and will argue about it if it's still connected. What WILL work is a DInput (Direct Input) gamepad. I personally find that a DualShock 4 works perfectly (make sure you disable any background programs that will make the DS4 emulate a 360 gamepad). Edit the bindings in the app as you see fit, click the Save button multiple times until you see the 'saved' popup, exit the app via its Exit button, and your gamepad should be good to go.   - The game might crash during the opening pre-rendered videos due to possible codec incompatibilities. If you encounter this, downloading and installing a codec pack for your PC might fix this. I personally recommend the K-Lite Codec Pack Mega (if you choose this, don't forget to also download and install the separate Update app on the K-Lite Codec Pack website after downloading and installing the K-Lite Codec Pack).   - The game might display strange resolutions in the Options (like 0x0) if you have a multiple monitor setup going. Unfortunate, I know, but that's why it's a shoddy port. Switching to only 1 monitor output before playing is best to choose the resolution you want. After choosing the desired resolution and making a save file, any time you start the game after, it will remember the resolution you chose, even if you re-enable multiple monitors and it goes back to displaying strange resolution in the Options.   - The game will start windowed by default. To go back and forth between fullscreen, make sure the window has focus and hit Alt+Enter (it will unfortunately sometimes crash when doing this; I find it's safest to do it while you're in the Options menu).   - The game was made in the era of 4:3 televisions (after all, it was a PS2 game first and foremost), so all offered resolutions will be in 4:3. If you are going to fullscreen, make sure your display uses the correct aspect ratio to avoid a stretched image (personally, I have to use my separate graphics card settings app to switch from scaling by aspect ratio to scaling by fullscreen, and then I have to set my actual display's settings to output in 4:3, though the specifics may vary depending on your setup).   - There's no 'Exit Game' option in the game, so to exit, you have to exit fullscreen and hit the window's close button to close it. When you do, THEN you'll actually get a 'Quit Game' choice in-game. Choose 'Yes' to close.   - There can be quite a bit of screen tearing at times. However, the game DOES technically support V-sync. To enable it, however, you'll have to do it from your separate graphics card settings app.  So yeah, it IS a shoddy port, but the game without mods is still very much playable if you're willing to put in a bit of elbow grease for this old title. I'd say it's worth it, though; this game is a hell of a ride and a hell of a gem! And hell, you can still use the mods too if you want after all this, why not =p",

It's not entirely unplayable as some may lead you to believe, but it's bad enough to make you want to not play the game despite how fun it is. Most console controllers will refuse to work for the game and what DOES work will leave you wanting more, such as not being able to use one of your joysticks. You CAN download a program to fix this and it's really not the main issue with the port because it can be fixed. The real problem comes from the fact that you will have massive, and I mean MASSIVE fps drops in multiple locations resulting in it being neigh unplayable. But in those non-large areas where fps is stable and you fix the controller up, it works rather well for a port.  I wouldn't recommend it because it's far too much work to get everything in working condition. (At this point there might even be a fix for the FPS drops but I didn't care to look for it)  THAT ALL BEING SAID If you don't have a problem with everything I said, feel free to pick up this game.",

For those new to the series PLEASE do not buy this port! I highly recommened instead buying it either for the PS2 or the HD collection for the XBOX 360/PS3 to see how amazing this game really is.  EDIT 16/01/15: A mod called 'style switcher' for this PC port has literally fixed almost every issue completely, it makes the game look 10 times better with fog and gamma fixes, fixing the terrible controller button layout, 1080p support (making it sharper and more crisp than the HD collections DMC 3) and widescreen, even allowing you to switch styles with both Dante and Vergil just like in Devil May Cry 4!!!  Unfortunately however the framerate issue still applies, but this can be fixed by removing a select amount of audio files (but that means less badassery during combat :c). If you ever (though i'd still not recommend this crappy port) decide to get this PC port please mod it with the style switcher mod!",
