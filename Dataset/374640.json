I was wishing there were more depth like spacechem, but there's only two types of 'combiner engines' and it quickly turns into doodle god with memes, trying all the combinations until you get bored and check the wiki.

Also, $9.99 MIGHT be a litle bit pricey but it is usually a good price when it goes on sale so buy it then.",
