            "review_text": "First, I think it is best to start by saying that if you are looking for a good racing sim that covers the F1 2014 season then this is a must have. It gives you the new turbocharged cars, the 2014 track list and the 2014 roster (exempting some mid/late season changes).    There are a lot of reviews that call this a 'copy/paste' of F1 2013's gameplay. That is correct but only because F1 as a actual sport is not one that changes it's entire rule structure, driver roster or track schedules in massive ways. it's a sport so any evolution is going to be slow and gradual. Going into F1 2014 with the understanding that it gives you exactly what it's title says (a F1 2014 season game) will probably save you from getting super upset.   I mean, seriously. Are people expecting races on the moon or something? Perhaps Jet powered cars with missile launchers? It's a F1 sim/game so it is going to use the material that the actual sport provides.   The only really significant downer is the lack of 2013's classic mode but considering how limited in scope the classic mode is in 2013, I suppose I can understand why they want to wait until they can really do more with that concept and I don't think F1 2014 was the place for them to do that (though I think expectations are high for F1 2015).   So, with that out of the way, lets talk about specifics.   1.) Graphics. This title is not going to be a massive jump from 2013 but it does the job perfectly. The car models look fantastic. The tracks look good and effects still do the job as well as you would want them to. The real standout however is the rain effects. Codemasters seems to understand the importance of good rain effects and how it effects the gameplay.   2.) Sound. The sound is great. The cars sound correct and reflect the 2014 move to 6cyl turbocharged power units. The rest of the effects do the job just fine and give you plenty of situational awareness.   3.) Physics/handling. This is where I think a lot of people have the wrong attiude in their reviews. They get so used to 2013's handling (with more downforce and less torque) that the 2014 cars can come as a surprise since they feel ENTIRELY different. This can make it difficult for those that mastered F1 2013 and some will get frustrated at having to adapt to a new driving style (just like the real drivers had to deal with). The handling is a real high-point in F1 titles and this is no different.   4.) Gameplay modes. It does not have the classic mode which is fine but the rest of the normal options are still there. The only big change is the switch from a long 'young drivers test' to a short evaluation lap which can either be welcome or unwelcome depending on your skill level going in.   Overall. while it lacks the classic cars and tracks of 2013. It still provides a solid F1 2014 season experience that accurately reflects the technical changes in a satisfying way. If you want a sports franchise to change in leaps and bounds then you probably are not being reasonable but I suspect that a lot of the big stuff is being saved for the F1 2015 release.  ",

            "review_text": "This game gets a lot of hate but I personally preferred it to F1 2013. Simply because I find it more accessible as a more casual player who uses a gamepad. F1 2014 is more pad friendly, and overall more forgiving than F1 2013 in my opinion. I am not saying 'it is better than F1 2013' because that's purely a matter of opinion and depends what sort of game you prefer. I got it cheap and for what I paid I've more than had my money's worth and enjoyment from it.",

Since Yes and No are the two options, however, I'll give it a Yes.  With the livery of every single car, the engine sounds, gears and everything else changed to match the 2014 season, I expected great things from this game. However... after I bought it (on sale, mind you), I remembered how quickly I got bored of F1 2013, and that game had many more features such as the Classic cars and tracks. I started to think I had made a massive mistake.   Once I got into the game, though, I felt like it wasn't all that bad. The cars were nice to drive and the new tracks were very well done. I did face the same problem I did in 2013 and that was the Intermediate difficulty was too easy for me and the Expert difficulty was just too hard, but that's probably just me.  Overall I would recommend this game, but I'd advise you only buy it if it's on sale. It's not worth paying full price for it if you have any of the older games.",

Schedule remains the same, unchanged, slightly sad.  In general, if you have not played these games, I advise you to buy. If you play, you better wait for the next part, have nothing to lose.",

Firstly, as with any serious simulator, F1 2014 is designed for high-end PCs with the decent wheel and analog pedals that allow precise acceleration and braking. When you try to play on the console or with a gamepad, you’ll be severely disappointed: the game even on the Very Hard setting will became much easier. The second major drawback is the lack of full replays.  76/100",

            "review_text": "This game is the third consecutive F1 instalment I played and third that’s probably going to get more than 100 hrs of my attention. Even though people bash this game for basically everything from graphics to content-related mistakes to less fun from the gameplay, I found it just as enjoyable as 2012 and 2013.   Why do I like it?  Basically it’s a new formula. New teams, new cars, new steering wheels, new rules. I was actually shocked by how much the car handling has changed. When I stopped playing 2013 game I was ruling the grid in a Lotus (4th best team of the season) with legendary AI setting and all assists off. I got into 2014 Ferrari using the same difficulty settings and in the first race qualified… 18th. The game is still demanding (maybe even more), some new aspects of driving were tweaked (in this one you can see and feel tyres cooling down on long straights, which creates a new set of challenges). And even though Mercedes are quite dominant in the game it is possible to win driving a different car, and some race events (like mid-race rainfall) can shuffle the grid in a way which creates way more interesting result than in real F1 timetables. The game surely isn’t flawless, but its strong roots still make it a solid product.   Why some people have a point bashing this game?  Yes, the new cars don’t have KERS, so there is no “boost” button to press when you feel you’re not fast enough. Presence of the 8th gear isn’t much of addition in terms of gameplay. Yes, Williams definitely has the wrong steering wheel. And yes, some tracks are unchanged, even though some of them were in reality altered for 2014 season. This last one isn’t entirely true. Canadian GP has a modified asphalt run-off area which was covered with grass in 2013, and some new buildings appeared in Monaco (most notably on the left of the famous tunnel exit). Plus two completely new tracks appeared on the calendar. The fact that some tracks were updated, while others were just pasted form the previous game makes me feel that development of the game was cut short at some stage.  I still love the graphics, but what I have a problem with is that the cars somehow got ugly on the details. And I don’t mean generally uglier car designs. In 2013 I loved the front wing camera in the replays, in 2014 it just shows how underdeveloped the car model is in terms of detail. Just closely watch the nose and floor of Ferrari F14T – you’ll notice some very crude edges and weird shapes.  Some people say that this game is just a 2013 mod featuring new cars. Sadly I have to agree. The full price is regrettable. Probably marketing strategy is meant make money of the newcomers. A person who had the previous game and buys this one for a full price may get furious.   Do I recommend it?  Let’s say a conditional “YES”. I marked “recommend” for this review because I have positive feelings about the game. But it clearly does not deserve thumbs up and “hell yeah”. You should definitely buy this game IF you are an F1 fan who wants to experience how formula changed in 2014, or if you like race simulations and haven’t tried F1 yet. And most definitely if you find this game on sale. The 2015 game will hopefully be better and all “next-gen”, but so far this is the only one with turbo engine F1 cars.   PS: Fromula 1 fan ranting (you can stop reading, unless you are an F1 fan too, or a 2015 developer :)  I found that the game was dumbed down a bit in terms of campaign interface, first race and team choosing. It’s nice that you can now select “length” of the season (number of featured races), but if they add an option of shortening a season I’d like to manually discard some of the races from the calendar. Some people liked replacing testing day with a simple racing sequence to evaluate player’s skills, like in GRID series. But I’m afraid it doesn’t work too well. When I tried it I found that it was around 1 lap of the simplest track (Monza) and all the assists were by default on. I almost crashed on the first corner when I started fighting with AUTOMATIC gearbox in an F1 car. Nice for newcomers, but will irritate the hell of the gamers who actually know what they’re doing. Also now you get to choose ANY team at the start of your career. A rookie in Mercedes AMG? Why the hell not. It actually doesn’t bother me since everybody can immediately choose their favourite team, and not struggle with Marussia or Caterham (yuck) for at least half of the season. What bothers me is that the team’s performance is defined at the starting point. Generally the developers decided that the big three is Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari. This hurts Williams which had a terrific 2014 season and their performance in the game is way lower than it should be.  ",

However, if you use a controller then steer clear, do not waste your money! The handling model is ruined in this one. Driver aids are forced upon you and it makes everything drive like junk. This is applicable to you whether you used assists before or not. Though if you didn’t use assists then the difference is even more aggravating. All the nice driving feel is gone. For them to claim this was in the name of accessibility is just baffling. The games have always had options to turn assists on for new players. Why couldn’t these new assists be included in said options? How does it make sense to force them upon people who purposefully turn assists off!?  What is left is a game where driving is a chore not a challenge. The cars feel awful but at the same time you will find it hard to ever spin or lock a tire. Instead you will be stuck throwing yourself into corners like an idiot because the traction control will just do the work for you, otherwise you can’t keep up. Driving fast with a controller in this game feels like cheating and going back to 2013 I was well aware of how much worse of a driver it had made me.  In terms of content the only real addition is a shortened career mode, in which you advance through teams by setting their drivers as rivals and beating them in a best of 3 races. I actually think this is pretty cool and I hope it stays in the series. Apart from that everything is the same but they cut the classic cars and tracks, along with a lot of the new driver testing stuff.   This is what you get when you take a franchise that already struggles for new content because of its annual release schedule, then tell the developers they actually have less time than usual because their 2015 version needs to be next gen and released early than usual. Hopefully it makes up for this mess.  Skip this one. ",

For gamepad users, I assure you everytime you play this game you will get this bug/glitch where your car suddenly starts to move either to the left/right (commonly right). I\\'m not fully blaming Codemaster for this bug/glitch, I started to suspect Windows 10 that might cause this problem. Overall the game looks pretty cool, I thank the person who made the graphics look so realistic also the detail in the car, crowd, grass, circuit, etc. Sadly I can\\'t give a good review about the game until either Microsoft or Codemaster fix this tiny problem. Remember that many people put a lot of effort into this game! Bought a steering wheel, upgrade their RAM so they can play the game lagless, wasting their time eventhough there are important things to do, and so much more just for a game.  Anyway if your using Windows below 10, I can promise you that this and all F1 games works perfect and smoothly (if you have the minimum specs of course). Peace Out!",

But after 18 times the same race (couse i wanted really bad to beat my rival) i managed to be 4th, last lap and out of nowhere, with zero speed, i got out of the way and turned over, that was the last thing i could stand.
