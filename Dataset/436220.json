            "review_text": "WOW!!!  This is the perfect example of an arcade shmup realised in virtual reality.  There are a couple of other titles in this genre already on the market but this one is by far my favourite. The weapons are simple but with a great feeling of power. One is a one hit instagib type railgun, the other is a slower full auto plasma gun.   The way to get high scores is by not missing so put the railgun in your dominant hand and when you have time line up your shots for maximum combo scores. When things get out of hand (and they do, oh boy they do) spray and pray with the plasma gun.  Its a simple game with no story and very little depth, but for the same price as a pint this is amazing value for money. Well done dev for putting a realistic price on your title. And well done for making something that is polished and perfectly playable.  9/10",

Single player life span i cant imagine would be to long being a wave shooter(but an insanely fun one with a soundtrack that reminds me of old arcade shooter games with more base following the tempo of the game.  Where i think this will shine (and ill be trying it out on friends this weekend) will be in a party /vr gathering situation where the competition will have you ducking driving side stepping faster and harder to beat those scores..  At a steam summer sale price it is now YOU WOULD BE CRAZY TO NOT BUY IT!!",

Difficulty is very very balanced and maneuver your body while shooting at the same time is so BRILLIANT!. Hope other game developer learn from this guy about how to make full use of Vive! I highly recommend this game to everybody and really really give you good workout without getting repetitve gameplay. Space Pirate Trainer game is a joke compare to this game!",

It's retro sexy. And the games don't go one forever, so it you have a group over to try out VR, everyone gets a try. And it's cheap!  Instant classic.",
