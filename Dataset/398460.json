            "review_text": "Mooch is adventure game what have a very unique style. In this game you are a small creature what been created by evil lord: 'Puppet Master'. In this dark underground world you and other same creatures forced to work to yours devil creator. Once you and your friend named Tula decided to escape from there, but sadly a lord captured you and your friend. Tula was been torn apart after this, the part of her soul was scattered in whole dark dungeon.   So this is a main story of game, your mission is first escape from a prison and collect all parts of you friend in this dungeon. But not all so easy how sounds. Here you will found a lot of different blades, enemies and bosses what you should avoid or beat. Overall more than 25 type enemies and 9 bosses you will found here. For all you should chose a different tactic and be very careful, because when you die you should start from the beginning the actual level. To beat a level you should collect all parts of souls on that level. The game control is enough easy, with keyboard you are moving and with mouse you are look around, also you can easily set a mouse sensitivity. Also a game have other very nice features for example a different story endings or a hidden passages. The graphic style is awesome, this is enough dark but looks very good and also this is hand-crafted! The game sound are also good.   So my verdict   +different endings +nice hand made graphic +nice story +challenging gameplay +different enemies +music and sounds fits to game +easy control +steam cards and achievements   -some level can be hard -sometimes can be frustrating when you die to many time   Well this game is unusual an challenging. The atmosphere and style is really dark, this well fitting to the story. Sounds and music is also fit to this all well. You can set difficulty at start, but this not bring to much help in some levels, so if you die again and again its can be frustrating. Anyway i really can recommend this game if you are want to get a some unusual and challenging for enough good price.",

            "review_text": " PROS  + Good usage of game features- There are not many types of enemies per level, but individual aspects of enemies are used well in level design and enemies are well-placed. + Cohesive art style. + Nice atmosphere. + Well-presented level design that fits with your small field of vision.   CONS  - There's a lot of precision movement- sometimes you slip between spikes without much breathing space and too much trial-and-error. - Limited options menu- literally just toggle fullscreen, change mouse sensitivity, change language, and toggle sound.   Overall Score: 7.5/10  Worth full price, easy game to pick up when you're bored.",

To complete this task he has to travel through different areas and defeat several dangerous bosses. Game runs fantastic on even old PCs, which is always a positive factor.  Buy it right now!",
