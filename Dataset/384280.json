This game isn't overloaded with flash and options, it's all about solid and strong design, bolstered by perfect-tuned graphics and audio. I'm a fan of the developer's other work so there was a lot to look forward to and I am not disappointed in the least! Great job guys, can't wait to see what is next-",

The game has a great sense of humor as it likes to poke fun at grandmaticalyly incorrect cutscenes that you would often see back in the era of 8 bit. The gameplay is pretty nice. Its fast and demands alot of attention. Did I mention you can chop dogs in half? Pretty cool. Its not worth its full price but if it ever goes on sale you should jump right on it.",

My only complaint is that your ninja REALLY loves to grab ahold of walls, and it becomes a pain to drop off of them. This will cause a TON of frustration and unnecessary deaths (luckily you get unlimited lives).",
