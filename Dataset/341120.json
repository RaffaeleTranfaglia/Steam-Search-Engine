You might want to try real life if you want that.   So, why do I recommend this game? I have a simple reason: THE EMOTES ARE GLORKTASTIC!  ;-; Emotes don't work here...   And if that doesn't convince you (which I highly doubt), remember that Glork and his best friend Super Backpack will tell you bad jokes until your brain explodes! Or until you quit.",

It features awesome art, incredible sound design, a cheery and absurd atmosphere, and even great characters!  The gameplay is as tight as in old coin-op shooters, and even if you aren't highscore chasing (which you should), there is plenty of wacky unlocks to pursue. Every second you play go toward that progress, which is always a nice touch of appreciation to the player from the designer. I played to no end the phone version. This PC port retains the same very tight control scheme (you are autofiring and only controlling movements) that feels perfectly at home here too. The only thing missing are friends or even global leaderboards, but that's okay 'cause I don't have friends and I am bad at games.  [Edit : actually there are leaderboards, but I fail to see them sometimes @_@]  Wonderful.",

Glorkian Warrior absolutely nails that feeling and takes me back!  Get this amazing game!",

It's a fairly simple Space Invaders type game but there's a charm to the art and humor that keeps me entertained. I imagine I'll tire of this after 5-10 hours but that's more than worth $1!",
