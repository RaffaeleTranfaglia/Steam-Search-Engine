            "review_text": "Jim Power is a classic, hard as nails, action platform shooting title that retro gaming fans will enjoy way into the night. The recent trend of 'pixel' art style games are because of titles like Jim Power- while super detailed, the graphics are still able to hold up due to trends in gaming today. What is even cooler is, right now, you get three games with one purchase in this deal.  PC version- original title, full of challenge. SNES version- port of the PC title. SNES Enhanced version- Piko made some adjustments to the SNES original, reworked a few things and added little stuff here and there. All around, this is the version to play.  Doesn't matter which version you play though, if you want a quality challenge then play Jim Power.",
