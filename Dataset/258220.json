            "review_text": "Very short game. I would call this a budget diablo game mixed with platforming elements. If i didn't play around so much, its possible to complete the game in 5 hours. By the time you get to the final boss you'll be op and clean the floor with him. The game isnt as bad as the community makes it seem. i completed the game with a controller, so maybe that helped a bit. Blood knights combat is pretty basic, lack of skills to obtain. youll basically be using the same 2 or 3 skills over and over, may get reptitive for most.  I don't know if i can recommend this game to anyone, but for people who are like me who like a linier experience with a slight repetitious combat system then go right ahead and enjoy the get/play the game.",

Soon enough I was given an opportunity to experience that. Blood Knights is one of those vamphyric games that I like. Running along and killing bad guys, monsters, warewolves sure is fun. And it is in this game. What is more, graphics are really juicy, and beautiful. But when it comes to the story itself it is as shallow as a hole dug by a child in a sand with a little spatula. Come on guys, you could have done better! It takes about 4 hours to finish this game on medium level of difficulty. At this rate heroes have best equipement and burst through waves of enemies without sweat. Dear player, a fan of vampyric games, if you are reading this, please mind that it would be better if you spend your money firstly on LEGACY OF KAIN series and then come back for BLOOD KNIGHTS.

Dialogues are written badly and synchronisation is out of character most of the time.  On the good side you will have some fun in local Coop, besides the bugs and aweful camera . I think it doesn't scale with player number which make it too easy.  If you can get it for a low price and want some fun nights with a friend in you basement it's adecent choice.  7/10 (Local Coop) ",

Cringe-worthy dialogue, wooden main characters, oftentimes uncooperative controls, and boss battles that only challenge your kiting abilities is what to expect if you play this game. I had hoped, by the positive reviews, that the game would be able to entertain me. It was hard to take the story and script seriously, especially with the development of the two main characters and how it basically flipped like a switch from 'sworn enemies' to 'fast allies'. I also use the term 'main characters' loosely, because Jeremy (male protagonist) has much more dialogue and screen time than does his counterpart, Alysa - the vampire with whom he is bonded.  I wanted to like the game, and came in with high hopes. I cannot recommend it, however.",

This may sound like a small thing, unworthy of attention, but i believe sharp and polished battle experience is the core value of this kind of action games, and its nearly impossible to get positive experience while you cant 'feel' strikes and dodges because of such animation and physics. And its not about graphics at all: models and textures are good enough for game with this price: its cheap, but looks nice. I also loved an idea to change between main characters within the battle. This game expect to be excellent action/slasher rpg if only developers spent a bit more attention for polishing battle engine and hire more skilled animator.",

Manage uncomfortable ( held on the controller ) . Play as Alice is almost impossible (where the sight of the character - hand ?) , And for Jeremy boring. Reception times two and miscalculated . The plot is largely trivial . Not the most successful arcade elements , possibly due to errors in the game design levels. Very boring . Pros - Present Russian language . Though unoriginal plot (especially tie) , but still a couple of interesting plot moves there . Grim surroundings . A bit like a series Castlevania. Simpotichnye female characters - when you look at outfits Alice doubly sorry about graphics quality ;) Bottom line - If absolutely nothing to buy, and then we can take. Maybe fans like vampires and the Middle Ages. But for fans hack'n'slay this year released The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.",

The female protagonist gives a voice over with as much passion as the recorded voice that plays after the dial tone ends. Much of the other characters have similar uninspired voice overs.  It does have decent combat, it is a button masher with a few power attacks that have cooldowns. The gear progression is nothing special, most of the purchases you could make from stores should be avoided because you will be finding the full sets in the treasure chests scattered through the next area. The rpg elements seem unnecessary as most of the important power ups are automatically awarded and the skill point distibution makes minimal difference on gameplay; the fake enemy difficulty is neutralized by adding a point to make your attacks deal more damage. This leaves a rather flat experience that could have been achieved by keeping the starting gear and starting enemy hit points and damage.  I can only recommend this if you can get it on sale for 80% off or so, and have someone to play the game with you. Was not terrible, was not great, just average and a little unpolished. If there was a neutral button, I would have clicked it instead.",

Frustrating at times trying to control things, then having to redo when I messed up... but I didn't really get overly ticked off. I've tried playing Alundra on the system &amp; as much as I liked the story, I just couldn't deal with the redos.  This one I find a little touch of obsession about saving can really save my butt and using a bit of strategy can get you farther than just rushing around killing and hoping you don't get killed. I really like the swap feature, but I'd like to try a co-op game to see how that works. I think I'd like it even better.  This is outside my usual style, but I found it really engaging, the combat was doable and the game makes you think as you progress. The story is also cool and the interaction between the two is great too. For someone that likes this sort of game it would be a great addition. For some that isn't used to this kind of game, I'd suggest giving it a try anyway.",

            "review_text": "I love the economics of the game. “How to gain the most gold and experience within limits” was a mini-game that I played continuously.  There’s nothing original about this game but for the life of me I couldn’t stop playing it. This is what it felt like playing Blood Knights. I enjoyed maximizing the gold boosts and experience boosts so that I could get those end tier weapons really quick from the shop trader. I think that alone was what kept me playing the game to the very end.  Some parts of the game are frustrating such as the platforming sequences due to undefined areas or camera shifting which lead to instant death. I’m forced to backtrack to checkpoints so that I don’t have to fight enemies over and over when I die due to bad jumps.  I like how my look changes when I change equipment. The graphics aren’t too amazing but they aren’t ugly either. Although I had fun playing on hard more the entire time, I wouldn’t play again even if there was a new game plus feature as there were a lot of aspects that were rough about the game such as the synching of cut scenes, odd voice acting, the hero becoming a sarcastic jester of sorts, enemy bosses that had potential to be great but were doomed to be uninspiring.  Blood Knights is a good bang for your buck as it a semi-solid action RPG that you can bite and suck on for a good few hours, granted that you are willing to ignore some of it’s flaws. It will suck a good chunk of your time and you won’t regret it as long as you buy this game during a sale.",
