The graphics (or rather, photography) and the enviroments are amazing, with a gloomy, lonely feel. The puzzles are very well crafted, they have introduced me to code systems that makes Silent Hill 3's puzzle hard mode seem easy in comparison.   I cheated a little at the end asking for help, but trust me that you that it feels extremely rewarding to do it for yourself. Also, one of the best aspects for the game is to do everything at your own pace, because once you advance 2 hours in the game, the map expands a lot, giving access to 4 additional stages and more sectors of the mansion, which you can all explore with little to no barriers...this is a thing that many lineal adventure games should be learning from : allow the player to explore freely.   Oh, and it manages to do all that while being PEGI 7",

Some of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult but that's what makes games like this worthwhile. It makes you think; though for me, the puzzles sometimes took my attention away from the overall story The environments are beautiful, the length of the game is suprisingly long, and the puzzles are intriguing, with one involving a photo really sticking with me. The one thing I will say is that while the map is useful, it doesn't have any labeling in terms of orientation. In a big house like the Manor, I got lost quite a few times.  Overall, a fantastic title worth of at least a playthough (or two).  Well done, Sushee!",
