            "review_text": "I don't think I've ever had so much fun being dismembered before. Focusing far more on action and fun than on realism, Chivalry is quite possibly my favorite multiplayer game of the last year. Easy to pick up, harder to master, and with an actual reward system in place for honing your skills, Chivalry is perfect for both the casual and hardcore gamer alike. Feel like having some crazy arene combat for 15 minutes before you leave for work? This game is right for you. Want to be up all night, storming the castle in a way that requires teamwork? This game is right for you. Want to prove you're the best to ever wield a sword, pike, axe, or bow and have all bow before you? This game is right for you. It isn't without its flaws, but there really is no other game that can provide you with an experience like this. Pick it up....you won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "Oh, Chivalry. What to say about you? I absolutely love the combat system, but boy oh boy can you be a buggy mess at times. I personally love the setting and the brutality of it, so I can get over it, but the bugs can get in the way at times, especially with the server. Couple that with most of the servers being completely empy, and about 10-12 that actually get filled up. The combat system is really great though. However, it can be frustraiting to get used to. I'm not even fully used to it yet, and I've played 11 hours so far. So the gameplay is great, what else is there to chivalry, you might ask? Nothing. Thats really the only other issue. Thats all it has to offer, and they want 25 bucks for it. I'd say they're asking a bit too much. This game almost always goes on sale during big sales, so if you're considering this one, wait until then. Its well worth the 6 bucks I put into it.   I can't really make this long, because there isn't much to say about chivalry other than it can be a lot of fun, but it can also annoy the living hell out of you. Especially if you just can't catch a break. The community is pretty good from what I've seen, although you're going to run into rude people in a multiplayer game, everyone should expect that. But the game is plenty of fun and well worth the 6 dollar sale price.  Pick this up if you enjoy multiplayer games, and are looking for something different than a modern military FPS or an MMO. Chivalry is well worth your time.     Buy At Full Price    ",

            "review_text": "Good game, although there's a great amount of unsolved bugs and balance issues in the game, mostly related to issues caused by pings.  If hard games frustrate or anger you, don't buy this unless you're prepared to go through hell. It's going to take you more than a couple hundred hours before you start getting a hang of the game's mechanics.  And if you're expecting a helpful and friendly community, temper your expectations... just a little bit. It's very rare to find high rank players that aren't complete dickbats. You will come across players who will intentionally try to get a reaction out of you for the sole purpose of being dickbats.  You'll also very likely get to hear a lot of 'rekt', 'ez' and 'git gud' when someone kills you. And it might seem funny now, but not when you're getting stabfeints in your face and it's your 20th death and you have 0 kills.  It might seem like I'm harping a little too much on this but seriously, this game's community is some of the worst I've seen and I think anyone considering buying the game should know before they buy anything.  (The game is also somewhat poorly optimized, which is something TBS has addressed and tried to fix in the past. Hence, it should not be played on highest settings even if you may think your computer can handle it. You won't be able to control your character properly if you have low frames. Oh and, you might want to adjust your FOV a bit or else you'll get claustrophobic. The default FOV is way too low to see incoming strikes.)",

            "review_text": "It's really worth buying. You know why? Because it's a totally unique game. How often do you see multiplayer medieval FPP/TPP game? It brings very refreshing feeling after all those modern shooters. And it's a really worthy representative of this rare kind of games.  Combat might seem very simple (only 3 kinds of blows: swing, overhead and thrust attacks), but unexperienced people who teamkill and whine about randomness of fighting prove it wrong :). Also, mastering your movement (ducking blows, parry timing, jumping over people's shields to attack them from above, drags, etc.) will take a long time. By the way: what other attacks would you use in real fight? There's nothing to complain about, it's not some kind of Japanese hack'n'slash, for Argon's sake!  There are no killstreaks or perks in this game. Is it a flaw? Not at all. It's an actual advantage! Congratulations to developers for that decision, because efectiveness should be an effect of player's skill, not some buffs which give you supernatural health or damage rate.  Community is generally great, far from typical 'CoD kids', people can discuss about many clever topics, you know, like a sir.  I also like high level of immersion: arrows wheezing next to your head, clanging of swords, rustling of hauberk... Imagine this with virtual reality headset...  Just think about one thing: why wouldn't you buy the game that is so immersive and exceeds the boundaries of run-of-the-mill, overhyped productions developed by companies focused on milking money from customers? Many people complain about Battlefield, Titanfall, Call of Duty games. Why aren't you encouraged yet to join the world which maybe doesn't feature tanks, planes or guns, but contains epic, close, often honorable combat and no ♥♥♥♥♥♥s camping in debris, killing you from 1000 m?  10/10, would join the Mason Order.",

            "review_text": "People need to understand that the skillgap in this game is absolutely unforgiving. You won't experience true flow in the gameplay until after about rank 40 (~300h into the game) and once there, you will still get ♥♥♥♥ on by higher ranks to the point of crying. After finishing the 10 min tutorial (which 90% of the bad review players completely missed) you will have 2 options; Play on the noob-friendly rank 0-15 servers that will breed you some hours into what seems to be the virtual version of kiddie football, that will paint you a false picture of how you think the game is. Or join a normal server. It will be hard and you will most likely spend more time waiting to respawn than playing. But you WILL eventually learn from every mistake, every death, every 'omfg exploit spinning hacker' etc and you'll become experienced to the point where you realize how much of a mechanically advanced masterpiece this game is. It will completely nullify combat like babby Skyrim, Mount &amp; blade, Soulsborne and more.  -If you're a 'casual' that can't be arsed using a brain this game is not for you. -If you can't handle stressful situations that requires milliseconds to none decisionmaking, then this game is not for you.  +But if you're an extremely competitive individual that wants to experience pure rewarding skill without ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG factors then there won't be a better melee game for you.  Bought it when it was on sale and it will forever be the best 6£ I've ever spent. So please ignore these plebs that thinks being bad=game is bad.",

            "review_text": "Well, there is a lot to be said about Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. It's a real love-hate relationship; sometimes leaving you with that feeling like your newly transplanted kidney just got prison chiv'd. It has had more 'updates' than any other game I can think of, for better or worse, always requiring you to rebind your keys. Some of the ingame taunts like 'Your brain is as dry as a biscut after a long voyage' or 'Your stupidity is no accident, it is your birthright!' accurately portrails a fair portion of the Chivalry: Medieval Warfare community.   The Cons: - Still uses dx9 (Can't utilize 64bit OS) - Updates sometimes make optimization worse - Limited online servers - Location restictive servers (80+ ping = poor performance) - Buggy textures or landscape that causes characters to get stuck - Steep learning curve, requires many gameplay hours - No shortage of trolls, emotional vampires, and snake oil merchants  The Pros:  - Ingame voting option (Next map/kick abusive player) - On sale often; lots of fresh meat - Active community with new maps/skins.  - Active game updates - Exciting melee combat - Teamwork potential  - High replay vaule - Endless comic scenarios  - Ingame taunts  This game is certainly unique, providing you a comical medieval experience and thrilling melee combat. Even for those who are unable to dedicate many gameplay hours, there are low ranking servers with many different gametypes. I highly recommend playing with friends or seek out a clan to bring out the best in the game's potential. Even with all the frustrations this game can throw at you, it has provided some of the most fun of any game I've ever played with friends.   Final Verdict: Medieval times awaits you now!

And he LOVES it, cause things go 'boom' &amp; its got all the things kids like...its DESIGNED for kids. But Chivalry, what a game! Way more skill &amp; practice is required to be considered a 'good' player. The skill ratio between players will cause you to rage A LOT of the time. You will encounter someone within rank 1 - 10, take them out n feel pretty good about it. Then you will turn the corner &amp; run into a rank 70 who is an absolute JEDI and you won't even be able to hit them....thats when the rage ensues. The thing is, YOU WILL GET BETTER. Every time you die in RRRRRAGE you will get better. And there is always the chance you are one of those players that will just pick up the game REALLY quickly. Im rank 36, and about 2 ranks ago was when other players would see me on the battlefield n then run in the opposite direction. Not gonna lie...it feels good XD.  Key things to know: adjust your mouse sensitivity accordingly. You swing your sword and use your mouse to delay or speed up the swings. DO NOT PANIC BLOCK when an enemy is rushing towards you...it means you are dead before the fight even starts. Archers who are a high rank will cause homicidal tendencies. People who use 'feint' will cause homicidal tendencies. Friendly fire is ALWAYS a thing. If you are surrounded by team mates while trying to kill an enemy, use your over-head swing or your thrust so you don't HIT ALL YOUR OWN TEAM MATES. I started out playing a Vanguard most of the time, but most ppl will recommend you start off practicing with a knight, just cause you are more heavily armoured. My advice, pick a class you like the feel off....n play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it to become good. There are PvP &amp; PvE options, PvE is fun and a good way to practice.  I always disliked all competitive 'deathmatch' type games (except Duke3D &amp; Blood), but Chivalry is just unique, and it won me over so quickly. The Emote system would have to be 1 of my favourite features in the game. I dunno where they got the voice actors, but they are funny as hell. The Mason Knights' emotes especially crack me up EVERY TIME. For the first time, ppl can spam emotes, I dont care....its just gonna make me laugh. The game, for what it is being sold for, is totally worth it. I've clocked 355 hours &amp; im just getting started! I've earned new weapon skins etc through my playing which is a wikkid reward. If you are looking for a competitive pvp game but are sick of CoD &amp; need a change, give Chiv a go. Just dont lose hope until your skill increases. FOR THE ORDER!",

My objective was to defend a village and its inhabitants from the Mason Order.  One person in particular that I remember vividly was a Mason Vanguard who I engaged in a duel after seeing him defeat one of my allies. I ran up to him with my longsword in hand (well, both of my hands) while his back was turned. He was preparing to bring his massive two-handed sword down to butcher another hopeless peasant.  He accidentially managed to hit me with a reverse overhead despite not knowing that I was behind him. Unfortunately, my loud yell of pain got his attention. I managed to get a few strikes in, but the first blow I took did a lot of damage and I fell on the battlefield. I watched with my dying breath as he started performing squats on my face while saying that he liked me.  Suddenly, his head exploded as an Agathian Knight struck him from behind with his maul. The dead Mason Vanguard fell on top of my corpse. As my respawning timer ended, the last thing I saw of that engagement was my comrade teabagging where our opponent's head would have been if it had not exploded, which unfortunately was also where my surprisingly still intact face was.  9,001/420 would become a victim of necrophilia again",

The weapons in the game only offer slightly different attributes which help the player develop aa preferance a to which class and which weapon they use. Trust me... Your equipment is not what decides the fate of the battle. The Game offers a good variety of gammodes which they player can choose depending on what style of gameply you enjoy the most. The only bad thing I can say about this game is the 'Vote Kick' system. This system is designed so one player can cast a vote to kick another player off the server. The idea was that you could kick someone who is hacking the game to give them advantages over the other players in ways. However this system is constantly misused. Players can frequently get annoyed when they die all the time on this game and will cast votes to kick player just because they are at the top of the leaderboard and they will accuse them of hacking. Overall though this game is fantastic and I would definatley reccomend it to players seeking a challenging method of mulitiplayer gaming.",

You can pick from four classes in the game: Archer (he uses bows, crossbows and javelins; daggers as his sidearm), Man-at-Arms (he's the fastest class in the game; he uses a variety of weapons like maces and swords), Vanguard (he uses polearms, spears and long weapons like that) and Knight (he's the heavy duty class; he has the heaviest armour in the game, and he can use things like maces and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords).  The game is packed full of action; there aren't many moments where you're not doing anything.There are a range of game modes to pick. There are the usual, like deathmatch and team deathmatch, but the most interesting one is team objective. As it says in the title, one of the teams has to do a range of things in the mode, like burning down a farm, for instance. I haven't seen anything like that before in a game.  However, there are some problems. Some of the weapons are unbalanced. The game's community isn't very good; perhaps borderline toxic. The company (Torn Banner) barely update the game with interesting new things. There haven't been new weapons for ages; since January of some year (could have been 2013). Apart from that, this game is very good, and I recommend you buy it for some laughs and fun. This game may make you rage, however. Just be careful about that.",

They aren't a very common occurence, however and gameplay remains very engaging and tense. It can be difficult to get used top at first but with some experience gained over time this can be very addictive as you take part in epic battles of a decent scale but with massive bloodshed and many skilled opponents. I'd fully recommend this game to anyone that enjoys any medieval theme as well as hardcore combat with a simple system and easy to use controls but difficult to master fully.",

A few humorous youtube videos along with a sale caused me to pick the game up.  You can have a blast with this game within the first minute of playing. The controls are pretty simple and familiar to that of other fps games. I remember the first game I ever played. It was 'free for all' on the stonehill map and within 20 seconds my head got chopped off. There is a startling and satisfying level of violence and all too familiar amounts of dismemberment. All around you arms and legs are being detached, someones head explodes like a suicidal extremist cantaloupe, from an arrow, bone and tendons being exposed from a blade raking against skin, the clashing of shields and mace/sword/rock on a stick while you get stabbed in the back from a stalking man at arms as he runs away laughing with his head held high in the air.   Point is: this game is fun even if you suck/are new.  The reason you see so many players with 500+ hours is due to the depth of combat. You initiate a swing with a mouse click or scroll of the mouse wheel and the weapon will follow a general path of its swing. However, you have the ability to move your body and pivot your torso in order to alter that general path. This allows you to swing your weapon in so many different ways (reverse attacks, accelerated swings, delayed attacks, attacking from a particular direction) PLUS: there are 4 different soldiers to pick from all with unique attributes and weapons. Each weapon makes for a different playstyle. Example: You can play as knight and either charge into several people with a heavy weapon and hope to 1 shot someone, or be a tank with a shield and absorb attacks while dealing medium damage and assist the rest of the group.  Once you get the basics of the game down there is so much to experiment with and new skills to learn that it makes for an amazing game to invest time into, because you will eventually be a mini boss. However there is no advantageous weapons/attributes once you get higher level, like explosive slugs etc. You have to unlock certain weapons by killing peeps but that can be done in less than 10 hours.

But there are bad things of this game such as : Backwards hitting, Hitting in 1 sec with one of the slowest weapons in the game, spinning around like a moron spamming mouse 1 (Left mouse button).  By far the most common classes everyone picks is knights or vanguards because of ♥♥♥♥ that I told earlier. Being an archer is again hard but rewarding and man at arms if you wish to be smart and not getting hit by someone.  There are mechanics like: Arrow cam which allows you to see where the arrow went, Dodging: Man At Arms can perform dodges a slight 'jump' (Not really a jump) to every sides foward,backwards,left,right which allows them not to use their block and be some what smarter,Jump charge thing (I have no idea how to call it): Basicly as vanguard you will perform a jump charge attack at enemy if you sprint with vanguard for quite a bit and by god how mutch damage it does. Another mechanic is where your sword is at that is where tha damage is and by that I mean for example: If you are swinging your sword anyone who is from left to right will recieve damage if you are in range and if they do not block and the same mechanic and always backfire by again..............................................Dancing like barrelina and doing crouch overhead spinish things  Overall I like the game but playing it with 50 level players it not really fun ",

Once I joined a team objective map I did well against the lesser roleplayers but got completely destroyed by the lmb gambling vanguards.   Actually this review is utter rubbish and does not represent Chivalry at all but a warped very high fov of which the player demonstrates his lack of respect for the game and other players, a common theme in all of his crass reviews.﻿  Just kidding game is good and most of its flaws are actually really charming in a strange way. The skill cap is extremely high though and even after a 1000 hours you are just starting to learn the real mind games that go on during every encounter. There are sadly though still a lot of exploits and glitches in the game and most of these will likely not be fixed anymore. But if you know what is going on and stick with it the game opens up and you can really enjoy its beauty.

(except my ego, since I kinda suck at this game)  If you had to explain Chivalry too someone who has never heared of it, the best way to describe it would be: 'Medieval Call of Duty' And it is exactly that. This game combines the choatic fun of an FPS with feudal combat. Yes folks this game is all about multiplayer, something it does very well. You have your classic game types such as; 'Free for all, Capture the Flag and team deathmatch. In my opinion the most fun gametype is: 'Objective'. In this you are either attackers or defenders trying too fight you way through a series of stages (It's a bit like battlefield).  Basicly this game is alot of fun and a recommendation for anyone who loves FPS games but wants too experience this in a different setting.",

It's not TOO terribly different, I'll get that out of the way now, but it does some things better, other things worse.  First, unlocks are persistent, where M&amp;B has a Counterstrike-style purchasing system. I like persistent unlocks. I don't have to limp along for a round or two before I can use the stuff I actually want to.  Control defaults are laid out pretty strangely, and is probably Chivalry's weakest point. I prefer M&amp;B's more intuitive mouse-gesture system for determining what kind of attack I do. With a bit of practice I've memorized how to attack how I want, but binding attacks to mouse-wheel up and down still feels weird. Clicking attack with your shield up does not bash, as it does in M&amp;B, but it just performs a normal attack. Again, unintuitive. Kick and bash share their own key, and if you want to feint, that's another key you have to press while you're in the middle of a swing you clicked the mouse to initiate. It feels a bit like patting your head while rubbing your stomach. Hopefully more practice on my part irons this out.  The game is prettier than M&amp;B (though most games are) and maps make more use of terrain, enterable structures, and vertical gameplay. There are only six maps, but most of them have an objective mode which is a bit more interesting than cut-and-dry deathmatch (though deathmatch is your best bet for grinding unlocks). Oh, and you can chop off heads, arms, and legs—M&amp;B doesn't have that!  Infinitely more fun with friends than just pubbies, but hey, what game isn't? You can also hide text chat and mute voice chat entirely, so if you want to play but don't feel like seeing people whine in chat, just hide it and pretend you're playing against bots.",

Not that there are alot of first person medieval combat games out there to the point of requiring these kind of analogies, but what I mean is that this game certainly is not Pirates, Vikings and Knights..   Where as Pirates, Vikings and Knights has more of an arcadey style gameplay (thus i`d call it the Call of duty of melee combat games), Chivalry has alot more complexity and depth to its core gameplay.   There are alot of little things to consider and be aware of if you want to master all of chivalry`s mechanics. Things like, hitting an enemy with the tip of your weapon will deal more damage than with the lower part. Simply because of this, a whole new 'game' of tactical positioning is in place. Taking into account the windup and recovery time of your weapon is crucial if you want to stay alive and emerge as the victor, especially if you are dueling as a knight with a heavy weapon against a lighter and quicker man at arms.  There are tons more of specific mechanics I could talk about, but that`s what the guides are for as this just a simple, quick review. So is all this talk of complexity any good? I for one truly enjoy what this game offers. There are few multiplayer titles that give you such a sense of gratifying accomplishment when you defeat another player, backed up with a nice visual feedback of heads and limbs flying off.   It`s just a shame that they added an ingame store where you buy cosmetic items such as armor and skins for existing weapons, and the only way to get these is buy purchasing them with real currency.. Yeah I guess they are harmless since they are only cosmetic and don`t affect any stats for your armor/weapons.  In the end though, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is truly a unique game and a breath of fresh air in the multiplayer focused genres, since nowadays everything has to be some kind of first person shooter variant to be successful. I`m glad that Chivalry can prove otherwise, and hopefully this will be some kind of stimulant for developers to try different things in the future.",

Different game modes - eg Team Objective (my favourite) as well as many others eg FFA and Team Deathmatch. 4 different characters to choose from - Knight, Vanguard, Man-at-arms and Archer - all play differently and have a selection of weapons to choose from. 1st or 3rd person play - it's your choice. (some servers are locked to first person - which i prefer anyway).   Chivalry is often on sale for &lt;$5, in which case, there is no excuse for not buying it! Mandatory friendly fire/team damage makes this game much more interesting and challenging. Frequent updates and new maps. Twitch play, skill, brains, calmness under pressure, accuracy, teamwork and a little luck - they will all be needed here. Good online community with some servers limited to low rank players so you can work on your melee chops before you challenge the big boys. You will be on the edge of your seat swinging your body from side to side as you block and duck blows aimed to decapitate you while simultaneously laughing your own head off.. Brilliant! - 9/10.",

Despite this, you can take down high level players once you pay attention to what they are doing and replicate that in your attacks and blocks. You may read what I thought a year back I believe. I think most players will enjoy this game. Have a nice day!    DON'T BUY THIS GAME! There now you know not to so much as touch it. It isn't that the graphics are bad or anyting similar to that, it's that new players will be steamrolled in almost any game. Unless you are willing to sit down for multiple hours practicing everything you've seen in game to youtube videos you might as tape FREE KILLS to your face and run into the horde of knights, vangaurds, and archers to be sliced into pieces. The game is just like going through hell for new players. I do realize you can turn on rank filters, but currently there are barely any players that are on a similar skill level to new players so they just have to be happy getting chopped to bits. You might say, 'but the people I've seen play in videos do really well,' hate to break it to you they have either spent days of their time practicing without ranking up or they have played the game to death and have a very high rank.

There are a few disappointing things but they are very minor and it will always be different for someone else most of the time anyway. For one the ranking system doesn't always progress as desired and most of the time not at all... the system seems a little off at times with things like that making it a bit tedious at times to unlock weapons in the interface but these are just my opinions. Note that the ranking system doesn't effect what weapons get used just by how many kills you get with them. Some servers can easily manipulate the physics and speed to make matters more interesting. Also, they have added 'Workshop' so that can be seen as an added bonus to game longevity.  Value: Get it while it's on sale if you want to play a mindless deathmatch style game, not always a bad thing, set in the Medieval era.",

I've been laughing all the way through it. The feeling you get when you run into a crowd of people swinging your sword around chopping people heads off, it's fantastic.   This game has a slight learning curve, make sure you play all of the tutorial and learn about extended swinging etc. Make sure to get your blocking on point, it's very important. At first I couldn't even 1v1, now I can happily run into a group of 4+ people fighting and take at least 3 out XD. Also try not to join a game with over 100+ ping otherwise you'll just be frustrated.   The first 2 hours were pretty brutal and tough, but if you pull through I promise you won't regret it.

That comes later and with a better understanding of things.   + 4 classes, a bunch of weapons and a heck of a lot of fun ways to get murdered. Archers, Man At Arms (MAA), Vanguards and Knights. Archers are pretty self explanatory, MAA's are the agile, firepot flinging crazies of the game, Vanguards are the heavy hitters with long range weapons and a charge attack, and knights. Knights are either your best friend or worst enemy. A bunch of health, some devestating weapons you can unlock (And exploit if you're sneaky like that), and the most feared sound anyone can attest to in game. 'COME HITHER!'  + The combat is extremely satisfying, you generally need to gauge the distance of the enemy to the weapon you're using. You need to watch where your opponent is swinging and parry at the right time, your curser has to follow the tip of the enemies weapon if you want to do this right. After a quick parry you can counterattack or dely a swing to try to make your enemy parry and leave him open to a swing. It's not extremely difficult but it can be the cause of some headaches if you don't entirely grasp the basics first off. Hit the training tutorial.  + / - The community... Can be a hit or miss. To really get the most out of this game, you need to be able to work with your teammates towards objectives. And when you get a cluster of enemies in allies in an area, it's very important to know how to stab or throw out a downward swing. That LMB thing you've been doing for those one on one fights? Yeah, there might be someone on your team in that cluster of goof doing the same thing. Most players are willing to help someone new to the game, but we all know how getting a bunch of goofballs together to kill stuff usually goes. Expect a lot of silliness.   Oh yeah, and as other reviewers mentioned, when you're new and going off past rank 15 into the open world of insanity, you need to have a lot of patience to really get anything more out of the game. Rank stacking is a thing, and when players get good and all play for one side and you're on the other... Well, you can still get some fun out of attempting to one on one some guys, but it really depends on the players in the lobby. Depending on whether you hate winning or losing, this could be a deal breaker for you. The skill balance can be broken easily when you're fighting a team with people who know how to fight in groups and defend points.   - I hope you don't like changing your skins. This doesn't really affect the game in any real capacity, but Torn Banner kind of charges a quite a bit of money for skin changes for individual classes. If you're one of those fashionista type players who has to look pretty, be sure to have a loose hold on that there wallet.   So TL:DR or whatever, this is a good game! The combat takes a bit of getting used to, and so does group combat. There could be more variety with the classes but sometimes less is more. The community is generally friendly and helpful, but there is some silliness to be had with others. You may run into problems and cease having fun later in the game due to ranks 48+ stacking on a side and pushing your ♥♥♥♥ in, but losing doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game. But if it does, than you might want to look elsewhere.  I recommend this game simply because when I'm getting drunk with nowhere to go, Chivalry is usually the first place I go to.",

It's fun, I love the gore, the classes, the objective based gamemodes, all that. I just feel like it is not something I would like to play for extended periods of time. The playerbase is decently active and not entirely hostile from what I've seen so if you don't have anything else in terms of multiplayer deathmatch games then this may be fun for you. Only problem I found was I feel entirely too slow which doesn't appeal to me in particular but may feel realistic too some people. Seems like there's enough depth to keep people playing for awhile because there are many classes and weapons to use. I recommend picking this up on sale if you want something new in terms of first person, multiplayer, battling games.

However, whilst the game is an initially fun semi-realistic medieval game, the game stops being fun once you reach the level 16. This is due to the lower level servers being locked out to you. This is bad as those servers are the ones that are the most full, and the higher level servers are filled with pretentious elitists.

The game features 4 different classes, a large variety of maps, objectives, and game modes.   Join team Agatha or the Order wage war on the opposing faction. Each team consists of Men-at-arms, knights, archers, and vanguards; the classes all vary in speed, weaponry, abilities, and stat lines. Man-at-arms are agile but fragile, knights are slow and durable, the vanguard is slow but wields large weapons focused on crowd combat, and the archer is weak but supports from afar. Melee combat is a rich experience that is easy to pick up but very difficult to master.   The soundtrack of the game is satisfying. When weapons connect the audio feedback feels good and encourages you to jump into the fray and start swinging. However, this helps create one of the most frustrating parts of the game, team killing is an extremely common thing and to fully enjoy the game you need to go in expecting this to be a part of the experience. The game also features war cries which help get the blood pumping as both sides charge in to combat.   Medieval is a well done game easily worth the time it takes to master the combat system. With the variety of combat styles offered by the classes and weapons this game will bring you back time and again. Get out there and fight soldier, For AGATHAAA!",

If you do not learn how to block correctly, people will hit you through your block and it will ♥♥♥♥ you off. Archers are probably the hardest classess to kill with and they usually are on the bottom of the lists. What also sucks is sometimes how you get groupkilled by three knights and a man-at-arms.

            "review_text": "This game is basically Counterstrike with medieval weaponry and hilarious voice acting.   Reasons to like this game as a beginner: It’s pure fun. The sound effects of dismembering or bludgeoning foes with an array of weapon types will most likely be the highlight of newcomers, along with the fact that even its bugs, crappy graphics and voice macros are something to laugh WITH and not just at. The community manages to help enhance these features. Then you’ll start getting better and expecting to get better. You’ll feel very rewarded when you manage to kill 3 – 5 enemies all on your own, whilst your team cheers you on in the chat-box. Especially if you duck under a swing from an opponent and they accidentally kill their teammate. Just BE WARY to not let it get to your head, otherwise you’ll end up like most of the idiots giving this game a bad review based on the ‘broken mechanics’ and the 'community.' These aspects I will rebuke in the following paragraphs.  People say it has a ‘toxic’ community, and this is simply untrue. The reality is that get your bad seeds with your good ones. Mostly if you stick to routinely playing on a server type, for example the Last Team Standing East US server, you’d find a jolly and friendly bunch there. Meanwhile, if you want people to be directly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by, then be a fool and start going on Duel servers ‘till you bang your head against the desk. Or if you want to be swamped in a sea of anonymity, go ahead and play Team Objective. Furthermore, Torn Banner’s emphasis on applying player-made maps and mods only increases choice and possibility.  Meanwhile, the people complaining about the exploitation of mechanics have a point, but then again they don’t. For example, I feint. I even throw feints in the middle of combos like a production line at work. And I get people shaming me, but I don’t care. I don’t care because the loading screens used to encourage it, and just like feinting: dragging, reverse-over-heading, Vanguard dancing or taking advantage of the Brandistock’s stab delay/reach have all become integrated and defined as the overall current product of the game. If you want to beat these types of players, then you’ll have to find a way to get better; either by being ‘taboo’ (like myself), getting better than them at their own game or by breaking the mould like many other players have before you.  Because these mechanical exploits weren’t apparent on Day 1 to the Chivalry community; they have been founded, learned and mastered. Thus, the community, skill level averages, and very mechanics of the game are constantly evolving. For example, when I used to play it extensively a long time ago, only a hand-full of players (mostly level 40+, which wasn’t common back then) utilised dragging, ‘rainbows’, or simply dashed the crap out of you with a hatchet wielding MAA or rushed you efficiently with a stiletto wielding Archer, etc. The Level 20s were crap, and in the 30s: Knights loved the Bearded Axe’s speed, Vanguards used to dance around like headless chickens and the MAA class would typically dodge forward, stab, and dodge back or exploit the Dane-axe reach. I personally used to take advantage of the alternate swing with the mace when they updated the Mouse layout by mapping alternate strikes to Thumb Mouse Button 1/2 and introduced the pole-axe.  And now? Even Level 20 players can utilise the very skills it took time to establish years ago, whilst the previous Level 40s are now around Level 60 (or mid 50s), have mastered almost every weapon, are probably in a well-known clan and are practically untouchable. Most good archers don’t need crossbows (which fire straight) anymore for headshot accuracy; even when approached for close combat the skilled ones don’t try and rush-stab you like an epileptic bat anymore, and the implementation of Duel mode has made the Javelin thrower type a force to be reckoned with. Most knights these days use the Messer, which is a weapon I favoured back when it wasn’t very popular due to its lack of speed (which many now realise is useful for feint animation, and best of all: dragging animation). Flails are now apparently universally considered as useless. No one ducks anymore because everyone else has all learned to direct their swings lower, or not swing at all. And I haven’t seen one single MAA using a hatchet these days! They all know the Norse sword or broadsword is the weapon of choice.   And this game will not stop growing, either. Funnily enough a lot of the cultural choice of weaponry has also been affected by the constant patches to nerf them, which derived from whiny idiots complaining about weapon x or mechanic y being overpowered. For example, Vanguards generally don’t use the Claymore anymore, because Torn Banner nerfed the damage output. I remember before this that the Claymore was a weapon of choice due to its speed; and the nerf directly affected the way players utilised the Vanguard, and thus indirectly affecting his opponents (of any class) and how they challenged him. Thus my point is we're still learning, and that this game is not yet a final product. You may call it 'exploited,' but you could also call it 'evolved.'    But enough of my analysis. Here are legitimate reasons why Chivalry sucks:  - I feel there aren’t as many players as there used to be. Perhaps this is because the majority are conglomerating in the Level -20 Servers. So you have to wait for a Free Weekend, and when that happens, every server is almost ♥♥♥♥ing full. Still, Free Weekends are a good thing for the game. - The new interface is crappy. Of course, this is subjective. But it is. - Torn Banner keep patching stuff that doesn’t need to be patched, yet can’t for example, fix actually annoying issues such as the chat-box resetting every time a new duel occurs in Duel mode (you can imagine how annoying this is when I’m in the middle of replying to someone). - The new maps, such as Cove, Castle Assault, and Impasse suck (of course, this applies to LTS). This is again subjective, but it is especially annoying as they are the only 3 maps I ever see in LTS along with that Colosseum based magically environment changing one, whilst they remove my favourites such as Dark Forest XL. - The customization brings originality, and the purchasing of separate items (some made by the WorkShop community is great, but I sometimes wonder why I’m fighting an Agathian that looks like a Mason Nordic Viking with campish bodypaint. Or a tw*t that think's he's Sauron from Lord of the Rings. This is just me nit-picking now.     TL:DR – Just read it you f*cking poof.",

Graphics: 8.5/10 The graphics are pretty damn good. The gore level is appropriate and it's an accomplished feeling when you timed your attack just right to land that fatal low that ends in a decapitation or other dismemberment. The game's environments are well done and I never noticed something ugly that stood out to warrant feeling otherwise.  Sound: 9/10 Great ambient sound effects that fit the environment, what you're walking on, what other players near you are walking on, water rustling and fires roaring. The music is pretty good too and gets you pumped to start charging into a fight. That CLANG as you parry an attack stands out in my mind.  Replayability: 10/10 With varied game modes like Free For All, Team Death Match and Team Objectives there's plently of variety in maps to never feel boring.  Cons: The only cons I can think of would concern the learning curve for the first few hours of play and I've heard that when the game isn't on sale the player base drops, but I suppose that's to be expected.  Overall: 9/10 I've put my first 10 hours in the game solo, but this would be great fun with an organized group of friends or a clan and I would recommend this to any fan of Counter Strike, Renaissance Fairs, and just good multiplayer.",

            "review_text": "Chivalry is a game unlike any other. It holds elements of the Mount and blade series, and other such medievel settings, however it is not a vast world like Mount and blade. Chivalry sets place somewhere in the medievel times (duh) and has it's own little story about how mason is this elite group, but then betrays their king. Nobody cares about the story anyways.  You play in different servers, with a few different game modes. The first and most noticable one is team objective, which lets you do different things like storming a castle to kill a king, which is player controlled, push a wagon to enemy lines, and various other objectives. then we have some basic game modes like team deathmatch, free for all, capture the flag, and duel. Duel being very interesting to certain people who likes the one on one experience.  The combat in Chivalry is unlike any other combat system you have experience i feel. You are looking through mainly a first person perspective, but you are allowed to change it to third person, however i would not recommend this, since a lot of the charm is in getting in close and personal to your enemy, instead of being some hovering camera. As you fight your opponent you have different moves to your disposition depending on the weapon you are using, but mainly these are: a normal horizontal swipe, stab, overhead, kick, and a possibility to feint to trick your opponent. However feinting is frowned upon since people are casul.  You have a wide arsenal of weapons, from spears, daggers, longswords, bows, crossbows, throwing knives, shield, and so on. Every weapon has an unique feel to them, and allows you to master every weapon specifilly, by learning the range, speed, and other factors that will determine your profiency in combat.  All in all, i heavily recommend this game. My review does not give this game the honor it deserves, and it is a game you should experience for yourself. If i were to score the game i'd give it a 8/10, as it is not perfect, but i enjoy playing it way too much.",

The idea is simple, recreating virtually a medieval battles (village invasions, attack a castle, etc.) in which you play either with teams or free-for-all jumping in a massive slaugther, and very accurately, meaning, you can accidentally send your teammate's head flying away if you are not careful.  Friendly-'fire'...hmm...friendly-stabs are quite the frequent thing as we humans are imperfect, makes you wonder how many people were probably actually killed on accident because of a badly-timed sword attack. Doesn't hurt to send a little 'Sorry!' on the chatbox though! It is also possible some people who must have absolute almighty skill for all games and NEVEEEER hit someone, since in all in his life already knew how to play this game might be set off by this and start ranting and what not on the chat, ignore and keep on, it's part of the fun, all those little accidents. You'll get better with practice, promess.   While the controls is something you need to get used to, this game is pretty fun. Running around, beheading people, blocking attacks with your shield, cutting limbs, using the ballista, aiming well your bow. As I said the controls are somewhat difficult to get the hang on at first, it will take a few hours of gameplay to adquire the most basic bit of skill, but it is worth it. This is a game where there's no tutorial skipping. Feels really like a medieval battle, and no, there's no magic, demons, or dragons. Just regular people, with old-fashioned ye olde beheading swords.  If you are quite the wealthy fashionista, this game also has an in-game store where you can purchase other kinds of weapons and armor to suit your taste.  Is this game for you? Do you enjoy multiplayer battle games and want to try something different? Give this a try, specially when it is on sale (that's when I picked it).",

Things that might be annoying and that you should know of *Team damage is ON which you should ALWAYS have in mind as you're swinging big axes and swords (MANY people have died this way) *You'll always be damaged or killed at least once of a teammate each game (and probably stab someone too) *Weapon choosing is not made in the custumization menu (as I thought in the beginning), but in the bottom of the  'class window' (where you choose youre class before a battle) *You'll get a hard time walking away from youre computer.

(they do get a share though)  -the bigger part of the community is very very toxic. for me that is the biggest complaint when i play this game. after work i want to sit down, crack one open, and have a few decent duells but the constant ingame hate-spewing and arrogance will put you off very fast. the only thing you can do is to completely ignore it.  having said that iam playing on 4 servers i favorited and those are duell servers. there is alot of salt on those as well but also some friendly and very helpfull individuals who will help you out or just simply not look down on you.    overall i will recommend chivalry out of the pure reason it is good fun. if you dont mind the exploits or just wait for a sale go get chivalry. there are still a decent amount of servers (i live in europe) out there. this is particulary true if you have friends you can play with as this will be a blast.",

It's hard to get bored by this game... at the beginning will be kinda hard and frustrating for you, but also fun.

Both of these games seemed to suffer from a lot of latency issues (Blocks would not count, hits would not connect, players would experience lag, sometimes even over hardware? Issues.) But as time has went on, a lot of these issues have been resolved. The gameplay differs slightly between the two, DW being a bit more fast-paced, and with more classes the issue of balance comes into play, but I feel they have done at least a decent job at attempting to balance out characters. I absolutely love both of these games, although I feel the latency issues still need a bit of polishing. Lower end computers will have a harder time with this issue, for some reason. Playing on a single core processor, I experienced miserable gameplay. While the game itself did not lag, I would find other players were simply too quick to avoid. Blocking was futile, and any hit I landed was by sheer luck. Playing on a much better multi-core processor has eliminated many of those issues, but now regions come into play. So long as I find a server close to me, I am fine. However, if I want to play with friends a far distance away, latency will become an issue for one of us. None the less, the majority of the time this poses little problem, and overall hasn't harmed my experience any. Great gameplay, great style, rather immersive combat system (Although a very simple one overall), and a great pvp experience.",

Everything else is simply, point and click, when you get done playing Chivalry.  I have been playing this game since it's inception as a half-life mod, Age of Chivalry. No other game comes close to satisfying that medieval desire that streams through my DNA for some reason.  If you have that same itchy feeling, that nagging urge to lop someone's head off, there is no where else you need to go. This is it. The meaty sound of a javelin piercing someone's chest cannot be duplicated anywhere else I can find.  However, as with most gaming communities these days, don't expect a warm welcome. Even to this day, I still play with in-game chat turned off. I don't need to read all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing about archers, dragging weapons, feinting, etc. I have no problems with any of the mechanics that are currently in the game. I personally do not spin attack, and even after many hours of game-play, there are still many players I just cannot beat. What's my solution? I don't know, maybe a fire pot to soften them up, or a heavy xbow bolt from cover.   This game can even be fun for the family on a LAN with bots playing Team Objective.

Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a multiplayer game which does exactly what I stated previously and nothing more. What's better than seeing your worst enemy's head chopped off and into a pit? Nothing, because it's a sight to behold.  There is a story behind this game which is explained if you play the tutorial, which is a great help, as there are a decent sum of buttons you need to learn before you storm the castle. There are four classes each with their own unique abilites; Archer, Man-at-Arms, Vanguard, and Knight. That goes from least armored to most armored, some doing more damage than others. Two teams, a Red vs. Blue style, the Agatha Knights and the Mason Order.  If you're not too huge for multiplayer like myself, fret not, you can fight bots. This isn't like any other game though, there's no difficulty setting. I'd place the bots at around an average player's style, they don't really counter your attacks much, but that makes it all the better if you're there to smash some skulls and nothing more. Though the AI is rather dumbfounded when they see themselves in a TDM, you're better off placing them in a free-for-all in a small map so you can get the most action possible.  The one downfall to this game though is it's price. Twenty-five dollars doesn't sound too bad with all the good things to it, but if you wanna get some cool looking weapons without having to rank up, you're gonna have to spend some extra cash to make your character look like the person you want. You'd be better off getting it on sale for 5$-10$ and buying the DLC for it as it will probably be on sale too.  Overall, though, this game get's an 8.4/10 in my book. It's fun to shout at your comrades or your computer as you gloriously stomp on your enemy's dead bodies and chop off their balls because you're one of those people.",

Apart from the good voice acting and graphics, the game's charm really lies in the combat mechanics.   The sword combat is one of the very few instances of a game actually rendering both the first person and third person sword models in three dimensional space in front of the player. This is important because it allows for swords to actually collide in midair, essentially making chivalry a one of a kind sword combat experience. You can maneuver around shields and blocks, you can do some seriously cheeky things to hit your opponents. The end product is a fighting experience that is something like being in 300 or Braveheart. In that sense the game very much lives up to its mission statement.   A large number of less experienced members of the community cry about 'shields not working' and players 'exploiting bugs,' but these people, who I imagine have actually hurt this game's sales to some extent, are basically just bad at the game. They are unable to imitate the strategies being used against them, and are consequently angry enough to write a negative review. There are no bugs in the combat system serious enough to imbalance battles.   The only unironic 10/10 I'll ever give.",

So lets begin, shall we?   Story   To start, I'll explain the story behind the entire game. Contrary to the belief of other reviewers, there actually is a story to this game. The land of Agatha is ruled over by king, Argon. He rules over the land and commands an army of loyalists, the Agathian army, and according to the wiki, controls the northern half of Agatha. Their faction's colors are gold, and blue, and their symbol is a lion. Southside, there is the Mason Order, commanded by Lord Malrik locked in a civil war with the Agathians. They don't believe in the way King Argon rules over Agatha, and their goal is to crush any loyalist thoughts under their boots. They want to make the people of Agatha harder and stronger, and use fear and intimidation to increase their ranks while providing vast promises for a better tommorrow. Their faction's colors are black and red, and their animal symbol is an eagle. For the rest of the story, you'll simply have to play the game for yourself by playing team objective maps, the story is driven by whoever wins these matches. Could agatha defeat this mighty force of mercenaries, or will Malrik rise  as the new king of Agatha?   Gameplay   If you're considering buying this game, please heed my warning:Don't dive into this game headfirst, you will die.To start, play the damn tutorial if you want to atleast learn the basics. The learning curve is ridiculously high, and if you're playing against competent players in your first matches, it can get extremely frustrating when their swinging their sword across your face before you know what hit 'ya. But don't give up, find what you're good at, stick to it, and sooner or later you'll find glory on this virtual battlefield. With the variety of four classes, with about 20-25 weapons.(With the more weapons mod, this number will be increased.) You'll find your niche in this crazy environment of swordplay. And with the many mouse techniques and crazy swings you'll be swingin', the gameplay is very satisfying. Want to storm castles with your buddies, you can do that. Want to just kill, kill, and kill some more in a small arena with about 15 other blokes wanting to rearrange your face into the greek alphabet, you can. Hell, with the steam workshop, the amount of gameplay is tripled. Only blemish I can see are the common exploits/glitches with hitboxes and such.   Graphics/Sound   Yes, this game looks as good as it sounds. Most maps, depending on where you are in agatha, either look sunny and hopeful, or dark, gloomy, and discouraging. Graphics are based on the Unreal 3 Engine, and I tell 'ya, they look amazing if your rig can handle the highest settings. Sound quality is clear, though there isn't much variety in terms of music, only about 6 different tracks that play during the beggining and the last of each match, but it does excel in raising your morale in that last push, and raising your heart rate when your team is making that last push and there's only about half a minute to bash the city walls down and slay everything that moves inside, and when you and your team do bash those doors down, your enemies best have a plan B, 'cause there is no stopping the pain train you're driving into their hearts.   Community   ...Aaaaand here's the moldy spot on this otherwise perfect peach of a game. The community, oh god do I hate it. Most times, the things you'll see in the chat box will mostly be insults, and if you're playing on top of the server, these insults will mostly be pointed at you. Sportsmanship is almost never seen in pub matches, so enjoy it if someone does actually compliment, as most of the time you'll hear, 'OMG YOU MOUSE DRAGGING SCRUB I'M REPORTING YOU TO MICROSOFT HERR DERR,' or, my favorite insult, is when someone insults you for using a certain weapon, even though as of the last patches in the last months prior to this review being written, most of the weapons have been balanced.   Overall   Knitty, gritty, overall fun. Remember that word, fun? Shouldn't that be what most games strive for? Well, this game, if you're into fast-paced, mostly, MOSTLY, fair gameplay, beautiful graphics, and a workshop that will keep you coming back for the next crazy mod, what's there not to love? Oh yeah, the community, but if you can get over that, grab a few friends, and go besiege a castle, for god's sake. You'll have fun, trust me.   9/10   ",

The graphics and the sounds are decent and it has multiple game modes, dueling a friend is fun oh and killing someone with a throwing knife to the head is very satisfying.",

It gives the first-person category a fresh new meaning. Weapons are pretty balanced with a good variety of weapons for each class. Over my time of playing this game, I have heard that each class is op, or over powered at least once, which shows that the classes themselves are pretty balanced. There are some flaws you have to keep in mind though, the new maps aren't that great and they seem to really want more of your money. Using more money isn't necessary because it only gives you skins, but it is expensive to buy them. So in conclusion, the learning curve is really, really steep, but it is a joy to play when you get the hang of it.",

And you know it was money well spent. Chivalry brings the same kind of pleasant feeling. This incredible medieval combat simulator will make your face turn into a speciality of French cuisine more than just once. If you are a sad, embittered person such as myself, you may often go bananas whenever you get killed in games, blaming this unfair world or Obama. Not in Chivalry. Here, for some reason, whenever I get killed, (despite occasional lag or general server problems when 40+ players are on) the only thing I blame is me. Skill is essential and is rewarded. This only makes satisfaction bigger whenever I get to kill someone, watching that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bleed with his leg chopped off. The gory atmosphere of the game is upheld by themes like dumping a cart full of rotten bodies into castle's water reserves, burning a village and slaughtering innocent peasants etc. However, lack of some vital, medieval fun stuff like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ peasants, no matter which gender, beheading muslims or burning jews on the town square, might seem a bit weird. Even so my final verdict is 4 broken pencils on 2 magnetic bracelets. Which is good, compared to similar game: Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.",

From the footsteps, the swords hitting eachother, the sound of throwing an arrow, all the yelling, the pain...  Game Modes: Lots of game modes and maps to play in. Team Deadmatch, team Objectives, Last Team Standing, Free For All and Duel (this last 2 are my favs) :)   I've been addicted to this game for a long time, stopped playing it for more than a year because had no time to play alot, but restarted again, and the game had some updates this last year.

It's just so buggy and the developers don't do anything for Chiv anymore. The worst part of it are the so called 'hitboxers', which is actually considered 'being a pro' by some, but it's just plain an simple bug using. It's when you misuse the hitbox of your weapons to kill people e.g. during wind up phase. You get killed a lot by those people and it's no fun at all. They'll be staring at the ground or the sky, aiming and hitting it, but you'll die from a weapon being wound up from beneath you. It's just ridiculous and definetly not the way, this game was supposed to be played.

YOUR A FREAKIN GIANT! if ur bg enough for peopel to think ur OP u earned it and it wasnt easy(unless using brandistock). if u cam reach about 200% size u cna step on peopel which is very satisfying and just hilarious.   blacknightmode: inspired by the Black Knight in monty python and the holy grail movie. if ur hit in the arm u lose ur arm, and cant use it anymore. if ur hit in the leg, u lose the leg and move slower. if u lose ur head u got 10 seconds to live(10 seconds in witch to ♥♥♥♥ sh!t up). i play this mod because its hilarious. when u completely delimb someone they essentaily become ur b!tch. or slug, and forcibly taking some tryhards limbs is extremely satisfying  horde mod: if u like call of duty zombies..u will like this mod. thie only difference it that u have swords and hammers.. and so does the enemy, every kill earns you points which u cna spend on a variety of things.   dont expect to hop in and dominate servers... this game takes a lot more skill than most other game. and everyone seems to think the community is super toxic but ive not noticed that. granted there are ragers and hackers but its like that in every game.  im a main class man at arms which is the fastest class but is also very squishy... a lot of weapons can 1 hit them and it takes like 5 hits to kill a knight and 3 to kill a vanguard...peopel try to say that it is a highly overpowered class.... and i assure u its not. u rarely see a skilled man at arms because it takes practice to be good with, granted all clsess take skill but man at arms has a very steep learning curve. but the reason they are thought of as overpowered, is that the few man at arms players that are good..,..ARE VERY GOOD. i consider myself a decent man at arms but i know there are better. and everyone hates to be dominated my man at arms because 9/10 times u encounter one u reck them easily its that one other time that u hardly stand a chance. IMO maa is the best class but you need to use it a lot. i got bored of vangaurd and knight and stuck to the challenge man at arms brought.  overalll i love this game and id rank it at around 9/10 oly thing that keeps it from a 10 is the massive amount of vanguard spammers(there are good vanguards but theres just to dman many annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lmb spammers)",

            "review_text": "I 'cautiously' recommend this game to everyone. I've separated my review into subsections for convenience.  Audio/Graphics: The audio in this game is absolutely great. From the terrifying screams of de-limbed soldiers to the fierce battle cries of charging knights the sounds in Chivalry really help to set up an atmosphere which makes you feel like a soldier fighting alongside others in the Medieval Era. The graphics are great at maximum settings (which most machines can likely handle) though if you start turning things off like anti aliasing and texture fidelity the quality drops quickly.   Combat: The combat in Chivalry is where the game really shines. Players duel and attack waves of enemies in real time. The system facilitates a painfully realistic blocking mechanistic where the player has to aim their crosshair where the enemy is striking to block successfully (if you point to the right and block and the enemy swipes at you from your left you'll be hit regardless of block timing). Also, different weapon types do different amounts of damage to different classes. A mace will be much more effective against a knight in platemail versus a shortsword. Similarly a man at arms in leather armor can easily be stabbed through with a longsword whereas a mace wont yield as much of a damage bonus. Overall, the system is amazing for 1v1 battles that do take place among the larger frays of heated battle.   Community Interactions/Battle Logistics: Unless you are willing to go into a Free for All match (you are a better person than I am if you are) this is probably Chivalry's mightiest flaw. Though you will commonly find players role playing and really getting into the whole Medieval mindset, working with strangers in this game is largely impossible. In Team Objective (one team attacks a town or fortress and achieves objectives, advancing the map, while the other defends against a clock) players will certainly attempt to do objectives but many simply want to kill people. This is rather understandable as the combat is so much fun but it makes objective based maps a lot more frustrating. Similarly, in team battles (whether in deathmatch or objective servers) players own need to slay foes is probably the largest obstacle to yourself forcing me to commonly say 'The most dangerous foe in this game is your teammates'. Team damage is enabled on most servers which in theory makes the game more 'realistic' however the drawback is astounding. Much of the time you'll find yourself charging in a wave toward enemies. Upon reaching enemies your team will almost certainly begin swinging their 5 ft long weapons at random in the hopes of killing enemies; and they end up indefinitely killing you. This could be solved by people using lunge attacks rather than swipes, or the elimination of team damage (but certainly maintaining the mechanic which cause your weapon to bounce off people to prevent a literal 'wall of swords') but I doubt either of these scenarios are likely to occur.  In summary, you should play this game and enjoy it, but be careful about your teammates, they WILL be the most frustrating enemy you ever fought.",

That's pathetic. Literally every game out there has bugs than this game.

The game contains a ton amount of weapons and a variety of maps to choose and play from. As I have played through the game, here's what I gathered:  Pros: -Is a very fun game to play with, certainly worth investing hours playing with it. -Objectives aren't all the same, one match you'll have to burn down a village, another you'll have to kill as many foes as you can. -Doesn't require a good PC/Laptop to run the game, yet it still keeps high quality graphics. -Customizable classes, change weapons, colors, uniform patterns, etc. -You can shout all day while sprinting and charging your weapon against the enemy. -Hundreds of servers to choose from. -Not too laggy even with sh*tty internet.  Cons: -Isn't very easy to concentrate on one target, sometimes you could accidentally slash or kill a teammate beside you.  That's all I have to point out for now. In order for me to add more details into this review, I'll have to invest more time into the game. Nevertheless, very good game.",

The graphics are okay, nothing special considering that was launch 4 years ago its still enjoyable. The major point in this game is combat. The good side is that really need skill to win a battle and, indeed it has a steeper learning curve. The down side is that after lvl 15 ( about 10 hours playing) you will fight players that have 100+ hours in official servers. The only thing devs needs to do is to match players levels by making servers with different ranges: 0-15; 15-30; Free level  Pros: Good graphics for a 2012 game Costumizable weapons and different classes Different playing modes Skill-based combat  Cons: Servers with only 0-15 and free level range any (X&gt;1) vs 1 player is an extreme difficult fight Archer class feels, somehow, broken.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

Anyways, I admittedly play the Deadliest Warrior expansion far more than the base game, but both are a lot of fun and probably the closest a game has come to having varied and tactical melee combat. I do feel certain classes are OP, mainly Spartans, but it's not too bad if you master parrying, feinting, blocking, and stamina management. It's the most fun (sometimes angering due to getting competitive lol) I've had with a game in the last...idk... awhile. Some other games in this 'genre' have come out and had features that I liked more (War of the Roses has/had a cool timed reloading mechanic on crossbows), but I feel this game is the most complete package overall.  EDIT: Yeah.... after playing this a lot more, you realize what all the glitches are that people use to cheat the system and do more damage, have more reach, or pretty much not be able to hit them. If you play this and see some idiot spinning like a ♥♥♥♥ing beyblade... leave them alone or learn the asinine counter to it. Instead of fixing it, the devs .... they just don't even acknowledge it.",

Make sure you tell them to feint to avoid fighting, and tell them to drag whenever they can. Tell them if they drag enough they get a gold helmet.  Ok Rick, i'll get right on it.  Great.

TIME FOR PROS AND CONS  PROs . Excellent combat system - there are so many aspects of this which you will pick up in time. No two players will have the same fighting style, and a lot of it boils down to body language and seeing patterns in your oppents' attacks. . Variety of weapons - personally, i &lt;3 using the heavy crossbow and my fists, but if you want to go sword and board, that's cool. . Variety of game modes - Free For All, Team Deathmatch, Last Team Standing (a 'battle royale' mode; if you find yourself being the last man standing on a team, prepare to have the biggest adrenaline rush in your gaming life), Duel, Team Objective. . Balanced weapons - a lot of people will disagree with me here, but I think the weapons in this game are balanced and fighting comes down to skill and not zweihanders . This game will keep you hooked and coming back for more  CONs . Lag - ALWAYS check the 'ping' column on the server list before joining a server and lag won't be a problem. . Empty servers! WTB more Last Team Standing servers with low ping . ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t - Sometimes you will die, and you will literally say 'WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED', perhaps an enemy dragged you, or stabbed around your shield, or you got feinted or shot in the head or someone magically attacked faster than you despite you winding up waaaaay before him or someone simply hit through your block. These sorts of things drive a lot of new players away, but personally I love the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. . Rage - '♥♥♥♥♥♥ ARCHER/FEINTER/DRAGGER/LAGGER/BACKSTABBER' immediately springs to mind.  TIPS . Be wary of anyone rank 40 or higher, these are the best players the game has to offer. However, always remember that THEY CAN BE KILL JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. So many times I have seen a 1 hp rank 40+ beat a rank 30 because the rank 30 fearfully tried to block his oppenent to death. . Unlock weapons through official servers, just to be sure it registers each kill for your next weapon. . Knights aren't as tough as they look, 4 quick stabs with the thrusting dagger, 3 stabs with a spear, 1 body hit with the maul, are all you need to kill a knight. . Rush the enemy archers! . Bow to challenge someone to a duel, i love this player made mechanic, challenging someone to a duel may result in an epic 1 on 1 for the ages, or a quick backstab from an enemy teammate  10/10 ",

CONS - Playerbase, for the most part, is very undesirable (for lack of a better word) - Learning curve - Lag spikes and stutters (rare, but still happen) - Teamkills in low ranks  OVERALL  This game is a lot of fun to play with your friends and even solo! Although it has a fairly steep learning curve, new players can go to the low rank (0-15) servers to play with equal ranks/skill levels. If you are to buy this game, $28 (where I am) is a little high, I would wait for a sale of 25% or more.

As I gathered my strength for a thrust that would challenge a formidible batlle veteran, the wicked animal charged forth. The next two seconds of my life altered every thought I've precieved on the topic of warefare. In one mighty leap I charged toward the animal while screaming the battlecry! 'FOR ODIN!!' we collided in mid-air.  The ground beneath us starting up at our bodies suspended in the air locked in a masterpiece of the art of war. And then, there was nothing. Blackness filled every possible angle of vision. The sound dissappeared like the air in a deflating whoopie-cusion. All senses fading away into the abyss.  Hours later I awoke laying half naked in a puddle of my own feces and blood. I wished I could fall back asleep... forever! to never know this foriegn feeling of utter defeat. To erase the eternal consequinces of failure and resume the proud and free spirit of a victorious ameigo. As I lay there attempting to hold the blade from the suicidal position of the infamous samurai tradition, I saw the infernal beast returned to his stealth purch upon his willows branch, Laughing... Mocking!   I've been training for 7 months since that day. To reclaim my honor and regain the title of undefeated sempai. I will never forget that moment.

It may take a while to get used to the controls, as it may seem kind of heavy and slow at first. but once you figure out the hit detection system its a blast. the first time i played it i was in a 4 hour sitting.

The gameplay is very skill orientated, if you aren't good you are going to die, if you are good and know how to play effectively you are going to be good.

Men at arms , Archer(Scumbag) , The Vanguard and lastly the HONOURABLE Knight. Yes im Biased , Deal with it. Each class has their own different traits that make them unique ( OR ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING ) . The weapons in the game are pretty fair in their own right. Each class Armed with a weapon that they would or normally would be Armed with in the medieval times. The unlock system is sticks and stones. you unlock different weapons based on what kind of weapon you were playing with. A Spear unlocks another spear , a sword unlocks another sword. Each Unlock though is not a straight up better weapon , Chivalry is pretty balanced that in a sense , Lets take the claymore for an example , its an unlock of the first two handed swords used by the vanguards. It lacks the stopping(Slashing) power and range of its previous counterpart which is the greatsword . but it offers it back in terms of speed . Despite what many people say about the community i rarely find cancers in the current community that im in. Everyone pretty friendly . Pretty Helpful. Lack of hackers.   Whats there not to like?

You can also dress yourself up and change your appearance too.  This game can feel like hell alone, but with teamwork you can be an unstoppable force. Objective based modes feel the most fun, despite many matches turning into straight up brawls instead of someone trying to acheive the objective.  A big point to keep in mind about this game is to make sure to have a decent computer and a good internet connection. Lag kill, literally.

You will die. Many, many times you will die. Even the players on the level 0-15 noob servers will kick your ♥♥♥ repeatedly. You will struggle to do good, and your first games will be spent trying to keep from sitting at the bottom of the scoreboard and looking like a no-skill idiot.  Aside from the grueling learning curve that makes games like Dark Souls or look like the next Call of Duty, there is heaps of fun to be had in Chivalry.  Let's start with the basics.  MAPS- Pretty decent design overall. The simplier ones like arena3 or moor are the most fun, especially if you can find a 50-64 player server with decent ping.   GAME MODES- Standard FPS game modes. Team deathmatch, free-for-all, capture the flag, last team standing (TDM with no respawns), and team objective. I find myself playing FFA more than other online games because, on lower population servers, it's arguably more fun than the team-based games. If you don't mind getting stabbed in the back by some gyroscoping knight ♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is where the lulz are obtained. I vividly remember wordlessly teaming up with some pink pole hammer-wielding stranger to take on the server in jolly co-operation. A couple of the people who saw us charging at their unprotected asses, our weapons poised to mess them up, ended up juming into the lake. We made first and second place.  CLASSES- Hoo boy, here we go. The four character classes (Archer, Man at Arms, Vanguard, and Knight) are for the most part, fair and balanced in the right hands. Don't be too shocked to see that the vast majority of your team or the enemy's are playing Vanguard. Those ♥♥♥♥s are grossly overpowered by wielding the second most damaging weapons with the longest reach in the game. Unless you're also vanguard, avoid getting into 1v1 situations.  The other three classes are decent. MAA is fast, can dodge around like a friggin' gazelle. Archers can pull of headshots that pops their skulls like melons. Their daggers are OP. Knights are slow, but their weapons are crazy powerful. Expect VGs and Knights to make up the bulk of your team.  CUSTOMIZATION- Not extensive, but pretty cool. You can recolor your team based classes a little (i.e. one side can be colored with blue, white, and gold and the other can be red, black, and brown). FFA coloring is a bit more flamboyant. Don't expect a crazy color wheel full of options, but you can have some fun with it. Expect to find at least person on a FFA server to be strangely commited to the color black. You can also buy character reskins from Torn Banner, but the skins are ugly and cost too much money.  Over all, give Chivalry Eight oil pots out of ten.",

When you attack from the side you can do a back hand attack. All these movements use stamina and if you run low you cannot block or parry.   There are many weapons to use, my favorite so far is the quarterstaff which I am not good at using and the hammer. I still have lots to learn, but I am having lots of fun to do it.

Multiplayer with friends is obviously the best course of action, though the community and public servers are still pretty fun regardless. The only negative is that the expansion pack really should've been a separate game since it feels like a different engine to begin with, as well as throws out all of the previous modes and maps. I expected/hoped that they were going to merge the two, but alas, it doesn't look that way. Despite that though, either half of the game is good and well worth a buy.",

This game is great fun especially if you have some good friends to play with and rage with. (Rage will be involved with this game and is quite comical at times, for example, when you swoop in with the vanguard to lop off the heads of your friends who were dueling for the past 2 minutes). The modding community is also very cool and has created modes like black knight which all Monty Python fans should enjoy (You can continue fighting even after loosing limbs, unless of course you loose your sword arm and are reduced hobbling away from your iminent demise) Awesome college dorm room fun.   A few things to note:  -The 'good' players are really good but this is due to the very high skill cap of this game, you can always get better and discover weird new tecniques.  -There is single player against bots.  -The game controls very well.  -The graphics are nice but you have to option to turn them down if it isn't running well.  -Firebombs will become the bane of your existence.  -Dead bodies rag doll and flop around a bit which is kinda funny sometimes.  - The Claymore, Messer, Maul, and Forked Spear are my favorite weapons (only because there are no Adamantium claws).

Headphones can come in handy in this game since hearing a vanguard coming up behind you with a big sword/polearm/spear can probably save your life.   Overall the game is pretty good if you like medieval fighting, the game has mutiple modes such as Duel (the only place where the code of Chivalry has any power), Free-For-All, Team Objective (taking/defending a fort) and more.

I also grabbed the Ultimate Warrior expansion which isn't bad either but this one is where its at. I HIGHLY recommend people pick up this game, you won't regret it.  Cons(if any):  Umm I guess I could try to point out some annoying tid bits but overall this game is a wonderful experience... but, they have it where you have to pay real money to customize the look of your character(s), which I don't mind, if you find yourself in love with the game like me and wish to continue playing for a long time, then a little 5 dollar skin pack won't hurt. I would just argue that its pretty expensive, I think one helmet could come out to 3 bucks alone which is overkill in my opinion... There is also a mechanic when doing downward swings that seems like a glitch, but since its been in the game so long, I'm sure its intentionally there. It takes some skill to pull it off, but basically when doing an over hand swing, you can quickly turn your back on your opponent and hit him with the blade(or maul) before your swing is even completed, dealing the same amount of damage, as if it was. It's a pretty annoying but effective technique, and I think a lot of players would go ape sh*t if they fixed this, I just think they should turn the damage take down.....   but ANYWAY, I know you don't wanna read a novel about my experience, but I already told you, this game is one of a kind, and everybody should have it. I love choppin heads in Chivalry!!",

Most of the time you can choose which camera you prefer, some servers may restrict it to a single camera angle/point of view.  Game core mechanics are around learning each weapon’s reach and speed and exploiting it to its max potential. Game shop is merely cosmetic, so it isn't pay to win. Currently there is a single glitche that ruins the game:  Drag =&gt; It's an exploit that Devs made legit. Example of drag: With melee weapon you have basically three options when attacking: Horizontal swing, Vertical Overhead and Thrust. While a single click of the left mouse button will trigger a counter clockwise swing attack, you can speed up (make it reach you opponent faster) your attack by turning your mouse (and consequently your facing) into the same direction - which I think is fair. Although you may also 'drag' your facing clockwise while doing the same attack, which will make you hit your enemy while he cannot defend himself (whenever you fail to parry, there is a cooldown of about one second before you can try to parry again). In my opinion, drags are huge immersion breakers for this game. I'd suggest you to search for videos with the subject 'Chivalry dragging' before buying the game.  I'd recommend it if you like First &amp; Third Person medium-to-low paced combat. Or if you ever wanted to try a medieval FPS.  Peace, Leos.",

This game has come really far, as is expected, since it's now a full release.  It's kind of hard to master, and a lot of the harcore veteran players will mess you up like Sandor Clegane messes up filthy peasants. Luckily this game caters to both experienced players looking for a challenge (you'll find most of them in the duel servers) and people that just want to skewer somebody on a brandistock or mash heads with a giant hammer.   This is in many ways a difficult game, and you should be aware of the learning curve when picking it up. It's tons of fun to play with friends, and mastering it feels really good.  It's totaly worth it's pricetag, but if you're unsure, wait for a free weekend or sale.",

            "review_text": "Had more fun running in circles screaming help as I punched anyone who came near me to death than actually playing the game as it's meant to be.  Team Objective is a pit of despair, as objectives are lost or won solely on which team doesn't have a Vanguards swinging the Zwei back and forth into their teammates. Say hello to the archers!  Free For All is THE place to go if you want to be called an idiot for not 1v1'ing people (Despite there being a duel gamemode)  Team Deathmatch is all Vanguards. If you've ever wanted to hear people screaming at the top of their lungs as they lunge three hundred feet forward, this is the place you want to be.  Duels might be the most amusing gamemode to those that don't take Chivalry seriously, for good reason. Nine times out of Ten, its a Knight using some disgusting cosmetic combination while wielding the Messer or its reskin equivalents. The other tenth chance is to be matched against a Man At Arms, already equipped with the Norse Sword or Holy Water Sprinkler, ready to spam the V button to dodge away from your clumsy attacks or rapidly press x and 2 to have his character burst into laughter at the same time he bursts your head open.  Shoutout to the maybe one or two servers that play Capture the Flag, where the small enclave of players actually play together and use weapons that aren't cheap gimmicks.  If you thought the archers were bad in Team Objective, play Last Team Standing. For extra fun, change to a Knight with a Tower Shield and see how many arrows you can have stuck out of its front. Better yet, don't use shields at all and become the human pincushion as Normal Bows, Crossbows, and Javelins are slung at incredibly high speeds into your poor body. Oh, and if you don't do 1v1s when theres only one guy left on either side, prepare to be kicked.  However, hidden in the mess is Torn Banner's Horde maps. Take NPCs that have no idea what pathing is, put them on a large map that has fire and spikes strewn about, and watch as they mercilessly kick or smack each other out of the way and into dangerous objects. I've never had more fun in this game since I witnessed a King three times the character's normal heights football kick his subjects into a spike after lighting everyone on fire.  In all honesty, the Chivalry is mindless fun. Swatting people with what seriously is just a wooden club, impaling heads against walls with a three foot long javelin, joyfully laughing as you punch an archer to death, or the ever-amusing lines of dialogue just make the game something to come back to. (Though maybe not for 20 dollars. Buy it on sale, trust me.)  The main drawback are the obnoxious level differences. 15 and below servers are seriously fun, but you don't learn anything playing with fellow inexperienced players, which leads to a burning hatred by higher levels when you finally are thrown into 15+ servers. People somehow forget colors (Seriously, what is so hard? It's RED VS BLUE) The game is plagued by overzealous veterans who will practically burn you at the stake if you mention that the Claymore, Zwei, Messer, and Maul are painfully overused, or that the combat system needs a big redo seeing as by aiming down and crouching will ally a majority of weapons to swing (FOR FULL DAMAGE MIND YOU) in half their normal time. Looking at you, Claymore.   So if you're thinking of buying this, do it when it's on sale, and play with friends. Community's too toxic otherwise.",

One of the most difficult things about Chivalry, is it's steep learning curve. You've got to know how to parry, when to thrust/overhead/slash at the same time and many more. The community is a bit unforgiving to newbies, but with time you'll get better and they'll respect you.  Rating: 9.5/10",

It is mildly accessible to new players, but a bit steep with its learning curve the more you persist with it. It's also very tropey, latency is definitely a major component of combat, as is grinding to get better weapons at times.  Having said that, it's not impossible to play, it's very fun and definitely unique. The game will give you many good hours, definitely worth a twenty-thirty dollar price tag. The world is also charming, and the amusing gameplay supports some realism. SOME realism. Being beaten to death with the haft of the Godfork for more damage than a mace swing is a bit of a physics conundrum, but, not gamebreaking.  Balancing issues sometimes upset people, and you can sometimes start a fight with the whole 'fair' issue. But, as long as you aren't an archer, you'll have plenty of fun playing the game. If you're an archer, you're a target and will be hunted and killed.  Don't be an archer.  (I'm kidding, go be an archer if you want!)",

You felt like you were on a battlefield and that you were just trying to survive while everyone around you was cut down leaving their killer to charge blindly at you as if to say, 'You're next.'   Then you get out of the low rank rooms and the immersion breaks. It becomes very apparent that it's a video game and that every high ranked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays it way too much.

The graphics are quite nice, but I had to search the web a little to fix lag in some areas. Never fear youtube helped me and I get a solid 60fps in maxed out settings! The gameplay is where its all at, I mean its a game for a reason. You have 3 diverse attack options that are used with your swords, battle axes, maces etc. These are used with both mouse buttons and the wheels, which I have never used in a game for an action type maneuver. The bows in this game almost feel gimped as you can tell not as much time and effort went into developing solid actions. They are in no way unuasable, but its just a shame they are not as effective. Some connection problems here and there on certain servers, but overall pretty decent. If I were to rate this using a number scale I would give it a solid 8/10.

It's easy to launch attacks with reasonable chances of hitting, it's reasonably easy to block or avoid them, and the various weapons handle quite differently.

            "review_text": "Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, in a nutshell, is a great game about medieval warfare via swords, hammers, bows &amp; crossbows, flails, etc. and etc.   There are 7 Gametypes, consisting of Team Objective, King of the Hill, Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Duel Mode, and Last Team Standing. Within those 7 Gametypes are the 2 Teams, the Agatha Knights (Blu) and the Mason Order (Red.) On both of these teams, there are 4 Classes, the Knight, Vanguard, Man-at-Arms, and the Archer. Within these Classes, there is a total of 55 Weapons (including fists), 5 Shields, and 9 Extra Items (Bodkin + Fire + Broadhead Arrows for Bows, Lead Balls + Pebbles for the Sling, Crossbow Bolt + Extra Ammo for the Crossbow, a Smokepot, and the Torches for some maps on some gametypes.)    From what I've experienced, the combat and blocking are great, but they might fail a bit sometimes (not occasionally.) You unlock weapons via rank, but this is a bit difficult for 2 reasons. 1 is that some weapons are just hard to use (to the majority), like the Archer's weapons), and 2 is because the ranking system might whack out, or your progress on a weapon might set back a bit. However, graphics are great, but they require a well-off. If there is every any Lag in the game, be it from graphics or ping, it is very noticeable. However, when your weapon meets its target, it is very rewarding and satisfying. The ambience and screaming is great.   Overall, I give this game a 9/10, and I highly recommend that you buy it. It's worth every penny.",

In my view it is fairly comical, and really pushes to sell itself on an exaggerated take on medieval brutality on the battlefield, but it ultimately enjoyable if even in a tongue-in-cheek fashion.  Just play the tutorial (see how quickly you grit your teeth) or listen to some of the voice-overs to see where I think the game begins it's play on humor. Though I personally prefer an intuitive control scheme as featured in games like Warband, I find this is an enjoyable foray into the first-person competitive stylization of medieval combat.  The issues I have with it are somewhat minor. Projectiles seem to travel slowly and leave glaring streaks which arc behind them, presumably so the player can see where they're going similar in some respect to modern tracer rounds. The second issue is the clunkyness of some of the animations, and the very, very awkward running and moving animations. Take your character to third person, grab a shield, bear it up front, and crouch-walk forward to get a taste of what I mean.   Anyway, in conclusion. Enjoyable, silly and funny. I exploded a man's head with a sling bullet somehow. I did the same with a mace. That's chivalry for you.",

Of course the odd yelling profanities throughout my apartment.   There's actually a lot of skill involved when playing this game, and every class have a good amount of differences to change how you have to play with them. Each weapon too is different with noticeable speed, reach, and damage. You can even get so good that you add crouch to your defense to duck the odd attack.   I've only had the game for three days now, played it for 13hrs, (With still most of the day to go.) and have worked 14hrs out of those days. As I'd bought it on say, I will say it was and will be worth a lot more than I'd paid. I've laid down $60 on a game to play it enough to get my monies worth, but I feel I'll get more out of this.   So I do recommend Chivalry: Medieval Warfare to anyone and everyone. I will have to add that I'd bought the complete pack, (On sale for less that $9.00) and that you must get both! I started with playing Deadliest Warrior for a little while, then went to the Original. I've been hooked on original at the moment trying to level up and get new weapons. I like how both version have different maps, weapons, characters, ect. I feel it's a little more fair playing the original, but I do love bother.  This game my friends, will only get better as it goes. Right now it's great with a few minor bugs that really don't get in the way.",

The other thing, is that playing with ping 50-80 feels like playing with 500 - games doesn't keep track of your actions: you blocked on your side, but in the actual, you didn't  - Vanguard is OP. And at the same time there're restictions on Archers which are average.  This is fun game to play, and I recommend buying it on sale, because it feels like a modification not a stand-alone game.  P.S. There's also Deadliest warriors, but nobody plays it and it has ever worse balance problems. P.S2.

Normally I don't like games like these because I do enjoy -some- story to go with my game before I jump into multiplayer. I discovered however that Chivalry does in fact have just that! The Blue Agatha's are fighting against the Red Mason's who are rebelling against the kingdom! And that's it. That's all I need. The decapitations in Chivalry are always amazing to see and perform on people and surprisingly the games hit detection is really well done for a first person sword game. You wouldn't think it would be as polished as it is, yet the game is amazingly well crafted for being indie. The combat is fast, dynamic, and if you want a Medieval campagin to go with it then I recommend picking up Mount and Blade: Warband. Both games go great together and play very similar! I love Chivalry and it's one of those games that goes perfectly with a good music playlist going in the background. I'll give Chivalry an 8/10. I would rate it higher but I think the game needs more maps! Other than that: It's GREAT!",

Some people call it a hack and slash, that's more because first person fighters don't really exist. The fighting mechanics are top notch. Once you get deeper and deeper into the mechanics, the more you want to play.   It has some trouble because there are a good number of bugs. Leveling up can take a while because the game frequently forgets what weapons you've leveled up and how much experience you have. It's a minor thing considering most of the better class weapons are the starting ones. It comes down to preference at higher levels of weapons.   The greatest strength the game has is that it feels closer to real combat than most games do. The weapons are fairly balanced, there are some notable weapons, that perform less than expected. However, it plays into the game, because people will think you're not very skilled for choosing them, so they get cocky. Once they think they have the upper hand, they will be more prone to mistakes.   I recommend this game to anyone (maybe not little kids, it's kind of violent), It's unique and worth the cost. For its asking price, it's a bargain. I give this game a 9/10, I'd give it a perfect, but there are the leveling bugs. Once those are fixed, this is a perfect tournament fighter.

I have 14 kills (supposedly) to my next Crossbow unlock, and low and behold, no ammount of kills seems to be counting towards it. I know I am not the only one with this issue.

You can learn how to play quickly, but it has a pretty big learning curve.  Blocking is extremely difficult to master. Unless you are the knight class, you can't hold down the block key. If you block at the wrong time (such as too early) you will be left COMPLETELY open for an easy attack. You can force your opponent into blocking by faking a swing. I have used it on a few people and when you pull it off correctly... easy hit.  If you connect with their head, whether with an arrow or a swing, you instantly kill them. Each class (4 different kinds) has their own strengths and weaknesses and they each have many different weapons to choose from.  All in all, I think this is a very fun game and definitely recommend it!",

There's a ton of depth to what is otherwise a simple set of game mechanics (3 types of attacks: stab which has the farthest reach, overhead when attacks from above and does the most damage, and horizontal slash which is the easiest to land and can hit people to the side of you, plus parrying/blocking strikes and dodging/strafing), just like how in CS you're basically just pointing your cursor and shooting people, yet there's also the matter of crouching to move silently, effective use of cover, and being able to accurate hit people and score headshots while not getting killed yourself. Yet even here, the gameplay has even more depth to it than CS, and being able to effectively parry enemies' attacks and not get hit while at the same time being able to hit them without getting parried or blocked is very challenging. The challenge is what makes it fun for me though, and what keeps me coming back for more. The weapons in the game are also very balanced for the most part, there is a lot of variety in the weapons each class can use. Just like CS you can quickly jump into a game and be instantly in the action, either playing many rounds for a long time or just playing a couple to kill some time and then dropping it. There are also several different game types, ranging from FFA and Team Deathmatch to team objective-based game types. So really, the best comparison I can make in terms of gameplay is to Counterstrike, just with swords/axes/spears/etc (with associated close-combat mechanics) and (cross)bows. I highly recommend this, as I have found it to be a great alternative when taking a break from Natural Selection 2 (which you should also get lol).",

The Agatha Knights and The Mason Order. And These 2 fractions clash in bloody wars for land. So you have 4 main classes, Archer, Man- at- Arms, vanguard, and knight. All of them have their own abilitys. Archer has a Bow and short sword, Man at arms is like a weaker version of the knight, but is quick on his feet, Vanguard, a heavly armored knight with a massive pole hammer that slams down on other enemies, then the knight that has a longsword, but can be swapped for a sword and shield. Now the gameplay. The gameplay is really fun IMO, you have team objective, Free for all, Duel, Team deathmatch, and my favorite, last team standing. All of them are unique in there own ways. And lastly the combat system, which is actually really fun. You can do all of these cool combos and slash the opponent from any direction. And the game looks awesome on Unreal engine 3. So overall, I recomend this game to anyone.",

I got what i expected from this title: a nice feeling of handling a melee weapon. Controls are easy to handle but it also feel much natural than mount &amp; blade for example (i'm fan of this serie). Speaking of this one, there is no solo campaign in Chivalry and its purely a PVP/Multiplayer game (TDM, Duel, Team Objective..). Though, in order to feel kinda RPG, you won't have everything unlocked at the beginning so just spending time unlocking everything is a good approach to learn the different gameplay link to this class or this weapon.  What could be frustrating about in chivalry is the required skill if you want to reach the top of the score tab. There is a clear gap between noob and quality players. That sounds obvious eh? I insist on this because in FPS with guns, even the best player cannot avoid bullets. In chivalry there is no bullet, a good player will avoid every single attack you throw at him, countering and killing you easily (and even laugh with his character). You're warned!  Those ways or another, arrows will always find their ways into your knee!",

'free for all' is too much of a mess. and i only play on official servers with no mods. i love the game. yes the game makes me want to punch a baby sometimes but i still very much enjoy playing it. u have ur good days and u have ur bad. im ranked around lvl 24 i think and i can do fairly well now. max ranked players make short work of me but it encourages u to play smart and look for opportunities rather than just running and swinging. if u want a challenging game with a steep learning curve give it a shot. also its free weekend so definately give it a shot. at full price i still think the game is worth it. skins are stupid over priced but they do nothing other than change appearances so there is no point to them IMO. the DLC deadliest warrior is garbage. stay way from that. i havnt logged 700+ hrs like some other ppl here who only play 1 game for 3 years, but its definately in my games to play rotation. i cant play a game that much that long without taking a break and playing someone else in between. if u are like me u will enjoy this game.",

Most games these days are some form of multiplayer be a shooter game, MOBA or MMO we seem to be connected online with any game we play so we have to learn to addapt to this new formula of always online. Chivalry does this as it brings fun combat from a game like skyrim which is singleplayer enhances the combat tenfold and then turns it into an online game in the formula of a fps game. In Chivalry you compet in free for alls, team deathmatches and objetive type games. Each game helps you work towards reaching the next level as well as leveling up your sword/axe/bow into the next far better one.   There is no endgame only the pride in knowing you have improved yourself from when you first started playing, being able to kill everyone in a free for all makes you feel good inside as you stand their hacking away the limbs of one of your enemys. This game is gory enough to make killing someone with the three diffrent swings really intresting each time as you don't know which limb will fall off first.   There are four diffrent classes which all bring something diffrent to the battlefield, Archers are the long ranged characters which stand at a distance and use a variety of diffrent medieval ranged weapons none of which have amazing accuracy so provide a chalenge as you get used to aiming and figuring out the best time and place to shoot the enemy at. You have the man at arms which is the quick moving quick attacking character that runs in and runs out which allows for small amounts of damage to be inflicted before one of the heavier more damaging charachters comes in to finsih the enemy. Their is the character who is sortof in the middle quicker moving then the tanky class but slow enough to inflict damage they have a charing attack which can allow them to enter the battle quick but once they are in the skirimish they can't leave easily. Finally there is the very tanky very slow class which goes into battle and if played wells dismebers the dead coprses at the end.   The game offers a lot of variety and unique gameplay elements that most games these days dont offer. I hugely enjoy playing this game with my friends with skype as it leads to a enjoyble time. I hope you play this game for yourself and figure out your own stratergy to become the master of the battle field and lead your troops to victory!",

This is very frusturating as what usally ends up in the clusters in one of two things: Team killing and poeple blindy swinging their wepons hoping for a kill.

Mostly because you end up inside the mobfight and there is one guy swinging the biggest and nastiest weapon he could find.

Cons:  Trolls which exist in pretty much every online game out there can be annoying, team mates kicking you off logs over rivers or off ledges etc..  Not enough people play it, you are not going to get a decent game early in the morning.

Also quite fast learning curve, the hardest part is to learn the timing of everything, every weapon is a bit different, but it's not hard at all. The combat itself excels in its balance, it requires you to know what you are using and how to use it effectively, you can't click-fest and be utterly successful, this makes for some neat strategic fights. The 32 player limit does not hinder it, however more players would improve significantly the chaos and tension you get. Apart from the combat, the game modes are exceptionally fun and feel more mission-like, unlike other games where you only have to stay and capture a 1flag, this one requires you to burn villages, kill villagers, push bomb carts, man ballistas, protect trebuchets, etc. 9.5/10",

Not a game to take too seriously and when i say this i mean in just about every aspect whether competitively or stat tracking. This is more of a casual game imo and i see many gamers get upset due to an 'accidental' team kill but in chivalry this is common due to the way many approach this game combined w/ blood lust.  I always encourage sale cost opposed to retail and same goes for this game but as far as hours to dollar ratio the game is worth its asking price.  You dont have to be a fan of mount and blade to enjoy this and although there are common aspects as far as atmosphere and other elements i will say that the simularities end there and yes the combat mechanism is somewhat the same = mouse click hack and slash , it feels more 'relaxed' and forgiving than mount and blade but just like mount and blade this is keyboard and mouse and can keybind.  Level cap is rather low but the leveling means very little other than some weapon unlccks which are scarce when comparing this to more traditional MP shooters/slashers. Classes are pretty much the norm w/ ranged ( archer ) , light and quick, medium (vangaurd) or heavy ( knight ) all w/ their own attributes/prs &amp; cons.  Game looks ok and runs well and have had 60fps w/ infrequesnt dips. Ffinding active servers not a prob ( as of 1/12/2013 ) and this may be one of the few games where one can jump in and not feel overwhelmed by higher leveled players ( my first game i ranked # 1 in scoreboard check screenshot ) meaning one can just jump in and hold ones own making chivalry noob friendly.  Casual , fun and overall a solid gaming exp but short from ground breaking or innovative gameplay/visuals etc.  Not a must have or own but i must try imho and some find it hard to get into but the majority pick right up and have a blast doing it.  7.5 ",

This makes the game amazing because of the fact that as the sword moves so does the hitbox. This allows for some great plays, or absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tactics. You see, because there are a multitude of strikes you are able to use, you can make the sword do all kinds of wierd ♥♥♥♥. In chivalry, your arrow keys move you around, but your mouse acts as your hips. So what that means is that you can do a simple left click (which is a swing from the right) and move your mouse, slowing down or quickening your strikes because of the hitbox situation. This lets you literally become a ♥♥♥♥ing tornado when you fight people. This makes skilled players nearly impossible to kill if you aren't as good as them. I fail to see how it is 'skill' though. Too many times has a vanguard rushed me and broken his spine to throw an attack. And yes...you can literally break your spine dodging. This game is fun, but it's also stupid.",

The game just remains in the load screen for all eternity, no message saying connection has failed, no refresh nothing. Second, there have been times where the server list refuses to load. I have refreshed it countless times, and still it remains blank. Third. Blocking mechanics... Ooooh blocking mechanics. I'll put it as simply as possible; You would think that if your character is blocking, in the direction of where the enemy swings that you would block the blow yes? Well how much more ♥♥♥♥ing wrong can you be? There have been times in this game where I have had a shield up, directly where they swung, and yet by the magical force of terrible programming, I've successfully had a claymore go through my shield and into my face... and let's not ignore the blinding issue of glitching... This is possibly the most glitched game ever. I've had characters teleport, I've had characters freeze in place and kill me, I've been killed by invisable characters played by players that aren't even on the scoreboard, I've even had my character's head just randomly explode once...

Chivalry was incredibly fun two years ago before all the exploits in the system were discovered, but they quickly became the metagame once they were mastered. Instantaneous overheads, feinting at no stamina cost, the ridiculous range of mouse dragging, all of this contributed to the game in its current (read: current as of half a year ago when I last gave it a chance) state. If running around in circles making noncommittal dives at someone until finally making a timid landing while moving erratically with your mouse is an experience you feel is worth five dollars, go for it.

The feel of melee combat is awesome, with great sounds and fantastic animations. It looks great and plays great.  The reason I don't recommend this is that when you get to a high enough skill level, the gameplay drops to a level of absurdity that involves confusing the game engine by contorting your character's body in all sorts of ways that are impossible in real life, to cause the side of your weapon's hitbox to collide with back of the enemy's exposed hitbox. I.e. turning your character 180 degrees while cutting straight down (or stabbing forward) with a very long two handed weapon, trying to make the flat of the blade (not the edge or tip) touch your opponent's back at the last second of the swing. Your character being off-balance and stumbling forward gives you a great range advantage when you can spin on your heels with the mouse to guide the already finished strike (but still active hitbox) into your enemy. This is just one of the styles to guide a vertical strike of any kind for a hit, and there are many other awkward and unnatural ways to make contact and kite with different weapons at top level play.  I'd recommend this game for casuals since its fun when its casual vs casual, but then those casuals end up having to face the pros on the same server and don't have a prayer because of the abnormal weapon styles.  The devs missed the mark with this one by a small margin, and hopefully a sequel to this game might be able to improve on some of the failures from the ground up with new code.",

Range, the range is really really ♥♥♥♥ed up, between one handed weapons to two handed weapons, it is not really accurate to the model itself and thus you just can't estimate it, unless you've got the hang of it by experience of course.  2.

Now you can witness them first hand! Please join us at a higher ranking server and watch as all of the fun that you had experienced that day disappear to a puff of smoke to you being mad that you died against one of those knights, who presumably call it skill, i personally see it as an exploit but whatever floats their boat.  3. 'Look down to hit in the speed of light technique' especially prominent with the vanguards, you probably have seen them already, the ones who only get claymore and twirl around like madman? Oh yes, it is full of people like that, is it skill or is it just a small exploit that Torn Banners couldn't be bothered with to fix? You decide.  Overall there are tons of more stuff that most people won't like, but if you are not like 'most' people, then please, be my guest and buy the game, have fun twirling around in a medieval simulator that is totally not a medieval simulator...

I must honestly say after been playing this game for roughly over a year that I'm quite dissapointed in how the game has evolved after the patches this game has recieved. It started out as something great, but it really just appears that this game was developed with just intentions to earn money, and not to really create this awesome melee game that could have been unique and so much better, for this game is pretty fun due to its unique melee combat mechanics, but the reason why I linger at this game is pretty much for the fact because there is none other game that has simular style than this, otherwise I would have left swiftly. Because I don't think Torn Banner Studios are taking things serious, the game company is lead by a kid who would believe that he knows whats wrong and right in every turn and refuse to accept aid that so many of us players around the community has offered, it has been a pretty shity year. They have this forum where they try to communicate to other players, but it has been a complete failure all along due to lack of communication to the player base, and most of the times they seek to avoid questions because they ♥♥♥♥ed up with one patch, and repeated the mistake in the second patch. Also, there was this one occasion where they had a 'Balance council' going on, where experienced players of the game were handpicked by members of Torn Banner Studios to share their experience with the game and possibly balance out the game once for all, but instead. Steve Piggott who'se the owner of the Game Developing Studio decided to take some changes into his own hands, him and his glorious 300 hours in the game. So for example, there was this weapon, Bearded Axe that has been broken for nearly over a year, since they buffed the 'windup' for the weapon in the first patch after release, and so we all complained about Bearded Axe being too fast for its own good, that the attack animation would just become desyncronizhed, and so later after the Balance patch, Steve Piggott concluded that he would increase the base damage on Bearded Axe since the whole competitive scene of chivalry cried out that the weapon was broken but needed fixing, but no one used the weapon anyways. This gives me as a player the impression that most changes in the game are done on the fly, and that Steve Piggott has NO absolute any idea what the ♥♥♥♥ he is doing most of the times, and since he won't accept any help from others, he is the one making the decisions, so you have to consider that changes will be made depending on his opinion, and his opinion ALONE. This game might seem alright to play if you are just a 'casual' player who just want to play it every now and then, but if you wish to go deep into the game, you will have a pretty much harsh time.  I would not recommand to buy this game due to lack of compitance in the development team, lets just say they had a gold mine that they blew up, and I am eager to see a new game come out that would be simular to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, but just better and with a much more serious developing team than what Torn Banner Studios can offer.

However, I don't recommend this game to anyone currently and to look for another one. The reasons are the game mechanics. It's not realistic at all and it breaks the immersion. For example, a vanguard would be fighting three different people, instead of taking a defensive position they'd just walk backwards and forwards swinging their Zweihander like they are blind infinitely. There's also the weird mechanic of looking directly at the ground while overheading to get a super fast overhead that is most of the time impossible to block. And there's the mechanic known as 'matrixing' where you would crouch down and look at the sky, manipulating your player model so that the other person can't hit you even though they are right in front of you. I really wanted to like this game but it isn't for me, maybe I'd come back to it just to finish the achievements or when they bring updates to the mechanics.",

The second time, I had a nuclear explosion.   At first I thought Chivalry was a fun game. You could explode people's head's with a punch, or Black Knight them removing limb by limb, roadhouse people to death and even beat them with a stick.  Then the patches came. Patch after patch after patch, this game became unplayable. Most games reward skill, this one doesnt; it punishes it. Don't bother to spend some time learning a class, a weapon or a game style, or don't even bother learning the game or trying to be good at it, sooner or later there will be a patch that will literally screw things over for everyone, then you are back at noob camp. Like to use maces ? Well, soon there will be a patch that will make maces the ♥♥♥♥♥iest weapons in the game, now swords are the hype. Learned to use swords ? Well suck it up, patch has come and now swords are ♥♥♥♥, maces are back, but now they cost more stamina.  The developers of this game forsook gameplay and entertainment for an endless quest about 'balance'. It's not about fixing the bugs in the game, it's about nerfing the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything that's though as unbalanced. 'Sure, let's keep the glitches and bugs, as long as knights can no longer outfight vanguards'. The catch is, at no point has it hit the devs that there will never be players will the same amount of skill; there will always be someone better, there will always be a weapon that's better than the other, unless you make them all the same.  Nerfs in this game are inconsistent, random and uncalled. They range from simply altering the stats for a class, to completely overhauling the game out of the blue.  What I learned with this game is, if you suck at it, cry about it on the devs forums and they'll release a patch that will nerf everything and make it easier for you, and harder for old players.  So, bottom line: This game is a money trap. My recommendation is not to buy it. You'll have fun for a couple of months, you'll develop some skills. Then there will be a nerf, and everything goes down the drain. This game is a marketing pitch, a sales scam. The nerfs and patches have only one goal in mind: To always make the game easier for new players, recent buyers or potential customers, while always triving to bring down veteran players by forcing them to constantly change their gameplay stile.

A lot of the hits you swing just don't register, many times I have seen my sword or axe swing right through a character and not count as a hit, or (worst of all) an arrow literally passing through someone when it blatantly hit them. It becomes infuriating when the game no longer becomes based on skill but sheerly through luck as to whether or not the game recognizes that you hit the other player. This isn't just from my side, there have been times where I have defeated other players purely because the game did not register hits they landed on me which should definitley have killed me.  I will admit, the settings, weapons and levels are really well made, and being in the middle of a big 10 player sword swinging melee is a lot of fun, but I just can't enjoy a game where whether or not I win is based on the game registering hits and arrows that blatantly landed.

But let's not call a game bug that the developers were lazy to fix, a combat system.   Asking 22,9 € for this game is a robbery. Only buy it on steam stales or humble bundles if it's between 1-5 € and you are feeling like giving the developers a tip for the effort, because that's all it's worth.

Or wait for Mordhau that game will show chivalry players, that how a melee combat system should look like and what they do is a dancing lesson not a melee fight. (seriously get that game when it comes out , don't waste time on chivalry)  Last but not least, are you a fan of story driven rpg games, with way better combat system than this P.O.S. game and larger scale battles?

            "review_text": "There is a list of reasons for my thumbs down below. All you need to know if you're looking to buy is this:   -This game is not for casual players OR new players. If you did not own this game a year or two ago, don't buy it now. You will be destroyed. You will lose. You will be angry. Save yourself the frustration.-     Let me start off by saying I have a great and many hours on this game. I started playing more than a year ago, when things were a lot more fun. As time went on, the enjoyment started to sink away. I beat a good part of the learning curve and began to shine more. I would have recommended this game, and did. I brought friends to play with. Sadly, in the end, key things broke my loyalty.  1: Community. The community of this game will make you hate all of humanity. They're (not all, but many) childish and insulting. Totally unhelpful. You will run into 'that guy' that kicks you over and over again on your own team to goad you into attacking him so he can votekick you for team damage.  2: The patching. I'm not going to sit here and say something about the ballance between classes with the patches. No. It is that each time they patch the game, more of it seems to break. Be it your weapon unlocks, your rank, or the whole screen going black while you play- Torn Banner is all out of free passes in my book to get this process right.  3: Hacking. There are two types of people that will tell you this doesn't happen. 1 is the guy that defends this game and thinks you're just a noob. 2 is the hacker. I knew hackers in this game, and to stop a votekick on themselves, they'd just say to the kicker 'You mad bro? learn to play, don't votekick.' and the players would vote no. They'd keep the hacker in the game by assuming the kicker was simply mad about losing.  Nothing is more frustrating than knowing the hacker personally and watching them game the system that easy because the community is so poor.  Again, there was a time I would have been all in for this game. I'd have defended all it's flaws. But as of late, after Deadliest Warrior (which is also not very good), I would tell you only to buy this game if all of the above won't bother you.",

You will freqiently see your arrows pass through others, blows that land, but dont, and you'll be beheaded by enemies that are not even swinging their weapons. The differences between how you perceive your moves and how the sprites perform are sluggish as best.

            "review_text": "SO. To try and organize the pros/cons with the game.. hmm... Well, to start off I suppose I could just say that its frustrating and aggravating.  First and foremost, the first thing you'll notice is that the community in this game complains. A lot. Every game you join, every class will complain that one of the other classes is OP. Gets annoying, but hey, I guess the devs know this, so there's a chat disable option in the config when you press Escape.  Second: BALANCE. Specifically, shields. They are SO easy to use. They make you immune to feints, archers, and generally any attacks as long as there's less than, say, 3 people attacking you at any given time. Being double or triple teamed? No problem; you have a shield. You can just turtle until help comes around. Archers killing your whole team? No fear; you have a shield. None else can block arrows but you. Going up a good player who attacks unpredictably? No fear; you have a shield and can just hold it up until he runs out of stamina. As long as you can keep up with where the attacks are coming from, you can always beat someone without a shield. The rest of the game is debatable, what with the different class abilities (knights have HP, Men At Arms have.. SOME speed, Vanguards have one shot charge attacks, and archers just sorta hang off in the background safe and sound), but shields really do get annoying. But hey, you can use one too. Unless you're a vanguard, they you'll just have to settle for having the best weapons in the game.  Third: Fun: Is the game fun? Can be if you go up against someone who's pretty much as good (or bad) as you. Other than that, you'll probably die instantly from what's left of the playerbase, which is just people who have 700 hours each of gametime. Fun to play with friends, if you can convince them to buy a game on the few hours you'll play it. Most players seem to quit this game before they get to level 17. Most of the players you'll see are about level 40-50 (pretty dang high). The vast majority of servers on the list are always empty. You'll have to settle for playing Free For All most of the time, which means lots of vanguards running around nearly one shotting you from behind, unless you're a knight, in which case you'll still die a lot in FFA. Vanguards reign supreme there.  Oh yeah, there's Low Level servers now for levels 0-15 for you to learn the ropes on. Once you hit level 16, time to go into the big boy servers and fight people who know all the game's mechanics, flaws, and exploits.   Anyway, it can be fun or funny sometimes, but they are far and inbetween the frustrating bits. _________________________________________________________________ As an added bonus I suppose I'll post what the pros and cons of each class are:  Archers: Low HP, fast but tiny and low damageing weapons (but they have double backstab damage) and, of course, Bows.  Knight: High HP, slow weapons, decent damage, good range. Pretty boring class.  Vanguard: Little bit less HP than knight, best weapons in the game (most range/damage, and sometimes speed), charge attack (superpower; lets them fly with considerable control) Most of the players use this class.  Man At Arms: has a semblance of a dodge (but sometimes it doesn't feel like it registers on the other person's end in time, and you get hit when it seems like you should'a been away), medium speed weapons, low damage, low HP, medium to low range (probably don't wanna use this one; people complained about it so much that Torn Banner nerfed it to obsoleteness).",

I've wanted this game almost a year and, yet, I've been on the brink of abandoning many times in the few 15 hours I've played. The game can be very fun once you get to level 30-40, but you got to be motivated to get that far.  Review:   Chivalry Mediavel Warfare is a very competitive, skill-based game with a medieval atmosphere. The combat are realistic and fast-paced. With 4 classes and over 60 weapons, you're almost sure to find a build that suits your fighting style. The game is based on skill and practice. You unlock weapon by using other weapons of the same category. The only things you can unlock with money is cosmetic, so it's not a Pay-To-Win. It has 5 interesting gamemodes and custom maps and mods.   Pro:  -Based on skill and practice. You can not pay to have upgrades you must practice to get better. -Dragging, Matrixing and other such things are very fun to learn and use in fights, even if they bugs. -Very fun, once you know how to fight. -Lots of different builds possible. -Team Objective, Team Deathmatch, Last Team Standing and Duel are fun and very easy to get better. -Nice graphics.   Con:  -Lots of hackers and team-killers on beginner servers- unintentional for the latter. And when you accuse someone of hacking, other people say you're a newbie and you don't know the game. -Lots of intentional team-killers on normal servers. -There is a huge difference of skills between beginner servers and normal servers. -The community can be very toxic with its hackers, team-killers, ragers and other such people. -If you've got a high ping or more than 10-15% team damage, you're gonna get kick. -It's very long and hard to be good. It took me 10 hours to be half-way decent on beginner servers. It takes hundred of hours to be good on normal server. And all the while you're gonna get destroy by better people and end the game with 2/23/4. -The devs have stopped working on the games. That means all the little annoying bugs aren't going to get fixed. On the other side, positive bugs suchs as dragging aren't gonna get removed either.   Beginner tips:  -First thing you should do after buying the game is the Training Map. Go in Training then Training Map. It shows you have to block, attack, combo, feint and how to play the different classes. It's very useful at the beginning. -Use a shield. Don't hold it in position all the time but use it to block more easily until you get used to the speed of the weapons and dragging. -If you're playing as a Vanguard or a Knight, don't side-swing in team games. You're gonna end up killing more allies than ennemies and get kick. -If you like to do a lot of burst damage and have a good defense, pick Knight. If you like to do a lot of damage and keep your distance use Vanguard. If you like to attack very fast use Man-At-Arm. -Don't play Archer until you're used to blocking with a sword. Archer is the hardest class to master. -Stick to beginner servers until you're level 10 to 15. But don't wait until you're 16 to play on normal server or it'll be twice as hard.",

The end and start of weapon swings do full damage, even though physically this should result in minimal damage due to low momentum. - Rough around the edges; approaching a ramp from the side can cause you to get stuck in the air. Many other bugs present in the game. - Awkward hit registration. Strikes that LOOK like they should connect do not connect. Strikes from the side sometimes connect with a shield even when there is nothing in the way.   Verdict: 4/10. It's quick, bloody and fun. But if you are looking for a realistic medieval combat simulation, this is not your game. It's also littered with janky animations and weird bugs all around. And once you have left the noob servers, be prepared for the onslaught of veteran players who know how to abuse 'dragging' (delaying or speeding up swings to catch you off-guard) to ridiculous levels, as well as those who know how to abuse the terrible animations to contort their character's body to dodge weapons in physically impossible ways. Infinitely frustrating when there are these players in the game; and in all honesty, if a game is frustrating to no end because of its broken mechanics which people abuse, then there is probably little point to playing it for fun. Because unless you have some masochistic tendencies, and you enjoy dying a million times over to bug abusers, then you will not find this game fun. YMMV.",

What this does is remove your ability to actually have a fair fight using the block, kick and parry mechanics that function well and in the way they were intended to.   The inherent mechanics of the game allow for this ridiculousness, and NO, the devs have apparently said that they have no intention of fixing swing speed manipulatioin. Sadly, when not on free weekends there will undoubtedly be at least a couple of exploiters at the top of every sever manipulating their way to buggy victory.",

I either miss the vanguard's charge completely or get someone behind my actual target. Even then, all fights play out the same. Whoever gets hit first will always lose. You swing, they block. You feint then swing, lag compensation will still block. You thrust, it misses. Overhead, it misses. You block, they swing and hit your side. They thrust, it hits your feet. They overhead, it cracks your skull. You think they feint since their swing stopped, then their halberd is inside your chest. Sure, I could join a team objective server and try to actually play the objective, but it just turns into a mosh pit at chokepoints. There may be two or three people guarding the caravans or pushing the battering ram, but everyone else is in the town square wildly swinging and killing as many of their teammates as they are enemies.  Either after someone sneaks around and does the objectives with zero interference or the time runs out, the game mode changes to either TDM (see: mosh pit in town square) or free-for-all (mosh pit in town square but you can kill everyone with no penalties) and the cycle repeats.",

Armor unlocks and paints and exp bars make the game more reminiscent of Call of Duty than an original game. Paints become borderline camouflage as it is difficult to see what team enemies with painted armor are on, and the exp bar for ranks makes the game feel more like a grind and less like a, well, game.  If you would've asked me a year ago, I would've recommended this game with no hesitation. Now, I urge you to buy with caution.

            "review_text": "I cannot ♥♥♥♥ing recommend this steaming pile of game. I honestly can't. I LOVED Age of Chivalry, the free to play predescesor to this game. That was amazing. This game? Not so much. I'll try to go over all of it's flaws and what it does well...  PROS -Gorey first-person/3rd-person combat including decapitations and loss of arms/legs. -Cool, original objectives to play in maps such as kill all the peasant in a village before you batter down a door and kill the king. -Very pretty graphics! -Weapon unlock system. Get x amount of kills with x weapon to unlock the next weapon in the tier. -Character customization. -Decent selection of game modes to play. CONS -♥♥♥♥ match making, server filters do ♥♥♥♥all. -Glitchy terrain, I tend to get stuck on nothing quite often. -RANK system (I'll go into detail of this later, main reason why I hate this game) -♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC. They have skins all over the place ranging from £0.99 to £3.99 to £8.99... These skins are a ripoff to be honest. You can unlock 4 helmets with a package but ONLY FOR ONE TEAM. You have to buy many skins SEPERATELY for classes AND teams as well. All in all, if you want all the skin DLCs it's going to cost you a friggin fortune. -Clunky, weird combat (at higher ranks)  The rank system in this is ♥♥♥♥ing godawful. When you start off there are servers for new players. Rank 0 - 15. These servers are generally very fun to play on as you can take it in your own pace, everyone seems to do alright. You never quite dominate, you never get crushed. BUT! The moment you surpass rank 15 (I am currently rank 17 and ♥♥♥♥ this game, never touching it again) you are now forbidden to play on these servers. You can't get in. As far as I know, there's no way to reset your rank either and I'm sure if there was you'd have to lose your weapon unlocks too. Not to keen on losing everything I worked for. The moment I ranked up enough to never ever be let within a 200 foot radius of those servers again I was just thrown out into the world of rank 60s and such dominating. They would crouch under my blows even though many times I saw my weapon hit them, they'll feign attacks (not too against it but it gets frustrating, kinda like a bully threatening to hit you over and over) and then there's the worst part... You seem to be able to manipulate how the weapons work. This is beyond god awful. They will start a swing so far away from you that you'd never ever get hit. Then they'll turn to you in a milisecond and apparently the tiny tiny bit of force that sword would have left from the end of that swing is enough to pop your head and everyone elses around you. As a new player, it's IMPOSSIBLE to actually enjoy getting ganked on these servers by high ranked ♥♥♥♥heads. I've seen this mostly in free-for-all.  Now, if you move onto team deathmatch instead, the situation is a bit different. There's not as much weird awkward swinging taking place but instead, you'll run out to fight people only to discover your team mates will leave you to do a ♥♥♥♥ing 1v5 and you ultimately can do ♥♥♥♥all about it. The 'chase' system pretty much ensures that you've no ♥♥♥♥ing chance to run away either. They need to implement some sort of 'unfair as ♥♥♥♥ let me escape you absolute ♥♥♥♥wits' system as well to counter that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Did I also mention that you get teamkilled every other second in team deathmatch? Directly or indirectly, you will die by your teams hand A LOT in this game. They'll swipe without consideration and chop your head off just because they wanna get a kill and you end up with just about no health at all. The next enemy staggers in and steps on your toe and you fall over dead. It's just ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating and dying in this game is so annoying. While dying in other games doesn't feel NEARLY as annoying as it does in this you may sometimes have to witness other people trying to hack off the limbs of your corpse (I'm guilty of this one myself as I was curious when I started playing if you could. And you can.) or seeing someone slap their balls on your toes.  I ADORED Age of Chivalry. I played that game so much and the community was amazing and there were so many cool people. Never in that game did I have to experience clunky awkward ♥♥♥♥ing combat with people suddenly dropping down to their knees looking like they were praying when they were infact busy shoving their knives into your cockhole.   All in all, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a decent game if you don't mind one of the worst learning curves I've ever seen in a game before. Most of my time in this I actually spent playing against BOTS because that's less of a ♥♥♥♥ing pain. Though, sadly you cannot unlock new weapons while fighting bots so I was trying to force myself to get new unlocks to enjoy myself but I turned out to just get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of and usually stay ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for the rest of the day. I'm usually never angry but this ♥♥♥♥ing game is just so infuriating....  Also, on a last note... Assists do ♥♥♥♥all and they're basically a slap in the face saying someone stole your ♥♥♥♥ing kill.

The HUD was overly simple with no option to change it, the textures were pretty gross, and the combat was chaotic at best but very slow at worst. There are multiple ways to kill people like slashing, stabbing and overhead attacks but none of these seem very different from one another and stabbing (the one I thought would take the shortest amount of time) was almost useless because of the time it took to stab someone. On top of that, the tutorial levels glitched up for me so I wasn't able to complete them. I feel that there should have been some sort of actual mission to get you into the game, other than just the option to play with bots. The servers were very laggy for me, and I was not able to play with my friends 9 times out of 10. The textures were also very gross and reminded me of a low-quality Oblivion even when they were at max settings. Overall I'd give the game a 4/10, but I may not have played it long enough to make a decision like this.

This game on the other hand, is as random and as frustrating as it can get. Surely, if you're a pro player, you might be thinking: 'HURR GITGUD'. But c'mon, when five enemies target you AT THE SAME TIME without even thinking 'can this guy really handle it?', I can't help but just kind of... something.  Also, sometimes when you SEE the blade go through you, you don't get hit, and when you CLEARLY dodge it, you take massive damage. Also I don't need to mention how heavier weapons somehow manage to hit you faster than a dagger  I've played this game for 40 hours now, I think, so I guess I can call it a guilty pleasure. It's probably because it's the only sword &amp; shield game I can find on Steam... And no, I am not buying Dark Souls",

They added mechanics to the game that make the game more fun on a competetive side but destroy any kind of realism this game once had. These mechanics is what divides the low leveled players and the higher leveled players the problem is however how easy they are too learn while also beeing very very strong. weapons got 3 strong points the first point would be damage the second point would be speed and the third would be range. some weapons will do massive damage however they are slow but thanks to these mechanics speed has become somewhat irrelevant as any weapon can be quite fast.  pro's  Can be allot of fun once you can get the hang of it  Is often in sale  Enough variety in modes you can play  Allot of fun to just ♥♥♥♥ around in aswell  free basic cosmetic (colours)  also paid cosmetic (different looking suit/sword)  cons new players will get destroyed once they leave there low level servers or if those are full. new players tend to do allot of teamdamage as they dont understand what strike to use in crowded fights. archers can be annoying though a shield will give you allot of protection against arrows or just run in a weird pattern, the mechancics really allow some weapons to just become very op. the mechanics also make no sense realistic wise i understand its a game but when i see a knight do a 360 so hes strikes has more speed kinda ruins it for me.   Conclusion: This game is worth it while it is in sale wich it luckily often is however if you want to be able to keepup with the higher levels you will need to learn how to use these mechanics and practice them. But even after that u will still get destroyed some more than others depending on ur own skill and the weapon as some weapons are just much better than others *cough* maul *cough* this game is far from balanced but worth it if it is in sale. It is though allot of fun to just ♥♥♥♥ around wich i find myself doing 80% as when i try i just end up raging on how the game has become.",

Other problems include clunky controls, unbalanced weapons, unfriendly and often abusive community, unbalanced maps with clear advantages and disatvantages (so you have groups of players swarming one or two chokepoints which defeats even the most rudimentary team tactics) and laggy servers. I tried to enjoy the blasted thing. I really wanted to. Heck, I've been waiting for a game like that since I saw 'The Two Towers' back in 2002 and thought 'Hey, wouldn't it be awesome to have a medieval FPS where you can attack and defend castles with your buddies?' That dream remains unfulfilled.    A massive disappointment is what I call this game. A bloody shame since it had so much promise. Definitely not worth the price tag. If you get it for 80% off and have a few friends to play with then maybe it'll be worth an hour or two of your time.

When you hold a shield to block your opponents attacks, they can just kill you with a counter-side nonsense which people does it by just simply hitting the CTRL button.  In Warband, there are so many negative things about graphic. Some YOLO peeps just joins into a DM server on Warband and kills people by just simply clicking etc., they do some combat mechanic things by an accident and kill people and they be like, 'THIS GAME IS SO EASY HELL YEH.' but it actually ain't. After I've joined a Warband Clan which have so many people who plays the game as 'experts' I found out this game ain't that easy.   Like there are so many things that you can do to be one step ahead of your opponnent, towards the victory. After you play both games for a while(as a person who wants to taste some hard MP game thing.) you may see that Warband is much better than Chivalry Medieval Warfare for people who tries hard. This game is all about simply left clicking to kill people and simply right clicking to avoid someone's attack. If you just want to play a game to cheer yourself up when you're upset, you can try this one.  I hope you guys can understand what I meant.  Videolarda başta oyun bana gayet güzel gözüktü. Arkadaşlarınızın arasında oynadığınız da gerçekten eğlenceli olduğu doğrudur. Dövüş sistemi dışındaki her şey güzel. Size saldıran birisini bloklamak için kalkan tuttuğunuzda rakibiniz sizi sadece bir 'farklı yön' saçmalığı ile öldürebiliyor. Ki bu saçmalığı yapmak sadece CTRL butonuna basmaktan ibaret.   Warband'da grafikler olmak üzere bir çok negatif özellik var. Bazı YOLO'cu arkadaşlar bir DM serverına giriyor, insanları sadece mouse'a basarak öldürüyor. Bu elemanlar ayrıca yanlışıkla birkaç dövüş mekaniğini yanlışıkla kullanarak adam felan öldürüyorlar. Daha sonra çıkıp söyledikleri şey genelde 'BU OYUN ÇOK KOLAY, AHKAJDKFJASD.' tarzı oluyor. Aslında oyunun cidden kolaylıkla bir alakası yok, en azından MP tarafı. Şöyle güzel oyuncuları olan ve oyunu try hard şeklinde oynayan bir klana katıldıktan sonra anladım ki, oyun cidden o kadar kolay değil.   Mesela, zafere doğru rakibinizin bir adım önünde olmak için yapabileceğiniz bir çok şey var. En azından iki oyunuda biraz try hard deneyen birisi olarak oynarsanız büyük ihtimalle göreceksiniz ki Warband bu oyundan kat kat daha güzel. Oyunun tüm olayı sadece saldırıp adamı öldürmek için sol klik yapıp, bloklamak içinde sağ klik yaparak beklemekten ibaret. Moraliniz bozukken biraz şöyle neşelenmek için oynayabileceğiniz güzel bir oyun. Eğer öyle bir oyun arıyorsanız deniyebilirsiniz.",

THINGS THAT CHIVALRY HAS DONE TERRIBLY WRONG.   1: Chivalry keeps adding bad cosmetic oddities and fantasy-like garbage instead of historical gear  2: No different types of armor for different parts of the body.  3: The hitboxes are bad and you can die from having only your big toe hit. Games never get this right.  4: Abuseable visual animations allow you to 'hide' your attacks. It makes parrying into a guessing game.  5: The very start of your attack swings, where your weapon has no momentum, will still deal full damage even if you only tap their solid steel chestplate with the part of the greatsword closest to the guard.  6: Weapon arcs are limited to the exact same main strike, and an alt version from the other side, rather than realistic strikes that can be angled from bottom left to upper right, or upper left to bottom right.  7: The 'ballerina fighting' players will do 360 spins while they attack with a thrust because it lets them threaten more opponents, avoid a parry, and strike from different angles. Also players will get one shot by 'reverse overheads' because other players are using #3, #5, and spinning to hit their opponent in the head from behind themselves while they crouch.. I fully understand how great it is to have unhindered control of your character... I must INSIST on how bad spinning crouching CLOWN fighting begins to feel for me after I've done it for awhile. Its some dumb cartoony ♥♥♥♥ that would be fine in tf2, but I detest it in a medieval warfare game like this.  8: The 'dash' mechanic of the man-at-arms feels horrible. There were countless things that would have been better.   There are many more problems, but I hope this was a complete enough list to help you steer clear of this game and give your money to a developer like Mordhau that looks like they're doing everything correctly from the very start.",

I understand these are features meant by the devs to give the game a high-end skill gap, but being spawn killed in about every game just because you haven't learned on how to swing your camera around while jumping+crouching at the same time for a super mega headshot isn't fun.

The use of medieval weapons like swords and shields, the arena style gameplay, and dismemberment physics that are gore and blood done right!  The bad? Pretty much everything else. I managed to do pretty well in a short amount of time, climbing the scoreboards and getting over the noob hump relatively quick. Unfortunately in my group of friends, I was the only one. Everyone I was playing with could not get used to glitch exploitation and angry MW players that are more obtuse than that little troll the billy goat had to stomp da' ♥♥♥♥ out. The game also disconnected a fair amount and had a lot of lag issues.  Overall the gaming experience is skin deep and the gameplay feels like a mod, not an officially released game. I know, I know, this game was originally a mod. But that's no excuse for this game being so glitchy and unpolished, especially since they seem to release DLC for an otherwise messy game.  If you want to bang your head against a wall for a few hours, buy this game for 2.50 during a steam sale. But if you want rich combat and immersive gameplay with a decent community to back it, then abandon all your hope, ye who enter here.",

If everyone in the server is running low pings, the battles can be intense and rewarding. However once pings begin to climb, your sword will pass through your enemies like spectres and your blocks will mean nothing against the enemys delayed hits. I really enjoy the idea of this game, and when it works, I have a blast. But because of the spotty hit detection. I'm left wishing I had saved my money.  July 2015: A year Later nothing has changed... It has only gotten worse. US servers are bombarded by people across the globe with pings in the 300's taking advantage of the garbage hit detection. Try to take advantage of this yourself and join a server half way across the world, and you're instantly kicked. Aparrently we're just too kind and allow anyone to walk into our servers... Interesting.  Besides the game breaking Client side hit detection, the game has become nothing more than a metagame of even more ridiculous exploits that have never been fixed by the devs. Why? You may ask. It's simple... The devs care more about piggy backing DLC content into the game to make more money, and have completely abandoned the actual game and gameplay mechanics.  So, a year later do I recommend this game? Have I changed my mind? Absolutley not. My initial thumbs down stands ten fold.",

            "review_text": " (Wow, I hit the character limit for reviews. I didn't know that was a thing.)   Note: My focus of this review will be on the Archer class. I understand that the melee combat is the selling point of this game, and I will touch on it. But I often see tons of people talk about what is wrong with the melee system, and I feel like the issues surrounding the Archer don't get acknowledged as much as they should.    (Also note that this review will be VERY lengthy; I doubt that very many people will see it, but I want to make sure that the few that do know the state that Chivalry is in. But another big reason that I'm writing this is the fact that I loved this game, and hate to see what has happened to it. This is why my review is rather biased.)      Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has suffered a problem that contrasts the stereotypical 'indie game': A fair bit of the stuff you find from indie companies tends to be a half-a**ed alpha/beta version that runs terribly and is in dire need of improvement. (At least, this is one of many images that the term 'indie' has received.) And in the majority of those cases, the game is later abandoned by the developer(s), and left to rot; it never becomes a better game. Well, Chivalry has run this course backwards: What started out as a flawed, but overall well-executed game has become a pile of glitches and 'features' that has chased away several long-term players, myself being one.      --- Summary (of how the gameplay functions, that is) ---    So let's go over the basics of gameplay. There are four classes: Knight, Vanguard, Man-At-Arms, and Archer. The Knight is a tank class that wields many strong two-handed weapons, along with a secondary one-handed weapon and shield. The Vanguard is an assault class that, while having less protection than the Knight, utilizes a number of heavy swords, spears, and halberds. The Vanguard is capable of charging: After sprinting around for a period of time, he will place his arms in a locked-position of sorts. This indicates that, when you left-click, he will lunge forward and strike the enemy, dealing a massive blow that can even one-shot some classes. The third class, the Man-At-Arms, is agile. He can 'dodge' out of the way of attacks by means of either double-tapping a directional button, or a 'One-button dodge' shortcut, configurable in the Settings. With swords and maces, this class is about running in, avoiding attacks, and landing moderate, fast damage to enemies. This would be the last melee class recommended to new players, due to its low health and dodging mechanics that can be somewhat difficult to understand. Finally, the Archer is the black sheep: His primary weapon consists of either a bow, a crossbow, or javelins. Depending on which you choose, you'll either be in the back firing arrows at enemy classes to weaken/kill them, taking out enemy Archers to help your teammates, or charge into melee range and act as both a fighter as well as a distraction. This class has the lowest health of all, and should avoid melee combat as often as possible.    All attacks cost energy, which is depleted from a bar that appears on-screen with the health bar. Swinging without hitting somebody (and with it, feinting), parrying/blocking, holding a loaded arrow on the bow, and kicking use up some of this energy. And when that bar runs out, you can no longer do combo attacks, and if you parry/block an attack, you get stunned for a little while, which gives the enemy the chance you attack you while you're unable to defend yourself. You have to wait until it recharges before heading back into combat.    The way that maps work on servers is very similar to other PvP games: You have your standard Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, etc.. I won't go over how each of them works, because I assume that you'll either already know, or are willing to take a couple minutes to look them up. In addition to these, you also have two gamemodes that aren't seen quite as often: Duel, in which a group of people are put up against eachother in a 1 v.s 1 style, and the person with the most amount of victories at the end is declared the winner. And the second, Team Objective: In this mode, players are placed on two teams of either 12 or 16, where one is playing offense, and the other, defense. One of the teams has a set of goals that they must accomplish in a set period of time, before they end up losing the match. The other team's objective is to stop them from achieving those goals. If offense wins, then the two move on to the next objective. These objectives can range from things such as pushing a wagon through a gate, shooting down a barricade with a Ballista, slaying peasants, and even killing one of the two military generals that commands the teams: Feydrid Kearn, and Malric Terrowin.    The game supports player-owned servers, as well as modding. But to raise your rank (which is, for the most part, simply just a number), you have to play on the official Torn Banner-hosted servers. Your 'rank' allows you to unlock special helmets at different levels: At 30, you get a silver version of the default helmets. At 40, a Black version of the Veteran helmets, a gold at 50, and a pink at 60, etc.. You can also gain access to veteran helmets by unlocking all the primary weapons of a class, which involves getting a specific number of kills using any of the weapons in a section of the weapons list.      --- The Issues ---    So, what are the problems with this game? Well, as I mentioned at the start, this is a game that has gone sour the more it gets updated. At the start, people were presented with a game that uses a combat system that relied on timing, accuracy, focus, and didn't have the sort of 'whoever attacks first, wins' feeling that arises from other PvP games, namely first-person shooters. People appeared to have clung to that idea, and as a result, made Chivalry quite a popular game. At one point (in 2013, if I'm not mistaken), they had sold over 1.2 million copies of the game, which is rather impressive for a first standalone game (as it originally started out as a Half-Life 2 mod by the name of 'Age of Chivalry'). Over time, though, that good combat system has deteriorated, to the point that people have left the game entirely.    To make a long story short: Certain melee weapons in the game have been unbalanced for a very long time (some from the very start, from what I've been told by friends), and continue to be unbalanced to this day, 3-4 years later. Torn Banner has adopted the idea of 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' when it comes to the fighting styles that you see. For example, if you turn your player to have their back face the enemy, crouch, point your camera straight up to the sky, and perform an overhead, the weapon will strike the enemy and deal damage to them during the 'wind-up phase'. (This is supposed to be the point where your character is readying their weapon for a strike, and gives players a short window of time to counter-strike, before they have to block or dodge out of the way.) And if your weapon is slow enough, such as the Maul for the Knight, then you can turn your character around after the 'reverse-overhead' attack lands, and hit your opponent twice, which will kill anybody, assuming they don't block either one or both of the attacks. Another combat style, which is used heavily now-a-days, is known as 'dragging'. This is a very basic concept: If you swing your weapon to the left, then you turn right during the attack to 'drag' your weapon, thus slowing the swing speed and causing your opponent to (hopefully) block too early.

            "review_text": "Summary: Pass, unless you want to end up featured in one of those 'gamers rage' YouTube compilation videos.  Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is the single most frustrating game that I have ever played.  The premise and execution looked intriguing enough initially; however, once I dove into the game itself I found that this game really punishes you for dying. Not only are you brutally mangled by other players, but the camera forces you to watch your body ragdoll for quite a while before it allows you to look away to 'ghost' after other players, while simultaneously showing you just how many times that other player has killed you. It feels like everything about the death system is about rubbing your nose in it. Unless you're on a kill streak and you're just on fire (proverbially), it's a really unpleasant and enfuriating experience. The Free-For-All gameplay mode is a joke. A surprisingly large number of players rage about 'honor' and fighting one-on-one in some of the team-based play modes, but once it becomes a free-for-all, 'honor' goes out the window and everyone is running around looking for opportunities to stab- or shoot- someone else in the back.  If I did well in the game, it felt dull, like there was no challenge. If I did poorly, it was infuriating and I felt challenged to continue to play until I was able to do better. Whether I did poorly or well, every time I stopped playing the game, I considered just uninstalling it.  Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is one of the prettiest and most promising failures I've played in some time, but ultimately it is - in my opinion - a complete and utter failure. I never once had a moment in this game where I thought 'wow, that was really fun.' When I won, I was bored, and when I lost, I was infuriated. I've never experienced that before in a game, and it was a such a bad experience that I'm never going back.",

No, with vanguard after you run around for a bit you get and extra damage buff, walk up behind someone and one shot them, no skill required.

If I could get a refund for it I would instantly, sadly I cant and im stuck with it and its one of the only medieval games i have.  This game has been abandoned by the developers and is so broken its is nearly impossible to find a fair fight. First of all theres the exploits, people spinning around in circles, twisting their bodies in ways that will make you want to call an exorcist and then they hit you in the head and kill you in one blow, going completely through your shield. And its not just that they go through your shield, the attacks hit instantly. Now you may say 'That's not an exploit thats just the way the game works!' I highly doubt the developers of the game purposely made it so you can turn around look up and swing and instant kill somebody through a shield covering 95% of their body, and hit somebody instantly. The mechanics werent built for that to happen therefore ITS AN EXPLOIT.   OP classes/weapons make it so certain classes dont even stand a chance. For example I was a man at arms, fast moving guy who can do a decent bit of damage going up against a knight, who has high stamina and high health but also happens to have a weaon that can one shot everybody (If not mostly everybody) who was exploiting. Fortunately because he was exploiting he was fairly predictable and I could dodge him and get some attacks in. I got 5 hits in and he still didnt die until sadly I slipped up and he turned around, looked up did an overhead swing and just killed me in one hit. In what way is this game balanced and fair? Blocking doesnt work half of the time (Welcome to chivalry) and that might be because of ping or whatever but the problem is still there and needs to be fixed regardless. It can be fun at times and thank every god in existence that I bought it for like 3 bucks cause this is in no way shape or form worth the full price for a game as broken as this. I want to play this game, but its just too broken, not fun and unfair, most of the time. I would get a $3 refund for it and go try a csgo case if I could but sadly that opportunity is long gone.  And its not even just the exploits, its the teamkilling, the spawntrapping, the hackers, the bugs, the salty community, the invisible walls in maps that interrupt gameplay and ofcourse, the gangrapes that occur when you respawn and 3 knights have surrounded you and brought you down to half health not even a second after.   Before you buy it, ask yourself if you seriously want to spend your hard earned money on a game that is so broken it will only bring you frustration and dissapointment.  Dont believe me? Then take a look, not just at the other negative reviews but at this video. This is SOME of the exploits people do and the types of players you will find in EVERY official server:         YouTube™ Video:  Chivalry is a well made game&nbsp;",

Good one! Enjoy yourself to many bizzare medieval attacks, such as rainbows (where you put your back to the enemy and overhead, resulting in an instant attack that low level players will not be able to block, or will block too early!), drags (where their attack is slowed down to a point where low level players will not be able to predict and block early) - Good luck reading feints in this game, when you have about &lt;0.3 seconds determining if it is a feint or not, without any certainty that it is, this is why so many players begin to gamble (when you hit without trying to read).  You can also spam about 8 feints without losing all of your stamina (not taking in to account weapon drain) - While a lot of the community is friendly, the parts I have seen (various FFA servers / duelyards), it is rather the opposite, it's better in NA/AU as well. - This game is riddled with exploits (There is a shield exploit that, when practised correctly, lets you avoid being stunned as a result of no stamina and even gives you some back), there are also many two hand exploits of which I will not discuss. - The gap of skill is huge in this game, a player above level 40 is just going to ♥♥♥♥ on you. - When you first saw this game, you probably thought: 'wow i am going to look so gud be aragon' - sadly, this is not the case. While you do have a few (helmets) skins, most of the skins will cost between €1-5, limiting the players to the ACTUAL cool-looking skins.  TL;DR: if you want to get this game AND be decent at it, you're going to want to devote, many many hours into it, and at the end it's all pointless.",

That is one of the classes which are present in the game, the glorious man at arms. This class has basically unlimitied amounts of stamina, and can teleport around the map at their own will. They also have access to some of the most unbalanced weapons that are present in the game.   Basically Man at arms is a class where they have taken all the op weapons from the different classes and given to this extremly overpowered class. This means that they can for example kill a knight with only 3 hits using one of the fastest weapons in game and meanwhile teleporting around the map.  The developers simply refuse to fix this element, this is because the developers are bunch of MAA lovers, they simply love them, and they hate the ♥♥♥♥♥ outta knights and rest. So the results are a highly overpowered class played alll the lowranks who use every op weapons at their disposal and now roam the servers of Chivalry killing everyone on sight with their cursed norse swords and axes. Many of the man at arms weapons, makes it impossible to block facing them. For example an Man at arms charging you with a norse sword and starts spamming you with alternative slash, you have nearly no chance at blocking them, because this require you to turn 180 degrees to actually block the slash.  This would probably the game of the year hadnt been for Man at Arms, spawn of Satan.",

Ever seen anyone stab someone over his or her shoulder with a 5-ft blade? Me neither. But this game decides what is acceptable realism according to its on arbitary rulings. If you want a stable, skill-based game where luck has no part in your ability to win, do not buy this game. It'll only make you want to throw you computer at the nearest innocent by-stander.  Furthermore, I've never felt more deprived as a winner in this game, there is no satisfaction, only the want to disassemble your opponent's body because he or she did something incredibly cheap just to win a pointless match.

It won't help you against the countless backstabbing and teamkilling of your comrades, tho, which is another big problem.

Overall: 2/10  Pros first (short list): -Fair Graphics for no visual lag. -Fairly easy controls for all that you can do. -Tons of servers to play on.  Cons (long list): -The games physics as relates to bows is a joke, base-line bows of the time had much better distance and travel time on arrows. -Lengths of weapons are not properly simulated, Classes with the heaviest armor seem to be the weakest (Note on history: anyone in that time period who wore that level of armor was raised to be a soldier from a really young age, they could realitively easily scale walls in full body armor and their weapons, this game fails to simulate that.) -Mapping as for running and slashing is fine, but the Archer class is highly ignored in the designs with a massive lack of elevated areas to shoot from, as was the case in history in defence situations with Archers using walls, towers and rooftops. -Armor ranking seems to mean next to nothing between the classes. -While friendly damage is expected, the penalties for it I found rather stupid given archers always end up hitting friendlies (been on both ends of the bow.) -Team killing/wounding is a common and idiotic happening in this game and commonly makes for failed team matches. Specially when 80% of your teams on FFA right outside the spawn.  There is a much longer list of things I found that makes this game undesirable to play, but I dont feel like its worth the time writing that much out.   In short: If you know anything about history and/or have held/used the real weapons, dont play this game. If you just love seeing tons of gore and blood and dont really care at all about a game being based on a historical time period being inaccurate as heck, then I would suggest this is a game for you.",

However there IS something staisfying about slicing off somone's arm or Head or likewise skewering them with a Javelin which under the archer class is my prefered weapon although its lack of ammuniton is a pain. Since this is my first playthrough i enjoyed it and i also disliked it obviously not having played it enough. Team play is difficult yet straight forward with friendly fire always on. You MUST beware of players uniforms and always keep an eye out if your not sure whether or not the cursor is blue or red before slashing. Can i recommend this game? Yes but only if you care to play a buggy non-triple A title that lacks refinement and (hopefully) will be fixed. This is a decent game to pick up on sale or play for the free weekend. That being said for full price no i cannot recommend it simply because the hitboxes are just terrible, that and knee deep water tends to be derpy.

I can't stop playing it, however, I do equate it to flogging myself; against unrealistic/broken physics and metagamer movement exploits of these failures.   I don't recommend people buy it until a few key issues are addressed.   Level 1-16 are a whirlwhind of fun for non-meta gamers. After you reach a certain level (takes 1-3 days), you are cast into a 'non-noob' rank pool of players. As a competent gamer, I was completely stunned by the immediate brick wall you face when you 'graduate' post lv 16. There needs to be a game-mode which enforces a HALO-style rank/matchmaking system so that players can be matched together based on an average recent skill.   I've noticed there are two types of players in Chivalry: Those who play and move their character based on their perception of real life physics [and] Those who exploit the game engine's weak grasp on realistic physics. Some gamers prefer to win at all costs; even if its sprinting, jumping crouching and swinging 100 pound claymore from left shoulder to right shoulder as if it were a twig, all at the same time. To make the physics worse, the devs have decided to add a speed factor to swinging a weapon based on how fast the player can move the mouse. What you'll find is players with LOW DPI mice, huge mouse pads, spamming tons of keys, jumping, crouching, looking down and swiping their mice wildly across a huge mouse pad. The client [you, the player] cant even properly render the movement-spam these players are producing, while you're dying to a sword you didn't even see swing. It makes any logical/reaction-based sword strategy extremely difficult to execute. The developers need to implement better physics based on the gear the different classes use. Weight factor should be reduced if a player opts to carry less weapons or equipment. Remove the ridiculous fast-mouse-power-swing idea. Slow player movement down or show me videos where people can wear full body-chain mail, have a tower shield on their back, jump 5 feet in the air while crouching into a cannonball and managing to swing and hit with a claymore before they hit the ground. This isn't Call of Duty guy-.. wait..   If player 'effectiveness' were ranked, there wouldn't be lopsided servers in almost every occasion.  It takes me 10-30 minutes before this game becomes unbearable..  Yet I keep going back.",

I can't stop playing it, however, I do equate it to flogging myself; against unrealistic/broken physics and metagamer movement exploits of these failures.   I don't recommend people buy it until a few key issues are addressed.   Level 1-16 are a whirlwhind of fun for non-meta gamers. After you reach a certain level (takes 1-3 days), you are cast into a 'non-noob' rank pool of players. As a competent gamer, I was completely stunned by the immediate brick wall you face when you 'graduate' post lv 16. There needs to be a game-mode which enforces a HALO-style rank/matchmaking system so that players can be matched together based on an average recent skill.   I've noticed there are two types of players in Chivalry: Those who play and move their character based on their perception of real life physics [and] Those who exploit the game engine's weak grasp on realistic physics. Some gamers prefer to win at all costs; even if its sprinting, jumping crouching and swinging 100 pound claymore from left shoulder to right shoulder as if it were a twig, all at the same time. To make the physics worse, the devs have decided to add a speed factor to swinging a weapon based on how fast the player can move the mouse. What you'll find is players with LOW DPI mice, huge mouse pads, spamming tons of keys, jumping, crouching, looking down and swiping their mice wildly across a huge mouse pad. The client [you, the player] cant even properly render the movement-spam these players are producing, while you're dying to a sword you didn't even see swing. It makes any logical/reaction-based sword strategy extremely difficult to execute. The developers need to implement better physics based on the gear the different classes use. Weight factor should be reduced if a player opts to carry less weapons or equipment. Remove the ridiculous fast-mouse-power-swing idea. Slow player movement down or show me videos where people can wear full body-chain mail, have a tower shield on their back, jump 5 feet in the air while crouching into a cannonball and managing to swing and hit with a claymore before they hit the ground. This isn't Call of Duty guy-.. wait..   If player 'effectiveness' were ranked, there wouldn't be lopsided servers in almost every occasion.  It takes me 10-30 minutes before this game becomes unbearable..  Yet I keep going back.",

The poor optimization and insanely bad netcode are also big issues (because of Unreal Engine 3). The biggest fault that I find however is that it doesn't feel like a team-game despite being presented as one. Fighting alongside allies is usually a detriment due to the friendly fire. None of the mechanics of the game encourage players to fight in cohesion or even really work as a team. Everything about the gameplay feels disjointed, like playing a mod of an FPS that never intended to have melee combat in the first place (that may well be how this game started).
