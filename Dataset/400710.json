I hope in the future more is done with this concept because altough the core of the game is interesting fresh I wish there was a little more ways to experence it instead of just duels with CPU. Now the lack of more ways to play is at no fault the game because what is offrered is great and enough to keep me happy for a long time to come I just love it so much that I wish there was more.  ",
