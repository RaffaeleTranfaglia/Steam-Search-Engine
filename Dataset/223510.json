            "review_text": "One of the richest exploration experiences I have gotten from a game. The triangulation cartography system is brilliant, and carelessness will get you lost (and probably killed). The main objective of the game -- find plants, synthesize medicines, cure the plague -- is entertaining, though sometimes I wished for a little more depth in the story and the mechanics.  This game made me wish that the developers had more funding, because they could have made a great game instead of a good game with a few very cool concepts. I think that feeling is a mark of how well they succeeded.",

            "review_text": "Miasmata is a game with a great sense of adventure and exploration. Majority of the time is spent just exploring with no fear of danger leaving you to plot and map out the island as you go. The mechanics for taking notes on landmarks you see and using them to get your bearings around the island to fill out the map more is great fun and very rewarding. It is quite unique and I have never seen it in a game before. By using buildings, statues, and stone formations you can use triangulation to check your location and add your surroundings to the map you create.  The creature that roams the island can be a positive or a negative for many people whether they are looking for some slight horror and suspense of hiding from it, or if they just don't want to be bothered by it. The creature isn't a constant threat and holds a good balance to appease either type of player. When the creature draws near your heart pounds and you do your best to stay hidden and hope it passes.  The game works very well with exploration and filling out the log book and looking for specific plants to be used in antidotes and medicines help drive you to explore more. Though you will want to keep exploration to the days as much as possible making your way to camps to rest through the night. The night time is extremely dark and after losing track of time and getting stranded in the middle of the night you will never want to be left out again stumbling through the darkness hardly able to see what lies ahead.  If you enjoy the slower pace and exploration which you most likely do if you care enough to look at reviews and recommendations about the game then you won't be disappointed. This game draws you into the world and makes you want to spend time in it seeing what lies just over the next crest.  I highly recommend it, there isn't much like it.",

I only have 5 hours on the game. Heres why, I HATE THE MONSTER!, when I was playing I realised that if you run he finds you easier in the first minute of the game I drowned... So sad. The game is challenging for wimps like me because its only about 2% of the time you see the monster but you spend 98% of the time cowering hoping to never see him. But he will find you... He will... Trust me. I did learn something cool about the monster and it's what made me buy the game. The monster doesn't just appear when you go to a certain place (Sometimes he does but thats only in places where theres something to do with the cure there (don't quote me on that)) he actually is always moving and when your in your lab making some science shizzles he's out there following your trail and looking for you... He's not just going to appear when you go somewhere, he appears whenever he has tracked you down! The starting area is safe but once you cross that line the beast will GET YOU!!!! Overall I like the game even though I hate horror games, but hey we all hate something right?, but this one will give you the creeps!   9/10 Good but losing that plant that you needed being chased by the monster is a bummer :(  P.S. He appears more the more time into a save you do. Example, Day 1: You won't see him unless you run in circles the entire day, Day 2: You might encounter him briefly, Day 5: You will see him on multiple occasions by now, Day 10: You will see him everyday, Day 20: How are you still alive?",

            "review_text": "Although I generally don't prefer this type of games, I was interested in Miasmata first of all because of its title and then after seeing a few impressive screenshots from it.   Miasmata is made by two guys, with an engine that they created themselves, thus everything about, around and in this game is 100% original. This for itself would be enough to praise this game, however in the essence of things (ie, gameplay, settings etc) there is so much more to admire.   Despite the lack of action, there are a lots of things to keep you on your toes as your character is sick and needs to regularly seek plants and mix them up to make medicine. This is far more fascinating in-game than it may sound theoretically; looking for the plants means wandering around the beautiful and immersive environments, exploring the island, which is the setting of the game, from one corner to another; and we are not talking about a tiny island! There are endless coastlines, deep forests, steep cliffs, ravines, huge trees, dense vegetation, mystic ruins and swamps, all setting up a peaceful but at times bizzarrely hostile environment that, personally I found extremely captivating and charming.   I mentioned lack of action a few lines above; however there is no lack of challenge. There is one enemy you have to avoid, and this enemy may or may not appear; once it does appear however it won't leave you easily in peace and it's far more fierce and lethal than it may look. The wonderful music adds a lot to the atmosphere and so do the realistic graphics and ambient sounds.   There are a few things that I found a bit discouraging at certain times - like the character being unable to control his speed while going down a hill and ending up seriously wounded, feverish and having lost valuable stuff that he was carrying, or having to walk miles and miles to locate one plant that couldn't be found anywhere else while having no actual hint about where to look - but as it turned out they were not enough to make me lose hope about moving on. I loved this game and I have to say I felt sad when my mission was over and I had to end it.",

The in-game instructions could have used some more clarity for the cartography, but honestly I felt foolish for not realizing how easy a system it was; simply making it more obvious that you have to tag an unknown landmark AFTER establishing your position with two known ones should have been obvious but for some reason wasn't. Didn't ruin the experience, and I found the cartography system to compliment the feeling of exploration encouragement/hide-and-seek aspects pretty well.  Try it if you've seen this on here for awhile and been tempted: It's worth it.",

As others have said the running away from the monster element is feeble and more of a nuisance than an excitement though the first couple of times it is frightening. The main part of the game is running round the island and trying not to get lost. It sounds simple but it really is excellent fun.  There is also some gathering of plants and making medicines which is so-so, and a bit of piecing together of history by reading scraps of papers you find. It seems that more and more games use this technique and it is nearly always feeble. Fortunately it doesn't detract from the game.  I think it was made by a two person team.

It starts out pretty rough at least partly by design, as being thrown into an unfamiliar setting and being so physically weak that you can barely move around and get easily lost are all part of the character. However, as you play the game you will learn how to get around more easily with the cartography mechanics, creating the right drugs to get you out of tough situations, and just as a result of internalizing the game's systems. Each time you create a shot that returns some of your physical abiltiies to normal the regular paths become easier to traverse and more difficult places become reachable. By the end of the game, you can get around so easily that it's hard to remember how rough it was at the beginning. Overall, the experience is very satisfying and I throughly recommend the game to anyone with the patience to get through the slower and tougher parts early on.",

            "review_text": "A great horror-survival-exploration game that's worthy of attention. You begin the game stranded on a beach, exiled because of a contagious disease... That's it, then it's basically up to you to explore, find clues and try to stay alive in hope of finding a cure.  Quick Summary: This game is a great example of an exploration game where you need to make sure you have enough water to stay alive and where, at night, losing your source of light is the worst thing ever, while avoiding an unknown creature and trying to find a cure for your condition by searching the local plantlife for ingredients. It is an immersive, tense and beautiful experience that I highly recomment to everyone interested.   +  Atmosphere:  Man does this game nail everything I like about atmosphere and ambiance.  It is stunning and mysterious at day and yet absolutley terrifying and pitch-black at night,  and the ambient sounds really makes the environment come alive.   Sound:  While the game has almost no music, it more than makes up for it by the afromented ambient sounds  which range from flowing water to tweeting birds.  +-  Graphics:  Alright, let's face it: the character model looks kinda bad, as does a few other things;  the water from the pitcher comes to mind...  The fauna however looks absolutley stunning, and you could (and probably will) get lost in the islands locales  whether merely trying to get a better view or to find new plants to experiment on.   Gameplay:  Gameplay isn't exactly what you would call exiting and is a matter of taste.  Do you like picking up random plant life, checking them for new components, combining medicine,  triangulating your position trying to explore the island while keeping yourself from dehydrating or getting  sick-er as well as being scared because darkness is falling then getting lost for days on end?  Also, there is a creature on the island that is far from friendly...  Personally, I love it, it is a tense experience, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but on the other  hand, if any or all of these sound appealing to you I highly recommend this game.",

Cons: -The 'Creature' is a huge pain, and not in a good way. It feels broken most of the time and out of place. -No food is necessary, which takes away from the survival aspect a bit -A lot of the achievements are glitchy (search on the forums for the 3rd party fix before you start playing)  In summary: If you're willing to put up with the annoyance of the Creature, it's worth picking up for people who like adventure/exploration and survival games.",

You start off stranded on an island, infected with the plaque and in search of the cure for the plaque. Luckily you are on an island on which the cure for the plaque was researched.  As sick as you are your bodies’ condition isn't good at all. You can't run very far without getting out of breath, swimming is beyond question and falling down a hill becomes a regular thing. After a while (or after falling down) your condition gets even worse and you start having fever. But fortunately there is plenty of plants and herbs that can be manufactured to a temporary medicament against the fever. Besides the fever medicament you may also make temporary as well as permanent body enhancement medicaments, which allow you to run faster, to run a greater distance and even to swim. Recipes for the different meds just as parts of the story behind the research team are found all over the island on certain campsites.  As you progress through the island searching for the cure you can't miss the beast, a creature which sole purpose it is to obstruct you. As soon as it hits you your fever worsens and after the second hit you lose you consciousness. There are several possibilities to escape from the beast and you have to escape from it not being able to harm or even killing it.  Another major part of the game is to triangulate your position and map the island. Without triangulating it is very hard to find your way to different parts of the island so triangulate as often as possible. If you can't find any known landmark and need to know where you are, you can drink a tonic you are able to mix to get temporary the ability to know where you are on the map.  By finishing the game you might get behind the story of the island, the research team and yourself.  Regarding the graphics: It isn't the best looking game BUT the weather and the different times of day are excellent conveyed. You always get really the feeling that it is as late as it is.

Also, there are a few technical glitches here and there that can detract from the immersiveness of the game. I like to think I have a decent computer, as it runs both most games very smoothly, yet this game runs like ♥♥♥♥ sometimes. The game feels a bit rushed as well, as you have a knife that doesn't kill anything and animals that run around that you can't eat. Despite the technical issues and some missing features, I really like this game.  Also, the giant panthers are very friendly and love to play fetch.",

It's a survival horror game where you are seeking a cure for your disease - while something is hunting you. A group of scientists found the cure here, but they are a little bit dead now and the formula has to be re-discovered. Can you find a cure for the Plague before you become Purina Monster Chow?  I also suggest that you read General Rye's negative review. His reasons for hating it are reasons why I like it. Yes, it seems like you are a 300 pound clod stumbling around an island - just like a real person, and not some uber-marine from your local FPS. You know what happens at night? It gets dark! Why the heck would you be wandering around in the dark when there's some freaky monster wandering around? Also, the game penalizes you for being awake all day (a neat thing that few games do), with moments of exhaustion, which can be remedied by (strangely enough) sleeping!  I'd like to see a sequel.",

And the beast that seeks you out (like the zombies in day Z) and hunts you while you are trying to find a cure for your plague. Highly recommend .",

It seemed like the perfect game for my mood at the time, nothing too heavy or intense, no fiddly controls to figure out or the wonderful task of re-binding keys due to being left-handed! And what a game it turned out to be.  For the most part an island exploration simulator, where you wander through valleys, over mountaintops and into dense jungle, Miasmata can be a theraputic, calming experience. Aside from the task of having to locate and synthesize a number of plants into drugs to cure your character of an unknown plague (admittedly not a relaxing expeience for the guy you're playing), there are no constant swarms of enemies charging towards you or restrictive timeframe placed upon your actions, besides the passing of day into night.   Of course this changes to a degree a certain number of days into the game, when another 'element' is added to the experience, which certainly got my blood pumping on a few occasions! Having a beast roaming the island with you adds an air of menace to proceedings, as you learn to be stealthier, sneakier or downright panicky in order to esacape its clutches when you cross paths.  In truth, the beast is only a small part of the joy of Miasmata, as I gained the most pleasure from simply roaming over the terrain, triangulating my way across the map in search of the next hut, piece of vital information, or important plant for examination. If you have a powerful enough system, the island is a wonder to behold, if somewhat sparse if you are used to running into streams of characters to interact with.  I couldn't recommend this game highly enough, for the time I invested into it. Buy it when it's on a Steam sale like I did and enjoy :)",

That's a pretty good description of Miasmata.  Exploration is the driving mechanic of the game, and in this respect, the island of Eden is a paradise. Every part of the island is unique, with hills, rivers, swamps, ancient ruins, and dense foliage of many kinds. The lighting and water effects are very impressive. At the same time, Eden's beauty is tempered by its dangers. Fatigue, sickness, and the terror of being stalked are conveyed in an organic and immersive fashion, which makes them all the scarier.  Miasmata is a beautiful sandbox experience. I also found it very frightening, at times. Perhaps not everyone will find it as scary as I did, but anyone who loves exploring will find it very engaging.",

I got lost in the game multiple times, where I had lost my location on the map completely, and there when playing this game I had my heart racing and my fingers pressing heavily on the keyboard, in order to move my character faster away from the threat in-game.

            "review_text": "Great concept, poor execution.   First off, I'll start with what I liked about the game.  Mapping is pretty cool, the idea of using triangulation to uncover the map and mark yourself/landmarks is awesome and works fairly well.  The island is large, there is tons to explore, and the game lets you do just that if you want.  Night time is dark, and you can easily get lost if you don't have a light. The idea of finding, identifying, and mixing different flora of the island together to make different tonics/medicines is nice.  The slightly bad. Map at night. If you're not holding anything, then you pull out your lighter at night to view the map. But if you're holding anything before pulling it out (including a torch) the map ends up being a useless black square in the dark. Requiring you to drop your torch and have it roll away every time you want to look at the map. Weapons. Why give me knives/axes if they're completely useless? The 'Creature'. I played this game for 5 hours and only saw the 'creature' once. It found me when I was out in the open and had nowhere to hide, so I just kept watching it while walking backwards towards the closest hut. It never attacked me, just followed a few feet away the enire time. Once I reached the hut it wandered off, never to be seen again.  The bad.  Your character controls like a 400 pound blob wearing bowling shoes. Once you get the slightest bit of momentum going, it's really hard to stop. This had me constantly running off cliffs and falling down hills that I should've been able to stop infront of. Any slight incline and you will either start sliding or just start running down it. This makes exploring extremely frustrating at times.   While I have stopped playing out of frustration, I may pick it up again at a later date to see if they've updated it at all. I really do love the idea of this game, and could probably have forgiven a majority of the flaws, but the controls ruined the experience for me. They drove me absolutely insane and were the sole reason I stopped playing the game. It's unfortunate, but I just can't reccomend this game because of the controls.",

You walk like everything is made of ice and if you accidentally slip onto a slight incline you'll slip and slide all the way down right onto your head. Even the smallest vertical drop will cause you to tumble and fall down which drops everything in your hands, puts out your torch, and sometimes injures you. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if the floors weren't all ice which makes it nearly impossible to stop this from happening.   Even still I won't discredit the game entirely, only buy this if it's on sale for $9 or less.",

Turns out, the ending sucked balls as well! After creating the cure and swimming to that island that's out of your reach, you find a row boat, get inside, row away, and fall asleep on the boat...the end.

Alright, let's go!  Pros:  Beautiful environment, simply brilliant graphics, with the weather patterns, day/night cycle, and the flora and fauna all fully realized and vibrant. Honestly, this game would be worth sale price simply for the graphics if you appreciate games like that.  The mapping system is unique and realistic, but not TOO real as to render it not fun. In other words, it's as real as a game can make it while still being a game. I really enjoyed walking around just mapping the island. Definitely this is the game's strongest point.  Cons:  While the environment is well done, the detail on the hands and arms of the player are absolutely ATROCIOUS! Bad enough that, to this day, I use the term 'Miasmata hands' to reflect a poorly designed first-person model. They could have at least used the standard cop-out of putting a watch or bracelet on the player's wrist to at least ease the pain of having to look at 2 ham shanks on the end of bologna rolls.  The plot. Spoiler alert, your character is ill, and you must find a cure. I believe this to be an unnecessary handicap in the early game, and I personally found it insurmountable due to the rather boring nature of the quest. Also, you can't do too much in the way of travelling or running around until you found the cure.  The 'creature' is just a joke. I will say no more, just take my word for it.  The controls are some of the worst I've ever seen. When you move the mouse, there's a delay in the motion, and when you stop, the camera 'shakes' and your hands lapse over where you stopped the movement. It's really hard to describe, almost like it takes time to gain and lose momentum when looking. The same thing happens when you walk or run, which can be the death of you if you're near an edge you didn't see. Also, this same delay is present in everything you do, which is really annoying.  I wish this game were better, as the concept could have been great. I just can't give this game a positive review due to all its faults.  Thanks for reading, and have an awesome day! ",
