(Even though they are too lazy to search for a solution to this, since you just have to open the steam overlay and alt+tab).  This game has some nice aspects to it. Although too easy in the first level, it is kinda relaxing, the music is good (until it repeats), the play dough makes the game looks really cool. It is a very easy shmup at first.  And then it turns itself into a bad game. The descend into planet level is pretty bad and hard to control, you can't really move that well and it makes the game really difficult and precise, since you need to play it very slow to reach the places. Any touch in anything and your ship explodes.  That was a poor decision of a game and because of that I don't really find the game atractive at all. This one kind of level can spoil every other thing of the game. But, it is really not that bad, it should deserve at least a bit better rank. Yet, I can't recommend it, even in a sale.",

The elements on the backgrounds are very confusing, you can't recognize if some elements are enemies or just background things (at least at the first level, i'm not brave enough to play this game seriously). Plus all the same negative aspects in Platypus. And finally, can't even leave the game to idle because the mouse won't move when you minimized the game :D  [ITA] No... ma proprio no. Come Platypus, anche questo gioco è veramente un disastro. Magari sembra un pò più interessante ma è comunque un disastro. Gli elementi grafici di sfondo si confondono, non si riesce nemmeno a capire se i nemici siano veri o no (almeno al primo livello, non sono abbastanza coraggioso da voler giocare seriamente questo obbrobrio). Ovviamente tutto questo si somma agli stessi aspetti negativi presenti anche in Platypus. E per finire, non si può nemmeno lasciare il gioco in background perchè il mouse non si può muovere :D",
