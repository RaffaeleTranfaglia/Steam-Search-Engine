            "review_text": "Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines is an immensely intriguing vampire-role playing game by Troika Games, and an exellent example of a 'flawed masterpiece' and had a lot of things going for it.  For starters, you are thrown into the game with the option of choosing between 7 different clans (vampire bloodlines) that each play a good bit differently. There's the Brujah: fast hard hitting rebels, the Gangrel: animalistic loners, the Malkavians: bat-**** crazy psychopaths, the Nosferatu: sneaky grotesque monsters, the Tremere: a vampire sect of blood mages, the Toreador: artsy fast vampires that are closer to humanity, and Ventrue: the most power hungry members of vampire society. Every single one of these classes feels distinct, as every clan has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the nosferatu get more blood from feeding on rats than the other Kindred (Vampire: The Masquerade's term for vampire), but cannot seduce anyone because of their monstrous appearence. The Ventrue are the only kindred that can use dominate (basically mind control) in dialogue, but they cannot feed on animals and may vomit when feeding on 'lowlife' like street bums.  Now, the gameplay is extremely engaging. Combat is fast, fun, and allows you several options. Every kindred clan has their own disciplines, or vampiric abilities, that allow you to choose your own approach to conflict. Do you use obfuscate to invisibly sneak past the goons? Or do you use 'fortitude' to soak up their bullets and 'animalism' to summon spectral wolves to tear them apart. It's your choice. Of course there are the standard ways of fighting: guns, unarmed, and melee weapons. There are a good variety of each weapon types (except unarmed) with upgraded weapons available to you along the way. Another potential tool for combat is feeding. As you need blood to maintain your sanity and use your disciplines, you will need to drink blood. You can drink blood from any humanoid you choose, hostile or not, but it can be more difficult to drink blood from hostiles. This is tempered by the fact that you have to stop yourself from completely draining innocent humans, but don't think twice about draining a thug. There is one problem with feeding, but I'll cover that later.  I need to mention the dialogue too, as it's absolutely awesome. The facial expressions on the characters in this game are better than some of the facial expressions I see in the games coming out today, and the dialogue choices are absolutely brilliant. The Malkavians and Nosferatu get hilarious dialogue options, including an infamous one where a malkavian player character can actually get into an argument with a stop sign. A stop sign! And if I remember correctly, there's a conversation with a TV as well.  The quest system is absolutely one of the best parts about this game. The side quests range from defeating demons to hunting down serial killers to fighting of zombies in a graveyard. You'll always have some sort of want to complete them because completing quests gives you experience, not killing enemies. I think this is an exellent system because this keeps you from being penalized for using stealth and guile over brute strength and bloodshed. There are quite a few missions where things turn out better in the end if you choose a stealthier, more thoughtful approach instead of going full Rambo. The main quest is no slouch either, with multiple engaging quests.  I enjoy the game's atmosphere quite a bit. The endless night conveys a mysterious feeling (to be fair, it's not like you're character can feel the sun anymore) and the music lends itself to this. While sometimes the music can feel a little repetitive (combat music is determined by area, so if you get into lots of fights in one area, you're gonna hear that music a lot) I never found myself annoyed by it because it was good. There are lots of songs from real bands, such as Lacuna Coil and Tiamat.  Now, time for the 'flawed' part of 'flawed masterpiece'. The game was rushed out on the same day as Half-Life 2 because the idiocy of the game's publisher, Activition. As a result, the game has several glitches by default, so don't even think about playing the game without an unofficial patch of some sort. The late game feels less fun because it's all combat, and becomes quite tedious because before, combat was more spaced out. I don't mind mandatory combat sections, but the last portion of the game gets excessive with these. Because of the mandatory combat and power of late game weapons, if you don't have your gun skill fairly high by the end, you're screwed. Melee skills only work well when you're not being shot at by 10 enemies, and that's a rarity near the end. Also, the series of levels, the Nosferatu warrens/sewers can be very boring, unintuitive, and downright frustrating at times, as there are few sources of blood, annoying enemies, it's long as hell, and mandatory. Lastly, there is the problem with feeding. When used against normal human enemies, I don't mind it. But when it's used against a human boss, it's pretty overpowered. There is no way for an enemy to escape from your grasp besides you getting hit, so if you get your teeth on a boss while they're alone, they're done. But all in all, these things don't break the game by any means, but they should be mentioned.  One last thing that makes the game great, and it should be no surprise what this is: mods. There are two mods particularly, Vampire: The Masquerade: The Final Nights, And Bloodlines Antitribu (although this one is somewhat buggy at the moment). Both (and other mods I'm forgetting ATM) add in cut content, new character models, brand new content and quests, and even new systems like the companion mods and blood loss that take the games immersion to new heights.  If you had your interest piqued by this review, you should definitely pick up the game. Even now, more than a decade after the games release, I still give this game a playthrough every now and then, because it's just that good.",

            "review_text": "This is it. The quintessential vampire game. There are many reviews that highlight its pros and cons, so I will just say this: it's very good; play it. Be aware, however, that installing the unofficial patch isn't just recommended, but necessary, since the game is very buggy (which is by no means the developer's fault, but rather the publisher's). So check out the community hub for guides on how and where to get patches and various mods.  First timers should also be careful in choosing the clan for their inaugural playthrough. For instance, Malkavian are a... peculiar breed, and some of the dialogue may be a bit confusing; you might also hear voices and talk to objects. Nosferatu, on the other hand, have an altered physical appearance (more 'monstruous'), so moving around and interacting with various NPCs can be a challenge; thankfully you can use sewers, and an innate cloaking ability. Even Ventrue can be difficult, because they are selective with their food; so you won't be able to feed off rats or homeless people. But all in all, the clans are pretty balanced, so it's down to personal preference  29th Oct edit: It seems Paradox bought White Wolf, which means chances for a sequel have just gone up. By a lot. Rejoice!",

            "review_text": "Bruh its a vampire game where vampires don't sparkle, buy it  Edited------  After the poplularity that my review has gotten I have desided to create a real review of Vampire: the masquerade Bloodlines. By far it's a classic rpg that set the standard for a new generation of rpgs, if your ok with a lot of bugs and not the best graphics due to being outdated this is like a game equal to Skyrim in how much fun and how much time you can put into it. There are a total of 8 playable vampire races that are all very different and provide a different experience that never really gets old, just don't play as a Nosferatu ♥♥♥♥ becomes impossible to play as. There are a bunch of different play styles that include, guns, melee weapons, magic. As long as your ok with a good amount of bugs drinking the blood of everyone, and a huge spike in diffculty by the end of the game and the graphics, this game is probably a 9/10 truely a masterpiece in the field of role playing games and if you are a fan of rpg games I personally recommend this game to any and everyone.",

            "review_text": "Oh, Bloodlines. The epitome of 'cult classic'. This game is the most unpolished gem I've ever seem in my gaming life. It was difficult to overlook it's many bugs, and in it's time, this game suffered from incredibly poor losses (also because of a bad business launch date). However, as the time passed and the modding community adressed most of it's glaring problems, this game finally blossomed into an experiece worth of the pantheon of the best RPGs ever made.  Because make no mistake: underneath that filthy layer of bugs and it's shortcomings of production/lack of content, lies one of the best RPGs ever made. Seriously. I wholeheartedly recommend you to buy it, whatever the price tag is, with a simple caveat: use the mods that fix it otherwise your experience will be undeniably disapointing.  The way the IP behind this game is treated (Vampire: The Masquerade, one of the best storyteller RPGs ever) is incredible, it will plunge you down to the World of Darkness and hook you up with an engrossing mature story with all the right touches of horror and sensualization we all love about vampires. Never before or since playing a vampire character would be so cool.  The mechanics are not the high point but enough to be called 'good'. The engine is the same as Half-Life 2, and it aged pretty well. The voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING. The story as multiple endings and the choices you make matter (to some degree), making for an incredible narrative. The Vampire Storyteller progression system is here, with slight tweaks, and it's awesome.  You basically play as one of the classic Camarilla clans. I won't say much more, because the word of advice here is THIS GAME IS WORTH IT&lt; VERY MUCH WORTH IT, JUST USE THE MODS TO FIX IT.  ",

Troika deserves full marks for this one, even though the game has its issues and the numerous glitches that the community has worked greatly to improve. Those same efforts only highlight how much this game is almost universally loved by those that try it. Great game, definitely recommend trying it, if you're on the fence that badly wait for a price drop but please do yourself a favor and play it at the very least.  Do not play without the community-made patches, however, as the game was rushed and contains glitches galore without said patches.

            "review_text": "  Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is the best half game ever. I love this game, everyone should. It reminds me a lot of Deus Ex and if given more development and money this could have been even better. It pains me when I see all the wasted potential of this hidden gem.  The writing is top notch, the stat system is robust and the choice of clans is a really great addition with some clans in particular pretty much changing the entire gameplay. The combat takes a lot of getting used to and that is not an understatement but it's fine enough considering this is an RPG and not a standard action game. The graphics are really good for the time considering the engine it is using the feel of the game is not like anything else you'll see. For those of you unaware, this takes place in a modern Los Angeles setting with hidden clan of vampires. It's like Angel but with nosferatu.  However all that comes with a problem. The development is incredibly depressing to read about and I'll save you the details of what game came out the same day, but the point is this is clearly unfinished. The longer the you play the game the less freedom you get until finally you end the game with one of the most disappointing final missions I've played. It really is a shame since I do love this game so much.  You need to play this if you love WRPGs. In fact many people consider it one of their favourites let alone favourite games of all time and I can understand why for the most part but it just slips out of that for me due to its diminishing quality over the game. This game still has fan patches being made constantly and for your sake get it immediately. Bloodlines might not be perfect but it'll be hard to find a game as rewarding, fun and memorable as this.

Seriously, it takes a lot to get me to give a ♥♥♥♥ about ♥♥♥♥ing Vampires.   Set in the World of Darkness RPG universe, this game had writing and design that was just too ambitious. The developers clearly had a magnificent vision for this game -- a game where the experience is vastly different depending on which clan you picked. A game where playing it through once only shows you a fraction of what it has to offer. A world filled with choices, and so, so many ways to solve your problems. If this game had been allowed to finish, it could have been right up there alongside revered greats such as Deus Ex and Planescape: Torment. Unfortunately, its flaws, and the fact that the game is literally not finished, rob it of such a reward. It's almost tragic, really.  If you're gonna buy this game, be prepared to do some homework just to get the damn thing to run. The unofficial patch is basically mandatory. But this game is well worth the effort.

            "review_text": "Okay, so I started playing this game about two years ago and only made it to the second location because the game is buggy as Hell and wasn't loading something that was an intergral part of one of my missions (so, I quit instead of starting over).  I recently replayed the game, all the way through, this time, and let me tell you: this game is fantastic.   I's an old game, sure, but it definitely holds up well. And in some ways, is vastly superior to some modern games. The graphics are a bit dated, but not horribly so. Again, I've played some modern games with worse. Voice acting is top-notch. The story and lore that surrounds the game is amazing and deep. You could spend hours just talking to NPCs because the lore is that involved and you may want to absorb it all. I hesitate to say characters are believable (I'm looking at you, Knox), but they're charming. Some are likeable, whereas others are easy to hate. Either way, they're all written well for the world they are in and really help to develop it. I found the Anarchs to be a much more relatable, realistic group than some of the others. That said, the members of the Anarchs are my favorite chraracters, so I could be biased.   Combat (especially melee) can be a bit clunky, but not impossible to handle. And, due to the various clans, it makes it very easy to find a playstyle that works best with what you like. This game transitions from a stealth/puzzle game, to a 3rd person hack and slash, to a 1st person shooter seamlessly, and allows the player to change up their playstyle on the fly.   Each clan has a very unique, rich story that surrounds them, which makes it fun to play multiple times in order to get a feel for all seven of them.  Some the levels are unsettling, or downright scary to go through. They're very atmospheric, with great audio and visuals. I would be lying if I said that there weren't some missions where I had to take my headphones off, or had to play during daylight hours while other people were around. There's one in particular where you don't even face any enemies, but the hair on the back of my neck still stands up every time I go through it.   My one main complaint is that VTMB is a game that hinges on the fact that your character might be a sexual creature, making it possible to sort of romance some of the characters. However, there is only one male NPC throughout the game who can be 'romanced', yet several females. I get that at the time, game companies thought that female gamers were a rarety, so I don't really fault it too much.",

To boot, the facial expressions and voice acting is amazing, and probably the best I've ever seen in a game.  This game is, however, quite glitchy due to its troubled release.

It really succeeds in making you feel like an undead badass and in portraying a world that thrives at 3am, features memorable locations like a gothic nightclub, a hollywood porno store and of course a haunted house (and theatre, and cemetary, and derelict hospital, and rundown apartment building, and fish market.... basically there's a lot of hauntings)  Features some terrific writing, dialogue and humour.

There's multiple solutions through missions and each vampire clan have their own unique skills to solve them, i.e. Nosferatu can turn themselves invisible, Tremere have powerful blood magic, and Malkavians can drive people insane. Sadly, the game falls apart in the end with some horrid forced combat sections (So make sure you have a good combat build going, though just cheating through it is totally fine) but it ultimately is a game worth playing because there are still way too few RPGs that are like it.",

Well that is exactly what this game is like and it has a very complex structure of Vampire that I've frankly, never seen before where there are many different races of Vampire each with their own distinct look, personality traits, and strengths/weaknesses, for example, the Malkavians are absoultely insane and have different personalities talking in their head and see telephone lines swaying constantly in the air and people will be a little off-put by you (if you choose to be this class...this is exactly what you'll see and hear as well along with crazy dialogue options)  The gameplay is more or less exactly like Deus Ex with more modern day weaponry and the fact that in order to use your special ablities you need blood which you can either drink a blood pack or find a victim and follow them into a back alley and have a buffet delight.  The story is also very intriguing and is inline with the lore from the tabletop games where its essentially about this ancient vampire coming back to life and eating Vampires and causing the end of the world.  I'd recommend this game to anybody really and especially those who are a fan of Deus Ex, Vampires, or fans of RPG/Action games. This is another really underrated game that definitely should get more sequels (comeon Activision, I know you have it in your black heart somewhere!) If you see it during a sale for about $10, which is rare, think about picking it up because you shouldn't be disappointed.",

This game is loaded with so much awesome stuff, and the humor in it is great. It's a shame these guys when out of business, they had the potential to make games as good as anything Bethesda has put out.    A note about all the people complaining about this game needing a patch to run: Of course it does, morons, stop your whining. This game was made to run on an operating system that's been obsolete for over a decade (and people could argue that Windows ME/2000/XP/etc were garbage when they came out), and the company that made the game was crushed and is long gone, of course you will need to DL a patch to run it. The good news is that these patches also fix bugs that were originally issues in the game. So look up and follow the easy to install patches, it's totally worth it (and they are free, so ... yeah).    This game is also worth multiple play-throughs, which can be hard to find with linear story/plot games. As each clan (and gender) has some different perks, playing through more than once can be rewarding. And if you haven't played as a Malkavian (the crazy ones), that is always good for a last play-through for the whole game.    Great for any fan of Vampire the Masquerade, great for any vampire genre fan, great for any FP/RPG game lover.  I played this a LONG time ago, and playing again now is just as fun, and it is still an impressive game. I highly recommend this game. ",

In the game you start out with a somewhat lengthy cutscene which gives you an idea of the society you now belong to as a new vampire or childe. You are then released into a somewhat open world to begin your undead life as pretty much everyone's errand person. Your style of play will obviously depend on what clan you chose at the beginning. Whether you are a fighting brujah, beastly gangrel, squishy tremere, smooth toreador, snooty ventrue, crazy malkavian, or *shudders* disgusting nosferatu; you will find plenty to fight in the perpetual darkness.   This game has decent graphics (especially considering its age), great dialogue, believeable characters (and some pretty wild ones too), monsters (other than vampires), plenty of seduction, AWESOME music (seriously though... this game introduced me to several artists that I had never heard of that I still listen to til ths day), and an overall decent and interesting story. One word of advice... explore the cities and talk to everyone... multiple times. There are many interesting side quests that you can easily miss!  It has a few glitches that can sometimes occur in unpatched versions. Only thing I dislike about this game is how many autoaves it produces. It creates a new autosave every time instead of simply rewriting the autosave file. This feature cannot be turned off as far as I am aware. Periodically you will need to go through and clean up the older autosaves.",

All the characters in the game can't get any more interesting as all of them have their own attitude and you get to know their backstory once you talk with them. This makes you relate with the characters than just see them as NPC's. However, the game has more than its fair share of flaws. First - The game is not playable without unofficial patches so you really should download one to be able to even complete the game. Though the game boasts a varied play style (Each vampire clan plays differently), the gameplay is not that enjoyable. Combat is clunky and the shooting mechanics are abysmal. But decent graphics (For its time) and a great soundtrack does make up for a lot of these flaws. So overall, expect a memorable, yet perfectly flawed (And I mean that in a good way) experience that you shouldn't pass on!",

            "review_text": "This game is a buried gem. Activision, as per their hitleristic standards, rushed this game into release about halfway through the development. The result is somewhat painful as far as bugs and glitches go. For me, the game wouldn't even start on its own, and when I initially tried to play it, I uninstalled and felt regret for buying it on my boyfriend's recommendation.  A few months afterwards, I installed it again while I had a craving for RPGs. Here's the single key to enjoying this game: go and download the unofficial patch, and make sure to select the patch plus during the installation process. A large amount of the game's content is in unactivated code. The patch is regularly updated - the most recent update was this year, last I checked - which fixes all of the game breaking bugs and readds content that wasn't quite finished or activated.  The game? Great. The lore is excellent, which most of anyone who has experience with the Old World of Darkness universe would know. Even if you're not, the game is a great introduction. I wasn't a huge expert before I started playing, but a few hours in, I pulled up the wiki and simply started reading. The writing is quality. The characters are memorable, and it's hard not to feel about them; usually, if they're not Beckett or Jack, that feeling is indescribable loathing. The quests are so interesting, you feel a need to go out and find all of the ones avaliable. The environment offers many areas to explore and makes you want to explore them.  The only two things I would say aren't perfect about the game are the graphics and the combat. The graphics, naturally, are as dated as the game, and they haven't aged well. I honestly enjoy them because sometimes they're literally laughable. The combat is charmingly schizophrenic, in that you're never quite sure what you're doing, nor what you should be doing, but gosh dang if the results aren't fun. The combat difficulty jerks up and down with little in game conceivable reason, and initially I was confused, but then I realized that the difficulty wasn't based on game mechanics. It's based on lore. If the game makes you fight vampire hunters, no matter at what point you're at in the game, the fight's going to be very hard because vampire hunters in the Old World of Darkness are damned near impossible to kill.   It's a great game, and I think that if lore, missions, writing, and plots are your thing, you should play it. However, don't buy it. Pirate it. A larger company - I think it was Bioware - bought the company that made it and fired everyone who worked on it. Your money would be spent paying the people who ruined the chance of a second game.",

Everyone has their own ulterior motive and the deep lore that goes into the 'World of Darkness' that this game is based on just enhances the feel and depth of this story.  The combat mechanics are pretty simple, there's 2 types of weapons, melee and ranged. If you want to be a crazy monster vampire who uses his fists to beat people into dust.. You can do that. If you want to use ranged weapons by running around and shooting people up.. You can do that. If you want to go around with a katana and slash people up.. You can do that as well. The skill and 'clan' system helps you build your character the way you want to. There's many different clans, all of them have different skill sets, pros and cons - There's the nosferatu that need to go through sewers because of their hideous deformed bodies would alert humans of the supernatural. There's the Malkavian who keeps on hearing different voices in their heads (Although most of it seems gibberish, a lot of it is actually true and the voice can also tell you the future or hidden intends behind the people.), malkavians have completely different dialogue options and their lines can also be seen as insane and convoluted with hidden intents. The lore is just so deep in this that you can't help but get invested.  This games second strong point is choice. You will have different choices on how to complete your quests, you will have choices on what you would like to do with the item, would you be OK with giving the item to the person who wants it, or can you find a third party who will offer more for it? Do you care for your own humanity and help people out just to keep your connection to the mortal life that you had. Or will you only look out for yourself, discarding the other peoples needs just to further your own agenda. There are multiple choices for everything you do, but what's great is that there's choices that aren't apparent and if you manage to find them they will usually pay off sweetly. This is a masterpiece in gamedesign. You WILL find interesting quests and items if you look around enough and you are not rewarded for going around and killing everything, but are rather ENCOURAGED to do things the way you want to.   Even though this game was released in an extremely buggy state because the game developer didn't have enough money to keep working on this. The game has been fixed with several patches (Some of the game devs worked for free after getting laid off, just to fix this. Goes to show how much they actually loved this game.).. Now thanks to the huge community there's several mods, unofficial expansions, etc that completely change up this game.  Before buying this game on steam I had already spent more then 100 hours in this, so I've played this for around 200 hours or so..",

The first thing you will notice are the outdated graphics but they really are not that bad and you get used to it pretty quick. The worst thing is combat.

The thing is VTMB is billed as an RPG &amp; it not only delivers but it may be the best game ever in this aspect if you like getting immersed in an excellent story. There are rules you have to (un)live by &amp; consequences if you don't. Decisions you make early on reflect what happens later.

            "review_text": "A game every RPG fan should play.  It takes place in LA, putting you in the shoes – or heels – of a freshly made vampire. They have a secret society and live among us with a certain set of rules to maintain order and ensure that their existence won't become widespread knowledge. This is the Masquerade. You become the new pawn for the local leader in his political wars. Not all is well in vampire community, and some factions are eager to change things.  It's a comfortable entry – just as you're in the dark, so is your character, letting the two of you learn together who's who and what's what in vampire life. It's a pretty crazy one, too. Violence and sex are plentiful and the game doesn't shy from either. You'll find it hard, and not too rewarding, to play your regular Good Hero sort. It's also a very humorous game with plenty of moments that made me chuckle. The voice acting is terrific and there are many great characters. I found myself often just standing still and listening to the in-game news report on the TV, or the late-night radio show for the laughs.   The story develops in unexpected ways and the ending managed to surprise me. Maybe I haven't found them out yet, but I didn't feel as if my choices bore significant consequences. It didn't really bother me, though, because the ride was a good one. The game is divided into city hubs that open one at a time after plot checkpoints, and you can jump from one to the other freely once they're available. You won't find the trademark 'collect 10 donkey tails' side-quests that pollute fantasy RPGs, but instead many fun investigative missions outside the main plot. Backtracking can be annoying, though.  While the story isn't too divergent, the gameplay is. It shares similarities with Deus Ex – many missions (though not all) don't offer just one way to the solution. Usually you can take a stealthy approach as well as the loud and bloody one. If your hacking skill is low, often your lockpicking will let you do the job instead – or vice versa. And while, like many other RPGs, it has its skills which aren't as useful as the others, I was happy to find out that many non-combat ones are still well utilized in the game. I won't write down a guide to power-building, though. One, because you can easily google it. Two, because it's hard to suck at the game.  You can focus either on guns or melee. I did one playthrough of each, and while I felt that later on my gun-focused character was stronger, the melee was more satisfying, despite how simple it was. I really liked playing an immortal psychopath who charges into a room while people shoot at her and she just jumps around slashing everything. However, just like the graphics, keep in mind the year of the game and don't expect anything advanced in terms of combat mechanics.  The game also has serious replay value. I'm already during my 3rd playthrough, and I'm not crossing out the possibility of a 4th sometime in the future. It's not due to different choices, because – as I said – they're not too significant here. It's partly due to reviewing the story with the insight of the twist at the end and partly due to different approach in mechanics – like many RPGs. You don't choose a specific class, but instead a clan. They're set apart by their own few unique abilities (some even have different dialogue options, which is pretty amazing if you ask me), while the bulk of the simple ones are shared between them all.   Before you start, two things. First, the game is buggy as hell and you shouldn't play it without the unofficial patch. Google it, it'll come up. Second, don't play the Malkavian clan in your first run – they're lunatics who hear voices, and their dialogue is completely overhauled and special, partly due to their weird insights into matters. So without understanding the plot after a complete playthrough, and knowing what happens in each interaction, playing a Malkavian can be really confusing. But after your first playthrough? Highly recommended. They're very entertaining.",

            "review_text": "Despite its quirks (graphical hiccups, repeated NPCs, wonky combat) and the absolute NEED to mod V:tM-B in order to run it on modern systems, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is, hands-down, one of the best RPGs - and possibly the best vampire game - ever made. Simply put, LA does not give two hoots about you, and events are only driven forward when you begin to interfere. Nevermind that vampires have generally fallen out of favor amongst gamers - this is one that should be played through at least once. Lust, hunger, betrayal, and hard decisions - its all here.  Expect to die at least a couple of times; the game doesn't pull its punches, and will backhand anyone thinking they're running on rails. The game's world may seem small, but given that the game is over 10 years old now it has quite a bit of space to roam. Maybe not Witcher levels of freedom, but very few of the game's quests are (or really feel like) fetch quests. The things you do change how the game plays, and each Family has their own oddities to them - both good and bad.  If there ever was a game that needed a graphical (and gameplay) overhaul, though, it would be this one. The visuals, while striking, are severly dated, and you'll see the same bums/hookers/random people begin to repeat over and over after a while (although it does give the feeling that the city is beginning to mess with your head). As well, the combat system feels severely tacked-on, and while functional, it is almost ALWAYS preferable to go in with a gun rather than a bat or blade, as melee combat suffers the worst. While it only becomes troublesome in a few areas, those can be the places that make one throw the keyboard in disgust.   Finally, as mentioned, the game will NOT run unpatched, so picking up an unofficial patch is necessary to run it on a system with a Windows 7 or newer OS (not sure about Vista; it might work, but it definitely doesn't on W7). Attempting to run the game unpatched causes many issues, so don't even think about it.  Overall, though, it is worth picking up (especially when it goes on-sale), as it was Troika's last game before they went bankrupt, and while buggy their games have managed to pick up cult classic status over the years. Beyond that, its a damn good convoluted tale featuring the children of the night, and certainly deserves praise for making the player FEEL like they're a bloodsucking monster.",

I have reached the final boss several times, but only finally got around to giving him his Final Death today. Taking around thirty hours, this is a game complete with an amazing story, interesting characters, cool powers, and the most legit vampire's I know of. The basic story begins with your 'embrace' - where you become a vampire - and continues as your rise in power and prestige, until you are causing the events, rather than reacting to them.  Each of the nine clans you can choose from have different abilities. They could be considered classes, similar to other games, but they aren't usually wildly different. Most of the change is in the player models, and the powers - each clan getting two powers from a pool, and a third unique to their clan. But there are enough differences to make replaying a possibility. For example, the Nosferatu are hideous, and as such cannot seduce people for blood, and instead have to suck on rats in the sewers below the streets, while the Ventrue clan is the opposite - they cannot drink from rats due to their nobility. Another is clan Malkavian; each and every one of them is insane. Incredibly, they have 100% unique dialogue, opposed to other clans having a few lines or opportunities each, and can engage in some interesting tangents - such as having a conversation with the news reporter on TV.  While the vanilla version is very buggy - due to the developers being rushed in their final stages - most of these issues can be resolves with the fan made Unofficial Patch, which is a must-get if you plan on playing. It's not the prettiest game either, with some pretty terrible animations at times, but all this is forgiveable in the face of such a wonderful experience. The game uses Valve's source engine (an earlier version of the engine Titanfall is built on), and was released on the same day as Half-Life 2; and though the models in the game are by no means of equal quality, they are attractive in their own way, and help nail the bleak, horror/noir atmosphere.  If Firefly was a game, it would be this one. While the themes are not at all similar, it is the kind of game that when someone brings it up in conversation, or you read about it on the net, you pretty much have no choice but to reinstall and have another crack at it.  10/10. I honestly cannot think of any way to improve it, other than give the devs more time to improve a couple of the cutscenes.    tl;dr - V:TM-B is one of the best games ever. It is often on sale on Steam. buy it. Install the most recent Unofficial Patch. Enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.   P.S. ♥♥♥♥ the haunted hotel. The game isn't all that scary, the hotel always gets me.",

Now, this game has a well-earned reputation for being buggy as all Troika games were and is riddled with unfinished content. It also is most likely not going to play properly without modding, so if any of those three things I just mentioned irritate you, then avoid this like the plague.  I like that it's rather ambigious and subtle with its story telling. I like the pacing and I like the atmosphere of most of the game. The weapons are (mostly) balanced against themselves which is uncommon in games like this. The power pools are fun and memorable, the side quests are interesting and I like all of the endings, too.  I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Aside from Bishop Vic. Whoever thought that fight was a good idea should flog themselves in the face with a rusted chain as penance.",

I bought it originally in 2004 when it came out, but bought it now on Steam just to have another copy. It's that good. I seriously cannot do enough to recommend it to anybody who has even the most microscopic interest in RPGs. If you like vampires and White Wolf franchises in the World of Darkness, it's an absolute must-buy. If you do buy it, however, you should be prepared to download the official 1.2 patch, or the famous Unofficial Patch by Wesp5. The game does have a few bugs, but either of those patches will solve them. Combat is also a little repetitive, but challenging for all the Clans; it's a mix of point-and-shoot and slice-and-dice melee. However, the game truly shines in its application of the setting and characters, all of which are representative of the World of Darkness, the larger world setting in which vampires, ghosts, werewolves, and all the nightmares of humankind are made real.",

This game, though doubtlessly flawed, manages to accomplish creating an atmosphere of such high quality that few other games come close to equalling it. The immersion is top notch, as the game builds a believable and haunting environment. L.A. serves as a thin curtain veiling some of the most disturbing and macabre locations and mysteries that I've ever seen in a video game; sub-plots contain anything from plague-spreading cults to cursed snuff tapes, and all of the stories the player partakes in are memorable and unique. Players have a plethora of choices on how they will accomplish their goals (for the most part; some of the end-game content is poorly designed in this regard, likely due to the numerous development issues that Troika underwent), and player input is respected greatly. This game, like the original Deus Ex, involves its players in its world in meaningful ways (as proper RPGs are meant to, in my opinion). If you are looking for a game with a deep narrative and an intriguing world, then look no further. For all its flaws (combat and bugs, primarily), Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines accomplishes things that are rarely realized this well in the gaming industry. Troika created a masterpiece, and despite some hickups, it is  absolutely  worth playing.",

From my perspective, you have a game that is very much like the original Deus Ex in terms of choice by in-game actions or conversations mixed with a compelling atmosphere perfect for the location and time period of the story. Being able to make various choices or alternate routes of completing goals is awesome. The 90s pop / gothic vampire cults imbued in Southern California culture is convincing and enjoyable.  Unfortunately, there are some design decisions that prevent it from being the same great addicting experience that is Deus Ex. The combat is lousy. While Deus Ex has aged in terms of gunplay, there are at least mechanics to perform instanteous lethal kills or knockouts. While stealth holds up with human foes, it is somewhat hindered in my point of view by the third person perspective that is forced when equipped with a melee weapon. When firing at an aware NPC, the combat feels similar to a bullet sponge FPS with no ADS. Think Halo. This would not be a problem if you did not get forced into critical situations requiring combat, however, there are boss fights that must be completed throughout the main quest.  Combat aside, the game has trouble with pacing. Some times you can become stuck trying to find an item or clue that will set you off on the next thread of the main quest. While tinkering around the world is enjoyable, being lost in 90s computer records is not great.  Anyways, I think this game should definitely be played. Buy it when on sale and dedicate 6 hours of game time before calling quits. Also, spending time with a character creation guide to make the most of your skills and vampire powers is advised.

Impactful decision-making, above average dialogue and tough, ultraviolent combat combine to create a level of immersion rarely attained in all video gaming. The GTA-style open world is packed with fun, story-driven quests that span a broad spectrum of level designs, some of which are among my favorite to date (many are truly terrifying), all of them teeming with World of Darkness's inspired takes on classic horror creatures. The 'feeding' logic is immensely satifying. Add the inventive weapons and gear and the result is an unprecedented completeness of world building. Easily one of my favorite games, period.  The game is sexist and racist, which sucks because it really is among of the greatest of all time. The sole black NPC wears a basketball jersey, sports an afro, refers to women as 'baby girl' and, in conversation, when he invites the player to eat with him, there is a dialogue option that reads: 'Couldn't I just watch the monkeys feed down at the zoo?'...Not funny! This and the gleefully violent sexual rhetoric in many of the in-game emails (and general objectification of women characters) suggest a troubling level of depravity on the part of the staff at Troika and Activision.",

(The preview photos for this game actually make it look far superior in quality, maybe there is a high res texture pack out there somewhere.) I found the way the characters walk and move to be bizarre and distractiing. The game kept sticking/freezing between scenes as well.  I don't fault original fans for liking this game.

Are all the vampire books, movies, and comics out right now not enough of a sign to point out that this IP is a potential gold mine worth promoting and expanding on? That's what I want to know.  Oh...yeah...this version is messed up. It's broken. This game is so buggy that the whole thing just falls apart hours in. Save data corrupted. Storyline and mission data corrupted.

This is on par with buying a car you have to drop an engine into so you can drive it off the lot. The fact that you have to add a mod just to make this game work is insulting. I've seen people say 'oh well you didn't play this game or that game that needed this and that' and the truth is they're idiots. Because that statement and type of thinking is a logical fallacy called appeal to tradition. Just because other games sucked too has ZERO bearing on whether or not this one does. Or saying that tons of people love it so it can't suck is just appeal to the masses. Justin Bieber and Brittany Spears are millionaires with millions of fans. Are you really going to say they don't suck? The masses like garbage and we all know that. This is why and only why pop music exists.     I haven't seen one intelligent comment on why this game DOESN'T suck. The problem is that this game absolutely does suck and not in the way a Vampire game should. I began as a GM for Werewolf AND Vampire the Masquerade when they FIRST CAME OUT as a tabletop RPG's in 1991. Many people who may read this weren't even born then. Or they were far too small to be playing them. Understand this means you sorely lack the context to understand why these games suck. I watched Kindred: The Embraced religiously for the brief period it was on. It was even shot in my backyard of San Francisco. The point is I am and have been a huge Vampire fan from day one. So my hopes for this game were very high. And I was sorely disappointed.    Anyone who has been a gamer for a couple decades knows and has seen the evolution of games with super powers. From tke original Xmen Arcade game released in 1992 to the flurry of super hero games released on all consoles, it has always been hard to get super powers right. This is where this game ultimately fails unbelievably. The game does not match the tabletop RPG AT ALL when we look at starting characters and power. In this garbage you are essentially nothing more than human who has to suck blood randomly. Guns kill you, baseball bats kill you, a stiff wind kills you. I've been fascinated by vampires for 30 years and done an immense amount of research on them. And the piece of crap representation in this game fits absolutely NONE of the stories.     The fun part about playing a vampire game is the power associated with vampires. Some great examples are the Legacy of Kain series. With Legacy of Kain 2 being the crowning achievment. You start out weak but not even close to as weak as a human. The game does a fantastic job of evolving the character to be more and more powerful as you progress. VTMB is just an utter waste of money and time. They betrayed their own tabeletops and all of us original fans. Whitewolf made the same mistake when they released the second rulebook for the tabletop game. They just tried too hard and ended up diluting the quality of the game with crap that really didnt need to be added. Take the money you would spend on this game and find 'The Book of Nod' which was a companion fiction novel that is a much better way to spend your time than on this trash.",

The game shockingly has a lot of replayability in terms of sure story and content. First off, this game manages to bring alot of the V:TM mythos into the story and it manages to have alot of interesting ideas and story-branching that it can get you to replay the game with a different clan just to see the difference. There is alot in V:TM Bloodlines that is worth playing, but that is only if you are truly willing to get the patches necessary to play it. I for one, am glad that I bought this since the game has alot of great characters, story, world-building and more. The only cons I have are the clunky combat system and stealth as it is clearly broken on several levels. Despite this gripe, I would highly recommend this game to any RPG or Vampire fan for the effort that was sadly rushed by Acitivison, as the game's poor sales resulted in the the closing of Tokia Games Studios in 2005.

You play as a newly turned vampire whose life was spare from execution due to the crime commited by the player's sire by the Vampire Prince of Los Angeles. In return, the player performs missions from many of the city's influential Vampires to further their own positions and as more missions are completed you uncover a political conspiracy that could greatly affect the Vampire race as your decisions become the determinig factor in shaping the future political landscape.  I've had a lot of fun playing this game and I would highly recommend it to any and all RPG fans looking for a darker atmosphere in Role-Playing. The game has a lot of paths and there are more than one way to complete missions. The only thing that I can say that is remotely negative is that I highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend that you look for, download, and install the fan patch for the game as soon as you install the game since the original development studio closed before they could complete fix all the bugs.  Edit: I've played the physical copy of a friend's years back and only recently got the steam version.",

Initially, the game would not even work for me without downloading and installing the unofficial patch, but the process was painless. I was not expecting much from an old, bug-riddled game; instead what I discovered was a rich, atmospheric and immersive world with excellently realised characters and amazing voice acting which puts a lot of modern games to shame. The game also revels in its adult themes of sex, drugs and death without being overly gratuitous.  The story regarding the development of this game is a sad one. The game was rushed out in an unfinished state to compete with the likes of Half Life 2, Halo 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3. The game initially sold only 72,000 copies and marked the end of the developer ‘Troika’. However, over the last 10 years, fans of the game and some talented modders have fixed a lot of the bugs that were present in the initial release, and even restored deleted content. That said, the game is far from being bug-free, but some of them are so hilarious that I almost enjoy them, it certainly doesn’t detract from the overall enjoyment I’m having with this game. I have yet to come across a game-breaking bug.    In regards to gameplay, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is very similar to the Deus Ex games, except with Vampires. The play style is varied and is really up to the player how they develop their character. You can choose to level your character up in stealth based skills such as lock picking, hacking, and sneaking, or pure combat based skills for those where subtlety is not an option. You navigate through 4 hub levels (Santa Monica, Downtown LA, Hollywood, and Chinatown) all of which have many optional side quests.   The game offers a lot of replayability, as there are a wide variety of clans (classes) to play, all of which are quite different to handle and can drastically alter the way you play the game. Although the game itself is rather linear there are multiple ways of completing certain quests, some much more difficult than others. You can also increase stats such as ‘Intimidation’, ‘Persuasion’ and ‘Seduction’ which offer the player some really interesting branching dialogue options.  My only criticism is that the combat is clunky and uninspired and the game also appears to favour melee combat over ranged combat.",

Still, VTM - B has a great atmosphere. The story is good and your decisions early on actually matter, but this is never telegraphed. The different characters and factions are interesting, too - glittery vampires and werewolves falling in love with babies à la Twilight are thankfully absent.

The story is extremely immersive I think and you actually feel like you're making a difference when you do something (not like other games where you are the only person in the world who could have done anything or like others where everything you do is meaningless) whether that is ruining others' plans or helping them. The gameplay itself is a little strange to get used to at first but once you get used to it (by the time you finish the first area) it becomes quite smooth, at least for me. Any of the popular playstyles are pretty compatible with this game as well whether you want to sneak around snapping necks, seduce your way around town, or just beat everyone in your way with a lead pipe.  I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of story-based RPGs (as they should all theoretically be), especially if you're also a fan of the World of Darkness series (or if you're just into vampires in general).",

It truly is a masterpiece. The only other issue that you'll run into is that you need to find a patch tomake the game work (you can find it in the steam forums).

            "review_text": "tl;dr: I visited Fat Larry at his 'truck o' mack' after telling a stop sign to stop; he didn't give a ♥♥♥♥. 11/10  I have played several RPG; on consoles, on the PC, and even tabletops. This one, with one, big, major flaw (which is fixable with a little bit of work!) is the _best_ videogame RPG I have ever played! I tested several characters, different builds, different approaches. I was never disappointed. The world is detailled, there are funny moments, there are intrigues, dead ends, confusing things, dark myths you try to solve - all placed in the 'World of Darkness', a well known setting in the tabletop community. The story is awesome and one might be thrilled to look it up, but this would ruin your experience, so I will say just the basics: You are choosing a vampire clan and the gender of your character when starting a new game. In the story, you are 'embraced' (turned into a vampire) without wanting or knowing that. So, basically, the character doesn't really know what is happening and so are you, if you don't know the WoD-setting already. You are thrown into dirty politics, shady business and immor(t)al situations.   Your choices and behaviour actually change the game experience: While playing one character, I was surprised by a situation: I wanted to talk to a robber so he leaves me alone; it has worked with another character I played before. But my character had a very low humanity, so he decided to just drink him dry, leaving me in lack of control. This is only one example of the possibilities which are waiting for you. While revealing the secrets of the mainplot, you can side with different parties, thus changing the end of the game. There are seven playable clans, and two of them are offering a very different experience: The ugly-as-hell Nosferatu which are forced to be unseen (if you don't want to get into trouble) and the incurable insane Malkavians, which are seeing the world totally different. So, you can play the story at least three times without being bored. For noobies, I suggest to start with one of the other clans, for WoD veterans: Have fun, you know the deal.  Graphics may be outdated, but I don't care. Gameplay was always more important for me than uber-gRapH1x, and this game got an immersive atmosphere with unique characters, cool details (you can listen to radioshows and watch the news on TV; there are references to the story in both of these!) and a nice soundtrack. Plus: The voice acting is awesome.   I have to be fair, though: The game was rushed and did not get the blessing of fine tuning, thus, it is, when played in the downloaded steam-version, very buggy and unstable. BUT there is an unofficial fanpatch which fixes 99,9% of the bugs and even adds bonus stuff if you enable it! The patch is still (!!!) being worked on (but it is in a very, very good state, it's just finetuning) and there are even some cool mods which are altering the game in a nice way.  So, to all those who are lamenting like 'I BOUGHT GAME I WANT IT TO WORK WITHOUT EXTERNAL PATCH!!!111':  I understand you. Yeah, this is not what one might call 'customer friendly'. But the developers are gone, there is noone official who could fix that. But, think about it: It has become quite a norm that unfinished, crappy early access games are popping up like mushrooms in the forest on steam. Some of them are boring, some totally bugged, a lot of them not even in a state of what one might call 'pre-alpha'.     This brilliant jewel of RPG here can be fixed with a third party patch which is easily accessible in the internet (just look for the 'unofficial patch'), so do give it a try if you are looking for a good vampire game. If you are a fan of the WoD, you may already played the game. If not: Do it. The disciplines have been changed a little bit, but this game is awesome; even with the little mistakes in the lore/setting. Don't expect a perfect tabletop-&gt;PC port, but it is damn good anyway. You will even meet some known characters from the books.",

            "review_text": "If you take every horror movie stereotype and Frankenstein it together, would the creation somehow mould its way into the hallowed halls of the A-movie? Probably not. But what a kick-♥♥♥ game it would make! This is that game. An RPG first-person shooter hybrid, where the strengths of these horror cliches are celebrated, and the atmosphere it creates is eerie, even startling. But it's not a scary game. It shouldn't be. After all, in this game, you are the nightmare. You are the vampire!  This game derives so much of its atmosphere from its music. It's fitting then that the first thing to introduce you to this bloodfeast of unholy gore is a score that perfectly sets the tone of the game; dark, but with a simple yet energetic beat. The heartbeat of the game. The visuals do a great job of creating an atmospheric world, but that atmosphere flourishes in the presence of such a masterful score. The darkness is all the more tangible.  The visuals, though a bit dated, are still nothing short of impressive, presenting a world that is dark, cold, harsh and inhospitable. Nothing of this world is beautiful, except how beautifully unpleasant a world it is. It's the detail in the decay; the rust in the infrastructure, the trash littering the streets, even the people are decayed by disease (of one form or another). That which looks beautiful only succeeds in looking artificial. The exception being anything of nature, what little of nature there is. And even then, nature, more often than not, has fangs. Truly a masterfully designed world, both from a graphic and architectural perspective.  Lets delve into some of the juicier aspects of the game. Starting with the creation of a character. There are several (literally) vampire clans to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. But all of them do serious justice to the name Vampire. That being said, some clans are easier to play than others. For instance, the Nosferatu clan is so hideous that they cannot be seen by humans, lest they violate the masquerade, a crime punishable by final death in the world of darkness. This requires them to stick to the sewers or sneak from place to place. Then, of course, there's the Malkavians, who are insane. With dialogue options so confusing that anyone playing as one might go insane! Every clan has various abilities. The Tremere has Blood Magic to literally suck the life from their opponents. The Malkavians have Dementation. Go on. Spread the insanity.  The RPG element is clever. Instead of earning experience by grinding enemies, you instead earn experience through completing quests. Some quests have alternate solutions, which sometimes net extra experience points. These can then be used to upgrade whichever stats suit your personal play style. And lets be honest. There are a huge variety of options! You like swords? This game has em. Guns? Try the convenience store. You like kicking ♥♥♥ using every violent means imaginable? Is using Vampire magic to literally boil an enemies blood until they explode gruesome enough? (Sorry, no ripping out hearts... that I'm aware of).  Guns did not suit my play style. But from the few times I used them, I found their accuracy and damage to be heavily influenced by skill, timing, and stat based luck. This is true for any weapon, but I found it easier to use melee weapons. Unlike guns, melee fights take place in third person mode (all the better to see thine ♥♥♥-kicking action). And once you get close enough to an opponent, dishing out a combo of damage is almost certainly assured. Regardless of weapon of choice, strategy is required if you want to survive.  The story is a fascinating exploration of darkness in all its forms. The vehicle for this exploration is the society that the monsters have evolved, and the multiple factions all struggling for what they desire. At the heart of this struggle lies the Ankaran Sarcophagus. And the secret sealed within. The first of these factions is the Camerilla, a near worldwide group that is grounded in structure and order, laws and politics. They want to establish a social hierarchy in Los Angeles, shielded by the masquerade of maintaining order. This is greatly in opposition to the Anarchs, who desire freedom over rigidity, though not to the point of stupidity. Revealing themselves to humans would call forth the hunters, those who would destroy any monsters in the name of god. And then there is the Sabbat, a group who relish their inhuman power, willing to lord it over both humans and any monster weaker than they are. They embrace their inner beast, regardless of danger. These are just some of the many factions dancing as puppets in the hands of the chess masters.  As the newly born pawn on the block, you are persuaded (forced) to do the bidding of one Prince Sebastian LaCroix, leader of the LA Camarilla. It quickly becomes apparent that not only are you LaCroix's pawn, you're everyone's pawn! But that has its advantages. You learn about the world and everyone in it by proxy and necessity. LaCroix's ambitions drive the main plot, but the rest is decided by you.  It's worth mentioning that while the voice acting is not of movie quality, you can tell that everyone put serious effort into their roles, even the minor characters! Extra points on that alone.  I'll admit that the ending was interesting, not as epic as I would have liked, but somehow far more satisfying than I imagined. There are a variety of endings you can choose from, and even your actions at the very end, after all has been said and done, can change the final outcome of the game from a satisfying conclusion to an unpleasant one. It is a harsh game that respects your decisions, even if your decisions are ultimately to your detriment. Interestingly, there are a number of subtle hints regarding the various endings of the game. Not enough to know what will happen, but it all falls into place so perfectly. That's some serious attention to detail!  Sadly this kick-♥♥♥ game is riddled with ♥♥♥-kicking bugs, and it's unlikely to receive any official update anytime soon if ever. But there's a bright side. There are a variety of well deserved unofficial patches to fix/enhance the game. In addition, there's also a Steam Guide on how to patch this game into something much more stable. As far as patches are concerned, I personally recommend using the 'Unofficial Patch Plus' (just do a Google search to find it). In addition to fixing most of the game's bugs, it also adds in content that was cut from the game, and it does a decent job of it.  Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is a phenomenal RPG experience. It has its flaws, but most of them are bugs, and most of those bugs, once patched, are very minor. Recommended for anyone seeking a challenging and well made action RPG.",
