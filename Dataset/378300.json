I thouroughly enjoyed the story, the interactions, and that feeling of not knowing WTF I'm supposed to do the entire time until I just click stuff randomly and succeed.  Can't wait for Chapter 2!  The game isn't very difficult, I got 'stuck' a few times for 10 minutes or so at a time but was able to figure out everything without the use of a guide.",

Finished it in one sitting and was left wanting more.  Can't wait for the next chapter.  I would have been happy paying a small price for this game. If the next chapter is longer then I would have no problems paying for that.",

I honestly donâ€™t mind that the game has been made by people with opinions about things, which is dangerous in this genderless - offended by everything society. The lines most character speak are godly :D Only the clicking system might be a bit annoying with having to change action icon A LOT of times (I used right click and clicked so many useless and unnecessary clicks). But I seriously enjoyed this little gem.",
