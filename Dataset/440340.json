            "review_text": "Just so we're clear, this is just my first impressions after about 1 hour of play give or take so if I happened to miss anything from here, I am probably blind as a bat or I haven't reached that far into the game yet.   First off, this is a game built on the Unity engine so looking at the options menu, it's no big suprise that it's usually bare bones starting off with the graphical settings. All you got is resolution that's fixed to your native resolution and can't change it unless you go into windowed mode, toggling realtime shadows on or off, and some basic form of Anti-Aliasing with the absence of graphical presets, but this game is not very demanding as far as I can tell. For sound, it's just the master volume, no sliders for voice, sound effects ,or music. Languages consists of English and Japanese, with the last one is basically swears with the ability to upload any language of your choice. The help menu is written in broken English, but it's not broken enough to not get the message it wants to say.  The gameplay is an on-rails shooter in a third-person perspective, so don't expect a third-person cover shooter. Looking at the game's screenshots, the UI in-game, and the way to navigate the menus, I have realized this game is a mobile port, but does it really affect the gameplay all that much? To me, not really except some design decisions that happen to get through. There are quite a bit of weapons to take with you on the field, but down the later levels, it really feels like they are just direct upgrades from previous weapons you were currently using and when you select a weapon, it has a button labeled upgrade so I originally thought I could alter stats to make the guns more interesting and make early game weapons still viable to use late game until I realized it's only to increase your ammo reserves since buying the weapon itself only comes with one spare magazine for some odd reason. Honestly it would be tolerable if there was a way to switch weapons at will instead of throwing away your entire primary reserves only to be left with a pea shooter. As an on-rails shooter, it unfortunately suffers the same problems as that god awful Rambo game with no warning markers to tell you if you're going to get hit, but instead of fixed health, you have regenerating health so it becomes less noticably infuriating, even though you still get hit occasionally behind cover. The gunplay feels pretty weak with no visual recoil on the guns with fairly poor sound assets in addition to janky animations almost convincing me that the guns were pre-packaged Unity assets and I say that because I am someone who really enjoys games from Tripwire Interactive. Speaking of recoil, there is no recoil to even speak of because it is actually on a set cone of fire that shoots in random directions so don't even think about trying to control said recoil. Occasionally, they will spawn melee units that instantly kills you for some inexplicable reason since I don't recall melee units in rail shooters instagib players at all, no, I can't think of a single one that does that. The levels themselves are pretty short considering this is a mobile game and it is deliberately designed to force you to replay levels over and over again to get enough money for the gun you need and the ammunition required to pass the level only to repeat the process again in return artificially extending the game longer than what the actual length is.  Perhaps I just have really low standards nowadays, but $6 is an okay price for what this is. Verdict? I can't really find myself recommending it to just anybody really and I kinda feel bad for saying it. I'd only recommend it for those who has the time and cash to burn, but not for those who are desperate for on-rails shooters. If you are looking for on-rails shooters, take a look at Blue Estate and Typing of the Dead: Overkill. Or better yet, Go to an arcade outlet and find Time Crisis 3.",
