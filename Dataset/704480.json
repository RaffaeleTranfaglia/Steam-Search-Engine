    "description": "Durak is a classical Russian card game. While it requires strategical thinking, cheating is also a viable strategy as long as you don't get caught. In the same spirit pay attention to your opponents or else you might get tricked and be left as the Durak! The game is best enjoyed with 1 to 5 friends.",
