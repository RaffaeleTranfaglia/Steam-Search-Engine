            "review_text": "I do not understand why the store page disappeared for this title. I wonder if anybody can see / read my review of this game.  SIN was an interesting FPS at the end of the '90s. It had a lot of scripted events and some really good action sequences. The game was also very difficult (or at least this is how I remember). I guess a lot of people played Half Life instead so perhaps not many gamers remember this title.   Emergence meant to be a sequel but with the new Source engine developed by Valve. The creators wanted to release follow-up episodes but it seems Emergency was not successful enough for this to happen. It is a pity as the game is quite good. It can be completed in a mere 3-4 hours due to its shortness, though.  I played its demo years ago so when it was offered with a discount bundled with the original game (released in 1998) I instantly grabbed it.  PS: It seems the store page is up and running so there's no issue with this.",

I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who cares about 'old school' FPS like HL2 and the like. The game has a few annoyances like imprecise controls, a sense of floaty movement (like on skates) and some other minor issues but overall it is good fun. Of course it's pretty short because it was just supposed to be the first episode out of many but for the few hours it lasts it is quite entertaining. Not great but decent enough to give it a shot. Nice run &amp; gun gameplay. Overall I'd probably rate it a 7/10 with one extra point just for the awesome title track 'What's the world come to' composed by Zak Belica and sung by Sarah Ravenscroft.",

So SiN Episodes: Emergence is effectively SiN 2, as a result. It's a shame because playing through this Source based sequel you'll find a lot of that fun actionsplotation you would have loved playing the original (Which comes with this game by the way which is why I recommend this). It's amped up now, and is a little less 'A to B shoot everything on the way' but still has that action star feel. Once again you're trying to track down a corrupt criminal CEO but now you've been poisoned. Play through this, and hope that someone competent secures the rights to finish this someday in our lifetime.",

            "review_text": "After rushing 24 hours total with this. I´m done. I´ve played all the maps(story i mean), fanmade, Sin 1 Source maps, EVERYTHING. (those all i could find and download). I examined every place in all maps totally. So the fun would not end.   Positive things about this game:  -AI, so much better than in any other source game, enemies can get wounded, and can´t move, just noticed that in last map i played, they kick things at you, shoots exploding barrels (and maybe kick them towards you after that), they can melee better, using head example, they throw your grenades back to you(i think, i´m not sure about this one) and they can get health from healthstations example. So it´s more challangening to fight them.  -Maps, so much colours. I love it. They world its self is gorgeous.  -Characters, Omg ur sidekick and main enemy *_*, characters are too very colourful and have great personalities. And other enemies etc. are funny as ♥♥♥♥. Mutants too are awsome. Like that hulk/tank, holy ♥♥♥♥ it´s terrifying, in a good way. And ohohhohooo holy ♥♥♥♥ i bursted to laugh with jetpack soldiers.  -Arcade mode (it´s like survival but you need to surivive example: 15 mins of \\'horde\\'), damn, i had so much fun. I made two gameplay videos of those, Official and un-official map gameplays. Vertigo is best of them all. And fanmaps are awsome too.  -Tiny bit of horror. That mutant part. I was terrifyed a bit.   -Guns with specialists. Damn i had fun with those bouncing shotgun bullets, those were helpful in many ways.   -HARDCORPS-mode, and that one, is hard. It is just like Outlast´s INSANE-mode.   -Soundtrack, i love mostly the last boss fight song, games theme and it´s remix. One of the best themes in gaming universe.  -Insane bunnyhopping  -You can shoot trough the walls, obstacles etc. Like CSGO. AI is clever to do that too.  -Many funny secrets and easter eggs  Negative things about this game:  -Movement, you move so ♥♥♥♥ing slow, and even sprint-jumping somewhere does not succeed very well sometimes.  -Only 3 guns+melee+stupidly generated shotgun ironsight  -Short game, it´s like 2 hours to 6 hours(if its new player playing)  -Sometimes, AI´s melee is too OP  -New game menu, like how do i know whatkind of difficulty i get while adjusting that difficulty. (see for urself and u know what i mean)  -Dissapointing ending.  -That tankhulk eats ur ammunition.  -No multiplayer support. (like there is no multiplayer at all, and it would have been great with arcade maps, or/with survival style)  -When you buy this, you will receive extra copy of Sin 1+Sin 1 MP, but Sin 1 is broken and multiplayer has no players and Sin 1 does NOT HAVE expansion pack (that is the real ending in that expansion.. buy this game for GOG if u want best version)  -Blade is more silent in this one.. ;_;  Now i want to say that this has been a great experience and i will not forget it. I will play this once again if this ever get revived. Last time i played this was 6 years ago and this was my second playthrough. And this game is 10 YEARS OLD NOW, has been for awhile. People has been in cliffhanger for 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years. Yes i know why. Don´t tell me then. I still hope they come back and revive this series ;_; we need EP2 ASAP.  I highly recommend this for people who misses good old FPS style like HL2, CSS, COD(okay cod just came to my mind because that greanade throwing thingy and shooting through walls etc and meaning, time before EXO ♥♥♥♥ etc..) So this is perfect game for these kind of people, trust me, you will not be dissapointed.  Overall rating 8/10",

Weapons and gunplay are boring and uninspired, character models are generic and recycled, levels are completely and utterly linear, and movement and aiming feel... strange. Honestly, the graphics aren't that bad, but the whole game just feels old. Like Half Life 1 old.   Add to that the plot, which makes no sense to me, and spends entirely too much time without actually explaining anything, and the game comes across as utterly uncompelling. If you're a fan of the series, you may understand things better, and may consequently like the game more, but at this point I just have no interest in ever firing the game back up.",

I didn't enjoy the demo of the original game much, but I was thinking more modern FPS design would help fix it! And I was pleasantly surprised. This is a leaner, shorter version of SIN without all the tedious level design (well, significantly less tedious anyway.) The scripted sequences are nice and it is fun to shoot the dudes in the head with your pistol. It's not much and it lasts about four hours, plus you're never going to ever get a sequel with this. Given all that, though, the work they must have put into this game and their subsequent closing down was the bellwether for the failure of the episodic model - too much work for too little payoff (and profit). Still, it's worth a playthrough.",

I highly recommend this game due to its gripping action, interesting charactrers, well put game design, great voice acting (which some of you may recognize), and the very simple, yet deadly weapons to choose from. However the cons to this sequal are: Lack of voice acting of Blade (the main hero), and interactive elements that were from the original game, such as: Computers, Panels. Other cons: Lack of Dark Environments from the original SiN, Electrka looks god damn gorgous but her face looks way different compared to SiN.   Other than that, Grab both games and have an old school pass through memory lane. And by the way...........'I'm gunna make you my ♥♥♥♥♥!'",

            "review_text": "(THIS IS FOR THE FIRST SIN GAME AND NOT EMERGENCE)  Still one of my favorite games of all time. SiN remains my favorite FPS ever created due to its interactivity, visuals, style, storyline and pure variety and fast paced fun to the gameplay. Sadly overshadowed by its competitor Half-Life even though SiN had done leaps and bounds more than the original Half-Life ever did. SiN kept the old school massive non-linear fast paced style of games such as Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood and a bunch of other examples of the glory days of the fps.   But while keeping that old school style it brought in innovations such as vehicles, intelligent AI that could call for backup or run for cover, location based damage modeling, destructible environments, dynamic music, location based armour, and a whole slew of other achievements.   Compared to Half-Life the location variety, soundtrack and overall gameplay is leaps and bounds above it. It gives me a much more fast paced, fun, varied and non-linear experience. While Half-Life gave you a research facility, a desert and... a research facility. SiN gives you a bank, a factory, an underwater plant, a warehouse, an office building, a construction site, apartment buildings, mines and an assortment of other locations that I can't bring off the top of my head.   While Half-Life gave you slow tromps through a linear environment, SiN gave you large open levels with tonnes of hidden areas, secondary objectives and an incentive to explore for weapons, armour and ammo.   While Half-LIfe gave you limited interactivity, SiN gave you interactivity to the level of Duke3D with interactive computers used with DOS promps, destructible environments, secondary objectives or items that could drastically change future levels, along with an assortment of others.  Overall SiN shall forever remain one of my favorite FPS games of all time, it's a shame that it was ignored due to the release of Half-Life and the slew of bugs that plauged it until the first patch.   Rest in peace Ritual Entertainment, killed by the industry and being bought out by a casual company.",
