            "review_text": "Before I write this, the music is freaking awesome, LOVED it, now buckle up.  I don't want to ever slate a game, but man this was so bad, I get the idea of sending it back to the 90's, for a cool retro game, but theres so SO SO much wrong with it. For starters, spelling errors in the 'how to play' section, is that even forgivable in this day and age? Not sure. Moving on to using a controller, I couldn't find an option to change the controls, so you are expected to use left stick to move, and click right stick to shoot..Can I not use one of my 4 triggers instead? So i was forced to use it on the keyboard, which meant shooting with my mouse, the cursor is ridiculously small, so you constantly lose where you are actually firing and it becomes a nightmare.   Theres a back story in the intro (you cant even skip it) the story is 10 seconds long, its based on battlestar galatica, which isn't a bad thing. But once you actually start to play the game, there is no longer a story line, or any cut scenes, or anything with text at all, you are left to guess what to do, no 'your mission' or 'you died' text.   Some of the planets/levels start off like they are going to be great, with instant action and waves, then you clear it, and it all completely stops, i mean completely stops and you have to painfully wait for the cores to re-spawn while the odd random ship happens to pop up and fly in to the wall you've built.  To be quite honest, this game just infuriated me, I thought it would be great fun as I love these types of indie games, and as a child of the 90's love going back in time inside modern day releases.  I know it's only a small release, but I read the one and only review, and got all excited thinking this is going to sick, and hard AF like a lot of indie games are. Nope no, it wasn't hard, it wasn't good and I regret buying it. Sorry.",
