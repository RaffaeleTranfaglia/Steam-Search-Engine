            "review_text": "This is the most fun that I've had with a spaceship-based combat game since Freelancer and, before that, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter. I have not beaten it yet, but these are my impressions so far.  The Good:      The PRICE. This game plays like a $60 AAA title.     Fast-paced combat in capital ships that actually includes you piloting instead of just giving commands.     Main storyline makes you want to learn more.     QWERTY controls are downright elegant - I own a controller but have no desire to use it.     No Z-Axis - I understand some people refuse to buy the game for this reason but, not only is it unnecessary, it would also make the game extremely awkward considering the types of ships you're flying. You won't miss it, trust me.     Young game, but so far, almost entirely bug free.     Epic blues soundtrack that changes songs depending on what you're doing in game. Fast music for fights, cruising music for, well, cruising.     The game world feels like Firefly would if it would have had a lot more in-space pewpew and also aliens. Lots of aliens.     Enough ship customization, but not so much that you feel like you need an encyclopedia. (looking at you, EVE)     Bits and pieces of humor throughout.     Graphics are pretty, if not necessarily stunning.      The galaxy is persistent, living, and breathing, and things are happening that have nothing whatsoever to do with you, which can cause interesting results.   The Not-As-Good:     They're not planning on expansions or DLC or anything, last I heard, and there have been zero updates to the game since launch, though that was only 15 days ago. I'd like to think there's a big content patch in the works or something, but I have no evidence for that. The game is, however, absolutely stable, as far as I can tell, so maybe they're just considering it finished. (edit - as of 11/17/15, they have released a small patch)     Running missions to keep your ship powerful enough to take on the next story element might be too reptitive for some, though I'm enjoying it.     Escort missions are still kind of broken. I just did one where my client's destination was to a base that was aggressive to him, presumably because the base was aggressive to me. I don't know any reason a merchant would purposely go to a station whose defenses were going to shred him. On the first attempt, there was also a BIG fleet, and I didn't get credit for the mission because he got blown up. On the second attempt, no fleet, so although the station's defenses opened fire on us both, I got credit for the mission just before the merchant ship exploded. So I looted him and flew off, getting both the merchant's cargo and the pay for the escort. Amusing, but obviously not what the developers intended.   Is this worth your $20? Absolutely. Zero question. Even if you don't particularly like these types of games, the lack of Z-axis might actually do it for you. It makes the game feel a lot less nauseating to those who typically can't handle the extra plane, and eliminates the circling buzzard effect that tends to plague starfighter-based games (Elite: Dangerous, looking at you).   There's something about running straight at a ship three times your size, turning and opening up your cannons and just shredding them that is immensely and uniquely gratifying while some fast-paced, hard-core electric guitar plays on queue, and the pirate-lord screams 'No...no-no-no-NO!' then blows up, leaving behind a rare piece of ship equipment.",

            "review_text": "I'm not really sure when space westerns became a thing. My secret inner weeb wants to point to Cowboy Bebop or Trigun, but it just as easily could have been Firefly or Starcraft or something else entirely. They're the logical conclusion of humanity expanding into space, really, embracing the freedom of an open universe without the unity or enlightenment of something like Star Trek. This is precisely where Rebel Galaxy lives, in a simple wild west approach to space battles and exploration.  You begin the game by inheriting an old junk freighter from your aunt and running errands in it for an old alien acquaintance of hers. Following the main story missions unravels a lengthy, familiar tale of deep space intrigue and ancient artifacts. This is of course only one option of many in the vein of something like Sid Meier's Pirates! because you can just as easily haul cargo, claim bounties, or pirate convoys for as long as the game holds your attention. A fair spread of ships, weapons, and upgrades are available across several factions for you to spend your hard-earned credits on and advance in power.  The moment-to-moment gameplay of Rebel Galaxy is like an arcadey version of naval combat. Capital ships in this sci-fi reality still rely on broadsides for most of their firepower, so you'll be sidling up to just about everything you want to blow away. You also get auto-targeting turrets and a secondary weapon that can fire missiles or flak, as well as shield and speed boosters to expand your tactical options. I wouldn't say there's a lot of depth to the combat but positioning and prioritizing targets can mean the difference between victory and the cold embrace of hard vacuum.  Unless you get really into the mostly generic story you're going to want to spend most of your time amassing wealth for bigger ships and guns. There's a basic commodity system you can play space trader with that requires some attention to trade routes and emergent events, but most of your time will probably be spent on missions. Each station has a mission board offering bounty collections, blockades, pirate hunting, cargo hauling, and more. These missions are assigned a difficulty based on your ship's current loadout, which is terribly helpful because anything above Average carries a very real chance of annihilating you in an instant.  Rebel Galaxy offers a very promising setup and world to prosper in but suffers from a few issues, the difficulty curve being chief among them. At some point you're going to hit a wall where your next story mission or the only profitable missions are High or Very High risk, and if the enemy composition is not favorable to your particular ship you're going to die very, very fast. Upgrading to a larger ship is the easiest way to climb the difficulty curve but can require a LOT of side missions and busywork if the next hull in line isn't very cheap. People who are easily distracted and habitually clear side missions will fare a lot better than most here.  The further you get the more technical issues you'll see crop up as well. Late in the game I started having mission-critical items disappear and enemy ships not properly register as objectives, which led to some aggravating wastes of time. There's also a lot going on in every star system, with pirates and militia lurking everywhere. This sounds cool at first but missions don't account for or clear existing entities in the mission space, so a Low risk battle against some frigates can turn out to be instantly fatal if the game decides to spawn pirate dreadnoughts in that particular sector.  I've had my fair share of frustration with this title, but most of my time in it has been a relaxing and rewarding romp around the galaxy. The systems you explore are expansive, colorful, and full of debris fields and nebulae to explore for secrets and bounties. Warping around has a great feel to it, with rich engine sounds and visual distortions through space. The twangy western feel is out in full force as well, with plenty of rough-spoken captains to deal with, junky ships to pilot and pilfer, and plenty of wailing country rock to fill the silent void.  At times it feels very much like a friendlier, simpler, offline EVE Online, though it never really matches the same sense of scale or vastness. I mean that in the best and worst ways, too, because it never really aspires to be more than a basic space hauling shooting gallery. And yet, there's an undeniable draw to scraping together the credits to land a new class of vessel and taking it out for a spin in the places you feared to tread before. That's where Rebel Galaxy really succeeds, in giving you a universe to explore and plenty of reasons to see it all.",

When I played Freelancer, I had a 'was that it?' feeling. Contrarily, Rebel Galaxy gives off a 'not JUST a space flight adventure simulator' sort of vibe.  Yay: - Ignore the story, earn money, buy really big ships. - Ability to join multiple guilds without needing to quit your current one - Broadside combat in a space sim is surprisingly fun. - Very responsive devs, check the bug reports part of the forum - Prices of commodities go up and down in response to world events and planetary type - Wide variety of missions. Escort, Pickup, Delivery, Blockade Running, Head hunting... - No speed lanes, you want to get somewhere fast just point your nose and punch the warp. - Dynamic system. In Wing Commander: Privateer, you could watch the news and respond accordingly to major events. Is there a famine? Bring food. War? Bring weapons. Market glut, buy low. This system is rarely found in these space trading games. I don't think Freelancer had it. - Good voice acting - Intuitive game design - Aliens! - Varied Nebulas. Including the classic ones like lightning nebulas that can shatter your shields in a single flash and dark nebulas where danger and mystery lurk within. - Scanner. A nifty halo emits from your ship and lets you know of nearby enemies, allies, and items.  Nay: - Broadside combat is rather easy. Just manuever until your side is exposed, use precise targetting, and press a button. The lead is automatically calculated for you. The only thing you need to decide is how much time to charge the shot. - Fighters are so annoying since they can go to the 3rd dimension. Plus the strike craft defense options are a bit lacking due to their extremely limited range. You're left with relying on general-purpose turrets to pick off the pesky gnats one at a time. - No speed lanes. Most of the time, I neglect to plot a proper course before warping so I end up going through like 3 asteroid fields, 2 debris fields, and 1 planet. That's like hitting 6 red lights when you're trying to get somewhere.  Meh: - No idle radio chatter - From what I've played so far, you pass lots of planets but there is no planetary landing. You always stop at a station in orbit. I'm guessing the idea is that space ships should stay in space where they're designed to work. ",

            "review_text": "Imagine you're playing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Now, imagine that instead of being stuck with that one, tiny, but somehow infinitely upgradable little ship, you can actually buy new ships as your fortunes improve. Now, imagine you're in space. Finally, imagine you don't have to get out of the ship to follow some British ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around the island for 20 minutes in an area that is suddenly, inexplicably teeming with soldiers.  I think I got sidetracked. Anyway. This is an excellent quasi-3D ship combat game. Not a full 3D sim like Freelancer... all player-piloted ships, and those of similar size, seem to occupy the same plane of space. Rolls, climbs, and dives are not valid maneuvers. Shields go fore, aft, port, starboard, with no concern for doral or ventral. Despite this, you don't feel particularly limited in your play. It's just streamlining something that can overly complicate some other games.  There is some downside. There isn't a lot of variety to your available weaponry. The targeting AI that controls your turrets most of the time is kinda stupid, and works in exclusive terms, rather that allowing prioritization. There are, inevitably, escort missions, some of which you will lose for no good reason. The in-game economy is a little capricious, which makes moving goods profitably as a trader a bit of a long game. But I still find it enjoyable to spend a few hours making pretty explosions in space, set to a soundtrack that you might find playing in Jim Raynor's house back on Mar Sara- forgettable, upbeat, twangy rock.",

It has a pretty low replayability though as there is very little interest in restarting the game from scratch (the story missions give you 2 different minor bonuses to choose from on 2 occasions).  So about the game, it is a pretty standard space opera trading/combat game and has all you could expect from the genre. Its (only) originality lies in you controlling capital ships (from the small and fast corvettes to the massive and powerfull dreadnoughts) and having 3 sets of weaponry (broadsides, turrets and a tertiary weaponry). Making money can be achieved through a variety of quests, piracy, bounty hunting, helping attacked merchants, mining, looting and of course trading. It is grindy, but fair.  Overall it is a solid title and I recommend it for what it offers which is a couple dozens of hours of fun (I have more on record because I deleted a save by mistake).",

Many 'Age of Sail' ship games don't do broadside maneuvering as well as Rebel Galaxy does it.   Cons: + Minor Nit: Some odd UX choices. Radial menu has most of what you need, scan button has others, and yet the start menu has even others. + No multiplayer. Wow, would this be fun in a team! I get that it would be out of scope for this sorte, ala Torchlight 1. + Another minor nit: Who are the factions? Are they important? Not sure.

Honestly, at this point the only thing that I dont particularly care for is the fact that there isn't any kind of co-op/multiplayer mode to it. The story line was compelling to the point that (aside from getting the distress call or unknown signal source) that i found myself wanting to know what would happen next about midway thru it.  The soundtrack is very nice, but as with other games, when i want to listen to something else, i mute the music in game and play my own play list.  The Broadside combat i throughly enjoy as i enjoy other games such as Black Flag (console), World of Warships, and back in the day Starfleet Command. To many space sim games that do give you the whole 3D still even lack the simple ability to do a loop. So why bother calling it a 3d game? (yes i pointing my finger at you STO and EVE)  The missions will get repetive, but honestly, what game doesn't make your grind once you reach that certain point? And there are enough different ships in the game to let you find the 'one' that fits your play style. I would love to see more ships added eventually. (i want to fly that Proteus (red devil cruiser/dread (has the look of the Galactica to it))). I would pay a little more for a DLC with the ability to fly the Alien/Pirate faction ships.  As one other person mentioned, there is no cookie cutter build to deal with all missions. The only ship that will come close to that is the End game Dreadnaught, but all that does is make you a Jack of all trades and Master of none.  (small spoiler below)    (small spoiler below) The only constant you can get is the Broadsides destroying everything in 1-3 volleys unless your doing certain Heroic mission.

You control a space cruiser flying around the galaxy trading and fighting. Make money from trading at space stations buying low, selling high, and use the money to upgrade your ship with new weaons, armor, and equipment. This will allow you to take on pirates (or become a pirate) and loot your fallen enemies. Trade, fight, loot, upgrade, repeat until you have enough for a bigger ship and repeat the process. This is much what I imagine Han Solo and Chewbacca did before running into Luke and Ben in Mos Eisley. Do you want a Han Solo simulator or a Firefly simulator? This is pretty much it. I also enjoy the amount of choices the devs chose to throw at the player. For almost every mission you have multiple options of how to proceed, be it violently or non-violently. I have yet to see how many of these choices play out, but Rebel Galaxy has made a very good impression in my first few hours of gameplay.",

Whether intended or not, the title is a loving tribute to all 'Cowboy Movie In Space' stories, from Star Wars to Firefly. As with any other similar offering, the startlingly addictive travel-fight-upgrade loop is crafted to keep you hooked, and hooked I was.  'Rebel Galaxy,' at the pick-up-n-play level, offers a nifty sort of subversive, stripped-down take on maneuvering and shooting. This isn't a game about twisting and turning in every possible direction. Instead, you're locked on a 2D plane, with your abilities to both manage your loadout and hop into manual fire-control being of paramount importance. This is not to say that maneuvering and mobility aren't influential. Rather, it's to say that the approach to those aspects is much more focused; The 'domain' is restricted to a relatively simple mechanic that's easy for the player to recognize and iterate upon.  What's very interesting to me is how this connects to the overall backdrop of the experience. Especially with the 'broadsides' element, the way the ship-combat works makes that part of the game a 'Tall Ships In Space' sort of activity, which is usually mutually exclusive from the 'Cowboy Movie In Space' genre. An odd sort of outcome, though, is that for all the emphasis on the broadsides, the game ends up subverting them. Matching speed and hammering away at an enemy is fine if you outclass them, but you're far better off getting on their tail and letting your turrets do the work. A smaller ship can really beat up on bigger adversaries that way, because the truly frightening firepower can't hit you.  'Rebel Galaxy' doesn't quite hit a perfect mark. The way the interaction is broken up into three modes is strange and clunky, with two kinds of scanning (the pulse and detail scans) being strangely divorced from each other in both where they are found and how they work. Also, the 'loot' value/ mission value/ mission difficulty/ equipment cost curves start off being very nicely tuned, but then seem to diverge as the game gets into the late stages. Particularly frustrating were missions labeled as being relatively safe, where that label apparently pertained only to the very beginning of the mission. A few moments into the actual meat of the encounter, and you might find yourself surrounded by a large number of very dangerous opponents.  The problems are very small, though. 'Rebel Galaxy' is a truly worthy effort that is fun to play and manages to have its own identity. I hope there are more like it over the horizon.",

The only problem I've had with this game is that faction reputation scores don't seem to give the effect that I expected them to. For example if I got my reputation upto 'Friendly' with the militia, I would expect them to be friendly with me when I hail them and so far I got the same response I used to get back when I was still in neutral. Other than that it is a great game, you can ally yourself with citizens and militia or be a pirate shooting up citizen and milita ships. Combat is well done and there's different types of ships and gear that you can fit it with. There's also an option to hire mercenary to fight along with you and there's a nice economy simulation under it all. And finally soundtrack really fits with the game, has space-western vibe to it.   In conclusion, get this game you wouldn't regret it.",

            "review_text": "Takes the fun/addictive elements of freeform space sims while avoiding the over-complexity of some of these titles (such as the X-series). As usual you start with an underequipped ship and earn money for better weapons/systems, new ships, and even mercenary support if you want it. You can earn money via missions (randomly generated and storyline), trading, mining, piracy or bounty hunting; it's up to you if you want to stay the right side of the law or if you aim to misbehave. It's worth noting that your starting ship is a corvette and the ship classes only get bigger from there on (right up to massive dreadnoughts). Because you're always commanding a large ship, combat is very different from a fighter-focused space sim and as others have pointed out it the 2D movement gives a 'naval battle in space' feel to it (though faster paced); it actually works pretty well, making the battles very fun to play - which is a good thing, because there is a lot of combat in this game.  Visually this has a beautiful-looking universe, some spectular space battles and a wide variety of nice ship designs (from Serenity-style rustbuckets to more conventional-looking starships). I like the fact that the different ships cater to different playstyles - bigger isn't necessarily better as there are other factors like speed, manouverabilty and weapon placement, so instead of a linear progression to the 'best' ship, people will find their own favorite ships along the way.  There are some aspects of the game that could do with some improvement such as the scaling of encounters and missions - the actual difficulty of missions doesn't always seem to match the stated risk level. Also it's quite possible to get into fights where the only chance of survival is to run, especially at the beginning of the game; though this is not a bad thing in itself, the fact that the game pops up a combat tutorial note on your first fight (even if you're totally outmatched) could confuse new players into thinking they should always be able to win their first battle. I can see why the single checkpoint-type save is controversial, but personally I'm fine with a single save AS LONG AS there is some backup in case of corrupt saves - fortunately haven't had a corrupted save yet, but would be pretty peeved if this happened after hours of play.  The hillbilly rock soundtrack does help create that 'wild frontier' Firefly vibe, but it also starts to get a bit old after about 10 hours - fortunately there is an option to stream your own music - this is a great feature that allows you to select different music sources for different situations (ambient, combat, idle, station etc).  Overall this is probably the most enjoyable space game I've played since Freelancer.",

Despite the somewhat repetitive nature, there was a certain appeal to finally getting that new ship and whipping the ♥♥♥ of those pirates that took you into hull so many times. Treat this game like it's Gran Turismo, Space Edition, and you'll probably solidly like it as I did. Game is 8/10. EDITED because I forgot to mention, the MUSIC is AWESOME.

            "review_text": "I have loved the space game genre since I was 8 years old. The fact that I am recommending this means that out of the 95% of released space sim titles I have played to death, Rebel Galaxy manages to stand out a cut above many of them. I am not even a quarterway finished with the main storyline, yet 10 hours in, the amount of content is quite impressive, and makes gameplay enjoyable to say the least.   First and foremost, this is a third person spaceship simulator. There is no empire building or 4X gameplay involved.   You primarily fight, trade and explore in Rebel Galaxy, and start off doing the main campaign which you can deviate from at anytime. Of course the campaign has you flying around a little bit to do other things, but fighting is usually involved. Wonderful thing here is though, interactions with NPCs in the campaign and in general allow for non-violent alternatives to do a mission, or, for instance, to handle a pirating attempt or an illegal cargo inspection by system militia.   There are about a dozen solar systems in Rebel Galaxy, so you are given some wiggle room to move around. Content such as missions, NPC spawns, and solar system events are randomly generated. There is enough variety to keep things from going stale, and as you get farther away from your starting solar system, more content (ships, equipment, guild allegiances) is available to you.  Combat is a bit different in Rebel Galaxy. And your ship's motion is limited to 2D movement only (while fightercraft and the environment objects can have 3D motions and positions). I will seperate this into two parts. Offensive capabilities and Defensive capabilities.   Offensive capabilities  Includes 1) A primary weapon 2) A secondary weapon 3) Turret systems 4) Mercenaries 5) Deflectors.    Primary weapons can be either pulse laser types or beam laser types. You fire broadsides (i.e from the side) at the enemies on either side. Very powerful, and include a small charging time for an auto-aim accuracy bonus.    Secondary weapons are either mines or missiles (point &amp; shoot or seeking). Good damage.    Turret systems can be either pulse or laser types. You can take control of your turret groups (1 at a time only) and fire at enemies in a 360 degree arc. Critical against fightercraft and provide good sustaining damage against larger craft.    Mercenaries are fightercraft/gunships that follow you around for a 1 time fee. They are very durable, are good fodder, and you can only have 1 with you at any time.    Deflectors are a sort of temporary shield you can activate which absorb damage. You can also ram enemy ships with them to inflict damage.    Defensive capabilities   Include 1) Deflectors 2) Shields 3) Armor 4) Hull 5) Engine boosters    As mentioned, Deflectors are temporary shields that asborb damage until you run out of charge, in which case you must wait for them to have charge in order to use them.    Shields are divided into 4 sections that protect your ship (front, port, starboard, aft) from all damage and collisions.    Armor protects your ship's hull. Damage to armor can damage to ship systems.    Hull is your powercore. If it goes to 0, you die.    Engine boosters can be used to maneuver weapons fire, outrun missiles, outrun foes, and kite enemies.   Combat aside, the graphics are very nice and well optimized. Also, the soundtrack is wonderful, it reminds me of Firefly.  As with any game, there is a bit of a grind involved to gain credits in order to unlock higher tiered ships and equipment. Best way to go about this is doing a bunch of high paying missions (mission payouts generally increase as your overall strength increases) alongside a storyline mission once in a while. Or however you want. Imo the grind doesn't feel like a grind sometimes. It's pretty fun to blow ♥♥♥♥ up.   All in all, I dig it. Combat is different, not shallow. Plenty of content. Good soundtrack. Solid mechanics. Decent plot. Way to go Double Damage Games. I hope you keep making titles in this genre!",

Enemies get through your shield in seconds and your weps never get through the enemies shields fast enough. It's annoying to have to constantly having to fix your hull and buy ammo.   Like I said, good game overall for a sp game. It's a shame the developer added more mobs that jump you every five feet instead of a story that works or better combat mechanics.  Plus there is little to no replay value for this game, replaying this game gives you nothing new and the story is a one way trip.  I would wait until this game is on the 5$ discount rack.

Pros:  - Great atmosphere - Enjoyable Costumization - Enjoyable Fights but (see cons) - Good difficulty balance - Nice random events but (see cons) - Great soundtrack - Beautiful universe and ship design   Cons:  -Fights get stale fast and are in terms of tactical depthness pretty bleak after a short while.   Enemys get spawned in around you which is a huge letdown. The fighst needed features like e.x. Take cover behind asteroids to avoid incoming fire from enemy, Take cover behind enemy ships to avoid fire. Maybe features like cloaking (you can detect every ship with a simples can, th game needs a system like world of warships), sideway boosts or big space battles with way more ships but a tactical feature to command and order friendly ships to win battles. (stop the game like the scannermode give us a overview and command features)  - Market system is to simple after a while and it should add new goods if you get to new systems or have individual goods that you can sell in different systems and more economical possibilitys.  - Random events like distress calls or bountys are great but two features get boring pretty fast  - Events on planets have a good impact on the econemy features but some events don't effect the prices as much as they should in my opinion.   - Rewards for e.x. destroying big battleships or pirate kings are inconsistent and don't scale properly  - And last but not least my most important complain:  The missions are too similar and there are only a handful of Story missions. The pretext of the Mainstory is good but it feels like the WHOLE CAMPAIGN should be only the FIRST CHAPTER of the whole story unfolding. Everything feels impersonal. You are traveling space for years and you have interaction with 4 notacible Characters in the whole game if you count all mercenarys as one character of interest.  I'm aware that this is a fairly small project from a very small developer team but the wasted potential on this game is making my head spin.

Even worse, sell him some items then destroy him to get them back after being paid. All while trying to maintain a good standing with certain factions.  The music is top notch. I could listen to it all day and it really sets the scene as a free-lance/cowboy pilot. Visually it is also wonderful. While not on the same level as EVE its enjoyable to fly through.  The combat is unique (in a good way). It is a hybrid between targeting and letting your AI handle the work and manually aiming and shooting. I like this a bit more than the EVE combat system.

It's simple with it being on a flat plane (meaning you can't fly up and down, instead you go left, right, and straight). Surprisingly it doesn't take to much away from the game. Combat is fast paced and their is a varity of ships to face, from small fighters to capital ships. Some of your weapons crush small fighters but won't even scratch the paint job against the capital ships.   There is plenty of upgrades for your ships and the best part is when you buy a new ship, you don't have to rebuy everything as it swaps out the ship but keeps the equipment and automatically sells the old ship (so if you're a tad short on money it'll do an exchange where it sells your ship first then buys the new ship making it pretty seemless to purchase new things).   The sounds are pretty good in the game, I really can't complain. Especially when you hit warp. The voice acting is above average for a game of this production size.  All in all, if you like space, I'd have to recommend this game. I got this game when it was $9.99 and to be honest, it would be worth it at $20.00 hands down.",

Lots of shared and samey stuff.  Nevertheless, you can also see where those savings went. Very few bugs, cool aesthetic and with the awesome feature to add your own music even for different situations. This is a super easy to learn, fun space shmup where all to a surprisingly kicking vanilla soundtrack (seriously, check it out on YT if you like space westerns) The gameplay is a little repetitive, but getting bigger and bigger ships is just so satisfying.

For those who have never played Freelancer:    In a nutshell, Freelancer was an open ended Space Combat/Economic sim made back in 2003, It was pretty much about making money, legally or illegally and exploring the universe. The cool thing about it is that you had different factions that reacted differently to what you did, for example, raiding cargo ships makes you unpopular with Police and Corporations, while Bounty Hunting made you unpopular with Criminals.     (Also for those complaining about you moving in '2D only' Lets be honest, 'Up and down' axis was purpouseflully not really used much in Freelancer either)",

Having played through this with a good friend watching it live on Stream for the majority of the playthough i can say i enjoyed this title a lot.  But i have gripes, gripes that comes from that it's meant to be played with a controller. There is a distinct snapping with aim assist in this game, this paired with no pitch control (Y axis for your spacecraft doesnt exist, but exists for other smaller crafts and various world objects/projectiles)  The game felt huge at the beginning but the main storyline skips through sectors mid story, which leaves you just going through sectors without a reason to stay (unless you are doing trading, mining or hunting).  It feels like this game was ported over from a Console, but that could also be good.. hear me out. In 50+ hours i have not had a single crash or bug, nor any weird software issues at all. This could very well be thanks to that the game is polished in that sense, framerate feels solid aswell.  Game is beautiful (even if nebulas are tiny dust clouds compared to real life), the game allows custom music for: Idle, Combat, Space stations, ambient &amp; main title. This is a very nice addition and lets you (once you get bored of the ingame music) put your own tracks for various interactions in game.  Game plays well, no stutter or dips in general performance. I highly recommend playing this with a controller, as with a mouse the snapping / aim assist gets very frustrating once you wanna have more of a freelook aiming.  Story should be made longer, or added with DLC as it felt short and kinda rushed, especially compared to the amount of sectors you dont even do any type of missions in at all. (you mainly just go find npc for mission-&gt;go and talk to npc-&gt;gate-&gt;gate-&gt;mission-&gt;gate back-&gt;gate back-&gt;find npc who gave mission-&gt;talk to npc.  It does have some issues in those areas i mentioned earlier, but because it performs so well, and compensates with positives i can only give this a thumbs up.  Improvements for a sequel in my mind would be: Expansive story, more side quests (not just mission board money makers), get rid of aim assist/snapping and give us Y axis / Pitch.",

There are ways to make money quick start of the game but really you just want to take your time, blow stuff up and enjoy the great looking textures.  If I could change one thing it would be to allow a player to view trade\\commodity details better. Its not as player friendly as I'd like.

They fit the lone horse/desperado theme really well and enhance the battles quite a bit. You can even load your own playlist and cruise around to your own tunes if you so choose.  The gameplay itself is fun. Combat is slightly confusing at first until you make it through a few battles. then you realise that for the most part your craft is pretty automated and all you have to worry about are your big cannons. You can control the smaller turrets and missles if you want, but it's hardly necessary. To that end, the battles do tend to get a little repetative after a while.  Finally, and this may be the only real negative, the missions quickly turn in to 'Start at point A, get to point B, blow ships up, return to point A, get money.' So it's rather repetative. I will say that I'm still not very far in the game at all (even after 11hrs. Lots of side missions), so this could very well change. I'll update my review if it does.  All-in-all the game looks great, sounds great, and feels great. It gets a little grind-y, but it's still fun. Definitely worth the $20 price-tag.",

In addition to the main campaign quest, you pretty much go around the galaxy accepting different bounties so that you can upgrade your ship and complete the harder quests in the campaign. Almost all the bounties are combat-type bounties.   You can also acquire money through trade on the commodities market, but it can be very time-consuming. The key to commodities trading is finding out what outposts will pay the highest for various products. For instance, a scientific oytposts will pay higher for intellectual property and tech stuff, but a rogue or outlaw outposts will pay more for illicit drugs and whatnot. You can also gain trading info by reading news boards and speaking to bartenders. Traveling between space stations and various parts of the galaxy can be boring. It can take several minutes to travel between points on opposite sides of the galaxy.  The graphics are nice and the music is awesome, but it gets a little monotonous after awhile since it plays constantly on a loop throughout the entire game.   The combat is interesting. It is 'naval-style' combat, which means your primary guns fire from the side. This imposes a significant learning curve to combat since you have to fight sideways, which makes it harder to see incoming missiles. There are secondary weapons that you can switch to that don't require sideways combat, but then you have to constantly adjust your ship angle if you switch weapons a lot. It is challenging but rewarding when you finally get it all down.  Rebel Galaxy is a fun and nice alternative to most space sims that require a lot of management and alliance building over a long period of time. Rebel Galaxy commences with all that by giving you a campaign and a ship. The rest is up to you.",

Between the two of them, they've had a hand in Fate, Mythos, Diablo II, and Torchlight. If you liked those games, and have played Freelancer or the little known Escape Velocity, this game should be an instant buy. Even if you haven't played space based ARPGs, you should buy this game.  Why? It feels good to play, and everything in the game is secondary to it feeling good to play. That's how it represents everything that's right about games: it focuses on playing as being the critical element. The controls, sounds, and looks of the game come together to make it feel like you're playing something that's meant, designed, and created to be played, above all else.   What really drives the game is the desire to kill things and become space rich, so you can kill stronger things and become even more space rich. It's the drive to kill, loot, and kill and loot even more that keeps the player going.  If you're into narrative heavy games, then you probably should pass on this. The story is campy, and not something that you'll remember for crazy plot twists or complex drama. But it's just interesting enough to keep you moving forward.  Rebel Galaxy has some sim-lite features, though not especially fleshed out. A player can disrupt a trade convoy, which keeps supplies low and prices high at a station. Or they can break through a blockade, and exploit the need for supplies to work towards becoming space rich.  Looking forward, this game provides a solid foundation for further features to be developed. I think this has a lot of potential to become an even better game, with deeper complexities driving the sim-lite features.  Really though, if you played and loved kill &amp; loot driven games like Diablo II &amp; Torchlight, or especially if you have played Freelancer or Escape Velocity... you need to buy this.",

Produced in a ridiculously short time, by the guys that brought us diablo, and then torchlight. Install's 2Gb, and run's so smooth even on a low end laptop. Has controller support, also (personally i love the controller controls on this title, well thought out, the commands are simple enough to just get stuck in). The controls overall aren't gratuitously complex. There aren't as many menus to cycle through as other games, and this doesn't feel like a bad thing, or that you're missing things. The combat is great fun. Winning or losing, it just FEELS good, with an awesome soundtrack to accompany it. Basically, in my view, while i enjoy say, elite, for a long term, 'sim', this is arcade. It's pick up and play, blast a few minutes out and achieve something. It doesn't have so much replayability for me personally, but for the 1 playthrough alone, it was worth every penny.

Other ships can go above or below or around you, but you're stuck on the surface, plunking away with broadside guns and the occasional turret. Homeworld's map screen alone has more maneuverability options than this entire game.

The game felt a little empty like there were other things that could have, or should have happened. The main story was also a bit too short and there's nothing really existing outside of that. Once I hit the end there was also no reason to further continue because I already had one of the biggest and baddest ships with most of the weapons being the top-line. There was very little that could stop me at that point so to max out every thing would have been redundant.  There's also lots of glitchy bits. Still I recommend this game because it's more about the music and the feel. It had a very cinematic aspect to it and I thoroughly enjoyed cruising through the stars and exploring.   In tribute to my ships:  Rasputin - Hammerhead  Fish Face McGee - Barracuda (The one I had the hardest time giving up cause it's agility made it dominant against all but the absolute biggest mothers)  Free Loader - Radovich  Lazy Jane - BlackGate",

Play as a pirate, smuggler, merchant, miner, mercenary, soldier or any combination you like!  The story is nothing to write home about, but this is mostly a space sandbox anyway. The game itself is absolutely gorgeous and an incredible pleasure to play. There are many different ship types to play around with and different weapon combinations to keep you interested for a good while. The little dinky tugboat you start out with isn't much, but it won't take you too long to throw some bigger guns on it and start slugging it out with the bigger ships.  Ship flight is arcade-style and takes place in faux-3D space: that is to say smaller ships like fighters and bombers (which you don't pilot) fly around in 3D, but the bigger ships, from corvettes to dreadnaughts, stay on a 2D plane. Ships have turrets and you can pick up a hireable strike-craft to help you out, but most of the firepower is concentrated in naval-style broadside weaponry.  Difficulty is mostly linear and is determined by the tier of your equipment, not the size of your ship, so you're not forced to play a huge, sluggish battleship if you don't want to (or don't want to save up for it.) Some people have complained about the 'risk estimate' for certain missions being a little inaccurate, but I haven't really had any issues with it provided I upgrade my equipment properly and am not afraid to bug out when the going gets tough.  Default soundtrack is great - a pleasureable selection of hard rock music that fits the tone of the game. You can add your own music, or replace the whole soundtrack altogether if you want. Controls are smooth, with the occasional futzing required with overlapping cargo containers (protip: use your targetting scanner to lock onto the container you want.) Graphics are absolutely stunning and the sound effects are top notch.  Definitely worth picking up this gem!",

I had a blast just trucking through space, retrieving and delivering cargo to different stations, outrunning or shooting bandits, earn money and upgrade you ship. Once I was ready to leave the first system I realized it doesn't really change.  It doesn't help that you have to do the 'grinding', side missions between the main story to earn money, to buy better parts for you ship or a different ship altogether so you can survive against higher level enemies.  I have an alright tolerance for this but got fed up after about 30h and just wanted to finish the game. It's possible I spend to much time in the first system(s) and maybe could have been more efficient to go to different systems earlier for more lucrative quests. Your mileage may vary.

Super generic quests, you can literally have multiple instances of the same quest. You can go ratting. You can go mining. Would not recommend going trading. Single pane (no up/ down) essentially no 3d movement in a space game??? Why??? Pretty I'll give it that. Broadsides are nice but its gimmicky. Sound track is good but it is a short soundtrack. So after the first hour or less you will hear the same songs again and again and again. Pointless. Targeting sucks. to interact with anything you have to get pretty darn close which is just dumb. Travel between quests takes too long, you can upgrade your travel speed but it’s still pretty darn slow. I want to like it but meh boring...",

Do you love the IDEA of piloting a massive battleship into battle, but can't deal with stupid 3D loop-de-loops? Do you just like pretty explosions and badass slide guitar music?  Then this game is for you.  It's a pretty standard space game setup-- fly around the galaxy trading, mining, fighting, what have you. Upgrade your ship, buy progressively bigger and badder ships, rule the world, and so on. The twist is that it all takes place on a 2D plane. Objects float around and ships-- especially fighters-- fly every which way, but you only have to worry about one dimension. The basic play is pretty much like Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. You hold down the button to charge a broadside, aim a bit and fire; hit your shields to brace for impact before taking return fire, and so on. There's a bit more, with turrets and different weapon types and hired mercenaries, but that's the basic idea. It's easy to get the hang of and fun to play. And, you know, it looks pretty, the soundtrack is great, and it's nice to have a third person view of your ship instead of trying to make sense of things from a cockpit view.  tl;dr: If you want to fly a battleship in space without wrapping your head around complex controls, this is for you.",

It's got a good economy system, AI is pretty good, seen better, but this isn't a triple A title by any means.   It's a great little game from a smaller developer.  Word of warning! If you really want this game to look good, AKA run it at max settings, it puts some strain on my FX6300 and R9 290. Both are overclocked, and running games like Fallout 4, Skyrim heavily modded, and ANNO 2070 (surprisingly a very graphic intensive game) I've never had a problem keeping them cool with air cooling and fans running throttled at 30% (Keeps the noise down). I had to release my fan throttle to keep my GPU from overheating running this game, it's pretty demanding on my GPU. So be warned for those with budget GPUs or lower end pcs, run this game at lower settings, or face the overheating.",

You can't even barrel roll for crying out loud! If there were 3 planes of movement, this game would have so much more depth. This does, however, work to the game's advantage since the combat is BROADSIDE SPACESHIP combat, so it takes away a whole layer of complexity. Do not go into this game thinking it will be a space combat simulator. That it is not. -Lack of a crew. This game NEEDS crew members, all with their own jobs and, perhaps, personalities. This would add yet another layer of customization and depth.  The only other thing that would've been friggin' awesome would be to actually build your own ship, but I don't see how, being the position you are in at the start, that would happen realistically.

You get to go anywhere you want at any point. The feeling of vastness of space is also beautifully achieved, without making the travel times to long.   The game has a lot of ships to updrage to and a lot of upgrades for these ships. The story could be better, but that is not what this game is about anyway. The combat system is excellent. There is great music and athmosphere within the game.  Now for some of the negatives, the most glaring thing that i am missing is an experience system either for the crew or the captain. This could have created another interesting dimension to the game. Also the fact that you cannot assemble a fleet isquite disapointing, (you can hire a mecenary but only one at a time).

Combining a the great atmosphere with a fun combat system with some random systems and a premade storyline, and you get a very fun game.

The game systems has some depth that you can use to your advantage, as an example I saw some people complain that debris can break your warping speed. But you can actually evade some of them by going around them, or even just shift to the side slightly if you are quick and skilled enough.  Combat is fun while not being to difficult to learn.

For 20 bucks I would say that this game is worth the cost and should get a best value award for the content that it brings to the table for the cost.  To sum the game up you are a called in by your Aunt to go to the nastiest part of the galaxy and you have to fend for yourself. You find a relic that you repair and eventually you collect parts to repair the AI's memory. The AI then decides to sacrifice itself for the greater good and that's how the storyline rolls.  As for the game play you'll find yourself warping throughout space fighting all types of spaceships and different situations which I found really fun to do.  The game has a high difficulty curve so be warned, this game isn't for those really really casual gamers and is geared more towards those who can think on their feet and react quickly to different situations. If you need to remember to press your scanning key which is TAB by default to freeze the game and analyze the situation.  I did 2 play throughs of the game one as a good guy and one as a bad guy. Both were pretty satisfying but it is really hard to be a bad guy. The storyline gears you toward being a good guy and to earn bad guy rep to actually enter their ports takes a long time. In the meantime you have to not ♥♥♥♥ off the civilians otherwise you'll have no ports that you can call your home and all you'll meet there is your end. No worries though missions will help keep your rep up so that shouldn't happen unless you get reckless.  The game also does not limit you in what you want to do. I skipped the storyline and worked my way towards the endgame before coming back to complete it. By the time I finished the storyline on my first run through I already had a blackgate that was decked out with MK 5 pulse turrets that decimated anything that strayed within their range of fire. On the second play through I bought a quick ship (the Icarus) and rushed towards the end game areas and did adrenaline rush dead drop missions for hundreds of thousands of credits to reach the end game faster which felt really satisfying to do.  Overall I loved the graphics of the game, it has a good soundtrack which you can make your own custom soundtrack as well, and the sound quality of the game is great as well. The only thing I am waiting on now to see if they will release DLC for the game or make a second sequel to the game which I will be more than happy to buy.

Its a nice feeling you can trade, you can do bonty hunting, you can help the militia or can even help traders that are in trouble. Thats quite fun.  In the beginning i found it wired to fly and shoot with almost 90° difference. Broadsides shooting the main weapons during fight. But ok, after some time its easy to handle cause the aiming help does work quite good. All the fights feel quite balanced. This is one of the biggest advantages. Broadsides fighting realy mad fun! :)   The only thing realy annoying is doing escort missions. Cause the warp flight is disturbed by masses like asteroids there are so often breaks and realignments during escort flight that just makes no fun at all.  I have an old graficscard and played with DirectX9 but the space looked quite nice with all that particles. Not the best but ok for that game.  you have different levels and different weapons you can try and use with weapons ports in your ship. you can buy ships bigger and bigger with more cargo space and more weapons ports. you can have special equipment. its all quite nice you can play arount with your ships spec.  The music i didnt like, but you can have internet radio. With good music the space traveling realy makes fun!  The missions are.. always similar, thats a bit boring but quite ok, cause the urge to play comes from ship customization. :)  There are standard conversions with traders and the like, they could have been removed. they seem unreal and always equal. but ok..

Upgrades for your ship don't come cheap and as difficulty spikes can be quite jarring you'll find yourself doing a lot of the same basic missions over and over again to get yourself up to snuff. The mechanics themselves are a joy, though, which really helps to ease this shortcoming and the moment to moment opportunities for profit allow you to choose between piracy, mercenary activity or just plain honest trade.  All in all, if you're looking for a space sim that will spoil you for choice, Rebel Galaxy is the game for you.",

Well, let's talk about that.  Pros: Fun, hectic combat Different ways to tackle a problem Trading system is fun The solar system feels lively Difficulty; some missions are rather challenging at points High production quality. SFX(including VA's) and GFX are both spot on. Good soundtrack as well. Naval style combat is fun and well done The feeling of being an outlaw(or not, if you so choose)   Cons: You really make the best money by killing stuff. By a considerable margin. This in itself is not a con but if you wanted to do something other than blow stuff up be prepared for the cash to flow in slowly. Difficulty; the difficulty ratings for a mission can be rather ambiguous. I found myself flying into dire situations thinking it was going to be easy. Maybe that's just me... I don't know. The entire game is 2D but fighters(non-Capital ship class vessels) and missiles move in a 3D space. This makes sense but is a con for me as I do prefer three dimensional ship combat. Story could have been delivered much better, especially in the onset of the game. Suddenly you are given a near derelict craft from a relative but I guess you graduated from flight school or something cause apparently you're a natural and know exactly how to handle this vessel. Now go kick some space outlaw ♥♥♥.  All in all this is a very fun game with a unique flavor and at this price point is a good choice for the sci-fi naval combat fan to have some fun.   Bang! See you, space cowboy.",

I was able to easily start playing this and get a grasp for how to survive and have a blast within a couple hours. I was originally turned off by the fact that you are pretty much on a 2D plane and it isn't full 3D navigation, but the game hides it well during battles and it really makes it a lot easier to figure out exactly what is going on in any situation without needing the added complexity of a 3rd dimension. It took me awhile to get used to the limited information provided by the HUD, but I definitely enjoy the fact that my screen isn't cluttered with useless information all the time. If you have bandwidth restrictions, this game is a surprisingly small download, and the soundtrack is fantastic and really makes you feel like a Space Cowboy. Two thumbs up!",

            "review_text": "Charming and addictive game. Yes its 2D space. There is no up and down flying. And the sytems are full (sun, planetes) but compressed in space. So there are traveling times, but they're not too long and nicely balanced, focussing more on fun and flowthen on realism.  Generally the flow and speed of the game is very very good.  Battles feel very much like the ship battles in Assassins Creed Black Flag. The 'Space' like a big, flat ocean. Additionally a freelancer like universe with many systems, multiple ships, in many sizes with different focus. Some only avalable from factions like mercenaries or trading guild. A large variation of weapons and equipment, boots, boosters, shields for different play and fight stlyes. Shields and boosters for example are not only different in hitpoints or speed but there are versions with completely different focus.  It's therefore nicely complex and flexible. And a smart buy/sell systems mean you can try without really goin 'wrong' or being punished for experiments. With possible problems, concerning difficulty, mentioned below.  Having finshed the Main Story: It's not a storytelling masterpiece.  But it's good enough, nicely presented, fully and professionally voiced, and leads through the first systems of the 'universe' and the factions in it.  Before i go to some details and little complaints, please keep in mind:  Its a fun little (its actually pretty big) game for a RIDICULOUS low price. Just dont expect a full 6 axis Space sim! It's a space based action game with strong freelancer elements in it.  I FULLY recommend it. Even for a higher price it would be a very good game! _____________________________   That being said :a few general remarks, only some bordering on complaints:  Like Assassins creed Black flag, which the fighting is CLEARLY inspired from, i find it a lot easier and more intuitively and precisely to control with MOUSE then with a gamepad. Both is available though, both works good.  My joystick (tm hotas) doesnt appear as option though.  After the Story there are still missions from boards to perform. Leveling up in factions to gain access to better ships. And trading. However for the trading the small selections of goods and the ship designs don't seem perfect. It doesn't really lend itself well to that. However i didn't really play like that so i might be wrong. There is a merchants guild in which you can level up, getting unique, trading focussed ships. But i think i can say, the focus of the game clearly is on the fights. And it excels in that!  The 100% system behind the upgrades makes it maybe a bit easy, as there are no hard choices to make. But it makes it also more fun to play. If you buy the wrong upgrade or a weapon you dont like, just sell it for the full price. No wrong ways, no saving money while flying with a weak ship, just to be able to afford something better later. I like that a lot, some might find it not challenging or complex enough though.  The same for the energy system. Basically nothing limits the size of shields and weapons in a ship. The only reason preventing you from upgrading hull and shields even in the smalles ships is the price. And the value of Damage absorption of shields, hulls, deflectors ( short period shields for emergencies) is the SAME, even in the smallest ship. If you put (you cant afford without cheat) a mk3 or 4 shield in your starter ship, you'd be immortal in the first systems. Heavy hull and Shields should be limited to big ships, given that they would consume more energy then a small ship can provide. Or provide less hitpoints in smaller ships. But they don't. I think that system would benefit from more complexity.  The mission log is too small. Should have room for a few more missions (quests). ________________________  Little tips from my experience, they're of course only MY opinion:  1.Mining lasers are op. They imho the best weapon ingame AND can mine asteroids (which isn't profitable enough as a main profession). They make good damage to shields AND hull. The other laser makes somewhat more damage to hulls but very little to shields. They simply make NO sense. Having a ship with all turrets mining lasers is (in range) the best. And you dont run out of ammo like with rocket launchers. small capacities of ammo make them near pointless. Disadvantage is the range, but i found my self that close to enemies all the time anyway.  2. In the first systems, in the beginning, as soon as you can, fly to the next system, even if it's too high-level for you to fly missions in, rush to a station, avoiding all fights, and buy the BETTER shield available there.  Even if you have to stick to cheaper wepons for a while to be able to afford it. Remember, selling those weapons later you get 100%of your money back to invest in bigger ones..  Then go back to the previous system where fights are MASSIVELY easier if you have that better shield. Every higher shield MK doubles the shields hitpoints. No matter how small the ship is.  The same works technically with weapons. Mining laser (and other weapons) MK1&gt;MK2 is a MASSIVE jump in damage (and a small one in range). But very expensive. Shield should be #1 priority. Generally: the jump in difficulty from the first to the second system is the highest. The first basically is an easy going tutorial system. 2-3 is also quite big. After that it's much less steep.  3. Fighting big ships: dont fly into their broadsides of course. Search dead angels and stick there, firing at it. Flying in its engine (does no damage to you) it can't hit you and you can fire. Discovering that made those fights vs capital ships A LOT EASIER for me.  4.Entering and leaving stations saves your game. Having a little detour between missions to do that is worth the time. Dying in the 4th consecutive mission, losing all you got from the last 3 can be VERY annoying.",

It's fun to feel godlike when firing 20 broadside cannons and killing ships that used to give you trouble in a couple of shots. This wears out pretty quickly though and I find myself wishing they would throw more at me to match the level of my ship.  Once the storyline is finished I don't feel there is a lot of replayability, there's no real 'other' way to play the game except as maybe an outlaw, which will severely limit the number of stations you can visit and missions you can take.  The positives, I think, far outweigh the negatives. As I said above there are plenty of fun customization options available to you and each battle needs to be approached with tactics in mind: lots of fighters? Stay back and let your turrets work and fire some well-aimed broadsides. Big badass dreadnaughts? Take down their shields and get in close so you don't have to charge your cannons up and take them down fast.

The enemies have continued to remain a challenge and there is always a chance that they'll drop some valuable cargo when destroyed, so that has helped keep things interesting and worthwhile. There are also quite a few different star systems to explore and each of them have a least some variations and new ships/upgrades which helps keep things fresh.

If you want to micro-manage every single shot fired from your awesome ship you can, or you can take control of a single specific weapon (EG: broadsides) and let the AI target and fire the others, without feeling like you are not doing justice to that particular firing solution.  If you are even just 1% interest in this game buy it. If you're not interested buy it, this is game you dont know you need until you play it.",

However, this is a game that I would not have initially considered, and it has turned out to be a diamond in the rough.  First, it is simple. It is naval combat...in space. Sure you can run cargo missions, or rescue missions, but in the end you will be fighting some faction, and it is simplistic in its approach. When I say simple, I mean it takes away some of the more complex aspects of gameplay and makes navigating and aiming the most important. Everything else is handled automatically or assumed for you. I like not having to think about complex aspects of a game. I like knowing where to go for a mission, and how much to repair my ship, and knowing that when I buy a new ship everything I previously purchased gets moved to my new ship.  Rebel Galaxy has done a great job in making a game fun to play, whether you are a hard core gamer, or a casual one.  I highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Brief: -------Very decent sandbox space shooter, full of charm and visually beautiful.-------   Pros:  The soundtrack is spot on, fits the bill to a T for all fans of Cowboy Beebop and the like. Fight the bad guys or skirt the law, it suits both perfectly.  Graphics are wonderful, the backgrounds are easy on the eye, the laser and engine effects are beautiful, and the asthetics of the ships, stations and other objects are up to par.  The atmosphere you get from jetting from one point to the next gives you the sense that its a lonesome place out there, and even though you meet npcs frequently, there's no way to shrug off the lone wolf vibe. Both good and bad, but certainly most of the time feels great.  Combat is tight. The whole game works on a 2D axis, which at first I thought would be missing a huge opportunity to give the space combat its full potential, but in truth it simplifies it enough that you never really get the feeling of being overwhelmed; it is straight forward, easy to master, and never really gets dull when you're fighting at your level or something tougher.   Cons: The NPCS feel bland. In over 8 hours of gameplay so far I've yet to meet any characters that I can say stuck in the memory or that I really liked. You could replace any of them very easily and wouldn't feel a loss of any sort.   The story hasn't got me hooked thus far, I don't particularly care about the objectives being laid out before me, nor the people who are integral to it. This could be because everything early game plotwise has been done many times before, the characters, dialogue and scenario all feel as though they've been lifted out of several other titles/stories the writers or developers have experienced and put together for their own project.  Occassionally travelling can be frustrating. Sometimes the large distances can be boring, though in truth adds hugely to the atmosphere of the vastness, so a double edged sword. However getting interupted from your warp because of misc objects is irritating, making me think warp lanes or shipping lanes might have been a nice addition.  I also feel the developers missed a trick not including simple add ons like being able to hire your own crew, making a diverse mix of aliens or humans to operate your ship, needing more the larger the vessel you acquire. It would have been a great opportunity aswell to put in some excellent personalities and vary up the dialogue during fights. That said, it would serve to remove the lone wolf feeling. You can hire your own merc to help out in the fighting, but can't really interact with them at all; no dialogue to get to know them or character development, just one liners from them saying if they're taking fire or going on the attack.  Overall: All in all, it is a brilliant and fun game. The lack of a killer story (at least early on) or solid characters doesn't detract from the fact that it is visually stunning and just flat out fun to play. I bought it the night of its release day and haven't really been able to put it down for wanting to get a better ship, better guns and take them into combat.   For those who love a space setting, bounties, smuggling and everything that goes with the territory, this is well worth the pricetag to kill some time. Better ships to buy, choose your own armaments and enhancements, join factions and improve your standing with them. Its a well put-together space sim.",

I've played a lot of space simulator type games since I first discovered the genre in the legendary game: Freelancer - all have fallen short of my expectations. This game however is the anomaly - the one that given enough time and attention could very well rival it one day in my opinion.  The biggest problem I originally had with this game is the fact you can only move on a 2d plane - I've gotten used to it and it isn't a big deal - it is part of the charm now. The other issue that I've found is with mining - it doesn't seem to be very profitable - though I've not tried it much since the starting system, I was always getting worthless materials with a few valuables mixed in. Trading was vastly more profitable and completing mission reasonably better - this means I never mine, which I find ashame as it could be interesting if it were more profitable.  Sometimes I think the danger levels given in some missions is a tad 'off' so to speak - doing a delivery of cargo mission with an 'average' to 'below average' rating and getting ambushed by what seems dozens of enemies - them ripping through my ship in seconds and dampening my engines so I can't escape or dictate the fight - after you've run a few of those types of mission, you expect it and are maneurvering and ready for it - isn't such a big deal then.  On the plus side - the music, it fits so perfectly, I'd like more tracks but the ones they have are really good. I like the fact I'm not forced to go down the main story line, I'm off in different systems doing different mission and buying bigger ships - that is the freedom I expect (but sometimes don't get) in open world games.   Combat is fun, the broadsides and turrets seem to be equally useful. The progression is great - though I find it a tad odd I can equip level 5 (which is what I'm up to) turrets/shields/engine etc on the smaller ships - surely they have to use more power or something? Meh doesn't really matter. All in all I'm very happy I bought this game and don't see myself stopping for awhile.",

It has a good wave between getting easy to frustrating and back to easy again, it doesn't fall off either cliff completely and I find the grind to be rather well balanced, which is an absolute must in this genra of game. A good perk to it is that the AI isn't derped or broken like I have seen in simular games (where a ship plants itself into a wall and doesn't get the IQ to turn around).  My only big knock against it is that the camera angles are at times borked out pretty badly, and requires its own learning curve to figure out and compinsate for.

So fight mechanics is like a sea battle. You have broadside weapons you have to aim with, you have turrets / torpedos / mines. You can also ram opponents with a special deflector (buy fast thrusters and a fast ship for that!). It is up to you to change the ship and fight dynamic and distance. + Nice music (you can set it to your own music if you wish). + Bright and colorful space. I know that this is unrealistic. But this is just the thing I wanted in X3 and the thing I've enjoyed in Freelancer. You can freely travel among a few systems with a warp jump drive. Driving during a warp jump within a solar system is cool! + The space exploration is a nice part of gameplay. Although, it's not very rewarding. You'll find some bounties, stations to be hacked, save a lot of miners from pirates (or the other way). But you won't be able to find any true gems / hidden space stations (the thing I've enjoed in Freelancer). + Trading looks nice. However, never tryed that. Just like the feeling that I could. Newsboards, station switching states. Lively (not very lively, still nice). + Pirating ability and 'change the side' possibility is also a nice part of the game. + Something original world setting. Looks a bit like Warhammer (edge of it) - you're trading with religious tracts! It's shame that they didn't say more about it.  - Few (only one) side quests. Quests from mission board sometimes challenging (take 'hard' and 'very hard' only!) but, you'd get dull after 20-30 of them. - You do not really influence the solar system state with your action. So.. No stategy here. I think it would be nice to take stations from one side to another and do some other sort of global things (like in Pirates or in Space Rangers / Seadogs). - Bad keyboard mapping and froms GUI. At least for PC users. At least during first 2 hours of gameplay. You'll get used to it and it would be OK after an hour of gameplay. In general, the fight controls are nice. But.... First, there were no presets for some important buttons, so I had to manually select some buttons. Then I changed the whole mapping since some of the presets were awful. Then I figured out that I am not able to use my Thrustmaster gamepad here (so what is 'full controller support'?). it took me 3 minutes to figure out how to close the tutorial message. It took me 2 hours to find the right spot where to click 'sell this good' in the commodities market. After 10 hours I've figured out that I can use arrow keys instead (which I set to do nothing in game settings), not with WASD keys (wich I used). After 3 hours of gameplay I've figured out how to use map (press 1 and use the mouse wheel). After 17 hours of gameplay I've figured out that there is a menu when you're in space where you can switch between missions / cargo (here's how one drops the cargo!) / AI turret preset (wow! but still this wheel widjet works strange). And it turned out that I can change pages only right to left. Not the other way (there is 'Esc' button assigned to it wich should change the page, but closes the window). - One button to rule them all: collect cargo with tractor beam, warp jump, receive incoming hail, close windows. Everything is done with holding the same button. Most of the time it's ok. But I hate the moment when I want to collect that damn cargo and talk to the pirate instead (for 10 times in a row, having him in a long range). Or want to jump and hear only 'the ordinance is full'. - Buy the I still do not understand how to sell ordinance. Took something in the beginning of the game and now I cannot collect any more and sell it. I do not use rockets / mines, though.  So, this is a nice arcade game. If you like arcade games that took place in space, you'll gonna enjoy it. If you prefer solid-like games (like X3 or Elite) - than you'll probably get bored at one point.",

            "review_text": "Rebel Galaxy is a sandbox space sim from two of the guys who brought you Diablo, Hellgate: London, FATE, Mythos and Torchlight, Travis Baldree and Erich Schafer. After so many years working on isometric action-rpgs, the pair cooked up something a little different. Rebel Galaxy is a tale of space cowboys and pirates set on the fringes of known space. Your aunt Juno Markev has asked you to come out to her neck of the woods to help her out with something. And I'm not saying its aliens, but it is definitely aliens. The flavor of the setting has been compared several times to Firefly, and I'm inclined to agree. The ships are scratched up and very spartan in design, there are bandits, merchant caravans and lawmen, and combat is up close and personal, accompanied by a blusey hard rock soundtrack including Blues Saraceno's 'Evil Ways'. But Rebel Galaxy differs from many space sims you may have played before in two very big ways: one, the entire game is on a 2D plane. You steer your ship with the left stick and aim your guns with the right, which brings me to the second big part- your strongest guns are mounted on the sides of your ship, which I should add, is no mere snubfighter or freighter. No, you begin the game with a corvette, and purchase increasingly larger and better armed ships all the way up to a fearsome dreadnought. The biggest fights are close up, harrowing exchanges of cannon fire like you were in an old pirate movie, or more accurately, the Harlock series. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is it fun. Some reviews I've read have knocked this 2d plane element, and I can understand where they're coming from, but I think it lends Rebel Galaxy a certain 'space is an ocean' feel that only helps the overall premise. One particular reviewer said something along the lines of 'it might as well be about truckers in a desert' which, upon reflection, would be a pretty badass game too. At any rate, you can also have a number of turreted weapons including ballistics, lasers and missiles, as well as a secondary weapon like auto-tracking missiles or fighter-disabling EMP flak guns, and you can designate auto-targeting priorities for your turrets so you can focus on firing your broadsides. You can hire a mercenary gunship to back you up, loot, buy and sell commodities at the station markets or with passing merchants, pirate said merchants or defend them from other raiders, take side missions, hunt for bounties and pirate lords, break blockades, mine asteroids, and join merchant or mercenary guilds. You can also outfit your ship with various specialized subsystems that allow you to, for example, accurately target incoming torpedoes or convert missile damage to your shield into more shield strength. Your actions affect your reputation with the citizenry, the militia, and various pirate factions, A series of story missions take you from one side of the sector to another, and each mission, main or side, is marked with its 'risk level' allowing you to judge whether to take it on your take some time to upgrade your equipment first. In some ways, Rebel Galaxy is a bit barebones. I played it for almost 40 hours and enjoyed most of it, but you will see most of what the game has to offer after the first 5 or so. From that point on, its mostly about buying bigger ships, more guns, and fighting larger groups of enemies. The side missions, as in any other space sim, are stock 'go here, shoot this, escort that, collect this' affairs that quickly begin to loop. Thankfully the combat never feels stale, and though you a lot of time early on in warp travel, you can buy faster warp drives as you progress, eventually rendering travel times completely non-annoying. The plot is not nearly as epic as say, Freelancer, but it serves its purpose. If you believe that any time spent grinding is time wasted, then Rebel Galaxy might not be for you, but if you see some grinding as a part of the experience, and enjoy space sims or shooters, Rebel Galaxy is worth your time, especially for the price.",

The soundtrack really gives the game a 'space cowboy' feel to it and I never tired of the music even after hours of gameplay. This game is worth the money.  That being said, there is plenty of room for improvement. The main quest thread, while intruiging, fell a little flat with characters that I never really bonded with and an ending that felt... unfinished. The systems blurred together into a sort of 'sameness'. It never felt like I was anywhere new and other then slightly more powerful ships to fight, I never really needed to know where I was anyway. With all the ovious beauty, color, and art talent on this team, I was suprised not to see more planets and variety. Where are the habitable worlds? What about gas giants and ring planets? Where are the location descriptions on docking that make me feel like the places I visit have some personality? The ships, on the other hand, were done very well though, each felt artistically distinct and I enjoyed the variety. It would have been nice to have some variety in mechanics though. The weapon selection was somewhat limited and I didn't feel like I had to carefully equip my ship to survive. You either outleveled your opponent or not. I ended with an enormous capital ship, which was cool, but found I had no fighter bays. I found myself limping across half a galaxy while fighters far from my reach fired a stream of engine crippling torpedoes at me.  In closing, this game has great potential. But, it could take a few tips from old, relentlessly addictive space trading and exploring games like Ambrosia's 'Escape Velocity'. Factions that matter would be nice to see. Factions with territory would be nice to see. Planets and space stations with some location information would be nice. A greater variety of technology, that you actually have to work hard to unlock would be super! How about some alien weapons? Cloaking? Or alien ships? How about the ability to board and capture ships? Have your own fleet? Dominate space stations and make them your own? How about... every once in a while... when your ship VASTLY outclasses some random bandit that warps in to fight you... they hail you and show a little damn respect?",

However, the lack of story and dumb (though often hilarious) AI may turn people off, and I wouldn't blame them.  Controls seem tight enough, once I got used to them, and the lack of a z axis to move in is fine with me. It allows for some tactics, such as hiding behind asteroids to regroup and attack the enemy, that I otherwise feel I couldn't easily pull off if the enemy could easily move above or below me (I'm talking the main ships, small AI fighters don't have this restriction).  I don't have a huge amount of time to play games, so the simplified but tight combat, and decent upgrade system for the ships - who doesn't love upgrades? Nobody important, that's who - make this game enjoyable and relaxing. I've only really gotten blown up once, and that's because I was stupid.  So, tl;dr:  Pros:  + Combat, simple but nice, more like 'boats in space', but not necessarily a bad thing. + Upgrades. Everybody loves upgrades. Wait, you don't? The heck with you, you don't count.  Cons:  - Story. Wish there was more to it. - AI. I both love it and hate it. Hell, it was an enemy ship bashing into his bro and finishing him off that was one of my highlights of my gaming week. At the same time, it keeps the game from feeling as immersive as it could.  In conclusion, the gameplay is nice, but the story will likely make the game boring after just a little while. However, it's a fun enough ride so far that I'll give it a thumbs up.  Take care, everyone, and Pew Pew! ",

To start off: If you're expecting a full-fledged space sim, this is not it. I would liken it more to a naval battle game. In space. With lasers. FRICKIN' LASERS, man.  And it. Is. Fun. Though it's not a super long game, it will still keep you entertained for quite some time. I have about 56 hours on the books at the time of this review and I only just completed the game. Keep in mind, though, that I took my time, did plenty of side missions, and have hunted down more pirate kings than you can shake a stick at.  The graphics are pretty good in my opinion. Good textures, pretty explosions, fairly well-designed UI. Nothing much more to say about them.  The sound though, or more specifically the soundtrack, is FREAKING AMAZING. Honestly some of the best soundtrack music I have had the pleasure of listening to. And even better? They're all *.ogg files in the game directory so you can easily add them to your favorite flavor of music management software. The music significantly enhances the game's atmosphere and gives it a nice Firefly-like vibe.  The controls do take a little while to get used to, and can still be a bit testy at times. However, once you do get used to them, you'll realize that things are actually relatively easy to control.  I would say it's already worth the standard asking price, but if you can get it on sale you'd be silly not to pick it up.",

I just barely made it through the game, I lost interest at one point but then later I came back to finish it.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not all bad.  I got really taken by the trailer, the music, the 'Really decline' - option. Turns out, when you see the trailer, you have seen all of it. There isn't that much music, not at least that good. And there aren't any real choices to be made in the game.  All of the sectors you visit are more or less the same, each has the same guys fighting eachother. Even one that shouldn't have any people in it, because you are the first one to get there.  And that moves me to the biggest letdown I had. None of the game makes any sense. I'v had Traders being attacked by the militia, which is supposed to be protecting them. I went the mercenary route, taking missions from the mercs was so random. There is no way to tell who you are defending and who is the enemy. One mission, you might be helping the pirates that HATE you everywhere else and protecting their dreadnaughts from a butload of trader frigates that have almost no weapons. Well, more free loot for me, since the trader ships are loaded.  Which leads me to what the money and loot buys. The weapons, there isn't really that much to do. Each new level of weapon 1 -&gt; 6 mostly just increases the damage the weapon. Ships are a bit different but nothing special. There is only one ship for each price range, meaning that ships don't have variants.  The game really takes it's toll when you grind for that necessary ship/equipment to finish the main storyline. At the end, the game kinda suggest to you that maybe you should continue playing just to grind equipment. My immediate reaction was to exit the game.  Oh and the story is nothing exceptional. I'll not spoil it any more, but don't expect anything grand. It's as bad as the story in X3.  Ships are good looking and the combat can be a bit fun, but shallow.  Should you buy it?  Yes if you are looking for a simple space shooter game with some progression. 20 euros is not that much, afterall. If it were any more, i'd say no. If you want something more, no. Don't waste your time.  I hate to say if I recommed this, but I would not recommend it for myself, since I like complex games with lots of depth and tweaking. So no, i'm not recommending. But it doesn't mean that you won't find it worthy of 20 euros.",

Depending on your ship the battles can be tragic losses, but if you can find the weak spot on your enemy vessel you will be victorious even with a puny, weak, little ship.  This game has some pretty cool and unique features that can be extremely beneficial if you choose to use them.  Trading and merchanting being the biggest feature that can be overlooked in the game. If you know the Solar System you are in well and can make trips to and from stations you can make a killing in the market in a few simple hours. Well, with a little luck too, I suppose. Merchanting isn't essential to the game, but it can help you get from 10k to 1M in a few hours if you know what you are doing.  You can become friendly with pirates while maintaining your ties with the other factions. You can try to be enemies with everyone.  The storyline is a bit lacking if you try to drive straight through it.  That's why I jump from story to the open and expansiveness that is this game.  It's ADD with a purpose. If you don't want to go on missions and follow the story you don't have to. Fly around space blowing up anything and everything you can and selling off the garbage that you don't want to keep for yourself.  I think I put in something around 60 hours in this game and I would gladly do it again. Why? Because in 60 hours I didn't visit every Solar System in the game. There are places that I just never went to simply for the fact that I didn't need to visit that area. There are so many side quests that you could play 100+ hours doing nothing but side quests and missions. I personally wouldn't, but you could if you wanted. I prefer chasing down Pirate Lords and killing them for bounties. Bounty hunting can be pretty fun, too. Saving every merchant that gets in hot water can be a bit of a pain, but it's worth it if you're not in a rush.  Seriously, I enjoyed this game and I think you will too.    -pro- Tip: Each enemy ship has some sort of blind spot or weak area you can exploit. If you're just starting the game out and want to take on a bigger oponent try different angles of attack to see if you can deal damage while avoiding the majority of enemy fire.",

You grind missions to get money to get better ships/parts. Move to next system that's a bit harder and do it again. Somewhere in there you do a story mission. That's about it. The story is fine, but also nothing to write home about, nor is it surprising. There are NPCs you intereact with and a couple guilds to join, but the ineractions are bare bones. You do missions for reputation and eventually they like you enough to buy some faction specific ships. There's some economy stuff in the game, but you can safely ignore it for the most part, unless you absolutely must sell your loot at the highest prices at all time. It's faster to just pick up more missions to do. You fight your way through the main story anyway, so going out mining seems more flavor than a thing you're intended to do.   I'd like to see more complexity in the systems of your ship. You get bigger and bigger ones, so having to manage some crew could be a welcome layer of complexity. You can set the gun AI to fire on targets based on ship class, distance and, etc, but it's really not been neccesary.   I'd be into a Rebel Galaxy 2 if they add more complexity to the base systems.

Has all the elements of ealier space PC classics yet with the graphics and game play of a modern AAA game. There are no load screens when landing and you can travel to objectvies without long, meaningless flights through empty space. So its fast to play and you get up and running very quickly.  The combat is really good - fast and challenging but with a good balance of auto-systems and manually controlled weapon systems. It gets the balance just right. Upgrades have an immediate noticable impact and you can choose the upgrades to match your combat style.  The mission story is fairly simple - but its interesting and nicely paced.  Overall an excellent game and for the sale price this is an absolute bargain!",

            "review_text": "So no more running; I aim to misbehave. - Mal, Firefly  I had this game on my wishlist for quite some time and I honestly couldn't bring myself to buy it. I do enjoy spacey-shootey things, but that whole 'it's kinda like naval warfare' gameplay was not really convincing me. So it was on sale several times, and every time I saw that 'game on sale' email I was like 'yay' and then 'oh, rebel galaxy, hm'. Finally, a few days ago I was so bored that I thought I'd give it a try, keeping in mind the lenient return policy, so what could go wrong?  Well, for starters, I was wrong. This game is more fun you than I could have ever imagined, especially for that price.  But let's begin with the cons, since that is always what I like to read first. While the graphics are really nice, the character models are sub-par. Then again, they might have invented cloning in that universe, so it might be perfectly natural to have a gazillion space stations with the same bartender. or he's working more than other people. Bartending doesn't pay much, after all, so yay for realism.  It also is a bit of a grind to get started, no way of cheating your way to a better ship. While that is not necessarily a con, it does mean that you spend your first few hours desperately trying to find a station that buys yourt goods for the highest price, or you do missions which dont pay that much in the beginning.  My last issue, if you can call my ♥♥♥♥♥ing that, would be that I truly and honestly miss a way to see which turret is placed where on the ship, because you might end up buying something super duper heavy hitting laser gizmo thing, and then you wonder why you never see it firing. Well, you might just ended up placing it underneath your ship, and since not many enemies go there (they better not, the buggers), it's not of much use there.   Now, the whole game is so much fun, I ended up playing it till VERY late at night, something I rarely do, simply forgetting the time. Want to be a fighter for good? a pirate? merchant? all of these? well you can, nothing is ever set in stone and you can more or less do what you want. trading is done well, a stations have fluid demands and you can't just always buy and sell at the same stations. 'Events' kind of help you plan a little, but not in a gamebreaking way. . So that keeps it interesting. Fights are fun and not always easy even with good weapons, sometimes you might need to run from them and come back later when you geared up. Special drops sometimes give you that edge you need, some special weapon or gear you cant buy, also a nice touch. The whole ship/speed/damage/defense whatchamacallit is easy enough to understand, but complex enough to keep it fun.  But while the game as a whole simply works and is super entertaining, the soundtrack is the real selling point here. You constantly feel like you are part of the firefly 'verse' and boy, they just nailed it with it. Also, if you don't like it, though you are clearly weird if you dont, they let you use your own music to listen to while you blast huge dreadnoughtships to smithereens.  Rebel Galaxy is one of those few examples of bought for ten bucks, would have gladly paid fifty.   ",

That said, I will say it's difficult to select targets (with the controller), and easy to get overwhelmed. It took some practice, but after awhile I learned how to pause and select, making it more fun. Do follow the warnings about danger, however - sometimes you have to run the hell away.  The best thing so far - however - is the alt-country soundtrack. The guitar rears up in combat, and calms down as you're just exploring space.",

The game is very good, it looks good it plays reasonably well. I don't mind the 2D setting, since it would probably just be a mess in full 3D, like som many other space-games. The story is excellent and even if the ending is a bit on the low key, it does seem appropriate. The game itself gives you different ways to live your life. You can be a priate, a stickler for the law, or something inbetween. I will raise a couple of points on the negative side though. The game is based around fixed values in equipment. In other words if you have hull plating absorbing 10K damage, it will be 10K damage no matter what size ship you have. Same with weapons, and shields. This means that having a natural progression up the available ships gradually increasing in size, is in fact a terrible idea. This sice all your are doing in buying a bigger ship is making yourself a bigger target. If things scaled with the ships this would be a good idea, but as it is it's not, just find yourself a fast ship with good amounts of ports, and upgrade the equipment to max, and you're set. Second negative point is that once you've done the story, there really isn't much to do, the sandbox in which it is set isn't very varied, same type missins with the same type people. However don't let these things discourage you from getting the game, since it is still awsome for those 30-40 hours it will take you to complete the story, which isn't bad for a game these days.  Pluses: Playstyle. Graphics. Awsome Soundtrack. Good storyline. Freedom. Pasting aliens with your guns.  Minuses: Static values for equipment. Limited play after completion.",
