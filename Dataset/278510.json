            "review_text": "Personally, I'm a huge fan of score attack games. I love trying to best my high score from old arcade classics, to music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. However, I've never been a huge fan of space shooters, nothing against them I just don't religously play them. That is, until I got Judgement Silversword: Ressurection. This game is fantastic in my opinion. Great controls, great music, great graphics (for what was a WonderSwan title), great gameplay, and fantastically optimized for even the crappiest of PCs. This is definitely worth the $5 I spent on it, and it's definitely worth your time and money too.",
