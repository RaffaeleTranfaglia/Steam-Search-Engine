    "description": "Rustbuckle Rumble is a side-scrolling, team-based, arena combat game - WITH ROBOTS! Inspiration for the mechanics was taken from classic run and gun games mixed with more modern, class-based, multiplayer shooters. It’s capture-the-flag where the players are the flags.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  -This game is fun as hell.  -The art style is fitting and in my opinion enjoyable.  -The classes despite some TF2 inspiration are mostly unique in their own right and have very strategic uses.  -There is a unique death system where enemies have to drag your carcass back to their base and throw you into a scrapping machine before you can respawn (and run off) in order to gain points. This makes the mechanics surrounding death and gaining points more interesting than just about any other shooter. (As well as leading to some comical situations.) I wish more games would be inspired by this mechanic.   -There is no mouse use and the shooting functions much more like a classic shooter, which is a nice change and controls well.    Cons:  -Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. This game has the worst netcode of anything I have ever played. This game should have released in early access because its netcode is beyond broken. 99% of games will lead to nonsensical disconnects in matchmaking and custom games, the 1% of games that do work will generally lead to either everyone jumping around the map due to lag or the enemy team will quit when you are beating them.   -There are no options to party up with your friends in matchmaking. You can only play with friends in custom games which will never work, and you will barely see any listings. The matchmaking is automated trial and error and at least succeeds some of the time. So in short if you do download this, expect to play by yourself.  -There is no chat box anywhere. In lobbies to determine if a host is AFK and promptly yell at him for being the host of the one game you could actually connect to, or in game to co-ordinate strategies with your team.   -You cannot invite people to games in progress. While this in a way is a good thing it means players wont fill places when someone rage quits, or if you enter a rarely functional custom game and someone starts the moment they see another player join the other team then too late! You're stuck playing by yourself without the friends/anyone you planned to play with.   In Conclusion:  Extremely fun when it works with massive potential, but whoever is behind the netcode deserves to be shot. This game was not ready for full release and they have probably killed their long term player base by releasing the game fully with the multiplayer in a multiplayer only game in such a downright unacceptable disgusting state.   If the developer has the competence to actually fix this I would highly recommend playing the game as it can be brilliant, but so far (10/05/2015) the only developer responses regarding this issue have blankly said 'we're working on it' with absolutely no eta on when the issue will be fixed with zero public announcements regarding the issue.    TL;DR: Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ed and rarely works, nobody knows if it will ever be fixed, otherwise really fun game, check it out if the multiplayer gets fixed.",

Getting friends together is key to having the best time, but playing with strangers is still a blast. The mechanics are solid and interesting, while the art style is unique and charming.   Play it for some casual MOBA fun with buddies over drinks.",

            "review_text": "This game is not my cup of tea. This is my take on the game;  Pros-  1. Interesting way to win- you have to be carried back to the other base, makes spawn killing much less attractive 2. Free- No need to sink money into it. 3. Fairly active developers  Cons- 1. Some pretty bad controls. Unlike most 2d platforming shooters, you don't aim with your mouse. You aim wherever your character is pointing. Makes the game very difficult to learn, and even harder to like. 2. Very little variation- The maps seem very similar, just a few platforms to jump around on. On top of that, all I've seen are the two free to play characters ever played. No one else. 3. Matchmaking is slow. It takes way to long to find 6 players, and half the time someone leaves and doesn't get punished for it. 4. Not the best graphics, although I don't actually care that much.  tl;dr I personally don't like the controls, and the matchmaking is bad, and there isn't a whole lot of class variation. Give it a try though, it's free.",

The developers have combined mechanical elements from games like the Smash Bros series and arcadey 2-D shooters, and polished it off with a nice clean graphical style, akin to something like Team Fortress. In a first play through, the game may seem a bit simple, but the joy of the game really comes in the way the various classes can be utilized for great teamwork. In particular, I feel like there is no better feeling than chain passing the scrap of an enemy back to your base JUST before the player can respawn. Snag the scrap with the sniper's claw, toss the scrap farther along with the big spikey guy, and then dash the scrap into the base just before it respawns with the ninja character. Feels good! There's actually a fair amount of strategy and complexity there for the players that are willing to dig in and discover the nuances of the classes, and how they can interact in the game.  Some reviewers have talked about connectivity issues, but I haven't had any problems at all. Played plenty of games.   I think there's some polish that the game could afford in the future, but it's absolutely worth playing right this second. Recommended!",
