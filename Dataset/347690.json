            "review_text": "With the newest update, 1.4.0, i finally feel comfortable giving this game a solid positive review. Before the update, i was not on the fence as to weather it was a good game or not. It still is and was a good game, with amazing support from the developer, who actually gives a damn about his product and the people who purchase it.   However, the game felt a little lacking. I felt less control than i would have liked. I dont mind hard games and challenges, but i also dont want to feel cheated by the limitations of the simplicity of the game.  That is where the beauty is in this one. You can tweak the settings to suit your gameplay style. The developer gives you the option to make this game your own. With each update, he doesnt remove options for the player, he just adds more and more.  speaking of this most recent update, that is what got me to write the review. I saw the update note and thought it was going to be the much anticipated player editor. While that will be an amazing addition when it eventually comes, this update was a welcome surprise for me. Adding the sprint option to speed up gameplay and really let me use the open pitch and give me the ability to get around defenders was wonderful. Then also adding the 'easy' dribbling control to go along with it, so that it was really my doing when i lost the ball to the defense by being sloppy with turbo or passing was the icing on the cake. I feel like i lose or win now based on my actions on the pitch. The first touch is noticeable, i dont feel as though the defense is stripping me of the ball nearly as often as before, because i can turn and run.  Notes:   -This is a hard game, easy to pick up and play (especially with friends) but difficult to master -This game almost requires a controller to play, but the controls are tight and responsive -There are still some improvements to be made, but the arrow is always pointing up as this is clearly a passion project that deserves the support of anyone who is interested.  If you are a fan of the classic soccer/futbol games of years past, this is a title you must pick up. With a developer that gives great support and is always updating and improving the game based on suggestions from players like you and I, This game feels fresh and like its improving on a successful formula. I can now proclaim it is a great game.",

            "review_text": "I felt a strong sense of nostalgia with this game. It brings me back to some of the old soccor games I have played on SNES and arcades. I actually was very happy that it had controller support. The game mechanics are basic and easy to follow. I do think the price point is a bit high, and would be valued closer to 9.99 or 12.99. Overall though I do recommend this game for the amount of work that was put into it.  ",

            "review_text": "So far this has been a lot of fun. It's simple, but something about it hooks me in. There are a few issues though, specifically around the lack of a practice mode, no multiplayer, a lack of details for how to pull off any other moves (if there are any, i.e. banana kick) and most frustratingly, the difficulty spike between easy and normal.  On easy, with natural dribbling on, I win 10, 12 to nothing and can outrun opposition players (the run button seems to work). Obviously, there isn't much of a challenge at this level. I change the difficulty to normal and it seems even the mechanics change. I can no longer run / out-run opponents, they close me down every time and stick to / dispossess without fail. I can try a passing game, but I encounter the same problem as above, quickly closed down and I don't have (or know of) evasive maneuvres.   This difficulty spike, where elements of the game world seem to have changed to increase the difficulty (i.e. run no longer works and the opposition is faster than all my players), is the biggest problem at the moment. Sure, I may get through it as I've still won at the normal level, but that the easy mode doesn't really prepare you for the normal mode (run vs. No run) is disappointing and ruins the experience a bit.  I'd still recommend the game, but with the caveats mentioned above.",
