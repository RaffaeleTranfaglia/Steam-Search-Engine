            "review_text": "Data Hacker: Initiation is the first volume of three already released games in the same universe (last one's in Early Access). I must say since the moment I saw this game on Steam it intrigued me and I ended up buying it. And how I enjoyed it, the story is solid, with a few 'loop holes' here and there, a Matrix-like tale of a world that is destroyed beyond hope with Humanity escaping to this Online World, an escape from the apocalypse. It's a typical RPG made in RPG Maker and one con I share with Data Hacker: Initiation is the use of some default tyles from the program, but nevertheless, the soundtrack is quite good and fits into the various scenarios you'll encounter throughout the 14-15 hours of gameplay. I must say, if you are looking for a RPG to play, this is the one to go with, being low priced and all. I have initiated my progress, onwards to being corrupted.",

            "review_text": "Starting up the first of the three episodes of Data Hacker I have,  theme of this RPGMaker is Refreshing, quite unlike the standard RPGMaker game so far. Roleplaying a Roleplayer in an online Roleplaying universe. I could only be impressed by the plot.  Standard skills, tp and mp system, thoughtful to accumulate tp after battle, unlike some RPGMaker which resets after each battle. Extra Card game similar to Tetra Master,  not too hard, a test of prediction and counters of Attack/Defence of cards, additional grind for cards for achievements.  An Arsenal of loot items, weapon, cards and skill types.  Hacking of enemies, turning them into companion or items. Unique. Many campanions to choose from and decide to put in action.   Only issue so far is,  the graphic looks stuttering while movement around. Walking speed is rather slow, preferably faster speed walk by default. Occassional losing menu access in the chicken runs, do make regular saves to prevent losses.    So Far, I am impressed with the game plot,  although too repetitatives, a huge grinder of time and effort for achievements in preparation to import over to Corruption. Some may like it, some may not.   Could try.  Data Hacker Trilogy included in the Reality Studio package.",

The graphics look very nice, and it's obviously not stock assets. Intro is annoying since you can't skip it - but it's only about 2 minutes, so you can go grab a soda in the meantime.  The storyline so far reminds me of Sword Art Online's storyline - Only as a real game. It's personally something I've wanted ever since I watched the series.  I got this on sale for 49 cents, and even at the price of $3, I'd still gladly pay that.  I do reccomend buying a SNES controller for the PC, as that would make this such an amazing game.  Please, if you have the money - Pick up this and the rest of the series - You won't be disappointed.",
