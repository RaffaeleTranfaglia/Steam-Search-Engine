            "review_text": "Retaliation... another mislabeled, short, Unity Personal Edition indie game that is nowhere close to the 'horror' genre as tags would suggest. The game is littered with problems that will most likely never be fixed, but hey, at least it went from the dollar bin to free in May 2016, right?  The store page for this game doesn't really give much of an indication as to what the game is about, so to put it clear and to the point: drugs. Teenagers and young adults taking drugs, to be more exact without spoiling anything. You're a nameless guy who has been kidnapped, and you wind up in a 'strangely familiar' town. You basically go around in a large circle, visiting all of the locations marked on the map, and solving small puzzles at each one. After each puzzle, more of the story is revealed. Though I believe that you can complete the game without even visiting any of the locations except for the last one. The entire experience lasts roughly an hour, but that's only due to the fact that it takes ages to get from one spot to the next.  The voice acting is awful, but that aspect is the least of the troubles that Retaliation hosts. Aside from jumping framerates, there are terrible texture flickers, popping textures, some of the worst mechanics imaginable, and controls that make it feel like you're moving a ten ton boulder instead of a human being. Climbing stairs is a monumental task, nearly impossible really, and you have to jump up any set of stairs in order to make it to the top; like this guy cannot even climb one single stair, I'm serious. One of the puzzles in the game is bugged. You footsteps keep going even when you stop.   Short and simple, Retaliation is another Unity Personal Edition indie disaster that tries to pass itself off as horror even though it has literally no horror elements whatsoever. I did enjoy the Bioshock reference on one of the posters, though. The game Morphine comes to mind actually, it has the same basic premise, bad assets, and hazy graphics, but even that paid-for mountain of garbage is better than this title; they're both bad, however, so don't go buying Morphine because 'Belphegore said it was good'. Anyway... just avoid this one in lieu of an actual horror title. If you're looking for a free, good, horror game, check out Cry of Fear.   Rating:  1.0/5.0  - It's Bad.",

            "review_text": "Retaliation is a short game, by far. I thought the story, and overall environment of the game was pretty good. That being said the overall experience is really brought down by the amount of bugs, or poor design choices made with the game. That being said I don't think its bad enough to NOT like it. From the description it says its some sort of student project, so it could have been the 'first game' made for these devs. I don't know, but I think if mystery/ horror is something you like, and you don't mind rough gameplay, or indie level game development you might enjoy Retaliation now that it is free.",
