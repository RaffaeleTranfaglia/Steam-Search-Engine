            "review_text": "When compared to one another, the two genres that Rhythm Destruction tries to meld don’t initially appear to be in any way compatible. But when you look at both from a distance, the similarities become readily apparent. Rhythm Destruction takes the reflexive nature of both rhythm games, a la Guitar Hero or DDR, and attempts to mix it with the frantic pace of a top-down bullet hell shooter. Both genres require quick reflexes and the ability to memorize extensive patterns to succeed, and together  could  come together to craft a satisfying culmination of two otherwise disparate styles. Unfortunately, Rhythm Destruction is  not  a quality example of what  could  be an exciting new alternative to the more standard rhythmically-inclined titles.  Rhythm Destruction looks like a standard bullet hell game when played, but rather than face insurmountable odds in the way of thousands of pink death pellets, you typically only have to worry about crashing into obstacles that  you can’t shoot . In order to account for the rhythm aspect, your ability to freely fire upon enemies has been removed entirely, in favor of specific button presses timed to the beat of electronica style music. This means that you’re often forced to maneuver through miniature mine fields of enemies and obstacles that would have taken mere moments to obliterate in a typical bullet hell title, all because the game decided that  these  enemies were not worthy of a rhythmic tap of the x-button on your gamepad. Failing to end an enemy that  did  earn that right may stick you in an unavoidable head on collision with them, reducing your limited life pool. Some of these issues, I could forgive, if only because the point of both genres is to test your memory as well as your reflexes. But your inability to freely deal with the limited enemy force isn’t my big problem with this game.  The best rhythm games are separated from the rest by a very, very particular gameplay aspect that many titles, like Rhythm Destruction, just don’t get, and that’s player feedback. Looking at a title like Bit.Trip Runner, one of the most satisfying things about doing  well  in that game is the emphasis on your actions and performance in relation to the music. Acquire collectible pickups and increase your score while avoiding death results in an ever evolving music beat, as does performing the correct action add a note to the rhythm. Failing to perform adequately affects the music, and furthers the desire to be absolutely perfect. This is an example of rewarding feedback for the player, and provides a driving force to continue against ever increasing difficulty. RD does not have this. Hell, it doesn’t have any feedback aside from a score counter. And that, beyond the button taps that don’t quite sync with the music, or enemies that you can’t kill, is what kills any enjoyment I could have had for this game. Failing to hit the correct button results in a loss of score, or, if you’re in a narrow hallway, the loss of a life, and that’s it. The music never changes to fit your actions, and in a game  about  keeping a beat, that is unacceptable.   While RD is poor example of variety in a couple of stagnating genres, I love the idea it presents. I can only hope that the concept is picked up by another developer.",

            "review_text": "Ok. I've played a lot of rhythm games. This looks completely different. First of all - do NOT look at it like it's a regular shm-up. I's not. Rhythm Destruction is a shm-up inspired rhythm game. Like your regular OSU or Guitar Hero but with difficulties: you got to dodge stuff. Not 'bad notes' or 'gray blocks', more complex stuff like enemy attacks/platforms/enemies themselves. I've checked only couple of songs - not my kind of music, but they were ok. If the devs are interested in marketing - wait for tons of DLC's from different indie musicians (I suppose). Achievements are great. Ingame challenges are great. They make you raise your skill. You can't just 100% the game in 4 hours. The only things that I'm not ok with is the keybord controls. They're a bit sloppy for me. (Will check on gamepad. Does it support gamepad, by the way? :D ) Not a diamond, not a must-have, but a fun little game that may become a gem if polished well (I mean: ADD SOME MORE MUSIC IN DIFFERENT GENRES, WILL YA?) Cheers!",

            "review_text": "Rhythm Destruction focuses more on the dodging side of shmups, and subsitutes a rhythm game sort of method for actual shooting.   It would be a lot more fun, if there were a lot more of each. As it is I feel as if I am either dodging or doing rhythm, and it seems rather simple and slow paced.  The music is pretty generic and uninspired as well.  I cannot recommend this game, unless you're really like rhythm games and shmups.",

            "review_text": " While somewhat sounding like a good idea to mix rhythm and bullethell shmup, this genre blending felt like it was here just for the sake of it being a mix of the two which I don't think was successful.   There are no sound effects aside from the very small turbo boost you can use. I understand I have to listen to the music for the rhythm part but in the case of it being a shmup that takes away substance it already lacks.  All you're really doing in this game, even at the much later levels, is moving around a bit to not die with your only method of attack is to press, at the right time, the shown button prompt that move around with the enemy ships. The prompts don't come around too often to feel like I'm keeping up with anything. It's like it's all actually just an extremely easy rhythm game but they merely slapped dodging bullets &amp; not crashing just so they can say it's part bullet-hell shooter which accounts for it ruining the exerpience for me.  I don't think rave music like the ones here work for this game but that could just be me. Though I found that much of the artists here have a tendency to get fancy and like to put additive rhythms in some random spots.  Though I'm a bit of a sucker for rhythm games I can't find enjoyment out of this.",
