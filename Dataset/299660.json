The game is perfect in what it tries to offer. The music is calming, the graphics are simple, but fit the need of the gameplay perfectly. The difficulty increases slowly throughout the game, though never gets too difficult at all. The story and the way it is told reminds me of Thomas Was Alone, which is also another great game.  The only negatives I can think of are that it's a bit short, though the price makes it worthwhile. And I wish there were more difficult levels to go through. Definitely pick this one up if you're in the mood for a casual platforming game that will challenge you but not make you scream.",

Took about an hour to complete, but there's also an hard mode which i haven't tryed excpet for the first level. It's a short but powerful experience and it's cheap. Worth buying in my opinion, really solid.",

            "review_text": "This is a small minimalist platformer in which you guide the Moon in quest of finding the Sun which has stopped shining. Main mechanic of the game is that there are no borders; screen just wraps around. Whereas in other games falling into the abyss would kill you, here you just emerge from the top of the screen. New things are introduced when you progress throughout the game such as spikes, breaking blocks and moving platforms. Game has 50 levels which are distributed into 5 areas in solar system; when you finish them in order to complete the story you need to go through them once more, this time in reverse. Gravity is also changed to keep the game less repeating, it takes a small time getting used to falling upward.   There is a small story presented and consists of moon chatting with some planets and the Sun itself. Dialog is nicely written, you can easily imagine planets as real persons. It reminds me of Thomas Was Alone in this regard, too bad there isn't more of it. Game does not overstay its welcome, it will take you about 1.5 hours for completion.",

However, I am disappointed in 2 aspects of the game:  I read that it was short, but I'd never have thought that a game could be THIS short.  I was in this game for 96 minutes and beat it. Those 96 minutes include probably somewhere between 15-30 Minutes of inactivity.  Jump-motion not sensitive. Basically you jump the same height every time, and I feel like the jump is way too quick &amp; powerful from the getgo. I was expecting movement more like low-gravity-style, or at least the possibility of doing this regardless of environment, which is not the case.  Conclusion: I did not dislike this game, but I didn't feel it either. Still...considering the extremely short playtime, I clearly can not recommend buying this for full price of 3.99€.",

Sadly what I encountered was a bright idea tangled in a total mess.   +The game has a really clever twist on platforming. +The idea of being the Moon, traversing Milky Way is really unique. +The music has an eery, empty space feeling. +It looks really unique.  -Extremely lacking in content (finished it in 80 minutes). After beating it, it unlocks a mode where you can play the stages the other way around (last-&gt;first). No time trials, or user generated content to keep you interested. -Occasional lack of response to my keystrokes, or response to keystrokes that never were. -Twice I got stuck in thin air and once more somewhere I could not see me. -For some reason the 'W' key decided to stop working halfway through, forcing me to switch to arrows, 3 levels after thinking it was a deliberate game mechanic. -Infuriating platforming and extremely lacking on the 'puzzle' part. Some extremely unforgiving levels, which felt unfair. I almost ragequit 3-4 times and would have if this game wasn't so short. -Stupid timed puzzles, completely out of sync with the music, making timed jumps a massive pain. These were some the most infuriating levels. -The music loops too much, becoming boring really fast and annoying even faster. -I had constant screen-tearing, no clue why, my PC is more than capable of running this game. Combined with some extremely fast changes from 'black with white spots' to 'really bright dark', I currently have a headache.   Overall, this game is a personal disappointment and feels, above all, like a wasted oportunity. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless (s)he's really interested and it's on sale.",

I don't care much about graphic in games, I certainly don't need 3D and high res, but this is just not good art, sorry.  Platforming? Well, there is one nice idea, but even though the game is short, that idea is done to death by the end. Level design is mediocre. Nothing astonishing at all. Compare it to any good platforming game (in any subgenre) and this is just worse. Additionally the mechanics are clunky and in general the whole thing feels rushed.  Story? Yeah, there is something resembling story. And it's the worst part of the game. It seems to be a story for kids, but it's sooo badly written...  To sum up - I really wish I didn't waste money (not much, but still) on this game. It seemed nice in the TB video, but it's not. It's not a good platformer and it's definitely not (good) art.",

This creates a wrap effect which can be used along with other mechanics as an interesting way of solving puzzels. The $4 dollar price tag is also another sweet point of the game. I really reocmmend this game for a late night time where you are alone and have some time to kill for some puzzle solving action.",

I enjoyed my time with it, following the cute story and listening to the relaxing music. The visuals are nothing fancy, but the gameplay is. The only way I can describe it is like this: think Portal - the top of the screen is the blue portal and the bottom of the screen is the orange portal. So falling off the platform causes the moon to just fall from the top of the screen, gaining speed in doing so. This adds a certain charm to the game that makes it so much more enjoyable than the average platformer. Unfortunately the levels are not too hard, and there are only 50 of them   (though you do unlock a reverse mode on completing the game)  , but overall the game is worth playing.  Enjoy! :)",
