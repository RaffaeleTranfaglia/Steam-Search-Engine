Its wildly addictive and honestly some of the most fun I've had in a game for a while, and I intend to play much more.   This game makes me feel like I'm sitting down for a single player DnD game with the dealer as sort of a 'dungeon master', laying out the adventure for me to go through. There are a lot of stories to be told that keep fairly short but interesting, and will occasionally result in combat. The combat of the game isn't amazing or revolutionary, but I find it fun and enjoyable. I'm into hack and slash style gameplay and this game does it well enough while not overstaying its welcome.   The combination of RPG, card game, adventure with some roguelike elements mixed in, come together in Hand of Fate to make an outstanding experience that makes you just say 'One more round'  Pros: -Unique genre -Strong and interesting atmosphere -Fun stories and adventures -Competent combat system -Several different weapons, armor and accessories to unlock -Strong difficulty(Starting at about 4 hours in) -Nice ambient soundtrack  Cons: -Occasionally Janky animations -Flow of combat can be somewhat awkward     Buy At Full Price    ",

            "review_text": " One line verdict:  A very pleasant surprise, mixing light combat with rpg, and deckbuilding elements. Grab it if it sounds right, because it is.   Pros:  - Excellent and fresh concept: The mix works well, giving the player some of all worlds.  Marvelous  voice acting: Top notch and plenty of commentary from the GM. This is how it should be done. - Gorgeous graphics of the cards and coherent one within the 3d-fighting world. - Well written cards with sometimes alternate texts, the perfect amount of reading required. - A real chance to influence the random elements of the game when you draw one of four cards that were shuffled. - Plays really well with PC xbox-gamepad controller. I recommend using a gamepad for this. - It's fun! Yups, that counts...   Cons:  - Feels little too easy the first 3-4 chapters, but becomes harder, and that's in the very start of the game. - Lacks adjustable difficulty settings, but makes that in part up by having an eternal mode. The game is geared towards the casual leaning to intermediate player or the experienced ones searching for some fun and well paced action. Hence, this doesn't have to be a con. - The combat system could possibly have gotten an overhaul for the more demanding players: It's somewhat too simplistic even if it is indeed challenging in it's own right. Feels too static now despite the fact that this wasn't ever aiming to be the next Arkham et.c. - When the shuffle is done it is sometimes impossible to understand where the card went mainly to how the shuffling is represented.    Want:  - Workshop support: Let the community create custom cards and/or campaigns. The game will never die then and keep getting followers. - DLC:s - this game has way more to offer within the already established framework. I'm certain that those who enjoyed it will want more of it.",

The fact that the developers have been regularly updating it with content -free of charge- is an enormus bonus. I am sure this game had like 3 content upgrades since I've bought it, that other publishers would have tried to sell me as DLC.  I must admit; the story ending is sorta lack-luster. This usually wouldn't even worth mention in a rouge-like game, it's just this game builds so heavily -and well- on narration, that I found it weird to end it in such way.",

            "review_text": "Hand of Fate has a very unique approach to action RPG. As the player, you will find yourself sitting at a table and across the table you will find a robed individual with rather large hands. This masked man has plucked and manipulated your very memories in order to set the stage. Cards are used to construct levels, provide gear, health, or pain. Part story, part combat this game brings both worlds together to give the player a interesting taste of the characters life through the dealer's eyes.   The player progresses through the game by moving from the starting position to the stairs, cave, boat or basically the exit point for that level. With each move the player consumes one food. If you do not have food than the player loses 10 health. Each move delivers a new encounter for the player as he lands on a card. These cards are determined by what cards were included by the player and the cards added by the dealer. There are more player cards than dealer cards for the campaign. The encounters can be everything from rat men, humans, skeletons to an old woman that asks the player to bring her husband home.  The combat system is rather simple. Counter green indicators, dodge red ones and use shield bash to get past their block. Melee is confined to one button and feels semi fluid. Weapons and items will give you special abilities, but it appears that only weapons will influence combat. For some reason if you do not have a shield you will not be able to see when to counter or dodge the enemy. With each boss run feeling slightly different, it improves the idea of playing more or even endless mode.   For additional details click the link below!

When you are really unlucky picking all the failure cards, and the dealer's ending is challenging, by challenging i mean the dev. just added all the best bosses into the fight makes it hard and you can't go through easily, really annoy. but a fine game overall.

            "review_text": "Hand of Fate is a rogue-like-like. It has randomly generated 'dungeons' with random beneficial and detrimental events and effects that either help or hinder your progress.  The story mode: - gives you a short, multi-level dungeon to defeat - with the boss of the dungeon being the major goal. - Can you find and defeat this boss before you die? - If so, you win and are granted access to the next story mode level/dungeon/boss.  The endless mode: - is very similar to the story mode, except for three main things: - First, it never ends... there's no final dungeon floor with a boss on it, and you just keep going until you die. - Second, you have no control over which cards are included in the deck - they all are, including the ones you hate. - Third, every floor grants some sort of curse or other detrimental effect that will usually follow you for the remainder of that run - better hope it's just 5 hp damage or something, which you can generally recover from quickly, and not some intense curse that affects food/gold acquisition.  As you succeed at card events, you will unlock additional cards, including new equipment, new card events, and new bonuses. In this way, even though your blessings/curses/equipment/etc. don't carry from dungeon run to dungeon run, you do progress. You are unlocking a deck, much like opening a booster pack in a trading card game. It's a fun way to progress in a game that otherwise focuses on each single challenging run.  Is it worth buying? I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, and honestly, I can see myself coming back to play this for years to come. I don't like buying games at full price, but if I knew there'd never be a deal on this game, I'd probably buy it. I see it as a must have for any fan of rogue-like-likes.  Oddly enough, it reminds me most of FTL (Faster Than Light), the rogue-like-like where you pilot a spaceship attempting to avoid and eventually defeat the evil fleet that wants you dead. FTL is another exceptionally good game that deserves your attention if you enjoy rogue-like-likes.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so this game is REALLY unique and cool. You play as a recently-deceased man who has passed onto the afterlife, and is reliving broken memories of his life in the form of a card game, played against a mysterious hooded figure known only as 'The Dealer.' The game's cards correspond to various memories of the man's life; trials he may have endured, enemies he may have faced, and the items and powers he may have wielded to vanquish his foes. Don't be fooled, though; this is definitely NOT a card game. It is more like a text-based choose-your-own-story adventure game, interspersed with hack-'n-slash combat encounters. The cards you possess on the table manifest themselves as equipment and abilities in the combat portions of the game, which are crucial to being able to take on the enemies you will face.  The combat encounters will seem very familiar to anyone who has played the Assassin's Creed or Witcher games. The flow of combat follows the same attack/dodge/counter system that players will recongize from those titles. The real brilliance of the game comes from the sheer replayability. You're dead, after all, so the Dealer is perfectly content to sit at the table and play cards with you for the rest of eternity, and once you get the hang of the game, you might be, too. Matches take the form of multi-level dungeons, the floorplans of which are laid out face-down on the table, using a mixture of cards chosen by you, and by the Dealer. As you win matches, the dungeons become longer, harder, and more complex, but always different. Winning matches will earn you new cards, which equate to new weapons and armor, stronger powers, and even persistent quest-lines that you can explore or replay over the course of multiple matches. As you become more skilled, though, the Dealer will become increasingly frustrated with your success, and throw even harder obstacles in your way. Despite there being only one fully voiced character in the game, the Dealer's voice acting, model, and animations are rich and full of character, and you may even find yourself reveling in your rivalry as much as he does. Overall, this game is a solidly designed, well-polished, and unique experience that any mortal would be pleased to devote the rest of eternity to.",

Missing a chance to earn a token is heartbreaking, mostly because you don't know what little nugget of the game was just pulled out of your grasp and how you could have used or played it in a future game run.  The game isn't without its issues, and most of them are related to combat. Using a controller just isn't an option for me personally. It doesn't feel right. But nor is the mouse-and-keyboard combo ideal, given you're restricted to just the eight cardinal directions. But pulling off a serious combo is still satisfying, and ultimately, the combat system is just a vessel for the greater card-dealing system, which is the meat of this game. Combat, ultimately, is passable. It doesn't bog the game down.  Oh. And the music. Yes, that music.",

Im a fan of RPGs in general, and have dabbled in numerous other genres of games. This game really fulfilled that desire for something different. As described by another review ..it's hard to describe. A card game with elements of RPG...but not really.  Each hand dealt is different. The gear and encounters change with each hand. It is a little addictive in a sense. I absolutely love that I can sit down and play for a short stint (like 15-30 Mins) and feel very satisfied with the time spent playing. Unlike most RPGs and other.....it doesn't require a huge commitment of time to enjoy.  It is worth every penny of under $20, and I will now be looking forward to seeing what the developers have planned for its future.",

It has a splash of rogue-like elements in both how each of the levels are constructed but in the cards themselves as there are ones that will reshuffle level that you are on. Along with the rogue-like, it has elements of D&amp;D in it in the stories behind the enemies and the stories that can be unravelled in the cards themselves through the game play. Plus like any good D&amp;D session you've got a dealer who would like nothing more then to see you fail spectacularly and you need to have a little luck in your corner if you want to make it through.  I can only hope to see the developers continue to work with this game and make more DLC for players.",

Maybe it was a hasty purchase during a sale, maybe it was from a humble bundle, maybe a friend gifted it to me. However it got in my library, I'm glad it did.   This game is a hybrid roguelike and card game. It sounds like a weird combo, but it works well. Your path through the dungeon is randomly laid out cards on the board. When the card is flipped over, sometimes you'll have to battle a monster, figure your way through a short story or even play a mini game. Many cards have a requirement, once you meet that requirement you get a token that unlocks more cards for your deck. Each time you play, you add more and more options for future games.  Some of the cards, however, rely on chance. I personally don't mind that but I know some people might find that offputting. The monster battles are in real time, which is cool. They're a bit on the easy side, however. Those are minor gripes, if you like roguelikes or TCGs or both you should check this game out.",

Once I purchased this game I was greatly enthralled by this game. This game is wonderfully unique in its style and approach it is a 'build-your-own' adventure game while still granting a level of unpredictability. However it isn't just a point and click esq. adventure game you partake in the adventure and are in complete control of your 'hero/adventurer'. The game is pleasant and there seems to be a story but, it is subtle and as you continue to dig it is slowly revealed by mysterious and cryptic host of the game. As seen so far this game scores well with me. I enjoy the ever changing adventure and it provides a subtable challenge on the more advance difficulty and does do well to ease you in and educate you on how the game works and the rules. Another great part is that nothing goes your way everytime and sometimes you just have to buckle down on it. However there are a couple of things which I feel could be improved upon. One of which is the ability to quickly and easily create a predictable pattern on every level set, but as the host of the game leads the story on it does somewhat mediate this issue.  That is my only issue with the game but, even with that the replay-ability is very high and the sub-mission within the game itself it exciting and enjoyable. I would highly recomend for someone looking for and adventure game that is different and unique and has a story that is mysterious and engaging wanting you to continue and dig deeper.",

You build your own deck of possible encounters, some are more diffacult than others, but can offer a great reward. Something about earning new cards excited me greatly. As I played through I've found that the randomness tends to fade away; not that it's still there, but more, if you leave the same encounter card in your deck you start to realize what options to choose in order to get the greatest reward. But it's all in your control for the most part so really that's up to the player.   Also, the wizard man gets his own deck. This will add cards to ♥♥♥♥ up your day. Rediculous cards that will make you want to cry. But without the wizard man there is no point in building your own deck to make you as powerfull as you can.   That's when luck starts to take effect. When it seems like all you do is run into the wizard man's cards, you won't be able to build up equipment on your character as easily, or at all. I've made it a few floors without gaining any gear.   However in the end the wizard man's cards, your cards, and the choices you make as you crawl and battle your way thrtough the floors creates a very rewarding experince.   8/10.  Also they seem to add some free stories/cards to play from time to time. So it's hard to complain about lack of content. Good on the developers, eh?",

Basically its one button to punch and one to block one button to stun and one other button to dogdge. I enjoy this because its easy to understand and easy to pick up on and it looks really good for the most part. The game has a deck of cards and you have a piece that you move around the cards. Differents cards have different stuff inside of them.  So for instance a card could contain a weapon of some sort after going down a ravine. The game is very well written and the guy who is the dungeon master looks and sounds great. So for fighting its sometimes one card and sometimes its 2 card with enemies. Sometimes its a boss plus more enemies. However fear not because the game gives you power ups.  Via armor and weapons. Some have fire and some have stuns. Also you can get poisin for weapons or stuns or sometimes you can get the knife card that flies in 8 different directions. GOod stuff. I really like the graphics of this game even the fight scene are enjoyable. Watching that slow motion final death blow to an enemy always makes me smile. Even more so if its a boss that I kill.  You can also re arrange the deck or have the computer do it for you. If your wondering how to change the gameplay like I was. Go into the deck building part and click on the middle card and here you can select different cards that can change the game rules its also comes in handy for the dlc. I am playing the monk card right now.  So graphics are very sharp looking, sounds are good. My complaints about the game are few. Sometimes you can get a lousy hand and either die because of bad drops or no food. I am halfway done with the game so it seems like it might be a tad short. Maybe around 12 or 15 hours long? Perhaps less it does have an endless mode.  Some on the forum have complained of the game being too dark after they switched to the newer unity engine. I have not had this issue and they did roll back the changes but some are still having issues. The fix right now is windowed mode.  My only other nit pick is sometimes the traps are a real pain. You fight in rooms and some are small and some are big and loaded with traps. It does hurt the bad guys as well however. So thats fair. I am having a good time with the game and I really enjoy it. One more thing the developers seem to be very active on the forums and seem to care so thats a very good thing.  A fun and unique game. Most games last around 10minutes up to 20 minutes or perhaps a little longer. Not super long. Buy it and you can thank me later.",

The Meh:  -Random card generation that leads to very different outcomes every time you play, you could end up with a pain card that may cause you to lose alot of heath or cripple you early on and make it very difficult to finish a run. -Combat is Arkham-like in which you fling back and forth between enemies and all too familiar counter system, its not as good as Arkham and a bit button mashy, but it works. -Kinda lacking in options, but hey, its a Unity game. -Encountered a small bug in one of the merchant shops where i'd pause the game and when i came back, my cursor was gone and i couldn't select anything...luckily i fixed it by alt-tabbing.   Overall:  An Early Access success, its nice to see a game come out of that hell hole and bring something very unique and special to the table.

The set up of 'randomized' events set up on uniquely simulated dungeon maps and illustrated through card play is spot on.  This is also one of the few games that is absolutely delightful when played in endless mode. It is almost as if the developer started out crafting a game based on endless mode, and put a well made story mode in to pull it all together. That combined with the just-long-enough, but making-me-beg-for-more, pacing of the main game makes for an excellent experience.

It doesn't focus on the 'Trading Card' mechanics in the fashion you normally see in alot games where cards are the biggest driver behind how the game functions. The cards instead allow you to essentially fashion your own dungeon, allowing you to play the way you want to, with the 'dealer' (AI) adding in his own cards to spice things up. Rather than a coin-toss or RNG for encounters where something is handled outside of combat, you are given the choice of 4 cards, Huge success/failure or normal success/failure, with the number of each varying between different encounters (for example, 50/50 success/failure or 3/1 failure/success ratios). The nice thing about this is that, for players with a fine eye for observation, you can actually watch and see which of these 4 cards land where, there is also equipment that will highlight one of the failures in these 4 options.   Its...KIND'VE akin to a boardgame, but at the same time it is also a third-person action RPG. Whenever you come upon an encounter that requires you to fight you are dropped into 3rd person view with all the gear/bonuses you have equipped. Combat style is akin to a mix between Fable and Assassin's Creed. Dodging heavy attacks (which become far more frequent as you get into harder runs or further in endless mode) or countering when a marker pops up over an enemy's head. Despite the heavy 'telegraphing' (icons/warnings when an attack is incoming), combat doesn't feel as simplistic as it is in Assassin's creed, where 90% of all fights can be won by simply waiting for a counter then pummeling your enemy while he is stunned.   Recent updates/free DLC content (as of the 5th of March, 2016) added numerous extra encounters, equipment and certain 'profiles' for lack of a better term (the exact name for them escapes me now). These new 'profiles' offer both unique challenges and bonuses for playstyle. For example, there IS an 'easy' mode now, where you gain substantial bonuses, but many achievements will not be accessible while playing on that profile. Whereas on the 'hard mode', you gain an increase in counter attack damage, but combat moves far quicker, enemies do more damage and you start with 20% less health. One last example (of the more 'unique' profiles) is 'merchant guard'.   Throughout each 'run', players can earn gold coins to gain food (1 food per movement restores health, each time you move WITHOUT food however, you LOSE health), this can be refilled in encounters or at shops littered throughout. One of the profiles requires you to go to each and every shop on the board before you can move to the next part of the board. While shops offer everything cheaper, you ALWAYS have to fight before you enter the shop, and ambushes are far more frequent.   Overall, I feel it is a refreshing change of pace from many RPGs on the market lately, that being said, I will decline from giving this game a 1-10 rating, however for those that are looking to step outside the norm, but love fast-paced combat, I would highly recommend Hand of Fate.﻿",

If you like gamebooks (esp. fighting fantasy series), you will like this game, and if you enjoy RPGs I highly suggest giving this game a chance. You play as an adventurer who has to defeat a set of bosses that are like tiers of each other, but not really in a way making it repetetive. You collect cards that make up the game and put them in the main playing deck and basically yours are meant to better your chances, and the dealer puts in cards to make it more challenging. Its amazingly fun collecting the cards to unlock new encounters and the dlc is actually a rare dlc that does in fact give you something new, it adds cards that change the rules from the start which makes it a LOT more replayable.The artwork is GREAT, like I mean really, really good and the fights sequences gain a lot from that. I esp. like the tomb/crypt area when you fight undead. The real only negatives are that the fights can get a bit boring, but not really such a big deal....another thing is a pretty annoying bug that causes background card shuffle noises (pls fix!!!!) that drives you mad if you don´t restart the game lol. All in all great, unique title worth its money with innovative ideas and solid gameplay I rate 9/10",

            "review_text": "Hand of Fate is a game I've been seeing around lately, hearing a lot of solid words from trusted sources and fellow gamers, and of course some harsh criticisms, which is to be expected, but the one theme that keeps popping up is that it is addicting as hell. Combining elements from card games such as Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, board games like Dungeons and Dragons, as well as RPGs like Skyrim, Diablo, and The Witcher, this game has all the elements to be the meth of gaming, a blend of a lot of different things making for a hell of a drug, but is it fun? Let's find out, shall we?    Gameplay: 93/100 A-  As I mentioned in the intro, Hand of Fate is a mix of a lot of different things, taking the best aspects of each and nearly seamlessly melding them into one, a feat that is hard enough to do separately, let alone flowing from one to another, but it is an achievement that Defiant have successfully done. Playing through the cards and planning ahead with equipment, magic, traps, all the standards that you can find in other card games, but then the RPG side comes in a bit as you can trade with caravans, should you draw that card, and finally landing on the combat, which is fairly simple to get used to. Attack, blocking, countering, all can be done and the game does flow like water over river stones in the spring time.   Audio: 94/100 A-  The sound effects and music is also done very well. It was never intrusive or overwhelming, Calm when it needed to be and action packed elsewhere. The voice acting has to be the crowning jewel here, where listening to your 'trainer' felt real. For example, leave the game playing during a turn or when picking cards, he may start babbling or criticizing you for taking too much time. It's an organic feel that I really welcomed and made me chuckle a few times. The combat sounds and ambience is also very well produced, a solid effort on this end.   Visuals: 94/100 A-  Hand of Fate is good to look at, even at the lowest settings. There is of course clipping issues here and there, but I feel like that's going to be an issue in gaming for at least another generation and a half. Anyways, the colors are all done well and placed in logical locations, things look like they belong as well as drawing inspirations from all the genres that are mashed together in the game: medieval fantasy, gothic dark ages, D&amp;D, it all comes together quite nicely, giving Hand of Fate a distinct style.    Content: 95/100 A  There are a LOT of cards to play with here, easily competing with other big dogs in the market, both old and new, couple that with the other elements of the game and you're into a lot of replayability, but with that also comes some repetitiveness, and while the latter is annoying, it is also expecting in a game that uses themes from other games which rely on such a large selection of options and randomness. But the game works well together, keeping me interested even when things became repetitive. It is something you come back just in case that awesome moment happens this time around and you get that ultra rare thing you've always wanted.   Design: 96/100 A+  Like I said, the game flows very well together. Everything is done in moderation and not one aspect of the game overwhelms or overpowers another and I think that is the key to Hand of Fate's popularity, despite the often complicated genres that it takes inspiration from. A testament to Defiant's understanding of the multiple elements they've taken from.   Performance: 80/100 B-  Now we get into the issues I ran into. While the game itself is brilliant in combining everything together, the technical side of things are a bit choppy. Again, this is from my experience on my machine, got it? The biggest issue I had, first, involved the Steam overlay glitching and remaining on the screen when I took screenshots. Another issue was often times during the loading of the combat scenes took ages to load, often making me think that the game had frozen, only to come alive suddenly. There was some detection issues with the combat as well, but that could just be my suckiness at said combat. Not to mention glitches here and there bugged me in many ways, but the game is good, so I just learned to ignore them and kept going.   Verdict: 93/100 A-  At the end of it all, you can't deny the strokes of brilliance in Hand of Fate. The developers picked and chose the right things from each genre melded them together, where they would be most effective and instead of falling flat, it stands tall, albeit a little shaky with a lot of polishing needed, it is still a great start. The potential for this game is through the roof.",

However I have very much enjoyed it thus far, building a deck to try and unlock new tokens can be very rewarding providing you succeed. The combat as everyone knows is almost identical to the Arkham games, although I do find enemies don't hit just hard enough early on to prvide any sesne of victory per fight. As you beat each section of the game certain enemies will gain permenant buffs but you also gains buffs, this will probably make end game fairly tough yet rewarding to those who persist.  The game for me runs at an almost constant 60FPS with a few hiccups here and there during the dealers card transitions but it's very minor. Button layout and responsiveness on an Xbox 360 controller is well done, I have yet to try the keyboard and mouse.  As I said above my only issue so far is that the game doesn't seem just hard enough despite it being a card game/Arkham fighter. I would reccommend this game at full price (£18.99) to anyone who enjoys the Arkham fighting style, to everyone else I'd pick it up on a sale as combat is a big part of the game.  Currently I would give this game an 8/10",

I've just finished playing this for the first time and i felt i must immediatly add my two cents:  What an amazing game. Yes people are complaining about the combat but i find it acceptable. Having never played Batman (which is what it is being compared to) I cant complain. It works.. they either patched it since the complaints or people are just overly picky about it. The only thing that bothered me though was the camera, it just doesnt feel right sometimes.  Combat problem aside. The rest of the game is amazing. The Dealer is voiced so well he makes the game for me. Along with the cards themselves, the stories they tell hooking me in.   I still havn't completed the story yet, I've had some really bad luck on some of the runs. There is enough game here to keep me coming back. Infact ive spent 9 hours on the game and that was all in one sitting. I still have a lot of cards to unlock and even when that is done, there is endless mode.  There are enough variations in enemies to keep the combat and draw interesting.  In one run i was doing really well and was on the last floor, after a very hard struggle of ups and downs id finally made it to within one square of the boss tile. All i had to do was defend myself from an ambush by a falling log 'Easy enough' i thought.. but then the draw. First enemy 'Queen of plague' .... 'well atleast it cant get any wo..' second card 'Jack of plague' ......... Needless to say that run ended there. But i laughed at my misfortune and moved on with the next run.  Pros: Narration is A+ (I just wish there was more but even the repetative narration isnt a bad thing.) Cards tell wonderful little stories. Variation of curses on each boss dungeon to keep it challenging. Game of chance/skill with picking the right outcomes. Random runs Simple combat. (I personally think a complicated combat system would take away from the rest of the game.)  Cons: Frustrating at times when the luck goes against you. camera angle in combat (very minor issue personally)",

For me this is not a problem as I enjoy the challenge, but for those looking for a game you can just walk through then you're probably not going to play to the end.   Something that came as a big and very welcome surprise was the storytelling. Which is told by the dealer who'll comment on everything that is happening. At first I thought that this was going to be off-putting after a while. But even now 30+ hours into the game I still want to hear everything he has to say. Through cryptic and vague pieces of information the story is revealed to you and it feels great to gather up these tidbits of information. The voice-acting is spot on and the amount of different monologues are huge.   As for gameplay there is a good balance between depth and simplicity. After a while you'll learn what encounter does what, but there is still a random element to each encounter that you as a player can influence. This lends to a big increase in replayability since even though you encounter the same stuff the outcomes will differ, and so will your experience during each playthrough.  The game looks good as well. While the graphics are not AAA they are certainly conveying the feelings that the atmospehere in this game needs to flourish. It also runs very well (at least on my computer).  Overall when it comes to atmosphere it's where this game shines the most.

It brings back the old pen and pencil D&amp;D memories and it is brilliant fun. its simple to grasp and so far hasnt been diifficult to progress, however it is hinting at more complicated gameplay and decisions to be made later down the line which i am looking forward to, such as as having enough food to explore the dungeon/scenario versus just try and find the exit. I really like the change in gameplay between making slower decisions and taking a random pot luck (dice roll) on choosing a card, to using skill in faster paced combat. the combat, is so far, a somewhat simplified batman/shadow of mordor type where the character can block and counter attack (equipment dependant) as well as using special cards that have been chosen.  It isnt without issues, the intro video has some textural issues and after using the steam overlay in game i ended up with a letter box display, however none of the issues have been for me game breaking. The actual gameplay however has been bug free so far.",

Some may be a bit disappointed that combat isn't turn based, but as someone who usually also prefers turn based games, I feel that the action based combat works in this games favour.

You get cards to build a deck and that is then shuffleded along with the layout of events placed along for you to traverse by picking a direction and going there. Different cards can be weapons and items, or monsters and events that can give you bonuses or negatives. The combat does feel weak at times but at other times really satisfying or even stressful.

Well, I am a lazy geek that enjoys procrastinating and well, do nothing. In this case, I really need to say a couple of things:  I bought this game on a whim. I liked the concept and the music in the trailers sounded cool. The price was just right for my 'I buy a new game on steam every month' thing, and so I did.   This game brings back memories of old. The soundtrack is awesome, our opponent is awesome as well and the replayability is absolutely tremendous. Everytime you play, it is a different game. You don't quite understand if the card dealer is a friend or a foe, maybe both, but you'll love him for it.   It is as much as an RPG as it is an Adventure game and well, a card game as well. You keep playing, betting on your luck and mixing it with micro-management and you'll eventually finish it all. It's not as easy as you might think though, you need some combat skills as well. The game is not all about playing cards, you do need to fight your way through various combat situations, which is cool. The combat system reminds me of games like Batman, where you need to counter enemies attacks. Of course you'll need some nice equipment and nice equipment you get throughout your gameplay session. Never the same mind you. The bosses - yes, there is a boss for every 'playthrough' - are hard enough, but you'll probably won't find any real difficulty, unless you've been real unlucky in the past like getting robbed by goblins of your food and pieces of equipment, or even a tough unfortunate card you've chosen that made you lose life etc....  All in all, it's not exactly up to you how you end the playthrough. It depends both on luck and skill, which is like in everyday life, where most of the things are outside your margin of control. The game is an awesome improvement on card and rpg games alike, and should be played by as many people as possible. The price is awesome, for an awesome game. Hand of Fate is my new favourite game, buy it.   ",

With the recent DLC update, I am enjoying it even more, being able to go into a hard mode as well as play in diferent mind-sets with the other original character choices.  I found almost nothing wrong with the game, my only problem was that a couple bosses were far harder to get to then they are to beat all due to a single card that is locked for them. However half a dozen tries later and I got through, so it is manageable.  Buy it, its fun!

            "review_text": "I've only played a bit so far, but before the sale is over I wanted to get this out. It's really a neat idea for a game, and I'm having a blast with it.   It's basically a procedurally generated game, but procedural generation is affected by a deck you put together and the AI puts together. It plays out like a board game, where each card is a space you can move to. Each game has several of these cars laid out. Somewhere towards the end of this trail of cards is a boss to slay. Each time you move. the card you land on is revealed. You may have a choice to make, an oppurtunity to shop with gold, or end up fighting. Combat will cause the cards to create a small arena and an opponent or opponents for you to fight. Combat is simplistic, attack, stun, counter, or dodge. It works though, and the enemies look cool. Love the slow-mo effect on the finishing blow to the last enemy. Speaking of face-crunching weapons, those come from cards as well, as do food and gold. These are drawn whenever you receive items from a encounter card, or on display at the various shop cards. Food is expended when you move your piece.  The narrator you play with has a lot of character, as someone else has pointed out. I was genuinely enjoying listening to his commentary on my choices and the cards on the table. His presence really makes you feel like you sat down to play a game with him. Occasionally he'll tempt you into undertaking a card's challenge by offering you a token that will unlock other cards for your deck. I can see this getting me killed eventually, but they are so shiny...  The variety in the cards from the get go is interesting. Without spoiling anything (half the fun is in the suprise I think), I was suprised my many of the encounters. They can be very creative, especially the ones that require decisions.  I've killed two bosses thus far, and if I didn't have real life stuff to do I'd be up for a while with this.  Long story short, the atmosphere and suprise in the game are amazing. It's like sitting down and playing a board or card game, but being teleported into a fantasy location for combat. It is absolutely worth the sale price if you think you would enjoy playing a mysterious game of cards with a good beat down session every thirty seconds or so.",

The combination of deck building and roguelike allows for a unique choose your own adventure style of play. With the release of the Wildcard dlc the replay value skyrockets by adding in new 'Fate' cards (essentially new player characters) that come with thier own unique challenges.   The game starts out reletively easy, with a limited number of cards and shorter dungeons. But as you progress you unlock upgrades that improve your abilities but also thte abilities of your enemies, creating a more traditional roguelike experience (i.e. hard as hell). While not overly difficult with thte default Fate, it becomes increasingly more difficult when playing as the Warlord (hard mode) or the Monk(no gold!!). Top it off with some real nasty curses and this game would appeal to the most masacistic roguelike fans.   On the downside, and it really is the only downside I can see, the combat gets a little stale after a while. It boils down to more or less hit and run strikes, although with the right equipment this ceases to be a problem.  Highly recomended, one of the best additions to the steam catalogue.

With each step another card is turned over to reveal another encounter, each feeling like they've been taken straight from the pages of a choose-your-own-adventure book.  The dealer sitting opposite you engages in amusing and intriguing banter, alternating between challenging and encouraging you, threatening to make the game more deadly at every turn, and hinting at the secrets behind the mysterious game you're playing with him.  It's a fantastic setting for a game, and quite a difficult one as the dealer keeps to his word and throws tougher creatures, harsher traps, cruel encounters and a seemingly endless array of painful curses to stop you in your tracks with every round you play  At times it can get a little frustrating. Being a card game, you can tweak your deck with favourable encounters, but sometimes that's not enough to prevent a string of bad encounters early on which can bring a game to a swift end. Couple this with some encounters being simple games of chance, and at times it feels like you've lost without really playing badly.  Thankfully this doesn't happen too often, and with each conquered challenge rewarding you with new cards, even a failed adventure can net you some new toys.  And if you really dislike having so much RNG in your game, you can stack the deck in favour of combat encounters to help limit the amount of dice rolling.  The combat, however, is probably the weakest part of this game. It's a straightforward affair, a watered down version of the free-flowing combat in the Batman Arkham series. It works just fine and can get quite challenging, and there's a vast array of weapons, armour and trinkets to aid you, but I feel like it needs a few more options to keep it interesting. All you can really do is attack, block, guard-break, dodge, and occasionally use a trinket or a weapon's special ability. I wouldn't expect the immense depth the Arkham games have but I think it's a little too simple here.  For the most part, the game looks and runs just fine. Personally I find the art style quite appealing and fairly unique, but I suppose some people might find it a little too simplistic for their tastes. I have encountered a few graphical glitches however, such as pink boats and monsters' limbs stretching like elastic, as well as a couple of freezes that forced me to restart the game. Nothing remotely serious or common enough to warrant a major complaint, but it's a very rewarding experience when you let yourself get immersed in the adventure, and those sorts of minor irritants draw you out from it.  In summary: A wonderfully entertaining card game/dungeon crawl/choose-your-own-adventure experience with a few minor issues. A little simplistic in its combat and sometimes a little heavy on the RNG, but these minor gripes are a small price to pay for such a unique game with a sinister, secretive adversary who raises the stakes with every round. It does get quite challenging as your progress, so don't expect an easy ride.",

Playing the cards and messing about with the decks you want to build to equip and fight against is a ton of fun, and there's a lot of anticipation and foreplanning when it comes to exploring each floor.  A good portion of the encounter quest cards lead to more encounters, often in a narratively sense as well as a strictly unlocking sense. Making your way through a boarder town for the first time, for instance, will open up new frontier lands (in the form of new encounter cards) for you to adventure forth to.  I am also very fond of the main character. While he is a bit of a silent protagonist, you do get a lot of insight to him from the cards and the encounters, which are based off of his past life and/or memories. I also like that he's not just a generic sort of a guy; he's got an interesting but not overdesigned look, and clearly isn't afraid to do what he desires. This is also somewhat shown through gameplay, as while you often get several choices of how to respond to some encounter prompts, only one of them will progress you to future encounters. It lends a sense of 'this is how it actually went' to thing.  At the same time the other main character, and your opponant, the Dealer, has his own story, some of which you unravel as you play. He is voiced very well, and manages to capture one's attention as he comments on both your gameplay choices and the narrative happenings in the plot. It's like you are both playing a game with him, and yet telling a story with him through your actions.  The system is also very expandable, so it's fairly safe to assume that there'll be some DLC in the works for this game.  Overall, this is a very solid game, and one well worth throwing a fair few hours at.  I would recommend a controller, if you have one, as it makes the combat feel a little better.",

Basically, its a rogue-like, and the fighting portions are a mix of Fable and Arkham Asylum. Your character will develope each session in a table-top game kind of style. Encounters will often present in a 'pick a card' luck based system. You're not completely subjected to the luck system. You can take note of the winning card before hand and try to follow it as it shuffles. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you get bit hard.  Make no mistake, a single RNG luck-based encounter can kill your character. I had a character with extra life, food and gold, and awesome gear. Then I bumped into a Devil, and he took me down to 8 health, gave me extra tough monsters, and I died in one hit.   But this isn't a bad thing. It's not a huge loss. If you lose a session you'll likely still unlock something. You'll never lose hours of progress. The setbacks are very minor, and the potential progress always outweighs the loss.   You will get frustrated every now and then, you'll get back-to-back sessions of getting your ♥♥♥ spanked by RNG and bad luck. But you won't reach that Dark Souls level of rage where you want to throw your computer across the room.  Endless Mode is very unforgiving. The RNG seems very slanted against you in it, but it provides a legit challenge, and you will need some luck to get far.   This is a great game. It's a high quality rogue-like, with elements of a table-top game. The graphics in fight scenes look great. The sound is great, especially when listening to The Dealer doll out cards as your session progresses.   The game is worth the money. I was fortunate to pick it up on the summer sale.   If they keep adding content to this game, it will be a no brainer as far as adding it to your library.   Do it! Just do it!",

For instance, you land on a battle card. You materialize in front of your enemies but rather than just rolling a die or playing more cards to see if you can beat them or not, you beat them up in real time to defeat them. It's something I seriously love about games like this. It's an excellent blend from what you'd expect from a table top and a video game.   Another thing I love is how engaging it is. It's very simple really, but somehow it's still enticing to play more. It might be the quips The Dealer says throughout the game or the atmosphere or even the achievement of getting more cards to play with after you beat a Path. It's probably all of these things and I love the game for them even more.   Speaking of The Dealer, he is a mysterious character but also a formidable opponent. I don't want to give too much away but if you find yourself having trouble with any of the minions or bosses you fight, best to make sure you're well and dandy to square them away before the final fight. Luckily, you can replay any part of your Journey which can be a big help.   So really, if you've been contemplating getting this game, do it. It's worth every penny.",

At the beginning it's very nice and fun to play, but when you get closer to the endgame the RNG becomes too punishing, robbing you of a chance to use your skills and instead tunring events into a slot machine of sorts. Well, it's not called 'hand of fate' for nothing, I guess, but it makes the endgame a little too grindy.  Encounter and item cards get unlocked very quickly, which makes the game rather short, even though there is an endless mode - it's just not very fun to play if there's no element of exploration, you learn the cards fast and know what they do and how it's best to approach encounters. Hopefully, future addons and DLC will fix that by adding more cards.  This is a good title to grab during a sale, it will keep you occupied for a couple of evenings, but not for much longer than that. It can be so much better; seeing the great potential of this game makes it feel a bit underwhelming in its current state. I hope that it will get there eventually.",

The whole idea of Playing Cards / RPG is really cool one.  Negative - It's a card game, but RNG is RNG. Sometimes you are very lucky, sometimes you are very unlucky - Camera is bad, especially in dungeons, when you can't really see what kind of traps are ahead of you ! - Last boss fight, I think the difficulty spike is 10x times of everything else encountered in this game. Is it really a good idea to basically collect all other bosses and let them fight you in waves ? There is no healing mechanic (Except few rare items), so you are on your own.

More cards get unlocked as the game progressess and individual encounters get resolved - either by combat or choose-your-own-adventure style dialogue.  The combat  is reminiscent of Rocksteady's free flow style, implemented in the Batman series.  The graphics  are easy to look at, however they suffer in details, undeniably due to a relatively small budget of the independent developer.  The audio  is great, especially the dealer's lines and voice acting gives the game a necessary 'oomph' to underline its atmosphere.

            "review_text": "This is a difficult little review to properly put down, but I enjoyed most of this game enough to want to recommend it, though with a little explanation of why you may also want to leave it be at the same time. I loved most of this game, but really just started to hate it near the end, and not for the reason the mocking narration would want me to.  To talk about it's positive features, Hand of Fate can be very immersive with its vague storytelling, atmosphere and gameplay. It's mostly easy to just lean in and become engrossed in the voice acting, artwork, movement of the cards, etc etc. The combat sections that happen in between moving your token along the path of cards laid down are very simple for the most part, and a nice little bit of interaction that may have kept the game from getting too hands off, even if it is a weaker, if neccesary, part of the game.  It's easy to just listen to the dealer speak through every draw of a card and outcome of an event, doing your simple obligatory counter-attack combat straight from the WB games. Quite enjoyable.  However, it was around the halfway point the game started becoming very, very hateable, specifically on the Jack of Scales boss. While I had had a bad-ish run up to that point, I was still capable of fighting the boss...until the game started crashing, in the middle of every fight attempt. And it turned out, it was a glitch related to his tail slap manuever a few other people had had problems with. Now, had I had a good run I could have blitzed him with a powerful artefact and a weapon ability...But I hadn't had a good run, so I had to forfeit the game and start over, not because of difficulty or utter bad luck with my run, but because the game was crashing. That combined with a bit of the slightly mocking narration from the dealer? Ooh, rustled my jimmies abit, but I tried to keep going.  But it just kind of went downhill from there. Lots of stupid ♥♥♥♥ would happen, like getting a card that requires you to move a certain number of spaces before a time limit takes half your health away, and having the destination just be beyond that time limits ability to reach. That has no strategy to it, no risk or reward. You just trade half your health for a probably underwhelming item that barely helps and you only knew you were doing that AFTER you couldn't go back. That's kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  And then of course, the cards start glitching out and you have a bad fortune card drawn and stuck on your screen, it sticks through the loading into a shop and then you cant sell things to buy food because a card is hovering in front of that crap, and you have to quit out the game and come back in, only to die the next turn because you couldn't buy food or heal on the shop because you wasted your turn quitting out because of a glitch, and the next combat had you fighting 5 lava golems in an especially small arena.  It's also worth mentioning my only ever encounter with the minotaur thus far resulted in a weird, awkward combat where he would charge around the arena, sliding off of pillars instead of impacting them, seeming basically impossible to hit, until he got stuck in a wall and his model started glitching out something awful.  And the whole time anyways, The Dealer is making his smug little commentary on your bad fortune, and it feels more like he's mocking you for playing a buggy video game than for having bad luck in the game you are playing against him. Immersion breaks, you grit your teeth and try to keep playing because you want to see the outcomes to things...  Obviously, that's a personal experience and it could not occur on someone else's playthrough...but still.  Summarizing anyways, Hand of Fate can be alot of fun, can be very engrossing, but can also be very frustrating and some of the bugginess in the game, while minor, really, really can upset the experience. I do recommend the game, it's well priced for what you get, but think twice if you're not sure. Maybe wait for a sequel or another iteration of the game where the developers have perfected things.  7/10, would reluctantly watch a minotaur warp in upon himself again.",

Every time you die in the game, your character and progression through the story has to restart, but any tokens you won are permanent (so it is sometimes worth dying and having to restart the game so long as you have a change at a permanent token). The combat is fun and fast, fairly easily button smashing with some strategy. The game is fast past and designed well enough that you can pop in and out of games. 10-15 minutes can be enough to actually make progress. I normally prefer very long and in-depth games that take 100s of hours, but this is something nice to break it up, or if I want something that is better on controller.

Nice graphic, simple fighting mechanism, quite some new equipments to collect, a funny card dealer who mocks you sometimes and most importantly you can customise the storylines by using the cards. Playing this game does require some luck, but once you have the idea of how it works, you can slightly control your luck by combining the encounters and equipments, other than that, yup, plain luck.  *** Must get it with DLC, DLC makes the game complete by adding few series of continuous encounters, and character classes to make the game much more entertaining (this also the part that I mentioned about controlling luck').

Long answer: You get to build a deck of cards: Encounters, shopkeepers, stuff, curses, blessings and such. I really wanted to like this game. And I definitely did. And still sometimes do. But there are far too many things that keep me from fully recommending this to you. So, good things first, the setting is part of what I liked. The ambience the game sets is pretty cool and involving, while not too extravagant. The game master's taunts and comments might be redundant in the long run, but they're still well made and help the player get into the game a bit more. The way you unlock new cards and encounters with tokens, pretty cool too, makes you want to play more and more to unlock more cards and move deeper into the different storylines. The game system, nothing complicated, but making it simple is what makes it work : You move from encounter to encounter, spending one food at a time, healing a bit while doing so. As I said, it's simple, yet allows you a bit of planning when you look at which way you'll go.  What could go wrong then?  First, the encounter themselves: While having them randomly placed on the map makes sense and allows for replayability [GOOD RNG], most of them involve luck way too heavily to be amusing. You just pick a card and see if it's a success or failure, which can lead to frustrating events (looking at you there, devil's carnival) at worst and not so involving at best [BAD RNG]. I understand the need of randomness in such a game, but I wish I could have a heavier impact on it. And then the combat, oh my the combat. Arkham Asylum wasn't incredible and definitely was too easy, but it was nervous, fast paced, and pretty to look at (most of the time) because of its dynamic nature. Hand of Fate's one is just plain boring. At first it might seem enjoyable, because of the equipment possibilities and monsters that you imagine will come against you, but after two hours you've seen most of it. It's bland, slow-paced, not hard by any mean, unless the game's RNG decided to ♥♥♥♥ you up and stack everything against you (curses, loss of equipment...). Seeing that it's supposed to be an important part of the game, it's sad to see it fail to convey the atmosphere of epicness the games tries so hard to set. That being said, understand that this game is fun, but that you won't have fun for more than a few hours at best, therefore I don't recommend you buying it at full price. Wait for a sale, don't pay more than 10 bucks for this, really.   tl;dr : Yes, I'd recommend this game, but for no more than a few bucks.",

It frustrates me that I have to give a negative review to this game, because it was really fun when I started playing. The animations were nice, combat was fun, the voice acting was great. It was a really well polished random adventure generator game.   The basic mechanic of the game is that encountering cards generates an encounter, whether combat, puzzle, story, what-have-you, and completing the card will unlock that card's token, which will in turn unlock more cards to add to future decks. It gives a good incentive to try to encounter many cards and figure out how to unlock more. Quite cool.   As you progress in the game, unlocking more cards, you will also encounter bosses. Beating them unlocks the next boss card, and after you beat enough bosses you will unlock an artifact that gives you some bonuses but will also make the game harder.  This is the point where the game goes wrong for me. The difficulty increases introduced by the artifacts make the game virtually impossible by the end. It was not unusual for me to start a game and the very first card would be a combat against a prior boss, 9 of their minions, on a trapped battlefield with an accompanying totem. There were so many high powered threats my brand new out of the box adventurer had no chance to win.   What makes it worse is that there's no going back. Once those difficulty spikes are unlocked, they affect the whole game, retroactively. If I go back to the very first boss of the game, my first encounter on that level might be the aforementioned impossible fight (and was, the time I tried). The fun of the game, of running around kicking bandits in the face and solving problems for townsfolk became overshadowed by a constant string of deaths brought on by unwinnable fights.   There's an easy mode that gives the player some benefits, but activating it disables achievements (gotta punish those filthy casuals) and you can't access any of the other character archetypes in the game, which locks out almost all of the games replayability.   Currently the only solution to get rid of the difficulty spikes is to use the 'Erase Progress' feature, which you don't realize until it's too late. Now, after playing for 12 hours, I'm forced to decide to either erase everything I've accomplished or give up because the game is unplayable.   Neither of those choices make any sense, and are a big part of the reason I can't recommend this game. There's a great premise here, and the underlying system is really, really cool, but it becomes difficult to the point of impossibility and I've got better things to spend my gaming time on than dying forever.   Should the devs put in a way to disable the artifacts, or otherwise customize the difficulty of the game in a way that doesn't lock out every other character option, I will revisit this review and hopefully change it to a positive.",

Don't buy it without doing your homework.  FULL REVIEW: Hand of Fate boasts an aesthetically gripping melding of two unlike games into a single experience that varies from unplayable to underwhelming. On their own, each of the ‘games’ of Hand of Fate fall far from being worthwhile. Together, the card game and the three-dimensional fighting game intermingle in a way that works just enough to keep players invested in a fairly transparent skinner box.   Players are subjected to a deck-building card game that rewards repetitive play with a larger card base and challenges players through proper resource management. Game-to-game rewards are meted out through a shell game that is either too easy or too hard, an aspect that belies the RNG nature of the card game. Overarching rewards are given after successfully completing ‘token’ cards, which have a variety of conditions to complete (some of which are obvious, some obscure, almost all of them lacking explanation). Common issues of RNG exist and are easy to overlook, but there are some more severe instances such as stumbling upon very difficult encounters too early on that force a player have to quit a run of the game or even completely reset their progression overall. Card balance is a huge issue, with several cards being outright stronger than others regardless of situation. Furthermore, the encounter deck that the player must create is a vague collection—there are no indicators of what the encounters do, and some encounters seem variable in their options and outcomes. This makes constructing an encounter deck a chore of either looking up each card online or simply not knowing what each encounter brings in terms of challenge and reward unless the player has drawn that encounter several times. Hand of Fate seems to beckon players to experiment to discover what works and what doesn’t, while punishing players every time that it does not work out both in their current game played and across multiple future games.  The fighting game, unfortunately, has even more severe issues. Combat is without weight, several mechanics of the system go unexplained, difficulty of encounters has to be inferred, some arenas are far too unforgiving, and so on. There is a simple system of click-to-attack, click-to-counter incoming moves that’s been popularly attributed to the Arkham series of games. Here, it barely works, as most encounters find the player vastly outnumbered by enemies that constantly attack. It is often difficult to even land two attacks in a row on an enemy without being interrupted in some way, giving combat a hectic and choppy flow. Camera angles can be a detriment to properly positioning the character, especially as some arenas feature traps and enemies can attack the player from off-screen. There’s a rolling maneuver that the player is intended to use to avoid several of the heavier attacks in the game, but the roll often comes out too late and does not offer much in terms of defense thanks to aforementioned issues along with painfully awkward hitboxes. Enemies take far too many hits, with the exception of when the player has specifically itemized to defeat an enemy type, and then combat becomes laughably easy against said enemies. There simply is no middle-ground, though. To further frustrate things, rewards are tied to number of monster cards drawn rather than individual monster difficulty--sometimes beating four skeletons can be just as fruitful as overcoming ten skeletons and a boss you fought before. Overall, combat is a mess, ranging from repetitive and easy to punishingly difficult thanks to a culmination of issues that are out of the player’s hands.  Throughout the whole of the game, there simply is a lack of clarity—how much damage am I actually doing? How much damage does my gear reduce? What does an ice-cone attack even do? Is holy damage only extra-effective against undead? Who are these various characters? What does this encounter card even do? What is the purpose? Too many aspects are left to be inferred, both in terms of narrative and mechanics (an appendix would help, even). Oft-times, I find myself recursively fighting through boring encounters, hoping that I actually win the shell games this time around, so that I can unlock more shell games and progress to just being done. There isn’t a gripping narrative arc that makes me want to continue to play to the end. The gameplay from moment to moment is droll and forgettable. There’s nothing that stands out.  This all goes without mentioning the several issues the game has just running. It outright crashes on startup, it crashes when loading some encounters, it sees framerate dips on some machines; so on and so forth. Thankfully, the support team for the game has been working on patching out and addressing these issues, mostly via their forums. This isn’t to say it’s all bad. I’d be kidding myself if I said the style of the game and the goals it sets out for aren’t awesome. There’s a very strong aesthetic that permeates the game just as there’s something refreshing about having these two genres put together in such a way that one doesn’t get too boring before the other takes over. Sure, dialogue gets repetitive and lore is a bit sparse at times and obfuscated at times, but it’s charming and interesting when it isn’t.  All in all, Hand of Fate is promising, but lacks polish. There are plenty of options that can be fixed, plenty that can be clarified, and several aspects that can be advanced. Sadly, it seems that a complete overhaul would need to be done to each of the games that exist within Hand of Fate for them to work on their own. If you’d like to pick up two flawed, repetitive games that can distract from their flaws and repetition by means of alternation, go for it. If you’re a sucker for how a game looks rather than how it plays, buy the game like I did. If you want a worthwhile playing experience that’s rewarding outside of just earning more stuff in the game, though? Look to spend your money elsewhere.",

Sure, you can 'build' your deck, but the cards from it then go into random layouts, there's no way to effect the random event results which are flat 25%, 50% or 75% hit/misses, and the only non-random part (combat) is a bit slow and clunky. Plus all the constantly repeating menus/dialog/video makes every action take a second or so longer than it should do, so I found myself constantly hammering A to try and skip through.   If it drops below £5, then might be worth it, but really weak for the current price.",

Towards the end you will be lucky if 1 out of 10 games are even remotely enjoyable.  The way the shell game works with picking success and failure cards is godawful for me. I don't have the best vision, so I can't follow the success cards that well, and almost always mess up. However, this shouldn't even be a thing. It's called Hand of Fate. It's supposed to be RANDOM. The fact that you can follow the cards with your eyes and track the success cards is STUUUUUUUUUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID.  So unless I close my eyes for every single encounter, game is trash.

The unskippable 'cutscenes'/'screens' for 'Newgame' and 'Gameover' makes this title unplayable for me.   I do love the actual game - so as soon as this is patched, I will change back to a thumbs-up.  [/edit]   As of 2016-02-06  If you find these three categories interesting... +Deckbuilding +Batman-style Fighting +Dungeon Exploration-Solitare ...just stop reading and buy the game!     Extreme annoyances  (Directed at the devs) :   1: Turn-around time on death is extremely slow, which is sad on such a well designed game, which is a very odd design-decision for a game that expects you to die... over-and-over.  (30-60 second to restart a game is just redicilously bad design.)   2: A 10 second, unskippable, game-over display makes me consider rebooting the game rather than waiting.  (Should be made skippable after 1 second.)   3: Upon death, you are forced to rebuild your deck if you received any new cards.  (New cards should  really  go to the 'off-hand' pile to reduce turn-around on death)   4: Many animations feel very slow and overly flamboyant after getting used to what's going on.  (The Tom-Cruise-style serving of a drink is fine the first 2-3 times, but there comes a point where you just want the bartender to just ♥♥♥♥ing serve that shot of Tequila without being a jackass about it.)   5: UI &amp; GUI is not designed for PC... - Some menues forces user to click on a 5 x 20 pixed wide 'continue'-button. - Clicking anywhere on the screen, will select the highlighted quest-option. - The 'return to top/bottom of pile looks like 'select 1 card' and clicking anywhere will default to 'return-to-top'.
