Well im glad I got to play this game because it is truly an amazing game yes it's from 2012 but the story is pretty cool, It does revolve around one house and one family but the developers have made this work in a good way, you play the game as a child coached by the devil into doing some pretty evil things.  The gameplay was great and I will play this game again to get the last achievements, the graphics are great and it worked well on my 5760x1080 resolution which I really liked.  controls are pretty basic but for this game and it is ok  To me the Steam write-up does not help sell this game and the metacritic score I don't really understand people's low ratings I guess we all see games from different prospective.  I will finish this off by saying if your thinking about buying the game buy it you wont regret it if your into horror.",

This game is short and buggy.It didn't feel like a satanic murderer sandbox,like most reviews and curators have said,but rather a game that would belong to the puzzle genere.I,myself,have experienced quite a few (maybe a lot more than just a few) bugs trough my 2 times finishing the story.The one that bothered me the most was journal entries literally not appearing no matter what I done.My ouja board was the only thing that helped me commit the murders.They would all at once pop up only after I killed the person,and of course I had to use a walkthrough at certain points,even if it is not a thing I normally do.The other annoying bug was Lucius getting stuck in the ground in certain points of Dante Manor,making me restart the chapter.Kristen Stewart has MORE facial expressions than the main character,that doesn't really even look like a 6 year old,and this logic really ruined the immersion for me-basically,in that manor of rich and respectable people he was the only main character that dressed in a suit.A 6 year old.Not his dad,not the detective that tries to catch you,not his mom,only his grandfather if I'm not mistaken.The other bugs I was talking about were visible but not always ruining the gameplay,things like models becoming colourless,glitching out,etc.And the only thing I found is to blame were lazy developers,for even grammar is not correct sometimes,usually in the MAIN CUTSCENES.The Dante Manor,the place where the action of the game happens is also pretty repetitive itself,having two mirrored parts,only with different room layouts,giving the big bad house a repetitive feeling,and even despite it's maze like corridors,trust me,that layout is so simple you'll don't need the map anymore from chapter 6 onwards.The hitbox of your final spell 'Combustion' is very rough and not tweaked for individual models,it can only hit the chest I think,nothing will happen if you set someone's hand or foot on fire (so real).The turn-the-crosses-upside-down system is a bit cheesy,or cliche,whatever you want to call it.And if you may want an explanation to my 40 hours of playing it,I left it open,because there is an achievement where you need to play 40 hours,and as the other are really easy,with 3 quarters of them you have completed before you know it,it would be a shame to now make this one a perfect game...hell,even Dark Souls achievements are less annoying than leaving this damn game open 40 hours.",

Getting used to the map is also crucial as the house is big! - Although the story is corny and a little far fetched it worked and it was just like a tacky horror movie. - Fun achievements, the type that make you want to go back and play certain missions again.  CONS: - Its unpolished for sure, I dont really mind it as it played into the games enjoyable charm but animations are poor and controls are clunky. - Grapically the game is not brilliant  VERDICT?  An entirely daft premise and not exactly good delivery but the game is somehow one the most enjoyable ive played, which is worrying cause you play as a serial killer.",

Your mom tells you to clean your room. You clean your room. She gives you another chore. Other people give you stupid fetch quests. You run around picking up clothes, or looking for a bottle of wine. You gather an assortment of random objects and you try to figure out what to do with them. And, it only saves when you kill someone. So, if you run around doing stupid chores for an hour, then you have to quit ... well the next time you play, better get ready to do chores again. (I thought people played games to escape the boredom of everyday-life activities like chores ...) You get clues which are useless - 'I should mess with this charcter'. You then proceed to try every item in your inventory to 'mess' with him, with no luck.  The killing isn't clever or fun. It's not like you have a number of choices, and you choose how and when to kill certain people. You have to kill a certain person on a certain day in a certain way using certain objects in the correct order. Don't be fooled by the beautiful packaging - it is tedious and annoying.",

It's also very challenging ! You may get stuck on a few of the murders as they will really push you to be creative in your process of thoughts.  It just was fun. Very fun.  Now of course it's not perfect : there are a few minor bugs scattered around, and the gory/satanic side of the game may give people some trouble, but then again that's what to expect with such a game.",

            "review_text": "I went into this hearing all positive reviews on gamesites, raving videos about it &amp; thought it would be good. It started off &amp; was decent, third person sandbox game in a limited environment, a focus on solving puzzles &amp; murder, playing as son of the devil. Oh how I was wrong.  After the first 2 or so murders though all novelty started to run thin, a character would say something in passing to satan-child, devil tells you to get souls, proceed to go through specific path to kill the person. On the way you can do various chores with your powers, pick up blocks with telekinesis, steal underwear from a maids room to wash it etc.   Graphics were decent, better than I expected but not amazing. The story was interesting to start but became boring fast, not as fast as the story decayed though. I won't spoil but by the end it just decided to wrap things up too rushed &amp; uninterestingly, while hinting at a sequel I hope won't come. About half way through it just became a chore to play, there's no way I'm even going to bother with the achievements I haven't got.  Although I hate comparisons, some people like them so here we go. With the (very) limited sandbox &amp; single choice murders, you could mistake it for a portable version of Assassins Creed. Happy? No, nor am I as that was a bad comparison but the game made me unhappy I bothered with it, so get used to the disappointment if you're going to buy it.   Cons:  -Limited interactivity with game world -Poor controls -Poor story -Bland gameplay -Too scripted (might just be me, prefer choices &amp; options in a game like this) -Over the top murders, we're talking the sort little Timmy dreams up only to find his mum being called in by the teacher to send him to psychiatric help, all the while imagining all the ways they could both meet a gruesome fate -Bad ending -No replay value at all, unless you want achievements -Nudity used 50% through to try &amp; entice the player -Everything else in the game -The price, $20 is WAY too much for it, I'd even say the $5 I paid for a bundle with it was too much. If you see it at $2, grab it &amp; be numbed for 5 hours  Pros -Graphics ok for indie game -Powers were cool, not enough to do with them -Good concept  So the tl;dr, interesting concept, really poor execution. If you're swayed by nudity, you can peek on a maid, if you want a decent game then go elsewhere. Maybe if you're 10-16 this will be good, otherwise it's too...forced feeling.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the worst games I have ever played. If you like context dependent 'find the magic pixel' games wearing the disguise of a puzzle/stealth game then this is perfect for you. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR? Omen fans? Were people really clamoring for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and contrived plots? How about broken stealth segments that rely on repetition with little to no indication of where enemies are? I can not emphasise enough how terrible this game is.  You play Lucius, the antichrist born through the machinations of your grandfather who made a pact with the devil to gain power and money. Now you have to go through a mansion and kill people as offerings to Satan in an effort to increase your power. This is done by finding little items hidden throughout the one location in the game and using them to engineer traps or situations that you can influence through your satanic powers that end with someone dying. I guess it's a good game for... snuff enthusists? The payoff to solving the puzzles is a gruesome cutscene sometimes followed by a new power to use that are highly sensitive to context. There's no experimentation, no alternate paths, just a set puzzle with one often obscure conclusion. God help you if you don't know where to get an item that you need to solve a puzzle. It'll usually be tucked away, some colorless chunk on the washed-out palate that you need to click on. Speaking of items, there's an inventory where you store particular items that relate to the story but there's no differentiation between the items you can pick up and the junk that is strewn throughout the house that you can just pick up and HOLD. Sometimes you'll even need to just pick up the items you can't put in your inventory! The house, which is the only setting, is featureless and huge. You can run around up and down stairs, but if you turn a corner too fast or make some minute adjustment with the camera you're going to get lost. Every room and every hallway looks the same, but after about 4 hours of playing I stopped having to refer to the map every 10 seconds.  The characters are all terribly stiff archetypes capering around and delivering lines through terrible voice acting. Not many lines were recorded, so expect to hear repeated dialogue a LOT. Another part of the story is told through what seems to be the diary entries of a detective named 'McGuffin' (hilarious) but I have NO IDEA why these segments were included. Who cares about what some detective is doing when that isn't the focus of the game at all? Why make that a thing? There's no mystery being solved for the player. You know EXACTLY what's happening because the 10 minute intro sequence spelled everything out for you. No tension is built through this parallel exposition and no new information is gained. It just turns into a boring sequence of people jabbering at each other, faking emotion while delivering tired and predictable lines that usually pan out like this: 'I'm a detective who can't figure out why people keep killing themselves.' 'Something weird is going on and the my upcoming election can't handle the scandal if the public gets wind of all these people killing themselves in my home.' 'I know. It's so WEIRD though.' Now repeat that between every one of the 18 chapters. This game was boring, frustrating, contrived, cheap, brought nothing new to the experience, had shoddy controls, barely any mechanics, and was a genuine pain to play. Don't buy it, don't play it.",

You have to find the pieces by trial and error to eventually solve the puzzles and murder your entire household.  Look at my avatar, it's holding an axe. When I successfully use puzzles to murder someone I should be clapping gleefully in a way that makes the FBI agents attached to monitor me feel very uncomfortable. I should not be feeling like my own brain is beginning to melt inside my skull to the point that I actually thought on the level of insanity of the developers.   A walkthrough is pretty much required for this game and I'm told that if you just want the story you can watch a movie called The Omen and save yourself the time.

There is no time limit to this, which gives you plenty of time to explore the game and interact with your fantastic surroundings, and talk to the characters which have unique dialogue that change as the story progresses.  The game has some very difficult parts that take quite a bit of thinking, and a couple of easier parts. Sadly, each death is scripted and you have no choice in the way they die, which means if you replay the game, you don't get a different experience. Having said this, it is a wonderful little game, with some very interesting cutscenes. The premise is a little cliche, but the execution is fantastic, as it keeps you interested until the very end.",

Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere.

The puzzles are sometimes nice, but mostly uninspired. The story is what kept me finishing the game, in the end I felt that it had more potential, but was still fine.  What really annoyed me though is the lack of life from most of the characters, if you can even call them characters. They have no personality, not even a glimpse of it, which would be fine if we didn't spend like I don't know, 75% of the game killing people like that. I mean as a hellspawn wouldn't it be much more satisfying to kill people who are good and have things to lose? It's more devilish, you know. Sure, everybody has something to lose, but why should we care about these people? Some of them are considered annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by Lucius himself (let alone me). And the others are just there, because somehow you must fill the mansion with people. The main characters are OK, and it's interesting to see them reacting to the events. So yeah, outside a few things this game doesn't really offer much. It's a great concept and a little bit of fresh air with the change of roles, but it doesn't execute well enough to be considered anything but a good idea.  tl;dr it's eh. 4/10",

Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively.

            "review_text": "A great concept completely ruined by some of the worst gameplay decisions I've ever seen. First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it. The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target. In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).  To make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place. These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight. You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.  You're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol. I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending. The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.  I really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea. The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun. Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it. If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle. Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.",

Rather than allow you to do anything on your own accord, Lucius plays out more or less like an old-school point-and-click adventure. Every event is coded in advance and the only thing expected from you is to follow the exact steps laid out by the game. There is no creativity of any sort, only trial and error.  Worse than that, the game is plagued by numerous bugs. The engine is poorly optimized and it's not uncommon for characters to clip into walls or objects to melt into the environment. The lighting is completely bonkers. Certain achievements don't trigger properly. The sound design is abysmal. Rather than put together a soundtrack, the developers downloaded a bunch of royalty-free 'horror' tracks and shoved them to play during the game without any sense or purpose, often completely ignoring what's going on. Get used to the atrocious 'chase scene' music from the tutorials to barge into the cutscenes that follow, even if that cutscene is a peaceful Christmas dinner.  Lucius is a game that tries to sell itself on its concept, but doesn't treat it with any kind of care. It feels like the developers simply pushed out the game, caring more about how much money it makes than whether it's actually any good. A shame, because a strong concept like Lucius could benefit from a developer who isn't completely apathetic toward their creations.",

The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius.

As for the other bugs they just break the immersion of the game. Also at almost random the frame rate would heavaly drop to almost a frame per second and everything would come to a crawl. Also the game has a hard time at really telling you what you really need to do and at times I had to use Youtube to finish some chapters because of how poorly the game told me on what i had to do.  On the other hand the game is kinda boring 'unless if you like games like this' the cutscenes are well done, and for the most part the voice acting is good. Sadly I really cant recommend this game unless its on sale because in a way the game gets you to kinda want to kill off the people in it other then your mother, your first victim, and the butler other then that the people you kill kinda had it coming.",

The cinematopgraphy was incredible and a joy to view (just look at the screenshots I took), however they were unsupported by poor voice acting throughout. The only voice actor I found believable was the actor playing Will.   Further, the games way of giving you a certain item to display hints on your hud was flawed as it didn't just show you hints specificially for the mission you were on, but instead, (I kid you not), it showed you hints for future missions aswell creating total confuson.   An example of a plot hole I identified: -There is no way Lucius' parents are fine with never hearing Lucius' voice before, actually no one should be. However, they live day to day fine with it. Further, everyone in the house doesn't seen affected by the murders in the manor expect for the mother displaying a natural character arc.   TL;DR: +Great game, great cutscenes, interesting concept - Poor voice acting, flawed help system, can't sympathise with characters due to lack of intentions and character arc.  ",

I wouldn’t call any of them “challenging”.  I ran into some bad AI interactions and minor bugs as well. The npcs repeated the same lines over and over again and they often spoke on top of each other. Towards the end it got annoying to hear Nancy (the main character’s mom) constantly ask you to do laundry when I had already completed the chore very early on. The game crashed a few times and one time I clipped through the staircase wall to the outside of the manor. I also ran into many minor flaws which made the game feel unpolished.  Still, it was a somewhat enjoyable experience and worth the 1,89€ I paid for it. In my opinion you should only consider buying Lucius if it’s on big sale and the premise sounds interesting to you.",

There is only one way to take out your target, and its usually the most obscure, annoying, and hidden way you could possibly imagine. What also sucks is how you never get to 'experiment' to learn your surroundings. Walk up to some guy with a gun and shoot him? Instant game over. You dont get to see the reaction of what you have done, you just get that satisfying 'GAME OVER' we all love.

Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.",

The game feels like a horror movie all the way through. You got a narrator talking about your progress, cutscenes to give the story more depth, and an impressive climax. The voice acting is decent; it ranged from superb to not so bad as to ruin the immersion. The characters are actually intriguing for the little time you know them and I almost felt sorry for some of the poor victims.   The whole puzzle theme of the game is intriguing since it forces you to think a lot. Sometimes you might get stuck for hours because you can't figure out you need that tiny thing in that room and put it in the other thing. But the cutscenes at the end of each chapter are rewarding and satisfying enough to make the frustration worth it.  The set of powers you get to wield with your character are also fun to use. I would have preferred some more freedom to fully enjoy your awesome powers of Antichrist, but as it is, the game takes great advantage of what it gives you. Especially in the climax, where you truly feel like a demonic badass with the help of great surroundings and an epic soundtrack. That too should be mentioned; the music in this game is really good.  If I were to point out flaws, I'd say that I did encounter a few bugs. Nothing so big that it damaged my experience, though. The characters' talking did get old really quickly as well. Especially the final boss, who has ONE LINE that he repeats the entire time.   To conclude, Lucius is the perfect game for the sadistic player who wants to feel like a villain and also enjoys puzzle games.

Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items.

It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.",

Generally in games keystage challenges become exponentially more difficult, but in my (short) exploration of this one it seems one task can be virtually impossible to complete followed by a task which is ludicrously simple.   It is challenging, in some instances overly so; actions expected of the player can be very obscure with no hints, once you've finally figured out what you have to do it can then be a feat of superhuman dexterity to complete your mission... creaing a serious anticlimax. It is frustrating and slightly tedious in alternating intervals. This is not helped by the fact the game mechanics appear to struggle with a controller, there are a great many graphics glitches, odd bouts of lag, and reloading from a checkpoint takes a very long time.   Perhaps the game is just older and I am being unfair. It is also possible that I'm just not suited to this type of puzzle solving as, to be candid, this game very quickly felt like a chore rather than a joy which is a pity because, as I said, the concept is awesome.",

The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me.

It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze.

It doesn't take long to go around, learn the basics and then, get on with it on your murder list!  There isn't much to be said about this game, concerning the story and gameplay. It gets the job done and honestly, I can't understand the gaming industry bashing this game. I liked it mostly for all its numerous faults and cons and it was satisfying enough to keep me interested and playing till the end (game is about 6 hours long).  PROS: +Antichrist antihero (feels weird and cool at the same time! Be THE creepy kid with powers!). +Creepy, tensed and gory atmosphere during the murder scenes. +Game is challenging enough to keep you guess the next step although, you can always get a walkthrough guide to speed things up! +Lots of exploring to do in this huge mansion.  CONS: -Some gameplay mechanics weren't responsive fast enough, especially during that Chapter 10 stealth mission. Patrolling grownups could see me even well hidden through walls and doors. -Straightforward linear killing list. -At some chapters startup, the game lacks direction as to where to go, what to do as you roam around the big mansion aimlessly. Quite irritating! Better read a walkthrough as I sure did around Chapter 5. Also, the map could use refinement! -The chores side quests are really worthless and only time sink. I suggest you simply ignore them... well the ones that you can as some could be mandatory, like that tape cassette for Micheal. -Save-game mechanic is atrocious. No quick-save, no auto save midway in a mission. You are forced to start a chapter and finish it so you can be sure the game saves your progress there.   OVERALL: Faulty game but entertaining enough (to me though) to keep you playing until the showdown. Lucius felt exactly like 'The Omen' simulator and it was a decent entry for this franchise. I do expect the sequel to surpass this game especially on the visual aspect as it is very lackluster (yes, game looks quite ugly), the gameplay mechanics and game direction with a better pathing on a reliable map.  RECOMMENDATION: Loved The Omen movie and loves creepy adventure styles game? This game is for you! Just, wait for a decent deal before forking you dough in this game.

Pros:  -You can ride a tricycle on your way to commit murder.",

My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.",

The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5€",

However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.",

Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.",

The house is a character, the house has alot of detail and is layed out in a manner that makes it fun to traverse. 2. Not sure if it is intentional, but its like a bad horror movie you get to play. Some of the sappy things that you would see happen in 80's horror movies, make this game fun. 3. This game would be a complete disaster if it didn't control good, but the controls work great and make alot of sense, and the parts that are not that great make for fun to master like the telekenisis. If you can get this on a sale it makes it even better, but if not I would still recommend this game a purchase.",

            "review_text": "As you can see I haven't played this game so much yet, but I've already found a couple of issues with the game, that's quite off putting for me.  First of all, the 3rd person view they've decided on using for the game, is incredibly annoying. Lucious's head is in the way a lot of the time if you need to have a closer look at things (which you often do), and at too far a distance, it gets hard to see what's hidden inside all the drawers and cupboards.  Secondly, I have to admit I was a tiny bit disappointed at the lack of a 'sandbox' mode, when this game is being described by the developers as 'Open World'. I can accept the premise that the house and the surroundings is the only area you can be in, but the fact that it isn't sandboxed, and it feels like you're being forced to do things in a certain way (where's the fun in that?) is definitely a bit off putting.   However, when all that's said and done, I haven't played that game that much yet (mainly because of the 3rd person issue), so as such, this review can mostly comment on the mechanics of the game.   The actual game itself, and the premise for it, seems amazing (which is why I bought it in the first place), so hopefully these things will manage to negate the drawbacks of the game.  I'm still having trouble getting into the game because of the way they made 3rd person viewing, and the lack fo any 1st person viewing, but I'd still reccommend this game try, if you happen to find it on offer.",

Despite the graphics being undercooked for a game that's only a couple of years old, the voice acting being a little under par, and almost every puzzle in the game consisting of only four steps, what Lucius lacks in polish it certainly more than makes up for in graphic, satisfying, violence. Having picked this one and it's sequel up for less than a cup of coffee in a recent sale, I probably wouldn't have even played the first instalment except that I saw it had been released in the last couple of years. ♥♥♥♥ I'm glad I did though, because it would have been a huge mistake to miss out on this little gem!
