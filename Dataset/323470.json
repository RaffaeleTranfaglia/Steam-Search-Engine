            "review_text": "TL;DR at the bottom  This game follows the DBZ storyline, but with a twist. A distortion in time has occured, and you must be the one to stop it. You will be summoned by Trunks, and the story revolves around your custom-made character. I have seen many comments on the combat, and how it seems shallow. I don't really agree with this, though, as I found the combat to be rather fun. You can choose to button-smash, but if you have skills and timing, you can get a long way. A controller is highly advised though, as it makes everything easier.  PROS: - Interesting story - Lots of skills and clothes - RPG-elements - You don't have to purchase the DLC, but it's a nice addition. - Custom characters (!!) - Parallel quests - Masters you can train under (Frieza, #18, Cell and many more!) - Multiplayer is fairly stable now - Collecting Dragon Balls can be grindy, but summoning Shenron and wishing, definitely makes it worthwhile ;)  CONS: - I highly recommend a controller. I had a hard time playing with keyboard &amp; mouse. - Tokitoki city is pretty big, and you have to walk around to each seperate booth to get things going. - Lacks some characters (Zarbon, Dodoria, #16 and the likes) - The DLC doesn't add a whole lot, yet is expensive (25 euros for season pass) - I found the Great Apes to be a bit clunky, but I suppose it is understandable with those huge models. - You have to grind levels quite a lot - Combat is pretty simple, and I understand why passionate fighting-genre fans would find it shallow. I enjoy it, nonetheless.  TL;DR: If you are a fan of Dragon Ball, you will most likely enjoy this game (get a controller, though!)  If you are a fan of the fighting genre, and want in-depth combat, you should probably look elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those games based off an anime that's actually  good . I was worried at first I admit, but the people behind Dragon Ball: XENOVERSE put a lot of care into this game and I haven't even completed all of it yet! But I have played enough to understand and get a grasp of things.    Pros:      You get to create a character of your own based off the DBZ races ... even Buus!    Character creation holds a lot of variety, even though some sections are limited.    Most if not all cutscenes show your character in them, executed with swell animation.    Fighting mechanics are well done, action packed and gives you that rush per battle.    Able to customize your skills with almost any ki / martial art that exists in the DBZ universe.    Side quests aren't annoying and reward you with loot that's worth working for.    Co-op is extremely awesome in this game, and can make quests way funner.    Boss battles are fair, challenging but fair ... also difficulty doesn't change if you bring friends along.    The mini map is simple and very helpful in finding what section holds what.    Dialogue isn't cheesy and sometimes the actors will cuss, satisfying those who like that.    You're allowed to have 4 pages of taunts, which your character + other people's can do for fun.    Your character's build can go however you want them to be, either powerful in melee, ki blasts, or other.    Able to join the villains in their optional quests to take down the heroes.    There are trainers in which will teach you very useful abilities, along with sometimes aiding you in matches.    Able to customize your character with clothing / armor you've unlocked and most can have their color changed.    Extremely addicting game with a ton of replayability and benefits for which race you go as every time.    Easy to make friends in this game because of how important each player is during a mission.    NPCs will start to respect you the more you level up, sometimes even wanting to be trained under you.    Main campaign is interesting, villains are cool and yes you can eventually obtain their armor.    Able to play as any DBZ character you unlocked outside of your created character during any side quest.    Some cutscenes are animated that match the show, while the voice acting is well done since most dubs suffer.     Cons:      NPCs in PvP is somewhat unbalanced, while custom characters in PvP is absolutely broken. Some characters can one shot you with 3 bars of ki off the bat, while others have abilities that they can spam and stun lock you for ages. Most of the PvP also consists of hackers &amp; cheaters, leaving people avoiding PvP altogether which is a shame.    Sometimes, even doing a quest / mission flawlessly will leave you with a C ranking simply becasue you didn't trigger the optional random event. These events happen at random, which is usually out of the player's control.    For very good loot, you sometimes have to grind for awhile. Performance doesn't trigger a better chance of obtaining loot.    If you're playing with three people, sometimes they can hog the enemy which leaves you having to race in landing a hit. This is especially true if you need to melee enemies to gather ki.    Certain abilities that you can get early outmatch the late game ones by a landslide, making the game too easy.    During certain parts of the mission, you will be given horde rush of enemies leaving you either bored or hurting.    If your partner is down and you need to revive them, it's likely you will be unable to because it takes awhile to fully revive them while the enemy is constantly beating on you.    There's no feature to see how clothes / armor will look on you when shopping... so it's only when you have obtained the equipment are you allowed to see how it'll look.    Certain enemies will transform in a cutscene, even while you're doing a combo or using a special attacking, meaning you've wasted that because the cutscene kicked in.    Certain side quests are brutally harder than 7 stars, despite they're only 4-6 stars. Some 7 stars are laughably easy.    Cannot change or alter your stats without having to make a whole new character.    Most armor / clothing until late game is useless for stat benefits. Some even harm you by going negative on an important section, hindering you despite wanting to wear it for fashion purposes.    You can fail a mission because an NPC died on yah, despite you've done everything to ensure survival.    Takes a long while at first to earn XP or zin (money) unless a friend is willing to let you ride with em on very difficult levels for the benefits of getting easy XP and zin without earning it.    Hard to understand the mechanics since the game doesn't do a good job explaining things. Only experience and playing will help you understand what does what exactly.    Lips don't move while characters are talking sometimes, breaking immersion.   All in all, this game is amazing though. The pros for certain, outweigh the cons and I adore what we've been given here. This is a game that DBZ fans will love for months while non fans shall still enjoy the daylights out of this game. You want to be a Sayian who looks like you, but can still go Super Sayian and do all the things you've seen in the show? You can! Want to be Freiza's race and wreck everything with death beams or super spirit bombs with one hand? You can! Want to have a female Buu who's super adorable but can kick the crap out of Broly hand-to-hand?? You can! This game lets you have that, and I appreciate it. I especially love seeing my custom character in the cutscenes being vital to the story. Not to mention this game is only $49.99 right now on Steam and will definitely go on price during Steam Sales. Worth full price in my eyes.",

There is plenty of ways to combo off enemies even when you hit them back  Nearly impossible to do in online battles with others since the latency makes the enemies not register the hits or straight up teleport    Charging My Lazors  At times you will find online people or yourself charging up to unleash a barrage of specials, and you just have to fend off the enemies off till they are ready (sounding familiar)      Super Sayin  Is essentially a spam super moves until your blue in the face (inspired by vegeta no doubt)  Can't go super sayin 3 or higher that is main character perks apparently.

Very fun game, and I've had no server issues. It's faithful to the series, combat can become a bit repetitive but the extremely large range of attacks and collectables to earn give the game a lot of replay value. Fun in multiplayer too.  For those who are unsure about the character selection: you play as a custom character throughout the story mode, but every other mode gives you the option to play as the characters you know and love (such as Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan (Kid/Teen/Adult), Kril-I mean, Frieza, Cell etc.) and most characters have multiple setups that change their attacks, stats and appearance. For example, you can play as very early Saiyan saga Goku through to late Buu Saga Goku (base Kaioken to SSj3! +   Super Saiyan God Goku as a seperate character  ), and every appearance inbetween up to the recent movie.",

No FPS drops so far.    Custom character creator is good, of course more options would've been nice but still this is good.    Parallel quests system and side missions are a nice touch.

Excellent game, these are the guys responsible for the Budokai series along with Burst Limit, Infinite World and the PSP games. All fantastic games. Dimps always stuck to 2D style fighting but their foray in 3D style like Spike's Tenkaichi/Raging Blast is wonderful, leagues better than Spike's and on their first try to boot.  PC version wise, this is a fantastic running game.   I highly recommend this to anyone that has been playing the yearly releases of Dragon Ball games since the 90s.   Hopefully someone at Bamco decides to bring the Budokai HD collection to PC as well!  I'd also like to add, the first DLC is really underwhelming, but there is apparently more to come so that's a good start.   Also I'd like to address a few things. Avoid PVP for now, It's just a mess of bad connections and there are a (few) people who a trainer to edit their stats. So for the moment until everything is fixed don't expect a consistent online PVP experience.   Another thing, is meta. You can't avoid this with any online game. People will find and use the most broken things and all you can do is simply play around it or find out how to combat it. Dimps still has a little ways to go with patching so don't expect balance at the moment.  Also, why so little Nameks? Everyone is a Saiyan grill that just spams ki attacks? Where is the variety? If there is another game in the series the Create a Character can be more expanded upon to stop people from being so cookie cutter. Just my 2 cents.",

I do feel that there are some things that can be done better with the game as far as animation for the Ultimate attacks. I feel that striking combos animation could have been put in to allow the game to be better like Budokai 2 &amp; 3. The chasing strike system should have been left in the game as well. Everything else I love about the game. I feel that I can't give a full synopsis or rating of it, because from what I understand there is still more to come with the DLC's and the Xenoverse servers are still down right now.

            "review_text": "Early Days server issues aside, This would have to be the most challenging and most satisfying Dragon Ball Z Fighting game to date.   PROS:  NO QTE's. PERIOD. NONE.  Solid Combat. Some of the moves and combos have little deadzones, but you don't need Street Fighter Reflexes to feel satisfied playing this. Create a Character is VERY rewarding, Even if you need to stack either Ki and Supers or Melee attacks. It's very Dragon Ball Z in that regard.  Storyline and Voice acting is Great. For myself, Very engaging.  Parallel Quests. This is a very fun and interesting take on setting up extra fights and it's a great time sink.  CONS:  Only Race with a transformation is Saiyan.  Item/Skill drops are VERY random and can get VERY frustrating grinding for one skill. Same goes for special events in PQ's.  Whis and Beerus smashing you into submission to the point where you basically lose the will to live. Yup, that fight sucks.    This is an amazing addition to the DBZ franchise. A beautifully crafted fighting game, with very little actual game engine flaws.  A MUST for and DBZ Game fan, and a MUST for any fighting game fan.   Needs offline mode, However, The Devs regularly update on the forums and through other sources, so it is clear they are aware and working on the issue. 2 Thumbs Up.  UPDATE: Server has been nice and stable for a while now. Can't say much about matchmaking, but at least the lobbies no longer kick you after every match.",

            "review_text": "As someone who is put off by anything related to anime due to it being something i've never really got into nor liked, I am rather happy to say I enjoyed this game even if you have limited knowledge of the franchise itself.  The story is basic yet engaging, to sum it up quickly, you'll play as a custom character of your choice (Human, Namekian, Majin, Saiyan or frieza's race) and have to help trunks, a saiyan from the franchise, by going back into past events of the dragon ball universe and fixing them. An example of this would be (Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler) Raditz at the start of the saiyan saga, instead of the usually weak raditz people know he's taken on a much stronger form and nobody knows why, you have to go and help goku and piccolo fight the now stronger raditz and make sure it ends in the way it did originally, with goku and raditz getting hit by piccolo's beam.   After story missions are completed, you slowly unlock side-missions relating to the story missions you did, an example of this would be to kill saibermen who were working with raditz, these give you experiance, mission rewards and a ranking from D-S (As far as I can tell)  Your character is fully customisable, with most of the moves used in dragon ball available, such as the famous Kamehameha and the galick gun and some more lesser used ones. When you gain enough experiance, you will level up and be able add points into your Ki amount, Health, Stamina amount, basic attack, super attack or super blast, which in turn makes the stat of it higher and boosts it. So it's very possible to make a character that uses a full close combat loadout and still have it as a viable tactic. On top of this, you can buy, find, or earn custom clothing in order to bost stats, such as Lord Slugs garb, or Turles's battlesuit, a wide range of clothing is available to suit your characters cosmetic and stat needs.  The combat itsef is very satisfying especially when you use your own custom character, it's very easy to pull off a combo even with limited understanding of the mechanics, whether it be shooting a kamehameha x10 or beating someone to a pulp in close range, it feels very responsive and fluid compared so some of the previous games (I'm talking about you, Battle of Z) The keyboard controlls are just as viable as using a gamepad, so people without one need not worry.   If I were to pick some negative aspects that push the game down for me, it would be the servers (Now mostly fixed) which disconnect you randomly, meaning you have to wait to log back in. And a lack of some of the movie characters and lack of character clothing, but it's still made up by what is available. Another problem i've found is that some special attacks are down right over or underpowered, the father and son kamehamea does the tiniest bit more damage than a normal one, while taking three Ki bars, while the blue swirl used by burter can deal nearly 3/4 damage of someones HP if they get in the whirlewind at the start, and this has a large AOE, so potentially you could destroy the whole team with one move.  Overall i'd give it a solid 7.5 out of 10, if it were to be pushed up to an 8 or a 9, the moves would have to be balanced out a bit more, and the servers would have to be working better, I would reccomend this to fans of the show who want a good game, but to those not into the game, it might be better to wait for some of the problems to be fixed, though I'd imagine they'd still have a lot of fun playing this.",

While the gameplay does feel like a little bit of a simplification of the fast-paced, EXTREMELY skill-based combat of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, this is only because the game is more about RPG-based leveling and MMO interaction with other players. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the gameplay is shifted a bit away from skill and a bit more toward strategy. However, the BEAUTY of this game is how it's still extremely fun to play, with MUCH more emphasis put on supers, making the fights seem more action-packed by giving the players loads of ki from melee attacks. This kind of shorter battle makes the online play more bearable, as well.  The story of this game is just awesome. It's actually a totally unique story involving a new foe, who conveniently alters the timeline, requiring the players of the game to 'fix it' (i.e. fight various battles from the original DBZ timeline but with changes). For these fixes, you are first shown a cutscene of the situation the characters are facing, such as a gruesome scene with Piccolo firing the Special Beam Cannon, impaling Goku but......missing Raditz completely?! O NO! Yes some of it is a bit cheesy, but overall it's really fun, with tons of fully-animated cutscenes (FULLY LIP-SYNCED TO THE JAPANESE DUB, btw), as well as an AWESOME soundtrack, featuring synth-based orchestral pieces that sound like the original Japanese soundtrack and the Bruce Falconer soundtrack had a baby that was this game's soundtrack (ok that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but still it's great).   The thing that truly makes this game fun is getting to connect with friends and strangers alike and share your custom DBZ characters, playing VS matches online, and doing Parallel Quests online, allowing you to replay many parallel-timeline missions, which have various battle scenarios, some branching from the real timeline and others being completely changed ('what-if' saga, anyone?). Parallel Quests allow you to have fun with your friends (OR by yourself), while leveling up your character and giving you Zeni, allowing you to buy skills, consumables, clothing, and accessories from the game's vendors. You can replay a single quest as many times you like, as there are not only RNG-based loot drops but 'ultimate' finishes which you can attain by meeting various (unlisted) requirements for each mission, which are often simply absolutely reking the bejesus out of the mission and completely dominating the whole thing in a short amount of time.     So, with all that being said, if you liked the anime itself and the skill-based Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast series' of DBZ games, you will probably have loads of fun with this game, likely playing it for hundreds of hours. However, if you don't have the extra elements of nostalgia as well as familiarity with the gameplay itself, this game does have its drawbacks, such as a lack of polish on a few of its parallel quests, and, especially with me coming from a background of playing lots of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, not the most impressive amount of equipment, but still a huge amount. Additionally, if you are a person who dislikes games that make you earn your fun by being extremely difficult (such as Dark Souls), then you will likely dislike this game as well, because that's exactly what it is: really challenging but extremely awarding.  Even if you aren't a total diehard DBZ fan, taking the minor drawbacks into account and everything, you will likely still get a lot of enjoyment from this game, and for me to say that must really show a lot about how great this game is.   My final rating of the game: 9.5/10",

But,they could have added a few more main-ish characters/transformations.Including Majin Vegeta,Super Buu(With SSJ3 Gotenks/Piccolo and Ulimate Gohan),Gogeta SSJ1(From Fusion Reborn),Andriod 16,Baby Vegeta,Uub,Janemba(2nd form) and Imperfect Cell/Semi-Perfect Cell.That's only naming a few.  Now a few other things,besides having the Xenoverse story have separate Saiyan saga-Buu saga/Beerus saga to give the newer fans more history.Or having an offline tournament,which also includes difficulty levels increasing each time you win, where all the opponents are random and you can either win Zeni or a random item.  Now for some negative stuff.It gets boring after a few good hours of playing,leaving you only to grind or get destroyed in online battles (either from hackers/cheaters or Super Saiyan Spam).I would say something about the servers being bad but they pretty much fixed it so.  Now for recommending.If you're a huge Dragon Ball fan,it's totally worth the buy.Only if you're ok with some (maybe alot depending on RNG) grinding,and replaying PQ's to get the highest rank. For the second recommend.If your new to Dragon Ball,I would maybe read up on the history/story and wait for it to go onsale or something,but if you want buy it and enoy it.  Well there it is,I hope you found this recommendation good and helpful. :)",

While it lacks some gameplay, in that it becomes very repetitive, character creation, plot(?) and online/offline fights more than make up for it. Modding the game helps too - different charaters, different stats, new moves. And having the DLCS is a bonus for those extra missions and characters.  Anyway, where this game lacks in gameplay it makes up for in asthetic. Essentially the Sims without the BS that has, and with fighting.  A word of advice - If you're reading this now, in October, don't buy this game. Instead buy the much better Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. Same price, ♥♥♥♥ tonne more stuff",

            "review_text": "I have played this game both on xbox 360 and PC with a total of over 100+ hours and can say it is an awesome game!  First you begin fighting the almighty Frieza, then you move onto Perfect Cell and finish defeating the indestructible Buu but that is only the beginning of this journey of a game.  The things you get in this game are cool and worth the you get many ways to customize your character such as skill points, clothing, race and gender. Story line is awesome because it is a little different from many of the previous Dragon Ball games and has a cool twist to the end. Parrelel quests are a good feature, it adds a whole lot more content to the game and cool drops so you can repeat the same quests waiting for a skill or a piece of clothing to drop. I also find that the fact you can change your characters skills into being an all melee type badass to a Kamehameha blasting maniac gives the game a lot of variation in terms of what you want your character to be, also choosing the right race with the right stats can give you a massive boost of power in battle.  I would say the things to improve on this game is more options for your character such as more hairstyles, I would like to have more hairstyles such as Raditz's and Vegeta's style, the ones we get for them are pretty lame as almost everyone in DBZ has a cool looking hairstyle and we get these Also a nerf on the character's skills would be nice as when I like to go pvp you get people maxing out everything into one stat and you get 1 combo'd with melee attacks or an ultimate skill which is not that fair or fun in my opinion.  Other than that this game is good if you are a dragon ball fan or even if you are not a fan pick it up and within a week you could be sat there watching the whole Dragon Ball series! This is the first game I have picked up of the Dragon Ball series so I can not compare it to any others but this being my first game I was blown away when I first got in and was fighting frieza   ",

            "review_text": "This game could have been far greater than it actually is. I recommend to DBZ fans (as any hardcore fan can make it through any kind of related game), but as for players looking for a new detailed ground-breaking fighter, this simply isn't it. Get ready for a grind ladies and gents and get ready to break your X and Y buttons from repetitive mashing. In short, I like the game but it's hard to recommend for this price range.  It's well done, but if feels like it could have been done so much better. The general Toki Toki City area you get to 'freeroam' is slow paced at most, and for some reviewers, a shot in the dark and grind to do the next mission. I find simply moving about the level is a nuisance at most. Why not allow for flying? You have great characters and such a rich ability range to incorporate into the game, in and out of fighting! For something that could be so good, it's simply decent. Not only that, half the stations you go to are oddly 'closed' or unable to process your request. When they do work though, online parrallel universe fights with other players add some replayability to the game.  There are two basic modes to the game : freemode and fight mode. In free roaming mode, you essentially get to run around and either shop (for new skills, items, or clothing), talk, upgrade and change your personal stats, or choose between different game modes from either the story line or the online/offline parrallel universe modes (which are comparable to single matches). In fight mode, you get to do the juicy stuff like fly around and throw wild energy balls everywhere.  The story character creator is satisfactory, while the story itself is well integrated into the series. Maybe it's because I chose Namekian that I'm limited in options, it doesn't seem otherwise there is much to choose from in variety. Either way, the story line is a good addition to re-visiting old DB episodes. Gameplay itself isn't too shabby, but can sometimes seem all over the place. Flying is slightly choppy and isn't as smooth as it could be. The fighting seems nominal once you get how the teleportation and fighting system work, as well as the stamina. There is a lot of tutorials that slowly creep up on you, rush through them and it can be a rough play through. To me personally it seems at times random combo's and teleportation from side to side happen. In all honesty, I'd like to be in full control if I can dodge VIA teleporting or teleport to bounce the opponent to the other side of the map. The fighting has it's ups and downs, but when buttons start matching up to what your character is doing, there is a nice flow to what your watching in addition to being in control of. What was disappointing to me was there was no real feel of impact when you sent an opponent flying into the ground (there is an animation for it). Granted, there is some landscape that can be broken but it feels like crumping cardboard paper toghether, then it quickly unraveling back into perfect shape. The damage animations (not effects) are nice as breaking a tree with your opponents back but that permanent damage isn't there.   Visuals are nice and the custom character looks really good in cut-scenes. The fighting sounds seem on par, but addition of a few more sounds (especially collisions) would have enriched the auditory experience. What really drives me nuts is the music in the free roam. If being on repeat isn't bad enough, get ready to go nuts hearing the same song over and over. They have also incorporated built in phrases and actions the player can perform (such as waving or sitting). Credit definitely has to be given to the level creators as the places you can fight are all in the DB saga. Some locations you get to fight in are Kami's lookout, planet Namek, different places on Earth and even a stage outside of the Earth.  This game is good, but no where near worth it's stated price. I'm a huge DBZ fan and for what it's worth, I wish they gave a little more into the game. I like it because it's something I can relate to. Will you like it based on it's gaming aspect, or it's content? I have to give the game credit though for trying to give the player more than a story to play with. WIthin TokiToki city, you may run into a Ginyu force member or even Gohan asking you for help (with a sidequest). You can also ask different characters within game (like Vegeta or Piccolo in TokiToki city) to be your trainer. That voice will follow you to every debrief after every quest.  For future DBZ's give some freedom for the player to use the specials whenever, or at least have the choice to fly or walk in free roam. The incorporation of actions such as waving or squatting added a bit of depth to the open world. That I definitely liked and would like to see that again. Also, the attacks were well done (minus button mashing X and Y at times) but I feel there needs to be improvement for the vanishing system. Dodging consist of jumping in the air while doing a front flip, which is fine, but the actual trait of disappearing and ending up behind an enemy is the whole fun of the Dragon Ball universe! I'd like to be able to vanish half the map for half or more of my stamina, but the closer I am, let me jump around my enemy for a bit!  If this game was $15-20 I would recommend it, as of now though, no. To true Dragon Ball fans : I think you will enjoy the game and play a decent chunk of it. You may find the money's worth.   Rating : 7.35/10       Gameplay   B-     Story / Campaign   A-     Visuals / User Interface   B     Sounds / Music   B     Replay-ability   C+     Overall    B-     PS - I think the DLC's are overpriced.

My review may change as the game game gets updated and such.   Edit1: I still recommend this game its amazing but there is a major problem with the servers at the moment and i suggest to hold off on buying it at the moment until they fix the servers and some minor problems with vsync. When vsync is on for me it sometimes doesn't show the ki blast but turning it off fixes it.  Edit2: They managed to fix the servers a bit so were able to get on them and I haven't had any issues so thats a plus for you guys who have not bought it yet.",

            "review_text": "Alright, so let's start with my first comment: BUY THIS GAME. It is absolutely fantastic and a vital piece of gaming media for a Dragon Ball fan. I didn't think I'd like it, then I played it and now it's one of my favourite online games. I can assure you, you will love it.  Now, let's get down to pros and cons.  PROS:   Easy to pick up gameplay, tricky to master but not exactly 'hard'.  A fun, engaging experience that will have your attention for hours on end.  A steady levelling system that has you work for it, but doesn't grind your face in the dirt or require you put in hours to get a single level.  Gameplay and advancement are well-paced and don't require too much effort, though you're not just handed everything either.  Nice simple graphics that don't tax an average rig too much even at full power; a good offset to the major problem of PC gaming.  Smooth, comfortable integration of USB controllers, although the keyboard controls are just as easy to learn.  ==  CONS:  Some ridiculously difficult Parallel Quest scenarios that will have you seething with rage as if you were playing Street Fighter or KOF.  Server can be a bit laggy and interfere with multiplayer experiences at times; I played with someone only a few miles away and we still had a tricky time with collision detection and movement lag.  Customization. It's another game that presents itself as being highly customizable in terms of character creation, however when you actually get down to it, it's pretty limited. You can only change colours on a very small selection of outfits; the others are based off outfits from the franchise, and as you would expect, they kill the 'character creation' function because the moment the average gamer is given a creativity toy, their first instinct is to make things they already know, so everyone thinks they're Goku, everyone thinks they're Gohan, etc. and very few people actually bother to make an original character in this.  It's a Namco Bandai game. They do this all the time; they bring out a great game that shows so much promise, only give it a little bit of content expansion and then abandon it to work on an inferior title, in this case that new One Piece thing. With SoulCalibur V, they did the same thing to work on TTT2 which was massively inferior. So while they make great products, they're a rather careless and irresponsible company that don't care much for their own products (although they're definitely no Konami or EA).  ==  SUGGESTIONS:  Needs more interactive environments, especially in the hub world.  They should put in at least quite a few more expansions that focus on character creation. Most specifically, let us colour any outfit and let Majin go barefoot; perhaps also some footwear like sandals or ankle guards. What we have is extremely limited despite being presented as bigger than it is.  An actual chatbox so players can talk to each other with text. I appreciate the effort to filter out spam by giving us preset messages, but come on - a private chat window at least.  I hate to sound like a feminazi, but there are SO many great female fighters in the Dragon Ball universe that you completely ignored. There are about a half dozen playable females in this game and several dozen males. Just look at the Dragon Ball Wikia and take your pick; you should put in at least 10 more females.",

Although there are not so many visual options, there are litterally tons of dresses and moves that your character can learn. -An infinite amount of perfectly done animations for every move of the game. -Perfect music and sound effects -The game is not super easy. -You can make the Team Genew Pose (?) with other people. -It's Dragon Ball!  CONs -The game requires you to connect to a server to work, too bad that the servers still don't work properly. There is a way to play offline, but it is a bit tricky to do it and it ruins a bit the experience of the game. -Local multiplayer is really limited, you can only play single 1v1 matches in a single map. -The game is full of DLCs, and I hate this. Before the game was even out you could buy €25 of DLCs, and there was a DLC only obtainable through preorder. -The RNG component of the game should be revisited. While I think it's ok to grind a bit to get a powerful move, the pain you have to get through to farm Dragon Balls is just unbearable. -Chat system sucks.  Note: I didn't try out online yet, but looking at the forums the game has potential but needs a few patches to fix a few broken things.",

I was the last person among all my friends to have the game downloaded, yet i had the most played hours in just one day XD This game is absolutely the best DBZ game i've ever played in my life... but it has its cons, like low number of characters (but the amount of good characters and variations outweigh that).  Pros: - Best DBZ Game Graphics! Although graphics don't matter, this game captures the DBZ feeling so well! - Gameplay mechanics are easy-to-learn, hard-to-master For some reason, as i progressed through the game, i started using less complicated combos, but i should be practicing them in the future. - Create your own character Who doesn't wanna be a Z-warrior? and to top it off, you have 8 different variations of gender/race - A ♥♥♥♥TON OF REPLAYABILITY! The parallel quests are seemingly endless, and you'll find yourself replaying the same thing over and over again (still having fun with it) just to get that one skill or item...but you end up finding a hidden condition or something that rewards you with better stuff :D - All-new Story Without spoilers, i found the story really awesome (though it felt like a Time Squad rip-off xD), i loved the fact that there are 2 endings (if you defeat the final boss fast, before a certain somebody could come and aid you, you get the secret ending). - Deep interactions, like characters recognizing your CaC's race and commenting on such, or fun interactions like Vegeta SSJ4 with Beerus - A lot of other stuff like the Master System and such  Cons:  - Gathering the dragonballs is a pain in the butt, i still haven't gathered them all :\\ - Some missions you'll be pitted against 2 or 3 super saiyans at the same time, and those mofos keep spamming their ultimate because of their seemingly infinite ki, it kinda gets annoying especially when you need to finish the quest for an item or such - There's a bunch of glitches that happen often, though they're not that major and i'm sure they'll be fixed - Some missing characters/transformations (although some could be understandable) - The whole DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...tbh i feel with those people who were waiting for reviews to see if they should get the game or not...and they had a low chance of guaranteeing a 'preorder' copy of the game on any platform... seriously? ssj4 vegeta for DLC when goku and gogeta ssj4 are in the game? and i found files for great ape baby in the game...that's supposed to be $10 DLC  Overall 9/10 Why? the game is way better than the whole PS3/X360 gen games, and possibly better than Budokai 3 and Tenkaichi 3. the downsides are just technical things that can be fixed, but the DLC thing is an issue (if anyone is familiar with the DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that the game Evolve had, this is kind of the same thing).

Anycase this game is still progressing in its development in my book due to the matters of 3 player coop the servers tend to say nope not gunna work or in endless battles it tends to disconnect at times, but other than that I dont see the game for its faults but for the quality and awesome battles that can be spectated and fought.",

They could definitely have added some characters, it would have made a lot more sense plot-wise. But when you look past all that, this is truly a unique experiance that any Dragon Ball fan would enjoy (not counting the scattered continuity errors).  P.S.: If I had to some this game up in 7 words, it would be 'Dragon Ball OC Generator: The Video Game' P.S.S.: I know full and well that this game isn't being updated anymore, but they should really go back in and fix a certain mission in the Ginyu saga. If you've played up to that point, you'll know which one I'm referring to.",

Other then that this game is a fantastic game and I highly recommend it for it is a 10/10 for me. For what this game does bad gets heavily overweighed by what this game does good and I can let some inconsistencies slide when the overall game is great. if you are new to the Dragon Ball universe and want to buy this game you can but just know that you won't be getting the full story just the important parts. I also recommend you go watch the show before or after playing this game to really get to know this great universe that many have been known to cherish and love, and I feel it was a privilege being one of those people. I can't wait for Xenoverse 2 because I know that it will be just as good if not better than Xenoverse.",

            "review_text": "Great game, I played the Budokai series when they were first released and those were my favorite DBZ games for the longest time, but it looks like this game could top those. The combat is easy to learn and very fun, but it will take time to master and you can tell who has more practice.   The game story mode has you create your own character (Saiyan, Earthling, Namekian, Frieza race, or Majin) and you help Trunks prevent the villians from changing the DBZ timeline. The main story from other games is there, but it is a new take on the story which lets you battle along the Z warriors with your own character.  The game also has a online or offline hub called Toki Toki City which can hold up to 200 players when online. You will be spending most of your time between missions here as you can shop for new gear and equipment for your character and start missions (offline / online: quests, story missions, versus mode, etc). There is no traditional chat system in the game, but there are many emotes (Wave) or messages (Hello, Good Bye, etc) you can use to interact with other players.  Overall the game is really enjoyable so far and I am looking forward to what will be added in the future with DLC.   Pros  + Combat very fun and fluid + Controls are great and easy to understand + Graphics are the best to date for a DBZ game + Create / customize your own Z warrior + Different take on story mode + PC port (up to 4k resolution, 60 FPS)   Cons  - Dialogue isn't the great - Some of the voices seem out of place at times (overall voices are good though) - No SSJ2 or SSJ3 for created saiyans, but I guess its understandable * Not much of a con, but many people are having issues with grinding XP to get through story mode. Sometimes the battles will be a lot harder than the last, so you will need to do side missions to level up before you can progress in story. (this allows you to make battles easier or more challenging, depending on how fast you level)   Port Quality  * Runs great so far with no issues * Various HD resolutions up to 4K  * Choose 30 or 60 FPS * Minor graphic options (AA, Shadows, Bloom, Vsync, few others)  If you are a fan of DBZ and fighting games I would definitely pick this game up. It is really fun and creating your own character and leveling up through battles is a great feature in this game.",

Pro's -DBZ game -Not to bad fighting system (overlooking a few op combos) -New story arc to get involved in (as in your own character) -Race Selection for CaC is neat with each race having different stats  Middle ground -OK Character Customization, I wish there was alot more, but as it stands now it works for the most part you can pretty much make any character from DB into this game the eyes / hair / everything is ripped straight from exsisting characters (No Videl hair though for some reason...) -Farming Skills and Outfits, could be toned down a bit but its not a HUGE deal because you'll be playing the game anyway.  Con's -Fighting music is awful. -CaC does NOT allow any real PERSONAL choices, no Ki color, no Tail (for saiyans), no hair change for female SSJ, No making your own Attack (even if it was just copy paste with a changed name and Color shader) -Outfits, Outfits are the equivilant to equipment in RPG's they have stats and yes I would love to wear the schoolgirl skirt / top outfit all the time, but 4star outfit has +5 (instead of a +2) to my stats. Outfits should have been seperate and Equipment or more stat points should be given to fill this. -Outfits Part2, only some outfits can be colored to your liking, all the other stuff (again straight ripped from DBZ characters) can only be its original color. -Difficulty, some battles are extremely frustrating, others to easy, the final boss was a cake walk compared to buu and ginyu. Could use some tweaking imo. -Roster is smaller than previous DBZ games, pretty usetting. -Server Issues, they suck, like real hard, if your in single lobby even expect to get dissconnected every other mission and kicked to title screen, its like they made the server out of bubble gum and spare wiring.  Overall I'm loving it, I just wish there was more CaC options. 6/10 Would bang Videl (Before she cut her pony tails off)",

There's multiplayer vs but I haven't done much of it and it's probably bad. The game is not remotely balanced and you shouldn't expect it to be, which is fine.   There's a lot of questionable decisions that can make things frustrating on the collection end of things. Not only are ability drops random for the most part, but also the Mentor system is random as well. You can't decide who to be your mentor, you just have to wait for them to randomly show up. This is the most annoying thing for me about this game, because while drops are random for skills, at the very least you are actually playing the game, and the skills are tied to specific missions. The DLC adds mentors but a couple of them I haven't even seen or gotten the chance to train with yet, because they show up randomly, among the pool of your old mentors too.

STORY: The story focuses on your own created character. You can choose between a Saiyan, Earthling, Namekian, Majin or Friezas race. You are paired with Future Trunks to stop villains from destroying the timeline. You will fight battles from the Saiyan saga to Battle of Gods. The voice actors from Dragon Ball Kai all reprise their roles. Overall the story is plenty original and probably the best that can be done from a Dragon Ball game.   Gameplay: Unfortunatly gameplay is where this game struggles. While its always nice pulling off a Kamehameha or the distrcto disk. The actual combat itself is very shallow. Combos are down to when you stop pressing a light attack and start to heavy attack. Also if you go super saiyan you get unlimted ki attacks meaning you can literally break the game.   As this is an RPG you will have to complete side quests to reach a high enough level to continue the story. However there is also a massive grind to reach a level. (Unless you purchase the DLC when you get missions you can complete at a level you shouldnt be at. I managed to go up four levels in one mission because i played a DLC mission that was meant to be endgame but was too easy. There is also a master system where you can get charcters from the show to be your mentor. this can unlock new moves for your character. Yet the progression is way too slow. I went the whole story mode with only two mentors.   CONTENT:  At around fourty characeters, a story mode and a lot of side missions. DBX is certainly not lacking in that department. i have put in fifteen hours and have still only scratched the surface.    While it does have its flaws Dragon Ball Xenoverse certainly is a fun time.

Though, despite all of those issues, I think this game is worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of the series.",

            "review_text": "The game can get grinding since a lot of abilities and cosmetics rely on repeatable side quests and RNG on top of RNG but the game, IMO, is so much fun you hardly notice it. it's especially grindy if you min/max.  The story line is pretty basic someone is changing time, you're summoned to fix it in key parts of the DBZ story line. Which it does well for the most part. I actually found the PQ (side quests) a lot more interesting than the main quest since it's more alternate time line-ish like helping Freeza or one where Piccilo destroys namic.  Over all a fun game well worth the past steam sale purchase.  The things I didn't like...  - The AI, it's well your team mates are window lickers and the enemy AI makes Seth in SF4 look like a ♥♥♥♥♥ cat. Your AI if you're getting double teamed will be off in east jesus no where doing sometimes literally nothing. You have to protect one they'll have an unusual low amount of health far lower than when you have to fight them this ofc mean they should wander off to try and 1v1 freeza or gokuh.  - The same enemy AI will decide it's had enough of your ♥♥♥♥ and you WILL die. 'What a perfect kamehameha in the face psssh I moved at like the last second now i'm going to combo the ♥♥♥♥ out of you lol' OR 'nope i'm doing some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t move that makes me invincible.' It's like playing freeze tag with children 'I got you' 'NA UH I was on base'. sometimes it looks like they're just randomly flailing about which while obnoxious can be exploited since they will at times try so hard to just punch you the AI will walk right in to huge ki supers.,,repeatedly,  - Hit boxes are jankey your toe is scraped by a say galic gun and full damage omg you're dead lulz but the AI will know that it's one pixel out of range of you're super and abuse the ♥♥♥♥ out of that.   - You can't see the enemy stamina or ki but the enemy AI sure as ♥♥♥♥ knows the millisecond you're out.  The above can be summed up by saying 'I'm a super saiya-jin who beat Raditz, Vegea, Nappa, Freeza, perfect cell, Kid Buu in two 3v1 battles one after another then beat SSJG Gokuh, Breeus and a time god, can't finish a Death Ball cause yamcha sneezed on me.'  The most annoying thing though is ccut scenes in the middle of a battle you're doing a combo and nope we have to show Vegita get up cause he's not done yet...for the 10th time. An on screen alert or voice line could have accomplished this without a break in the action.  Yet it's still fun...seriously even with obnoxious AI and janky hitboxes it's still fun.  Story wise I liked it over all but a little disappointed, for one it seems edited for the kiddies there's scratches but no blood. Hercule isn't Mr Satan even with subs on the japanese track. The Gokuh/Piccilo vs Raditz fight no hole in gokuh's chest Piccilo has both arms.  There are some strange things left of of DBZ history like the whole android saga, all but the last fight of the cell saga, all but 2 fights of the buu saga. The android saga is the most disappointing since aside from my favorite it kinda fits the time traveling theme of the game..I mean a little..  I can excuse this as they didn't know how well this game would do so they wouldn't put that much time and resources into it but for the second one, we'll see.  Overall great game worth the money even with it short comings and all, Get it on sale or not, it's just a fun game even better if you like DBZ. As for the DLCs I got the bundle from the last steam sale so can't really say.",

            "review_text": "So here are my honest thoughts on Dragonball Xenoverse. Note that I have played about 24 hours of the game, have yet to beat it (Although I am on the last set of missions) and still have not done all the parallel quests or master trainings.  I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.  However, I am also a huge fan of the universe of Dragonball. And you really need to be a fan to get the most out of the game. The premise of the game is that you spend your time joining the 'Time Patrol' with Trunks in a place called TokiToki city, after he wishes for assistance from Shenron. Don't know who those are? Tough, its not explained. Again, you really need to be somewhat familiar with the universe of DBZ to get the most out of this.  YOu then spend your time doing Time Patrol missions which are basically you going back in time to correct 'errors' in the history of DBZ. You start by helping deal with Raditz, as somehow history was being changed to allow him to dodge the Special Beam Cannon attack, killing Goku but not him.  Again, if you have no idea what I am referring to, I can't help too much.  From there you uncover who is behind the strange time distortions. You also can do Parallel quests, which are basically side missions with alternate rules. In one you might help Frieza beat up the Z warriors. In another you might go and reenact the World Tournament against Yamcha, Tien, and Krillin.  You can also apprentice under various members of the DBZ Universe such as Piccolo, Vegeta, Gohan, Tien, Krillin, Android 18, Cell, Capt Ginyu, ect. You can thus learn their moves (Vegeta teaches Galick Gun and Final Flash for example, Ginyu teaches various fighting poses).  You also level up, raise your stats, and select your own combination of moves from the ones you have unlocked via PQs or Training.  And you will be grinding. A LOT. You can replay EVERY mission in the game, both story and PQ as many times as you want. And in order to level up to take on tougher challenges, and to get gear and moves, you need to grind PQs. I personally find the fighting fun so I do not mind so much. Collecting all the moves is a fun pastime for me.  Visually I love the art style, but I grew up on DBZ so it reminds me of happy times.  I can't speak too much on MP, as I have only been able to play in 1 single Multiplayer PQ without being kicked from the party (no idea why, maybe folks dont like Female Buus?). But it was fun to do, and the AI partners are no where near as smart as a player (Example: AI Goku with Super Saiyan on his moves list will NEVER BLOODY USE IT!)  Nothing makes me happier then punching Frieza in his smug Frieza face then hitting him with a Kamehameha followed by Milky Cannon. And maybe a Final Flash I dunno.  Be aware that some fights can feel cheap. Sometimes you gotta take on 2 fighters at the same time by yourself and they can easily ping pong you and wreck you. I cant beat PQ 32 because of this (stupid super saiyans and their stupid unlimited ultimate attacks)  So there ya go.  If you have ever dreamt of being a Z Fighter and helping to fight some of the big bads (I mean I got to face off with freaking MAJIN BUU!) then this is the game for you.  Also get the DLC. It lets ya level to 99, adds some cool extra fighters, and more masters and moves and gear.",

I will say, definitely worth it for what I payed. There are a few cons however  -A lot of the quest rooms people make in the servers (for me at least) are DLC quests. So you need to buy to play -Theres not a lot to do online, considering not many people are playing outside of private matches. (Again, could just be on my server) -Story takes a bit of getting into, not super interesting off the bat -Random gear drops on quests are a pain if you are looking for specific items  Aside from all that its a pretty great game so far, and I'll list some pros just to be fair -I personally love the animation style and graphics on PC -Hours of gameplay can go into the same few quests to unlock hidden conditions and get all the gear -Tons of quests, no shortage of stuff to do by yourself -Great levelling system (Skill points/Attributes+Gear) -Balanced gear effects (modifies stats and powers, scales with level) -Pretty good story, after you get past some boring bits -DLC is super worth it -Badass Character Creation   TL;DR: Very customizable, good game,decent story, online is decently active, buy the DLC Overall: 8/10",

Replayability due to sidequests and variances with races and playstyles    DLC is actually worth the money.  The bad:    Random Number Generator is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. When you fulfill the requirement to get an item or a secret ending for a sidequest, RNG dictates whether or not you are allowed you get the item or continue to the secret ending. Some items are only available in the secret endings so it causes you to replay it over and over and hope the RNG is on your side.    Most races are underpowered compared to saiyans who can transform.    Enemy AI can be terrible. (Any enemy that starts as a super saiyan in a fight will constantly use their ultimate because the transformation will not run out)    Grinding is necessary in the form of sidequests.    Unbalanced combat. Some races (Mainly saiyans and majins) have infinite combos that are easy to pull off.  Although it does have it flaws it is still a fun game to play and don't let my short playtime influence the review, I used to play it on PS4 before I got the PC version. Also its recommended that you use a controller, I haven't tried it yet but the keyboard/mouse controls look really clunky.  ",

Pros:  -You can make your own character! -MMO-lite systems to ensure that you'll be playing for quite some time.  -Character progression feels pretty straightforward and your power rise is noticeable. -Parrallel Quests have a good amount of replayability. -You can play with friends/others and do non-story quests together or beat each other up in PvP.  -Lots of skills, costumes, z-souls, and other stuff to unlock. -Looks freaking great. Everything feels very fast-paced and flying especially feels great. -Follows the deceased Dragon Ball Online's storyline, which is great to see a recovery of. -Has so much freaking potential just waiting to get unlocked in future DLCs/patches/sequels. -Dat DBZ Abridged Nappa cameo.  Cons: -Occasional bugs. Namely getting stuck in place and being unable to move (happens to both NPCs and Players). -Clothing gives stats... kind of defeats the purpose of collecting costumes and creating a custom character if it hurts your performance to a degree. -Combat feels a bit wonky and takes time to get used to. Could be more fluid. -Story is patchy in areas due to the nature of the character roster. -Doesn't really touch on Dragon Ball at all, just Dragon Ball Z and some of the movies. -Best played with a controller, in my opinion.  Either/Or: -Customization is there, but it's a bit limited in areas where it could be better (i.e. Saiyans don't have tails, and most clothing can't be recolored to your choosing). -In general feels like they could do a lot more with the game, but at the same time there's plenty as-is. -Server stability is wonky at the moment, but that's to be expected with such a big launch. -The character roster is a bit questionable in areas (i.e. picking fodder characters Appule/Raspberry over Zarbon/Dodoria or even Cui), but covers the main stuff and a bit more. -Things like transformations and powering up are a bit wonky because they take up skill slots, hampering your ability to use all four skill slots for the numerous physical/ki/defensive abilities.  Overall this is ALMOST what I could consider as THE definitive DBZ experience. If they do a sequel that improves on existing systems and fills the character roster out, it would be an easy 10/10. For now though I'd give this a good 9/10 for DBZ fans, 8/10 for non-DBZ fans.",

            "review_text": "First of all I will say this.. The game is very far from perfect. In fact it has a lot of little flaws that caused annoyance for me in my play time thus far.  First things first lets asses the minor flaws that cause those who nit pick to cry. NIT PICKERS READ HERE: The game starts, Intro movie plays, all good right? Well Until you realise it's about to play again and now it cant be skipped. Next up is the voice acting.. Credit to the NA developers where it's due the voice acting isn't bad, it's just a little off from time to time. It seems like this was a translating issue but there are little things. Sometimes the characters talk telling you something, but it's like they were supposed to say something else or you get called a he if you are a girl. This didn't bother me too much personally but it does leave cracks in the imersion of the games story.  The controls, I think this is most peoples main gripe about the game. The controls cannot be customised from what I could work out and this causes a lot of issues for controller users like myself who are limited to 2 preset configurations which are both horrible.  That pretty much sums up the bad for me the rest are really small things that simply I personally can overlook.  Story: The story is pretty solid apart from a few missed oportunities. The story also could have provided a far more difficult end challenge. Sometimes I felt as if the some of the early really drawn out sequences were a little too much but the end game fight is just a single battle against an enemy with pretty horrible abilities that 2/3 times don't even connect. For that reason the last boss was a little dissapointing but once again I got over it.  Game Play: I personally think the gameplay is awesome! Once you get used to the controls gameplay is fun, challenging sometimes and overall solid. One thing I will say is I hated the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2 transformation abilities. Put simply I think it's really off canon. I would have liked to have seen it be made better perhaps giving all races a transformation of some sort and making transformation equip slots with pros and cons to them all. Running out of super saiyan randomly is really annoying and feel like it's happening for no reason when you can power up again and transform again.  What would of been better is to make it like this Earthling: 2 tranform slots kaioken and kaioken x3 Sayian: Super Sayian 1 + 2 or Kaioken Frieza: Body apperence changes twice for power increase Majin: Absorb upto 2 opponents with less than 25% HP  Overall the game is solid but not without it's nit picky flaws. Buy at own risk.",

            "review_text": "I debated over whether or not to give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down. There's a lot I like about it, and a lot I dislike about it. The most compelling factor is the custom character aspect of this game, which has separate sexes and races (for most races.) The customization options are alright, though I honestly would have liked a bit more. I also owned Ultimate Tenkaichi for the Xbox 360, which dealt with the character customization too. On actually making a character, while only for that one race, UT actually felt a bit more in depth in certain ways. There were things like auras and fighting styles you could choose from, which felt nice. Also, going Super Saiyan didn't just turn your hair yellow, it changed shape and such, as it should. It's simple things, but they made your character feel all the more like your character. When it comes to the clothing, I find a problem with the fact that they give stats. Instead of just dressing how you like, you're going to want to pick certain clothing just because it's the best one stat wise for your character. Saying this, however, I do appreciate the fact that you can have different set loadouts to choose from, so it offsets the problem slightly. These are some of the minor problems, and I have other small grievances as well, such as the fact that you have to walk back to the parable quest area after each quest, but they aren't game breakingly terrible. On the large problem side, I have two. The most prevalent one, which has been mentioned before, is the servers. There's nothing quite like paying $50 for a game to have the wonderful experience of watching a circle spin on the loading screen, having your game get stuck there, or all around crashing. The problem isn't mine alone, as I have 5 other friends all going through the same thing. This is a game breaking problem, considering I can't play it when I want, and when I can, it's after getting on and off the servers over and over. They really dropped the ball on this one. The other problem is the ease of which people can cheat on this game. 3 of my aforementioned friends have done it themselves already, so I know it's relatively easy. If a player wants to cheat on their own game, I don't care very much, but other players are using it to play against each other online in competitive battles, and there are no repercussions to this. All of this combined has marred my experience with this game as a whole. On the positive, however, I do have some to say. For one, it's a Dragonball game with character customization. Sweet. The option to play with up to two players online in the missions is also a huge plus. It has a DBZ Sagas feel to it, but done better. The combat as a whole is better than UT, which was that games biggest downfall, and it flows pretty smoothly. When it comes to using moves, this game is nice in the fact that not everyone is going to use the same moves. Most moves have drawbacks of some sort to them so, unlike UT, not everyone has the need to run a whole kit of Broly's moves for the simple fact that they're the best. I currently run one of Nappa's moves, which happened to be the first thing I unlocked. I was really worried about that aspect, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. The story line was okay, though rather short. The parallel missions make up for that though, and the acquisition of items and moves is clearly the focus of the game anyway. Replay value is high in the sense of you having enough character slots to have a character of each sex/race possible, but all items and equipment is shared through each character. That is a good thing, and a bad. Once I get everything initially, I can just power level all my other characters to a high level. Regardless, I still see a lot of play time coming from the game, even if half of it is at the loading screen. Overall, I've enjoyed playing the game, when I can, and I give it a thumbs up in the hopes that they fix the server issue.",

            "review_text": "Xenoverse is a game with some problems.  The character roster is severely lacking, combat is pretty simplistic, online rarely functions properly (and when it does, you're far more likely to encounter a cheater than not), the transformations are... poorly implemented, the environments are very small, and the visuals fail to adequately capture Akira Toriyama's classic style.  But none of that matters. Why? Because it's a fun Dragonball game--something we haven't seen in years. With a robust character-creation system--something we've never seen before. And an original storyling that's actually fun--something we've never seen before.  Being able to create your own Dragonball character and go wild, levelling up, completing quests, learning new skills, etc., etc. is an absolute joy for any Dragonball fans. So while the game as a whole may still be inferior to the oft-praised Budokai Tenkaichi 3, it's a helluva lot better than any other Dragonball game since then, and is just as promising of a game as the first Tenkaichi is.  If DIMPs can keep the license, I am very excited to see this series improve. If any game could steal the crown from Tenkaichi 3, it would be a XenoVerse sequel.",

It's definitely a return to form for the DBZ games and the time travelling story is presented well. I don't have much to complain about in the combat and single player department. It has a strange, almost Monster Hunter-like system where there are side missions you can do over and over and get different/better rewards each time, and you can also do these co-op online in addition to the story mode. Unlocking most characters is pretty easy and seems to be done just by progressing the story, along with kitting out your own custom character.   My complaints are pretty minor: The script lacks much originality and the acting is passable but you can tell they didn't have great lines to work with in the first place. It's also annoying that it dumps you about 35 steps away from the quest counter after a side mission and you have to walk back over to get a new one, and there is no run or dash in the hub area. You also can't preview equipment before you buy it, and the stats they give you are pretty vague but luckily don't seem like they're extremely important.   Female Buu's are way too cute!",

            "review_text": "It's been a long time since I had any hope for a Dragon Ball game. Xenoverse promised a lot but did it ultimately hold on to those promises? Well sort of yes. It did. This is my short and rather biased review of Xenoverse.  Dragon Ball Xenoverse is the next game in the series of Dragon Ball games released by Dimps. People who have made fairly succesfull Dragon Ball titles in the past such as the Budokai series. The game's story takes place in a time when a group of people called the Time Patrol notice there are several fractions of time being disturbed causing history to change. Since violating the timeline is a bad thing and there seems to be a lack of heroes these days the Dragon Balls are used to summon a hero strong enough to help solving this time crisis. This hero is you.  The game starts by the player creating his or her own Dragon Ball hero. There are five different races. Majin, the pink Buu looking creatures. Saiyans, everybody's favourite spiky haired monkey people. Earthlings, your plain general people on the earth (which are oddly missing all the animal variety of people you see thorough the show). Namekians, the green slug men from space. And lastly the Freeza race, everybody knows Freeza, right?  Each of the game's races and genders have different stats so race does matter. For example Namekians are tough and generate stamina quickly on their own while Freeza race is extremely fast and has a stunning Ki attack replacing the regular Ki pew pews.  You get to customize your character. This includes mainly the size and what your face looks like plus colouring the whole thing. The real customization after that comes from the game itself. There are tons of different outfits and accessories to buy using the inworld money Zeni which you earn by the truckload while playing. All in all the variety of user created characters is pretty good. It could be better for sure but it works as it is for now and you can see plenty of different people online, provided if you actually ever get online.  You're then unleashed into the game world, TokiToki city, which is where everything in the game happens. In that place you physically walk in the Dragon Ball world, talk to people, take on quests, buy things and all that stuff. It reminds me of Fable 3's horrible Sanctuary in a way, but in this case it doesn't bother me since it's only a world you move in. All the important thigns such as choosing skills, increasing your characters attributes and putting on accessory or clothes is still handled through a regular menu options.  Dragon Ball Xenoverse looks really good. The visuals are nailed very well and the game looks like the anime and manga. And they even got the lip sync done right this time. There's not much to say about the graphics. I guess the only part which I didn't like too much was some of the ground textures in TokiToki looking out of place and too realistic for a DB game but that's about it.  The game opens up with the main quest for you to follow and once you advance in that you open up more options. For example when you begin the game the stores in the city are closed, but after a while you're introduced to all of this one by one untill you everything from shops to paraller missions are accessible to you. Talking about paraller missions.  Along with the game's main story you unlock a large variety of paraller missions. These are 'What if' stories basically where you end up doing plenty of different things. Each quest has its main objective and also hidden goals which you only find out by trial and error. Knowing what happens in the manga and anime though can help you unlock some of the hidden goals. Doing these missions is your bread and butter when it comes to leveling up your character. There's also a random loot system for each of these missions and you may earn rewards from healing items to different outfits and most importantly new skills, depending on how well you beat the mission.  Leveling up grants you a level, which makes you stronger against lower level enemies and also gives you three skill points to share between six diffrerent stats: Max health, Max Ki, Max, stamina, Basic Attacks, Strike Supers and Ki Blasts. Putting a point in any of these stats increases their effectiveness and you can end up with a great variety of different stat builds which in turn lets you play your character the way you want.  Fighting in the game looks very familiar to all of those people who have played Budokai Tenkaichi or Raging Blast. Characters soar in the air and shoot beams at eachother and punch themselves through walls. The way the fighting works has a simple beat 'em up formula to it, but don't let it fool you. Mastering it takes a while and learning what move set and play style works the best for you. The game has basic melee attacks light and heavy ones. You can chain these attacks together freely to create insanely long combos if you know what you're doing. In addition you have four super attacks which can be Ki balls, beams, explosions and the like or melee strikes such as the melee combos from the show some people might be familiar with. There are also supporting skills which get you out of troubles, charge your characters Ki or just generally make a particular situation easier for your character. You can also equip two special moves which are extremely powerfull but require a lot of Ki to use, such as Reccoom's Ultra Fighting what ever Bomber? or Kid Buu's planet destroying energy ball. Combining these is fun and works very well and I was positively surprised to see how amazing the fighting system is even with all its simplicity. It's not all good though. The controls can be frustratingly clunky to a new player and even after a while once you get used to taking your character out there to fight people it still feels needlessly sticky. Also Ki attacks aren't really what you would expect or what you've been used to if you've played any of the Budokai series games for example. The attacks are done right and they look the way they should, but the 'oomph' is missing. No big explosions, no blinding flashes. Even the strongest attacks just feel dissapointingly washed out and simple. It's a bit like throwing beach balls at people. The impact is the same.  The game is cearly meant to be played with friends and online. The AI in the game is horrendously bad. Not the enemy AI, the team AI is what I'm talking about. If you have NPC's helping you or you get to choose people from the roster for the paraller quests be ready to dissapoint and rip your hair out. The friendly AI is not only dumb and useless. It tries to help you. Emphasis is on the word TRY. More often than not your AI partners just get in your way, ruin your long, game winning combos or special moves and generally act as a constant annoyance. Luckily you don't have to take those people with you for the quests if you don't want to, but there are still the mission specific AI allies who are out there, looking to get themselves killed, especially if your mission objective is to... say, have that guy survive till the end.  The online part of the game, at the time of writing, is still broken. You can't get online and it's no possible for me to interact with people who play the game online. So I have no experience of creating groups and taking on quests together. I managed to play a few one on one matches and a single paraller quest by being directly invited into a game. It provided to be good fun and I really enjoyed it the little time it lasted.  As my final words I would suggest getting this game. It's hands down the best Dragon Ball game to come out in a long time and if you're a fan of the games, shows or the manga you most likely wont be dissapointed. The game has plenty of content to keep you busy for a while and once the online part of the game gets fixed to a playable state it can only get better.",

AKA Easy to pick up, harder to  master.  +Decent story (Though it is basically fanfiction of a self-insersion Deviantart OC, ha)  +Seems to be a decent amount of post story content to do, namely PvE content in both solo and co-op.  The bad  -Silly hub world that could just as easily have been a menu, very slow to walk through and key NPCs I want to speak to spawn at random, often not appearing at all, only shuffle about when I do a mission and get back.  -RNG drop rates of certain skills, equipment and z-souls is total bullcrap. A mentor asks me to get a specific soul from a mission I could do as early as lv10, I've now beaten the main story hours later and despite over 20 attempts I have yet to get the z-soul I want.   To summarise; in each mission you have X drop, to get X drop Y event must occur, Y event has Z requirement during the mission. Such as beating all enemies in under 5 minutes which spawns an additional enemy that MIGHT drop the item you want. But here's the kicker; that event only has a CHANCE of occuring in itself when the requirements are met. This does not belong in a fighting game.  -Servers are crapping themselves right now, BanCo is aware of it however so this may be fixed eventually.  -Sadly, the game has NO anti-cheating measure. There are already trainers and ini tweaks around which are easily used and make your character absurdly powerful, beyond what is actually possible. This also works in PvP.  -Speaking of PvP; like all DBZ games, if someone picks an extremely powerful character from the show, you may as well give up on the spot. SSJ4 Vegeta for example, who was a pre-order bonus only of all things, is frequently picked because he simply has an absurd amount of health, damage and so on compared to about 90% of the roster. If you're expecting balanced PvP, look elsewhere, unless you're okay with choosing powerful characters all the time.  -PC specific bugs, Examples; -Teleporting doesn't work properly, instead of moving you behind the target you just 'blink' on the spot. This works fine on the console versions. -If you use an ulti ability, pause, alt-tab, tab back in and unpause, your character will perform the ultimate move AGAIN without costing ki or stamina. This does not work in multiplay as it requires a pause but it makes a lot of PvE very easy if abused. -Some people are reporting the ki blast effects are not displaying correctly  -AI cheats a bit, having infinite ki and stamina (Not visible to the player, but when an AI spams ulti's something is up).  -Some PvE fights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ without absurd amounts of healing items, many of these can only be done solo, no friendly AI or co-op.   So, would I recommend it? Yes. If you are a fan of DBZ, this is a very good release. Non-DBZ fans however may find little to like as the whole thing is basically just fabservice. If you're on the fence, wait and see if some of these issues are cleaned up in the coming weeks or months. The combat isn't as finely tuned as Tenkaichi nor is the roster as big but it's perfectly good as is.",

Spelling mistakes (such as misspelling Beerus' name) plague this game, which is a big, red flag for a game priced at 50 euro. Apart from that, Xenoverse is simply put, a very poor Dragon Ball game. Excluding certain story characters such as Zarbon; Dodoria; Android 16; Dr. Gero; Imperfect and Semi-Perfect Cell or Majin Vegeta, it also skips a huge chunk of the Sagas presented in Dragon Ball Z.  Due to not including the necessary characters. The Namek Saga starts off with the Ginyu Force because Cui, Dodoria and Zarbon aren't present. The Cell Saga begins with Perfect Cell because Imperfect and Semi-Perfect Cell aren't present. The Android Saga doesn't include Androids 16, 19 or Dr. Gero. The Majin Buu Saga skips everything related to Gohan and Videl, Majin Vegeta and the Supreme Kai. It just feels lazy.   The game is riddled with artificial difficulty and grinding, too. You will have to fight multiple opponents that can very easily stunlock you by spamming super or ultimate attacks. Very often, opponents will have Super Armour (or was it called Hyper Armour?) too, meaning you can't even stun them by attacking.  It's no surprise so many players are resorting to spamming ultimate attacks while transformed as Super Saiyan.  The game prides itself on the ability to create your own character too, but this doesn't stand out much either. You get a few races to pick from (Freeza's, Namekian, Majin, Earthling or Saiyan), where Earthlings and Saiyans have the exact same options for customization. As Majin, you get the choice between Fat Buu or female Kid Buu(-ish); no Super Buu at all. You can't even change your Ki colour or your fighting style (your regular punches and kicks). Why can't we opt to take the same fighting style as Vegeta, Piccolo or Freeza? You can train under all of them, but they only give you a few super and ultimate attacks instead.  The last point is grinding. Yes, this game includes the ability to trade items, but only the very low levelled ones. For the rest, you'll have to resort to grinding. If you aren't lucky, you might have to spend hours upon hours redoing the same mission for that one attack, or that one piece of clothing you want.",

It's not extremly terrible of course, but the negative points are pretty overwhelming, once they start to actually occure. But here is a typical pros and cons list.   Pros:  - The fighting system is pretty intuitive and easy to learn, yet hard to master. Zooming around in huge 3D areas and pounding enemies into the ground or mountains is super fun. - All animations and sounds are as close to the anime as it can get. You get a little reaction shot for super moves, your character shouts it's name, etc. - There is a universe of possibilities for character customisation. Most likely every costume, attack and super move that ever occured in the manga or anime, and probably more, are in this game. You can unlock those via the story missions or parallel quests. - Hence, you can level up your character and invest points in stats to form him/her like you wish. You can be a melee powerhouse or a ki-blasting ranged fighter.  - You replay every important fight in the story mode with your custom character, from Raditz to Beerus, the whole Saga is there. - You can gather the seven Dragon Balls to get Shenron to grant you a wish! Pretty cool! - The voice acting is just like in the anime!   Cons:  - The voice acting is just like in the anime! - The music is repetative and more or less not even existent. - NPCs never shut up in fights. They repeat the same lines over and over, its extremly annoying. You can mute the voices in the options, sure, but that also mutes fighting grunts which I would like to have. - The story is nothing super exciting or original. Bad guys try to alter the time lines and destroy the universe or whatever, you're a time cop and have to stop them. - The hub world was a terrible idea. It's slow and just annoying to get around in. - Loading times are pretty long, worst is the simple connecting to the server. - When you fail a story mission, you have to skip through all the cutscences again, instead of just starting over the fight. - While the fighting is pretty fun, the experience gets pretty much drowned by some super annoying things:   Sometimes the camera lock doesn't work properly and you shoot your super into nothingness. When someone hits the ground, even NPC enemies, they gain invicibilty frames, which cancels the damage for most epic combos. Pound your enemy to the ground and blast them with a charged Kamehameha? Won't do any damage. You can switch targets with the right stick, but the portals with which you change areas can be targeted aswell, even when enemies are around. When you lock on on a distant enemy, another just can zoom in front of you and start attacking you, without you even noticing. Friendly NPCs who have to survive sometimes, don't know how to dodge enemy super attacks and die quickly. The AI in general is pretty bad. The list go's on...  - There are no ingame stats for items or skills what so ever. Wanna know how much damage this skill does in comparision to your other? Have to try it out first. - The game is entirely based on RNG. You need a certain item or skill from a certain parallel quest? Well, good luck, for it is luck and luck alone that even the requirements are met for the item to drop. - Most parallel quests are just recycled, you fight the same round up over and over again. Super boring. - And probably the worst about the whole game:  Because of the RNG and increasing difficulty in the story mode, it is a gigantic grind fest.   Until I hit the point in the story mode in which I had to fight the two androids, it was pretty fine. Cell was ok to fight, but 17 and 18 pretty much insta killed me without any chance to react. Fine, I thought, doing more parallel quests, unlocking more stuff and so on, it's fun. But holy cow, the parallel quests get longer and longer, and you have to do like 3-4 of them get a level up and 3 points to increase your stats. (Wow) And it's aaaaalways the same!  This is the kind of game which lures you in with exciting gameplay and hooks you with unlocks and motivation, but the longer you play it, the more you realise it's unfortunatly riddled with flaws and bad design choices which makes the experience annoying and not fun anymore.  Edit: After I managed to unlock the Super Saiyan ability for my female Saiyan, I beat the whole story mode in one sitting around lvl 35. How? Because you can exploit the NPC's easily with an ability called 'Vacation Delete.' Super Saiyan let's you spam ki-skills with no limit, just draining the bars slowly. This ultimate attack has a big hitbox, does moderate to high damage and stuns the enemy for like 5 seconds. You do it over and over and over, and the enemy has no way to get away until they're knocked down. How did they not change this? I cant believe it's intentional. Completly broken.  Also to mention, if you're a die hard fan of the franchise you will get enjoyment out of this game, for a while at least. It's the holy grail of Dragon Ball fanservice, if you will. And if you like this kind of grind go for it, I guess, but not for the full price, game wise it's definitly not worth that amount.",

Im not going to focus too much on the positives since there is so many of them and instead i will be evil and tell you what currently at the release doesent work that well.  Issue nr.1  Settings menu, especially the sound options... The game is quite loud and there isnt much you can do in game to change that. Instead of a normal audio slider its just 5 different steps. That poses a issue since even on the lowest the music is too loud for my taste. Same goes with attack audio. Just wish they used a normal slider like 0-100...  Issue nr.2 Connecting to the bloody XENOVERSE Servers... need i say more? Launch game, trying to connect... go make dinner, eat it, come back and its still trying to connect. I have to literally disconnect from my internet atm to be able to play the game. Another issue is that it kicks you to the start menu most of the time after you do a 'offline' sidequest... Probably due to it trying to update leaderboards....   Issue nr.3  The camera.... Not really a issue, its just that the mouse settings have the same bar that the audio has so controling mouse speed to be able to turn properly and look around is hard. Also the camera is still way faster then it should be even at minimum. Just another taste related issue ^^  Even with these easy to fix issues i will give the game a 8/10 and it also gets a 'I totally recommend this game!' sticker. The game is really good and the variety in skills just makes it so playable.",

            "review_text": "In short: I do recommend this game, but only to hardcore dbz-fans who do not mind grinding for equipment. If you're one of those people, rest assured, you'll get your moneys worth out of this game. If you're not, you better stay away from this one. Save your money for a sequel.  Extended info: Despite this game having great customization which you can find in both equipment and the way your character gains strength as you level up. (You gain status points which you can use to increase their offensive or defensive capabilities like you see in many rpgs.) It fails on a few key elements.  First and foremost, there is the AI in dragonball xenoverse. You'll often hear people complaining about the difficulty of xenoverse, and where in some games this comes from a dangerous but fair AI (-read 'Dark Souls'-) in xenoverse the difficulty comes from the unbalanced power of the AI opponents.   All fighters in xenoverse have a stamina bar, and if you want to use evasive moves, or block incoming attacks, your stamina will drop. The problem is that many of these evasive moves also inflict damage on the attacking enemy. In a player versus player match this would not pose a threat but the AI seems to have a different stamina bar that regenerates ridiculously fast in comparison to that of a player. This means that the AI is going to spam these evasive moves to get out of a players combo. When sooner or later you yourself run out of stamina and your opponent doesn't, be prepared to take in damage despite having the upperhand. This damage will be magnified if there is a level difference between you and your opponent. Did I mention many strong opponents can't even begin to be combo'd unless they lose stamina first?  Another issue is the hub world. I understand what the developers wanted to create, but they made some mistakes here. For one the world is far too big for what is actually in it. The running around is boring and annoying in an otherwise fast paced game. This is made worse by the fact that after each mission you'll be dropped at a difference place than where you accept missions. This should be easily fixable by adjusting 3 lines of code however.  Another thing I should mention is that there is a transformation that is only available to the saiyan race. This transformation called super saiyan, unlike its effect in the dbz universe, presents the player with a 'limited' time of being able to spam ultimate and super attacks. While this will not pose a problem in pvp to experienced players who can dodge these attacks, it does seem to be the best way to counter the unbalanced AI. This ends up demoting the at first difficult AI to nothing more than silly target practice.   Despite all of this, you can have a lot of fun teaming up with up to two friends simultaneously to tackle missions and grind for equipment. Which brings me to the last problem of this game. Many rpg games, including this one will give you slightly random rewards. This is a great way to add replayability and fun, trying to get that one special item. The problem here however is how xenoverse handles this. Instead of only rewards being random, some events that give you these chances to obtain rewards are also random. Quite a mouthful, right? Let's rephrase that, you'll have a random chance, to obtain a random chance, to obtain your item. This is simply bad design that leads to frustration. Especially considering some of these random events, aren't random, but need to be triggered by certain hidden objectives that are nowhere mentioned in the game. This way you never know if that event that might give you your desired item happened by chance, or by some random teammate's health being below a certain point when you finish the mission. A perfect example of bad design.   So, yes, this game has flaws. A lot of flaws. But there is a silver lining to it all, if you are true dragonball fan and you like games where you have to do repeated tasks to get your favorite items or level up, you'll like this game. You'll probably end up getting mad once or twice, but I can assure you it's worth a buy. If however either one of those two conditions are false. Avoid this game at all cost.   ",

You have only one transformation possible per character, and no option to go back to normal unless your KI is depleted.

There is no option to set time to unlimited for fights or even to set difficulty, not to mention customize standard roster. You can only equip things for your character and if you want to find them prepare for hours or days of stupid grind and repeating same long quests and boring fights against and with horrible AI.

However, the game does have its good moments, such as the campaign, customization, and many other things.  Now, why is this game not recommended? Because it was NOT made for PC.

(e.g. Vegeta during Saiyan saga to Buu saga) + Ressurection 'F' DLC content, including Golden Freiza.  Cons: - Online matchmaking is close to dead at this stage. (By the time of this review) - PVP is unsurprisingly broken and crap. - Special/Ultimate Attacks are the only defining factor for characters. - Combat could be seen as shallow as a result. - Prepare to hear players spam their attacks continously, and give you little opportunity to contribute in a quest. - Your character only goes up to Super Saiyan 1 in appearance. - Loot awards are mostly random - Special quest conditions are only activated randomly even if you fulfill them. (e.g. Fighting Super Saiyan 2 Gohan requires beating everyone else first before Gohan. Strangely, the game will only acknowledge that you did this 25% of the time)   Conclusion: If you held off on Xenoverse, it may have been for a good reason. Still, customising and developing your own hero/heroine may grow on you. In the UK at least, finding viable matches for quests and PVP is quickly becoming hard as a lot of players have already have moved on from the game.  If a Xenoverse 2 has (ever) been announced by the time you read this review, you may be better off waiting for that.",

Well, it might seems fair.. but if you can't complete a simple mission because gohan or crillin keep dying.. well.. you judge. Afterall you've gotta take care of your team, still, I don't like.  OK: The combat system is really good, even if you'll end up with bouncing eyeballs. NOT OK: Gameplay: reminds me of when I played pokemon on gameboy. You gotta press A on controller on every dialogue to continue.. The movements, places, dialogues between npc and players.. It seems like playing a gameboy porting.  Too bad I didn't buy on steam because I'd have asked for a refund, the multiplayer (unless you've got already some friends to play with) Is quite poor.  I'd not recommend because I wish Dragon ball to be developed by a non asian company. It's not their job. Would have been better for this title a touch of improvements like the newest game.  The videos inside the game are amazing, one of the few thigs I love of this game.  Price of steam cards way too high, like 0.20 cent each card.. guys come on.. they're just cards!",

It mixes elements of RPGs and Fight games well enough that you don't seem very much in games which is unique in its own way.  You play as a unnamed custom created character helping future Trunks playing through the main storyline Dragon Ball Z, GT and Movies (GT and Movies are only available through DLCs) through time distortion created by familiar villians from Dragon Ball Online and GT. The main story line can be cleared quickly in about 4 to 8 hours which is short for a $60+ game however there are parallel quest which extends this to about 20 hours if you want to unlock everything.  Character creation is decent enough although they could have added more variety, although races are unbalanced, saiyans being the weakest while Earthlings are overpowered as hell, while the other races are well balanced enough to hold on their own. Customization is bad really, really bad, limited selection of clothes and the clothes don't explain alot and don't really provide good bonuses, it would be better if they allowed you to customize the clothes yourself.  Gameplay wise this game is meant to play with a controller which makes it a crap ton easier as the mouse and keyboard feels stiff as a stale french loaf which you can use to hit someone's face and make them bleed. Fighting is decent enough although it is nothing complex. In game AI is stupid and useless which could use improvements as they are easily dispatched with a KI spam character. AI battle assistance are stupid as ♥♥♥♥ they are only good at helping reviving you but they are ♥♥♥♥ against their own when fighthing another AI.  The game hub is tedious.  Online for PC, is non-existant and broken as ♥♥♥♥, there are cheaters everywhere with infinite health and ki and one hit kills you. Its much better to play this offline. Chat needs to be improved. Microphone excess would be great. They could have a better security against online cheaters.  Despite all its flaws. This game is a guitly pleasure of mine. Purchase this game if you enjoy Dragon Ball or you are a Dragon Ball fan.  Rating: 7.5/10  PROS: - Lots of skills to collect from the Dragon Ball Universe - Basic RPG elements - Combos everywhere - Parallel quests - Masters you can train under and collect their trademark skills - Grinding Dragon Balls and summoning Shenron  CONS: - Controllers a must - Online  - Customizations (MODS is a must) - Races are unbalanced - Tokitoki is too big and troublesome to navigate to go through just to get what you want - Shenron wishes",

            "review_text": "Warning: This review may be slightly influenced by my love for DBZ, so be advised. Now I've played through this game three times, each time just as enjoyable as the one before. I highly recommend this game, but theres some things I should mention.  Pros! This game is a great fighting game, and as with most fighting games this one is best with a controller rather than mouse and keyboard. Why I suggest using a wired controller for this is because of the way this game works, most of the time you'll be in the air fighting rather than on the ground. Without a controller it takes a bit of getting used to manuvering while flying, like rising and lowering your altitude to get closer (or further away) to your target. This leads me to another reason why using a controller is supreme. Ultimate and Super Attacks. I have to say this was probably the most fun to experiment with when your playing XENOVERSE, as your ultimates and supers can pretty much make or break your character depending on the way you go with character customization (I.E: using a ton of melee based supers when doing a Ki based character) I suggest you mess around and have fun getting your ultimates the way you like it. Now I can go on for a while about the great things in this game, like character customization. But theres somethings you should know if you plan on playing Xenoverse.  Cons: *Sigh* This game is really awesome, but some of the features can ruin your fun. Lets start with least favourite feature of this game... Random Number Generator... Oh where do I begin with this pile of crap. RNG is used for the drops in this game, which can lead to hours or days farming for a super, ultimate, item, or a piece of armor. This is probably what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most in this. I spent hours farming for Super Vegeta 2 (one of the transformations) and still haven't gotten it. Even though I've gotten Z-ranks almost every time I did the mission it was on. So I spent upwards of eight or nine hours farming for it, and at some point gave up on farming for it. So if your playing through this and hoping for a certain item be prepared for either really short or a really long farming state.   Partner AI is another bad part about this game, sometimes they'll just be useless and at other times they'll be helpful. I honestly couldn't figure out how their AI works, but be prepared to revive them a few times. This brings me to my next subject.  Some story missions in this are annoying as heck at times. I'll give an example, theres a part in this game where your character has to defeat 20 enemies. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. You have to constantly protect Gohan and Krillin from getting killed, 'cause if they're killed its an instant failure. Oh and the missions don't have checkpoints, which makes this tedious along with their horrible A.I.  Okay I can go on for a couple more paragraphs on the good things and bad things about this game. But overall, the good outweighs the bad. So what rating would I give this game? I honestly would give this game a 8/10. I went into this game wanting it to be my GOTY for 2015, but I found it in my top 10 of the year. This game would be a 9/10 if it wasn't for some of the annoyances with the Parallel quests (Due to their occasional repeating of objectives), RNG, and partner A.I. If you're going to get this game I'd suggest getting it with a friend because its much better with friends, I also suggest waiting for a sale and getting the Resurrection F DLC along with it. Now go, have fun with this game. I know I did. :D ",

Even at this point at the hours I have, I realized this game got boring a while ago. The character creation will most likely get boring after making more than three or so characters. If more time was put into it and more effort, I think it could of been much better.",

The battle against Trunks in the beginning is like a teacher battle, personally they should have kept the fighting on that level until players began rising up in the ranks. Also rank up you health, because you will need it to survive the constant fighting. Health first, along with Ki levels, and then the rest can go up.",

The game itself (When I can finally play it) It's an alright game, I had some fun playing it but it does in no way compare to it's predecessors, like Raging Blast or Budokai series. The combat is slow and feels somewhat handicapped, for example, after charging ki I'll have to wait about 2 seconds before doing anything else for the animation to finish. This makes the fight very slow, unlike Budokai or Tenkaichi.  The only plus I can think of is that you can create your own avatar (human, saiyan, namek, frieza, buu), and the graphics. Otherwise this game has gone backwards. Too glitchy, buggy, unbalanced in terms of stats. Combat feels clunky and broken, sometimes your beam connects with the enemy but nothing happens, or your character shoots in a wrong direction. Also, maybe I'm missing some settings or something, but for the life of me, I can't find an option to extand local games to more than 90 seconds limit.  I hope the next game will resemble the Tenkaichi a bit more.  We never asked for much, just a remastered Tenkaichi game with the new characters.",

In offline play melee oriented playstyles are incredibly gimped and simply spamming beams whilst transformed is the best way to progress the story. This game should be bought if you're looking for a strictly casual experience. It's definitely not a competitive fighter like KI, MK, or SF.    The game is ridiculously vulnerable to hacking and save editing, making online play outside of co-op even more of a hassle.    Glitchy, wonky, or otherwise out of place voice acting.    Artificial replayability through item drops with terrible RNG mechanics.   Are you a DBZ fan? Then you'll probably still find at least some enjoyment in this game. I know I did.

Also that season pass is just embarassing but to be expected of Scamco Badguy.  I had a lot of fun with it though, but because of the previous statement I can't recommend it to others. I suggest waiting for some form of sequel, there's potential to extend the content and fill up the roster even more with some fan faves that were missing such as Zarbon, Frieza form 2 and 3, Imperfect and semi-perfect Cell, Cooler and Janemba.  Also stats being tied to items is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.  But some positives: Despite the 2 button combo system that is the same input for every character, everyone has a unique moveset which is quite cool for a roster this large. The game sounds great and if you take the time to disable some annoying modernisms like HDR and bloom you can enhance the game by adding texture filtering and anti-aliasing via Nvidia Control Panel / Catalyst to make it look great too.

            "review_text": "This is a game that parades itself as a fighting game while being one of the most disturbingly unbalanced garbage piles I've ever played and I had a phase in my life where I actively seeked out bootlegs of fighting games for giggles. From giving NPCs infinite transformations, transformations which give them infinite power to spam Ultimate Attacks at will in turn, to having you fight 5-6 different enemies at once, enemies which can stunlock you forever if they so wish using those Ultimate Attacks or in other ways I may describe later.  This is a game that has possibly the worst AI ever invisoned in video games. They'll switch targets constantly and erratically, they'll spam attacks and keep you stunlocked and if I didn't know better I'd say it was ingenius and strategic but no, it's just them flopping about. It's actually kind of funny because in one instance, this I took a screenshot of actually, the AI was flying into a wall for two minutes. Two whole minutes trying to get at each other. It was nothing short of astounding and quite honestly I felt embarassed for Bamco.  This is a game that is full of bizarre bugs, horrible online play with ridiculous amunts of lag with two people, let alone 3 in co-op and boy does it go nuts if there's a 6-man match. Not only that but let's say you win a quest, you beat it... sometimes, very often, the game will decide you're not worthy and softlock. That's right, you or your friends will get stuck and the only way out is to ALT+F4 which, by the way, will incurr some penalties like getting your name turned red in the multi lobby. As an extra point sometimes it won't recognise that your friends have the DLC. If you're in a team and you try to host a DLC quest sometimes it'll just say your friends don't have it and you can't play it despite the fact that if you simply host the quest on your own anyone can join freely. I could go on about every bug I've encountered since I started playing but then I'd take weeks and that's more work than this game deserves, and likely more work than was put into developing it.  This is a game that is lazily made in overall. It has the strong taste of half-baked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry I've come to expect from Bamco. In this game there's 4 separate Gokus and several slots in the base one. None of these is a costume change to keep him Super Saiyan, even just as a graphical change. They all fight exactly the same with the less-than-notable differences of having alternative Super/Ultimate attacks, yes even the SSGSS Goku and SSG Goku. It should be noted, however, that he and every other character who can transform[there's not many by the way] can remain that way forever if he's fighting you, with really annoying super armour and infinite Ki to boot, which leads to infinite Kamehameha spam. It should also be noted that mods can easily mend this issue, an issue that should not be an issue at all honestly, condensing every Goku into one? Done. With extra little costume details? Sure! Transformations are also boring and lacklustre with the player character's hair not even changing if you go Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan being the only unique transformation, the other races just get left behind entirely despite being more interesting and unique to play as but that's enough nitpicking there.  Little note to leave here before I give my finishing thoughts; Customisation? Awful, lazy, horrible. That describes it. You have more options in customisation playing a Newgrounds Dress-Up game and would probably have more fun doing that. I might go do that after I finish writing this.  In summation this game is awful, it is a horrible, lazy waste of up to $70 dollars and it is a shame that something hyped up so badly ended up being such garbage. BT3, it is not. It is not even the Raging Blast games which were arguably the worst of the 3D open-world fighters in the DBZ series. Simply put, don't get this unless you're a hardcore fan of the series, even then, consider how much value you want out of those $70. Final score; Disappointment and Frustration/10.  Dragonball Z Xenoverse is the worst Dragonball game I have ever played and I have played Taiketsu on the GBA. The AI, the bugs, the interruptions, the lazy attacks, the way they fake difficulty by swarming you with spammers. I hate it. If I had a choice between it and Sonic 06 I would slit my throat with the Sonic 06 disc.",

There were times when I felt like Vegeta, blinded by rage, and other times when I felt like Goku, just having fun in a tough fight. I think it's an awesome game and I feel like compared to other Dragon Ball games, it really captured what it's like to fight in their universe. It's not a side scrolling beat-em-up or a 2.5D figher, it's a fighter that exists on a full landscape in which you could possibly be figthting 5 enemies at once (an actual fight).  I know some people didn't like it, but I thought the addition of custom characters really made this game. Personally speaking, when I play a game, I like to feel like I AM the character, I don't like feeling like I'm controlling a character. That's why I love games like Skyrim so much while disliking pretty much any MOBA ever made. I didn't feel like I was a coach watching Goku save the world while telling him how to do it. I felt like I was helping him in a fight he'd otherwise lose.  Something else I thoroughly enjoyed was the Master system. The Master system basically let's you train under one of Dragon Ball's many character in exchange for their occasional assistance and skills. I trained under Vegeta and learned many of his signature moves that helped me a ton along the way. You can train under all of them over time which let's you rack up an awesome roster of cool skills. I enjoyed that a lot I thought it was an awesome addition.  Now that's not to say this game was perfect either. As I said, this game took me about 37 hours to beat. However if I were to go back and start over from the beginning with my current stats and abilities, the game would probably take 3-4 hours to beat. This game suffers from what I think many many games suffer from. Using difficulty to increase the length of an otherwise contentless game. I know people have pretty much accepted that grinding is something you have to do in most modern RPGs, but I personally never fell for that. You wanna know why Skyrim is such a well-loved game? Because you can get 100+ hours out of it without having to do a lick of grinding because there's so much content. Dragon Ball doesn't have that. I spent most of the game grinding because between every chapter of the game there's a huge difficulty spike. That's not to say it's a bad game, but I would have much rather seen new story arcs or more parts to each chapter.  Another issue I had was parallel quests. Parallel Quests are basically different variations of the actual storyline that you get to play for fun and rewards. But for me their main use was for grinding on something besides the plot. See when I was first learning about Parallel Quests I thought it was gonna be like the Dream Log from One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3. See in the Dream Log, you get to experience missions that would never happen in the actual storyline. Luffy and Doflamingo could be fighting to stop Ace and Nami from escaping Impel Down. Bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy stuff that is insanely fun. Instead I found that Parallel Quests were basically alternate timelines of the original Dragon Ball story. There are a few that are pretty crazy, like fighting off a bunch of Cell Juniors while searching for the dragonballs. And others like where I literally just did the final battle with Frieza but instead of Goku, it was me. Both games were made by Bandai Namco so I feel like they really missed an opportunity to do something similar to the Dream Log but instead I got Parallel Quests which are only fun the first few times, after that they're just grinding material.   Overall, I think this game deserves a 7/10. Awesome fighting, Customizeable character. Too much grinding, not enough real content",

However, server is extremely unstable for the moment and there are a good number of game-breaking bugs. Those are killing the game right now. Keep an eye on the forums and patch notes to decide before you get the game. [TL;DR]   I will start by stating that I am glad to see a Dragon Ball game on Steam! If you are a fan of the Dragon Ball series, you don't want to miss this.  Pros:    The game is smooth when it works, you will be using all those supers and ultimates in the series.     Co-op is fun with a friend and enjoy the epic moments in Dragon Ball like you actually play a part.     Content for the price is fair in my opinion. You get quite a bit to work with, I love both the story and the parallel quests.     Online battles and ranking. PVP always plays a good factor.   Cons:    [Major] For some reason, some of the game mechanics are tied to FPS and there are some gamebreaking bugs. Most of the in-game items or functions are working only at 30FPS. They fixed 1 and many other appears. For example, power capsule not giving you the correct amount of energy. All the effects will be lost when you have VSYNC on. Recover all your health with a simple punch when its only suppose to give you a little amount of health.     [Major] Server is extremely unstable for the moment. They have released a patch but it didn't seem to resolve the issue. They are still actively working on it. Problem with the server not only affect online plays, but also offline plays. The game decided to have you connect to the server before entering the single lobby, which is a bad idea. Yes, you can disconnect and goes back to the title screen during offline play.     Drop rate was too high. They fixed it by lower it down but now its way too low. I reckon they could implement a better drop system. So yes, you need to farm hard ♥♥♥ to get something you want.     Rating is also strange sometimes. You fulfill the hidden conditions of the quest but there is a good chance that nothing will show up. Again, you may need to farm the same mission again and again just to get the rank.     Adding friend is annoying because there is a high chance that you could not find your friend in the player list. During group play, instead of creating a room and choose quests to proceed, you have to host a quest and invite every time.      PVP winning condition has its flaws. Some player could just hit and run and wait until the timer is done and wins. Ultimate spam could also be fixed by putting a cast time interval between.    I like the game but I am not going to recommend it to anyone until they fix the major issues. Bad server always kills a game.",

            "review_text": "Having played most, if not all of the PS2-era DBZ games and Sparkling, I must say I'm very disappointed with this one. It lacks all the energy and speed that the earlier Budokai games had, with you mashing out the same basic combos over and over, leaving you to punch, knock away, follow, and repeat over and over. You can get strung into a unblockable (once one hits) flurry of staggering ki attacks, and if you're versus more than one person at a time, you might as well turn the game off. The locking-on is abysmal, and I've lost matches purely because I wasn't able to target the person I needed to. And let's not forget that when you teleport behind an enemy doing an energy attack to avoid it--assuming your block/teleport button works, which it doesn't always-- you will still be hit for full damage by a forward-firing beam despite being 180 degrees behind them.  The game's tutorial--given to you after no less than three full fights, which feel awful because you don't know what you're doing--is so bare-bones that it doesn't even explain basic mechanics like deflecting ki, requiring almost immediate reference to player-written guides, which is proof of incredibly bad design.  Running around the hub-world is boring, the Parellel Quests are already getting repetitive after 6 or so, the graphics have that ugly GT gloss that the series now always seems to have, and while I chose not to buy it myself--the DLC is a disappointing rip-off. More time seems to have been put into the customisation than the fighting mechanics, which I could understand if this were some lavish MMO, but this is a game I will be playing solo, and for 'that' it feels hollow. Speaking of MMO design, all items rely on RNG drops and grinding the same levels over and over again, and progression in the main story REQUIRES grinding for XP in patrol missions, which is the definition of lazy pacing and length-padding.  This is a game with a good concept and bad execution. Most of the new voice actors are fine, but so far Trunks, Frieza and Cell all stand out as being completely terrible.  EDIT: This game has unskippable cut-scene, such as entries or revivals, which halt gameplay - but not pause it. If you were in the middle of something, it will be as if you just stopped playing, and any special attacks will be cancelled. Get into a fight where lots of people come in? (like the final Captain Ginyu training mission) You won't get a single special attack out, and you'll waste all your ki because of these cutscenes. I lost two ultimates in a row because someone entered after I started it. Absolute garbage. This game needs to stop pretending like it's a real fighting game but giving ever item stats too - I want to customise my character, but I'm locked into a certain set of clothes because of my build. Same thing for alternate costumes on main characters.  There is also no option to retry a mission if you fail. You must endure the failure, listen to a character tell you you're ♥♥♥♥, go back to the hub world and manually start the mission all over again. ALSO, all dialogue refers to you as a male, regardless of the gender of your character, and the single-player missions always refer to you as if you were part of a group, though you cannot co-op for the main story, as far as I know. There are also really botched translations in parts, and bizzare moments when your custom character speaks to others but makes no sound - which you might consider standard, but your selected voice speaks attack names, so why not the odd scentence too? It makes the whole thing feel very fake and transparent.",

But it is still fun and worth playing if you're a fan of DBZ titles.  While the game does incorporate a lot of new elements, none of them feel fully flushed out. The Toki Toki hub world is just a huge pain to navigate, and why did they even give a jump button to you in that area? I like the student system, where you can learn skills from a chosen master, and gain items pertinent to that character.   The story is passable, and the voice acting is pretty much what you'd expect from a DBZ title, but the major disappointment is the Parallel Quest system. I think this could have been a great way to introduce battle scenarios, but it just feels like more of the same of the main questline. Yes, there are items you can go around and hunt, but it wouldn't feel like nearly as much of a chore if after every parallel quest it didn't start you back at the Toki Toki world entrance. That just makes me not want to do PQs.  But then comes the games absolute biggest flaw, and something that I feel is worthy of a refund: The constant disconnects from the game server. I understand that I can play single player without interruption by restarting Steam in Offline mode, but that is a major inconvenience when I can just choose any other title from my catalogue and play that instead. But what if I want to play with friends? Well, you just have to put up with being disconnected after just about every other quest. It is horrendously implemented, moreso than any other only mediocre-implementation of features.

            "review_text": "TLDR: Awesome game, but Im not sure if its worth the 50 bucks. Probably best to wait for a sale and give them time to iron out the bugs. I love the game and its fun to play but I cant really recommend it as it is for the PC. Oh and RNG OVER 9000! So much RNG, for EVERYTHING!!!!!!  So I dont typically like many fighting games, and while I do like the anime Im not really a fan boy. If I 'were' though Id tell you how excited I am for the new Frieza movie coming out in japan sometime this April ;) Since the servers seem to be functioning now Im editing my review, but honestly I still cant give game companies a free pass when they release games in such a broken state. Plus there are STILL issues with playing online, such as the broken 'idle checker' that will boot you even when you've just come out of a game.  'Would it really have been so hard to just...?' In depth review is as follows - you were warned.    1= Now I don't mind RNG in games, but Xenoverse relies on it to a rediculous extent. Not only is the loot not explained but it has only a chance to drop if you meet the hidden criteria for it to drop. What makes it worse is many PQ missions play out similarly. For instance many events require something to happen, say killing a specific character last. And even if you fulfill these special requirements the event that is supposed to happen might not even occur due to no fault of your own, simply RNG. It makes the whole experience largely a guessing game of what you have to do to make something happen to fight someone to maybe get a drop from them at those times. For example when farming Brollys clothes, you have to sit back doing nothing and wait for the terrible AI to decide when it will fight and kill Videl, then hope Brolly kills Goten and Trunks so Gohan appears. This gives the best CHANCE of Brolly deciding to revive. Then after you kill him the second time [if he revives] you still only have a small chance to get an item. Much of the game works like this, its lame.  2= Now a very close second, the lack of any actual chat in game. I mean for crying out loud... this is obviously a straight up console port with no love for PC enthusiasts. You're limited in game by already scripted comments like 'Hello' and 'yes' and 'no'. What is wrong with just a chat lobby for people? Maybe the ability to private message someone or send someone little messages through steam at the very least? It really makes me wish steams default ways of doing things didnt prevent you from simply messaging people who you just met and havent added to your friends list. Anyway, one particularly annoying situation is I'll be in the game trying to offer some help to anyone who wants it and Im limited to 'Seeking Friends' 'I'll help!' and so on, and then when we set up a team we STILL lack in game voice options until we actually make a room and pick a level. So theres litterally no way I can ask someone which specific mission theyd like help with until we're already in a random mission. *shakes head* Communication is important, and the ball gets dropped hard here. This is on PC, I have a keyboard, LET ME USE IT! *shakes game*  3= No online story mode, wouldn't have been hard *sigh*. Now I understand that its perhaps for a more immersive single player experience but I would have liked the ability to at least make a new character and do a co op campaign with friends or something. Perhaps be able to go back to already beaten missions and play them again with friends to get a better rank... something at least? But especially for a game that requires you to be connected to online servers at all times [unless you set steam to offline mode] why isnt there more content to do online with people?Theres a lot of possible content here that would be fun to play, yet we are limited to side quests and versus mode only. I really wish there was more co op content in the game other than side quests. As it is, other than pvp theres not a lot replayability here yet.  4= The online play has problems too. Now I wont get too much into bugs, or balancing issues. I wont get into lame combat mechanics like ult spamming and such either. I mean the actual game play... for one the Host has a very large advantage since the game lags and desyncs a lot, which strikes me as odd if we're supposed to be connecting to some official game server right? Im not sure what the purpose of these servers are if people are hosting their own games honestly. Lots of times attacks that should hit miss, and in a fighting game that relies a lot on well timed blocks and split second timing of attacks to get a hit in this can easily be a game changer, or, a game ruiner. And like I said earlier, most of the game seems centered on pvp fighting, it really wouldnt be as big an issue if the single player or co op parts had more replayability.  5= Lack of customization, sorta. This will be my longest and most in depth critique, and I admit its mostly opinion. Dont get me wrong theres lots of options and outfits, and even the ones with the most stats barely affect anything so its pretty close to being entirely cosmetic other than for hard core minmaxers. My problem stems from more deep seeded issues. For instance most of the outfits aren't tintable/recolorable, which would have been pretty easy. Theres also no way to take a favorite outfit of yours and make your own version of it, say with your own preference of stats or styles, so if you wanted your character to have goku's torn up gi and be bare chested then your SOL. Theres other problems too, if you dont want to be a fat buu you have to make a female buu. And while I understand that namekians are genderless why couldnt we have female frieza's? Speaking of, different genders have different stats, as well as your size and such. Its strange that your appearance wouldnt be completely cosmetic considering almost everything else is, but my suggestion is if your wanting a female character make her as large as possible since they're super tiny. My first Saiyan couldnt even see over the counter at the default height, and even at max height possible she's right in between Gohans and Videl's height, for reference.  Otherwise, Buu's and Frieza's have no different forms. And super saiyans, well where do I begin?Theres only SS1 and 2, theres a super vegeta form but its the same... its supposed to increase your ki blasts a little more than super saiyan instead of melee but Im not seeing it so if the difference there they probably ♥♥♥♥ed up and put the decimal in the wrong place so its probably like 1% and 3% difference instead of 10 and 30 or whatever. I'll go super saiyan when a friend is looking at me on their scouter to see my power levels and it doesnt change at all. It would have also been nice if our hair changed AT ALL when we went super saiyan. While it DOES turn colors, the style is completely static. I was really hoping that my hair would spike up and nope, the model didnt change what-so-ever. Would it have really been that hard to include a normal and super saiyan hair style versions?  Lastly for complaints about customization, it seems the same voices are used for all races. I was expecting different races to sound different but humans sound the same as every other race... which is a let down. Would it really have been that hard to get a few more voice actors for a major title game? Your character is stoically silent in the story mode anyway so all your character says is names of attacks while battling... like SPECIAL BEAM CANNON! and 'Hi' or 'whatsup?'    Otherwise, all that aside [and it is a lot] the gameplay is amazing. Its primarily an online fighting game so I think thats where the majority of people are going to be concerned with. Balance, bugs, latency, etc are all issues but Ive ran out of room in my review, sorry.",

Unfortunatly, I must admit that this game is quite a bit of disapointment for me...   Positive:  - The main good point in favor of this game is the game, which is the core element in game development.   This game is build on a somewhat MMORPG feeling with the whole quest, duel and arena system.  You are not playing one of the main serie character, but rather your very own custom character (either human, sayien, namek, boo or freeza race). Lot's of customization is possible.  You can upgrade the stats of your avatar and the gear (even tough you can't change the color, what a shame) just like any RPG.  Yet, the gameplay is the one of a fighting game, let's say fighting/RPG (since you can use item during fight).  - As an inveterate fan of Dragon ball, I can't help but to like this new way of presenting the story of this classic Shonen.  Yet, the game in itself is now half as story immesing as Naruto shippuden : ultimate ninga storm 3 is...   Negative :  - The soundtrack is sincerly annoying and I'm not even talking about the poor english dubbling.  OK, purists will tell me to play in the original version with subtitle, but hey! There are some people too lazy to read when they are playing...  In any cases, the soundtrack annoy me so bad that I'm turning the sound off when not playing the main campain.  - The cell shading is not bad, yet it is not extra-ordinary at all. The colors and the lights are rendered somehow a little bit weird...  Globally, the graphics is far below games like Naruto shippuden : ultimate ninga storm 3 for cell shading or final fantasy 13 for regular japanese graphics.  It's a shame when a brand new game can't compete with way older games...  - No matter at which time I play, it is always a challenge to connect to the server. If I ever manage to log in, I can't even play more than a single quest without being disconnected...  Why the h*** can't we play offline?   Conclusion :  This game what most definitly build on good intention. Yet, no matter how good or bad a game is, it cannot be anything but a bad game if you can't manage to play it.  I mean, with the season pass DLC, this game cost something like 83 canadian dollars. That's quite a lot of money!  I hate those new generation game that you absolutly new to connect on game server to play. That mean that you can't play them when there are under server maintenance, when your internet is down or, like in this case, the server is most obviously not designed to support so much players.  Anyone would agree that never being able to play a game you paid good money for is unnacceptable. This is not a 5 dollars indy game, this is supposed to be a AAA game...   I would recommend to wait for them to fix all the server bug before ever considering buying this game.   In the meaning time, you should consider, if you don't already own it, Naruto shippuden : ultimate ninga storm 3 for a way better fighting shonen based game.",

Don't make me start on the AI of characters in some quests (47) where some individuals just keep spamming ults because they 1. have np ki to deal with and 2. an unlimited super saiyan and hey! if you're really unlucky you won't even get to play because they just simply lock you into their ultimates.",

You have to kill Tien, Yamcha, Krillin, and Vegeta, THEN kill Super Vegeta. ONLY then do you have an ?% CHANCE to unlock the move. Best part is, there's only a ?% CHANCE that Vegeta will go super saiyan in the first place. If he doesn't, you've got zero chance to get the move, and have to do everything all over again. The mission auto ends, and puts you back in the city. It doesn't give you the option to restart. You have to walk back to the counter, accept the mission, and sit through the UMTEEN millionth loading screen AGAIN. It doesn't matter how good you are at the game. And it's the same way for 80% of the ♥♥♥♥ in the game, making the entire system for progression 100% luck based. The grind is TEN TIMES worse than it is in MMOs.  The combat system rewards playing like a 2 year old. Fk getting good at combos and dodging attacks; blocking at the right time, learing attack patterns... No.. Just spam super / ultimate attacks. The ranking system actually REWARDS that kind of behavior, and the bots are too braindead to punish you for it. To make it even worse, once you unlock super saiyan, the transformation not only boosts the power of your supers, but makes them cost NO ENERGY, meaning you can just stand in one spot, hold 2 buttons, and spam ultimate attacks non-stop ad-♥♥♥♥ing-nausiem. Throwing ANY challenge or skill requirement right out the window.   I played the same ♥♥♥♥ sucking mission, over. and over. and over. AND OVER AGAIN for an HOUR straight, and I STILL did not unlock the ♥♥♥♥ING move that I wanted, because the system could not give ANY less of a ♥♥♥♥ about actual skill. It is 100% random chance.

Cons: -Silent Protag, glad we're back in '98. -Their idea of making fights hard is putting 2 horny boss characters with 2 lifebars against you and a braindead computer. They also don't flinch and every time you attack them they push you away, FUN! -If I wanted to grind this much I would have put Tony Hawks Ride back in my dreamcast. -One word.

Xenoverse Server disconnection frequently or couldn't even connect to Xenoverse server a lot of times  You can only create one character and all other charcter slots are locked out until you completed the main story,which is quite a long time.

            "review_text": "Flawed perfection.  That oxymoron is what I use to describe this game. In that regard, I will talk about everything that's wrong with it before I praise it.  Dragonball Xenoverse has some of the most idiotic A.I. I've seen in a game in recent years (Although the worst goes to that one Aliens game, I'd say. You know the one.). In a PQ, you can choose two of any of the characters you've unlocked to assist you, which is good, because some of the quests are tough, even at the beginning. The problem arises in that they are basically just meat shields to take hits for you and deal some light damage. They rarely use their super moves, and they never, ever use their ultimates or transformations (where applicable... or not applicable, as the case may be.)  In addition, the enemy characters may just float harmlessly in front of you, begging to be hit. On the flipside of that coin, some of them will be absolutely ruthless. They will spam their super and ultimate moves, and chase you down afterward to kick the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you. Granted, most of that happens in later difficulties, but more than you'd expect. In one of the later quests, where you have to fight every single Z-Fighter (From Yamcha to SS3 Goku, in several different areas, each with their own team of enemies), going throught the portal into th final zone greets you with Super Saiyan Goku, Gohan, and Goten. More often then not, both Goku and Gohan will fire Kamehamehas at you the second they see you, while little Goten hits you with a barrage of blasts that, while inaccurate, can lock you in place fairly well... right before the Kamehamehas hit. You'll likely die immediately, because of course.  There are a few glitches, too. The most notable ones seem to be in two PQs that have you collecting Dragonballs. Both have the same problem, which is that one of said balls spawn, without fail, outside the area you're aloud to traverse. And that blue, circuit-like barrier that holds you back will mock you silently.  Also, there are spelling and grammatical errors absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY, everywhere. Sometimes, when a character shows up in a fight, what they say may not even be what's displayed on screen (In particular, Frieza and Vegeta rarely know what they're saying.). That's not to mention the bits you find in the shopping menus and non-cutscene dialog. It gives a sense that the translation of this game was incredibly rushed. Like, 'get it done by lunch' rushed.  Lastly, and this is more of a personal grievance, though I know others share the sentiment, there are not beam struggles. That's a staple of Dragonball Z itself, as well as the better fighting games it has produced. There are still physical clashes, but I've yet to win one of those, as there's nothing that tells you how to do it. Button mash? I'd love for you to tell me which buttons. I've tried them all.  Now,,. the praise.  This game is the ♥♥♥♥. Everything that they did right, they did amazingly. The character creation is some of the best I've ever seen (Though I would have liked to be able to make an Android character, but that's neither here nor there.). Saiyan, Eartling, Namekian, Majin (every single one directly related to the big pink fatass, I might add.) and whatever the hell you call Frieza, there are almost endless combinations of parts and styles to choose from, every bit of which lets you pick what color you want for that specific part. Ever seen a blue and orange Namekian with a spikey skin mohawk and red eyes? You will.  The story mode is amazing. You'll see just about every important moment in DBZ history in addition to some completely new ones, AND get to fight alongside the regular cast. Who among you never got the urge to jump into Gohan's fight with Cell and deck the power-stealing sum♥♥♥♥♥ yourself? None of you.  There's tons of replayability, too. Every PQ has hidden objectives, and drop some amazing things, like famous characters clothing and moves.  You can learn from a master as you progress, all of them key heroes and villains, From Krillin to Beerus the Destroyer, and a lot of major names in between. Each of them will test your strength, and teach you their exclusive moves, which you can't get from any missions.  You can play online or off. When on, you can directly interact with other people roaming Tokitoki city. When off, a few handfuls of those same people will appear as non-interactive NPCs, so you can admire the cool ones or laugh at the silly ones without drawing their attention. I once saw a player character named Kim-Jong Uub. Enough said.  All in all, if you're a fan of fighting games, Dragonball Z, or both, you'll love this game. You'll buy this game. You'll cheat on your significant other with this game.",

            "review_text": "Dragon Ball finally hits Steam! But with Battle of Z and Ultimate Tenkaichi in mind,  is this an arrival we should celebrate? Dimps are no strangers to fighting games (They created Street Fighter IV's engine) so they should have what it takes to create a knock-out title.  It's not exactly the deepest fighter around and there are some absolute killer combinations of certain Z-souls, support abilities and Ultimates that completely break any balance Dimps may have been going for. Still, there is enough to the game to make experimenting entertaining both in terms of the combo mechanics, and in the different stuff you can attach to your character (Z-souls especially). The game's idea of difficulty is rather skewered though, as it would rather give enemies super armor, strength in numbers or give you a rock-stupid Ai partner that you have to keep alive in spite of its suicidal tendencies rather than simply making the enemies competent. There's also some stupid walls of RNG attached to getting good item drops even when you do score a perfect Ultimate Finish. But that's Dimps for ya.  You've no doubt noticed the MMO-ish aspects of the game. See, you have the option of choosing between single and multi lobbies. In multi, you can walk around and interact with other people in real time and fight against each other or team up on missions as you'd expect. However, single lobbies work rather differently as you don't actually interact with other people. instead, the game spawns other player avatars as NPCs.  A question many seems to be asking is 'is this always online?'. The answer is that it isn't, so long as the servers work correctly. Usually, if you can't establish a connection, the game simply tells you that the online multiplayer aspects aren't available and boots you into the single lobby where you can do all the single player stuff as usual. However, some people have experienced problems wherein the game will put you in an endless loop of trying to establish a connection that never allows the player to enter the single lobby. Others get into the lobby, but are sent back to the title screen every time they finish their missions.  If you do encounter these kinds of connectivity issues that hinder you from playing at all,  they can be temporarily fixed simply by booting Steam in offline mode.",

Sometimes you will get smashed in story mode, so you go off and train a bit, and then you can beat the level. It works really really well. The class differences are small enough so that none are particularly overpowered (that I've seen) but still noticable. A fair amount of gear choices for fun appearances, and some stat variation. Then the ultimate customisation is the move list, where you can have whatever suits your play style, with fun ways of unlocking them.  The music is pretty lame, and a few more volume levels would be good, it's often hard to hear voice chat without other sounds completely off. Graphically it's simple, but looks nice.

The good: - the combat system is actually very fluid and not a button masher in the slightest. If you go in mashing buttons, you will get recked -challenging and rewarding unlockables -very smooth gameplay -pretty good roster -character customization is pretty neat and has plenty of features, could be a bit better and i have the feeling there will be stuff added -Open world style battlefields are not gimicky The slightly bad -as with most multiplayer games released first week, slight server issues (You can play offline as opposed to what negative reviewers state. turn your internet connection off, play the game and bam, you can play without logging into servers and previous players that were in your lobby before will be there as NPC and you can encounter them from time to time in game -slight graphical errors that go away within a minute or too i.e. special move lighting effects dont show up. it'll probably be patched, not game breaking at all -Voice acting is sub-par from time to time TL;DR Get it if you love action rpg, fighting games or a mix of both, high replay value, works perfect with the ps4 controller (go to hell with your 360 controller), and it's highly addicting.",

The Dragon ball games have gone downhill for quite some time in my opinion, but this game brings back all the enjoyment I once had playing a Dragon ball game!  Pros:  Character Creation: It's not the best in the world, but it's not bad. It fits the Dragon Ball universe.  Graphics: Isn't a major deal to me, but darn these graphics look amazing on my PC!  Gameplay: The gameplay is smooth, fast pace, and feels polished.  RPG: The game brings a great RPG element into the series. Sure, other DBZ games in the past had items you could find in the world etc, but this one feels more natural to me anyway.  Main quests &amp; Side: The game adds in a main story line that doesn’t feel poorly written like past Dragon ball games. It’s actually fun to watch, and it doesn’t make you want to skip every cut scene you come across. The side quests are fun and engaging. I mean heck, you get to attack Goku with Raditz for the heck of it! Awesome,  Cons:  The camera angel still gets on my nervures from time to time, but this has been a thing since Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi.  Servers: Need to add this now. The servers are quite annoying from being disconnected all the time, major lag when doing online battles (yes, this can happen from other players internet connections), but it is a little ridiculous at this point. Trying to find any online matchs. It feels like it takes forever to even find a match, and even longer to join them.   Hopefully these issues get fix soon, becasue I would like to play with other players for the online quests and vs.  That’s it for cons thus far.   Overall, I’m glad I brought myself to purchase this game instead of staying clear of it like many others in the past!",

Can't use mouse to navigate menus   Only FXAA   Returns you to the title screen when turning off FXAA and VSync.   The game has general usability problems.   When you restart after failing a mission, some will restart at a point before cutscenes. You can skip these, but in some cases there can be three cutscenes, all with loading time in between.   There's no preview of the clothes you can buy.    There's no real description how effective equipment stats are. Character attributes are shown in numbers, while the attribute gains from equipment are shown in... arrows.   I have to disable my internet connection to play offline when the game servers are unreachable. Heh.   You have only one character slot until you beat the game.   Some people might get tired of running around the lobby to start the game mode they want, without having an quic launch option. Escpecially as some missions require you to run through multiple lobby areas.   The game isn't very pretty. It emulates the anime style well which looks good most of the time. But there has been some incredibly lazy texture work in parts of the lobby town. Given how small that area is and the time you'll spend there, I really think they could have put more effort into it. Apart from some lighting and shader effects, this game looks like it was made 6 years ago.  And how come they still can't make cutscenes without awkward pauses between the characters saying their lines? It's like they're all politely waiting for each other to finish talking or yelling.",

            "review_text": "So, first up, I'm gonna say that I have been a longtime fan of DBZ. Friends and I were watching it before it was even brought to america, we all sat and watched imports (complete with japanese commercials) and had fun guessing at what the people were saying. Krillin was called 'Dots' cause of the dots on his forehead. :P  Fast forward a decade or so and the dbz games under my belt are a few of the super famicom versions, both import and local 'dbz legends' and then Dragonball z budoki 3 with lite experience with a few others.  I am both pleased with and dissappointed with Dragonball Xenoverse and here's why: After 21.3hrs playtime, AFTER the server stability upgrades....  Positives: ++ A character creator that allows you to create your own dbz characters that is actually not too bad. Somewhat decent options with more customization to appearance unlocked via drops or purchases from the clothing shop in game (no, not a cash shop)  ++ Wide variety of powers you can find with even more powers that you can earn from story characters that you gain as 'Mentors' which include Captain Ginyu, Frieza or even Beeru, the war god.  +++ Lots of classic DBZ action  + Takahata of Team FourStar does the voice for 'Male voice 8' and there's even a TFS Nappa easter egg in game that is easy to find (just chat with the NPCs in Toki Town and listen to thier voice greetings)  Minuses: - UNBELIEVEABLY grindy! I spent at least 5-10 hours of game time grinding side quests in order to get certain powers or items and after fighting Frieza, the very next fight was Cell and Mr Satan. Mr Satan was actually a bit Difficult! Time to grind for a few hours more to build my lvls so the next story fight isn't such a chore.  -- Mentors are very ambiguous when it comes to what they expect you to do before advancing thier training.  -- While stated that the Character creator/customization isn't too bad, it still pails in comparison to ALOT of other character creators. For me, being a fashion wh***, this hurts. Alot of options leave something to be desired and there's currently NO WAY to color your powers. To truly make a character your own, I think it would have gone a long way to be able to color my own abilities, you know? Also, why can't I color the clothing options I buy? You give us the ability to color our starting 'no stat' clothing and you keep the options available throughout the game, but you don't allow us to color what we buy? Another point that doesn't make sense.  -- DODGE!! This is hard to do. Most of the times that I try a teleport, either the pc is anticipating where I'll be or I just blip out and reappear in the exact SAME spot. FORGET trying to make blocking useful.  - Small touches that could have made the game better: Eliminate 'cr*ppy dub syndrome' when the characters talk. Make terrain damage more dynamic and have it hang around longer than a second or two. Why can I NOT sit on the benches in Toki Town?? Why can I NOT actually CHAT on a multiplayer PC game? I get that it is a console port, but there's tons of console multiplayers that allow better communication! MAKE THE SCOUTER WORK LIKE THE GAME TELLS YOU IT SHOULD! Yes, it shows you the lvl of the character you're facing, but it's slow to turn on and off and you can't fight while using it. Also, contrary to what the scouter tutorial tells you, it does NOT show whether or not there are enemies waiting on the other side of that gate!  -- PVP battles don't seem to be balance matched to xp lvls at all and there is no way to gauge the other person's xp lvl or abilities until you actually fight them. I tried my hand at a few battles and in one case managed to land only a small amount of damage before being perma juggled and thrashed to defeat. The others were pretty much along the same lines. It was clear that I was fighting more powerful characters and would have been nice to know BEFOREHAND. Characters in DBZ were able to sense power lvls in advance...  --- THE SERVERS ARE -STILL- UNSTABLE!!! When I'm not getting the immediate message 'unable to connect to Xenoverse server, here, play it offline', I can only play a few battles at most before I'm kicked out.  6.5 / 10 Overall, I feel it is definitely a good game, but definitely could have been done way better. If you're a dbz fanboy/girl, you may get a good amount of enjoyment out of Xenoverse, but just keep in mind that this game is in no way, shape or form perfect. Would definitely recommend waiting snatch it on a sale.",

Xenoverse just came out, and DB Extreme Butoden for 3DS (by Arc System Works!) and the new movie 'DB Revival F' are coming out this year in Japan. If you are a DB fan, you must be excited...unless, the game sucks. Good news! DB Xenoverse is an excellent game. I can see the developer really put a lot of effort into it. The fighting mechanic is fun, the story is interesting, and there are a good amount of character customization.   The fighting mechanic of XV is not complicated, but with evasive moves, and guard cancel &amp; jump cancel combos, I find it very enjoyable, and it is more than enough for a DB fan fighting game. Not to mention, the fights resembles those of in the anime very well. (I especially love the smooth SSJ transformation.) The game may seem unfair to some in the beginning, but once you get the fighting mechanic and invested a bit of time in building character and customize skill, it shouldn't be hard. It is always fun to test out new kills when you just get them anyway. There is a bit of grinding to do to get the gears and skills you wanted, but it's not half as bad as Monster Hunter (MH is one of my fav by the way).  The story of XV starts a bit slow, but after Mira and Towa(instant fan!) show up, the pace picks up. And the final battle, it's so cool and satisfying. I played DB Online years ago but never finished the game and it haunts me for years. I felt such a great sens of relief after finishing DB Xenoverse story mode as it heavily borrows elements from DB Online.   Few complaints however; - like everyone said, the server is bad - developer should work on enemy AI instead of giving them super armor - missing training mode - should be able to go to various mode from main menu - offline single player mode should be accessible from main menu instead of using Steam offline mode - block should auto follow target - Toki Toki City doesn't look so hot - 2D animation is meh  Overall, I really like Xenoverse. It's one of my fav DB games. Xenoverse 2 must be coming right? BN, right?",

            "review_text": "This game had a lot going for it, but ultimately cannot be recommended.  First, the good: The three-dimentional combat works remarkably well. The battles are generally fast-paced, and the ultra-moves are spectacular. The time-traveling setup provides an effective and interesting framing-device, and the resulting list of missions allow for a wide variety of scenarios. Fight alongside your favorite characters from DBZ... or change history by standing alongside the villains and securing THEIR victory. Lots of spectacular optional battles where heroes or villains from across the continuum join forces, too. Care to fight Super Vegeta 2, 100% Final Form Frieza and Powered Perfect Form Cell all at once? The game will provide you the opportunity to do that and more. Huge selection of fighters, including characters from outside the normal canon (Bardock, Broly, and several from DBGT, just for starters) and with it comes an equally huge selection of super-moves and ultimate moves, for all your ki-beam-throwing needs. The ability to create your own fighter and set him/her/it up just the way you like is as satisfying as promised - there's a huge variety of clothes and accessories to go with your carefully-configured character-appearance. Be a hulking titan, or a pint-sized powerhouse! Anything goes.  ......BUT! And this is, as Zero Punctuation's Yahtzee would put it, a big, STINKY but. For all its advantages, it's got greater disadvantages. The combat works well... but you have to choose between 'interesting' and 'possible'. Meele combat is fast-paced and fun, but the useful skills are few and far between, and high-level enemies will devastate you without trouble, since they basically don't flinch - making them impossible to combo. Ranged combat (using 'Ki blasts') is extremely potent, but quickly gets really, really dull. Stand back while your allies distract the enemy, fire your favorite flavor of multicolored death at them (knocking off large chunks of the enemy's health-bar), then charge up your Ki again. Rinse and repeat until all enemies have fallen. That's it. That's ALL you're going to be doing for the last half of the game - well, that or constantly dying. Meanwhile, the huge roster of fighters has some glaring, obvious holes in it. Several familiar faces are missing, including Androids 16, 19 and 20. Intermediary forms of Frieza are missing, as is Cell's non-Perfected form.   And of course, there's the servers - the game has aspirations of MMO-ness, and while it CAN work just fine offline, it will stubbornly TRY to connect to the servers, often failing miserably and wasting your time in the process. If you DO connect, expect to get kicked off time and time again, returning to the main menu every time. Lose your internet-connection in mid-battle? The game will likely crash, taking your progress with it. This issue will probably be aleviated over time, as the dwindling number of players eases the pressure on the servers... also reducing the POINT of the multiplayer.  Several other niggling details tear away at the enjoyment. Randomness rules the day - enemies and allies alike may randomly drop pieces of gear or skills while you fight, and if you're trying to get your hands on a particular skill (either because it's awesome or because it suits your character perfectly), it can take a LOT of grinding to actually get it. Worse, the 'Ultimate Success' of side-missions is random too. To expand: Fulfilling certain requirements during missions (such as winning under a time-limit, keeping escort-targets from taking too much damage, or defeating enemies in a particular order) will activate 'Ultimate Success', providing an extension for the mission where new enemies appear, old ones ressurect and power up, or other interesting events occur... if you're lucky. If you're not, you can play the same mission over and over a dozen times, fulfilling the requirements each and every time, and still never see the special ending. Several of the missions are also frustratingly difficult to the point of impossibility, and while being ganged up on by constantly beam-spamming Super Saiyans can be handled with the right set of skills and a maxed-level character, there's no counter for escort-targets who can be one-shotted by the final enemy and constantly bounce right up in said enemy's face.  So no, I would not recommend buying it. In the final tally, it's got more frustrations than awesomeness. That being said, if you DO buy it, make sure to play it through to the end. The final, post-game chapter is ALMOST epic enough to make up for all the annoyance that went before. Almost.",

Graphics : 8.0  Storyline : 1.0  Due to teamates death in story mode relentlessly over and over , contrary to the story as a whole if they wanted them to die it should have been used for Parallel quests.

Suddenly, a mysterious hero taking a blur of many shapes, sizes, forms, races, and powers, jumps out from time and space to help out the heroes and set things straight once again. But, what is this crazy new evil power the villians are utilizing? Who is this strange hero who's always there to even out the fight to restore the timeline? Find out... By playing DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE!   Ahem... Sorry, I had to get that out of my system first. Anyway... Welcome to Parallel universe theory where you can do lots of crazy things and have it still 'make sense'... Vaguely.  Ever wanted to be in Dragon Ball Z and kick some butts and take some names?  Ever wanted a big community hub in a DBZ game with lots of players wandering around with self made characters and easily accessed Multiplayer that includes both Co-op quest missions AND PvP with 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3?  Ever wanted to do all the DBZ poses together with friends that doesn't involve any cosplay or going to a con and have it be admired and applauded by a bunch of random people?  Ever wanted to create the mystical rarely ever seen Saiyan and Majin Females to run around and look fabulous?  Ever wanted to just roll with the villians and kick the heroes in their butts so hard they spin flip into next tuesday?  Ever just, wanted to see a a group of 3 Yamchas somehow take down all the main villians? Or, you know, turn it around and have Frieza, Cell, and Buu all at once pummel Yamcha into a corpse a hundred times over?  If any of that sounds appealing at all you'll want this game. ------------------------------------------------------------------- However, there is a slight split over opinion on this game. This part is where I'll discuss the actual gameplay and go a little more in-depth on the status of the PC Port. Read on if you want the little details, but be warned, I'M TYPING UP A STORM!  First off, this is not a pure blood DBZ fighting game, it won't handle like any of the Budokais or Tenkaichis. So if you REALLY want combat like a true fighting game and would hate it if it was anything else, please save your money and other players the hassle of having to deal with more of the same complaints. You'll feel that the combat is way too 'clunky' for your tastes.  Now, with that aside...  This game has RPG elements, to mix in with the fighting, so it essentially becomes a Hybrid. You'll have basic fight game systems in place, simple combo strings, for example, Weak Attack x5 -&gt; Strong Attack x3 or Weak Attack x4 -&gt; Strong Attack x2, and such. 'Super' Skills are all mapped to 4 buttons after holding down a trigger on controllers or pressing another button first on Keyboard and Mouse. They happen right away and can be thrown into your regular attack combos if you're savvy enough and good at timing them. There's another 4 skills that get mapped however, three of them are 'Ultimates' which take three times as much energy as regular super skills but dish out a lot more damage and give you super armor during the entire duration (can be useful but also detrimental depending on what the opponents do) and the last one is an 'Escape' skill that lets you get out of combos instantly, usually causing a counter attack effect that deals a bit of damage back to your attacker. (No DBZ Sagas combo looping here!) If you panic and forget to use the escape skill or just don't want to bother, you can also hit the jump/ascend button to do a small teleport that nets you some invincibility frames and usually gets you at least to the side of the enemy if not behind them to catch them off guard and start your own combo. This method is more risky due to the fact that sometimes it doesn't work out as planned and you'll start getting hit again regardless. The RPG elements are simple too, there's a simple gathering and crafting system, and a rudamentary leveling up system where you gain 3 stat points with every level up and can spend them to increase your stats such as your HP, Ki Pool, Stamina Pool, and different attack stats. This allows for some basic character specialization into either a pure up close fighting, a pure Ki Blast user, or a hybrid of both to do mix ups. If you're just going to do missions and such with friends, how you specialize your damage won't matter TOO much as they can be boosted with the help of gear you gain access to as random loot drops from beating quest missions or buying from the shops when they unlock as you progress through the story.  If you're a fan of this Hybrid Fighting RPG gameplay that's found in some other games like Final Fantasy Dissidia or Phantasy Star Online, then you'll feel right at home with this game.  Now, gameplay aside, lets take a look at the port. At first, I went into it with low expectations, I mean, it's Namco Bandai, did you SEE their Dark Souls Port? It was so awful the community fixed it for them by making mods.  This however... Ohoho, this game... It's port? Let me just say that it's pretty astounding, at least compared to what I've seen from them before.  It's nailed the basic PC options menu pretty well, the resolution can go up to your monitor's max, you can turn Vsync on or off, There is however, no option to fiddle with the graphic options directly, but the game does auto detect your PC's specs and turns things to suit them the best while keeping things looking amazing. There is ONE option that you can change but it might cause slow down on older PCs, it's their shading system. I can't tell if it's because the shadows are super well done to make everything look nice and Manga/Anime-y or if it's because they couldn't find the time to optimize it correctly but fiddling with the Shadows option is usually enough to boost performance. There is also a frame counter option, but it goes roughly between 50 and 60 depending on your resolution, which is better than consoles mind you as they're locked at 30 FPS. You can of course go into the files and un-limit your frames if your monitor and PC can handle it.  Now with the options out of the way, lets see how well optimized this game is.  I have a higher end system so I should be able to run it without too much problems right? Well, yeah, except it's running so smoothly it's like watching butter melt down over a hot plate of pancakes. So I went around and asked people with lower systems. A couple of people got the 'minimum requirements' on Can I Run It and they get the same smoothness as long as they fiddle with the options a bit... So I can safely say, this game is pretty well optimized, if not amazingly so. This can also be in part to how simple most textures in the game are, while this might make other Triple A titles look appalling, the cell shaded textures fit the DBZ style so well that with the more simple textures it actually makes the game look even better. Most of the detail is on character models but even then they don't have things like tiny little details you can only see if you have hawk eyes or a microscope.  I kind of lost my train of thought here so, I can say one thing for certain... This game is a great RPG Fighting Hybrid, it's got a sense of community thanks to the hub, it can run on pretty much any system due to how well made it is, the PC controls don't suck, and DBZ fans get to live out their fantasies.  Just don't go into it expecting the Budokais and the Tenkaichis.",

Holy crap this game! It isn't like it's some kind of masterpiece of gaming, but it works. It works so very very well. The sheer satifsfaction of learning the ropes with your own character, finally being able to chain one move to another and sending your opponent flying helplessly, only to catch up to him and give him an up close and personal look at the special Ki moves you've learned... It's... It's pretty awesome.   If you're like me and you watched the Dragon Ball Z series and liked it, let me be clear; you get to create your own character in the Dragon Ball universe and then fight using that character. That sentence alone should be enough to convince you. I've played a few of the other Dragon Ball games, but none really ever stuck.

It is quite a nice mix of Dark souls and Monster hunter. with a bit of Beat´em up aspects with the combat.   Pros: Dark souls like difficulty at times. Monster hunter like quests. Easy to learn combat.  Cons: Difficult to get into the gmae at times. (may be fixed with time...) Quite confusing you dont ready quest text. Massive Gramatical flaws (presumably from the translation from korean.) Would i recommend it? Maybe. If the things i have just mentioned sound awesome in a Dragonball setting. then ♥♥♥♥ yeah. If it sounds odd, or too weird. then no. avoid it untill it goes on sale. 50 Euros is admittably a bit much. but it is worth it if you like Dark-souls and/or Monster hunter.",

            "review_text": "I have played both intensively and casually every DBZ game from the PS1 editions to the GBA sprite versions to the popular budokai 3. I will make things detailed for each section for everyone looking to buy this game and/or get the season pass.    Gameplay   8/10, as others have mentioned the game has a lot of skills and abilities for you to use from basically the whole series to its own unique versions, the grind in the game is actually a positive part of the game as it adds things for you to do HOWEVER there are some things I don't agree with. For example, You  could  get Super Saiyan early by beating a 3 star mission or you can spend those same hours grinding to just unlock it in the shop. It would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that it's really hard to get the skill and the time spent grinding for it could just be spent getting to the point in the story where you can simply buy it. None the less I still helped my friend grind for it as there is a sense of accomplishment but strategically it's better to wait it out. The game offers quite a few ways for you to play your character but there are certain moves that are just outright unfair and unblockable, it's not as big of an issue since it's a new game and balancing still needs to occur but it is significant enough in the story mode to lower the rating. Additionally another problem which made this a solid 8 rather than when I originally wanted to 10/10 gameplay is that auto attacks are very simplistic and lack depth which is apparent since there is only a single page for when you open up the combo list, teleporting behind/infront of characters costs way too much even though I find teleporting is a significant part of fighting in almost all games and it is showcased a lot in the anime series.     Story   10/10 As a Dragon Ball Z fan, the story gets real old with every retelling and you basically know what to expect, they have done a great job making the story engaging and making your character feel like they are genuinely interacting with the story and making things better. This becomes even more apparent as when you beat missions the city populates with new faces which creates a sense of accomplishment. After I had finished the story, I wanted more as it was engaging and while I haven't finished the story 100% (at 90% currently), I am happy to see there is more to come in the DLC packs. What makes the story engaging is as the other users have mentioned, the creators did a great job of answering popular fan questions of 'what if goku failed', it lacked depth at times beyond 'time and history will fall apart' but it is a great idea and it was well executed, sometimes even featuring what happens because goku failed. While you can't expect a whole new rendition of the story line, the game does a great job of telling the original story as well as adding its own twists, coming out of the game I could explain most of the DBZ story to another user without actually seeing the anime. While at the same time, knowing the potentials if one of the key characters had failed/succeeded.    Pricing   10/10  The bundle pack is easily justifiable for anyone who is a fan of the series, I've paid more for other games such as CoD which turned out to be a bundle of sticks. This game goes above and beyond for delivery and while so far you can get the same content by getting the cheaper version, I highly suggest getting the season pass for that glorious DLC and besides that, you are supporting the developers which will help push out content faster as well as attract some big players to bring DBZ to the PC and hopefully even start pumping out an xenoverse sequel or to add more content to the game and features.    Customization   6.5/10 Initially the customization is great as you are given quite a few choices and thematically the characters all make sense, I can tell apart a Saiyan from a human and overall the team has done a great job to allow the users to be able to customize. Unfortunately as certain clothes prove to be better for your characters build, you find yourself wearing the same outfit as others who have the same build as you, the more you venture into the game, the more you find yourself noticing close clones. I was under the assumption you could change the color of ANY item which would greatly expand the small clothing selection but was quickly let down when realizing that is not the case. Additionally, the game almost taunts you with the amount of races that you cannot pick or for certain characters you cannot play as, for example Buldos race or being able to play as the dark version of Frieza. The game has quite a few choices for character creation especially as a at launch game which is great and from the DLC packs it is easy to tell that more options will soon be available. As for new races, unfortunately I do not think they will be implementing anything beyond the 5 choices.    Graphics   9/10 Overall there isn't much to say about the graphics, it's sharp clean, and looks amazing in ALL available market resolutions, I have a 4K monitor and it was just beautiful to watch, the cutscenes were equally as beautiful. The games bright colors has an eye candy effect and even in dark rooms you can clearly see where is what, what made the graphics tank is the fact that the game is still glitchy with cloth effects such as hair moving/tail coats moving as well as the lip syncing is a bit silly. The game needs some polish but it turned out pretty damn well for an initial launch.    Cons   4/10  Keyboard controls are atrocious, using a controller is basically mandatory and I find myself wishing some keys would be mapped together such as instead of having two separate keys for supers and ultimates, to have a toggle instead with ctrl would make the keys more accessible, remapping the keys before playing is highly recommended. On both controller and keyboard, throwing is really easy to forget for key combination and every single one of my friends who I told to get the game still had no idea how to throw even after being told how ingame. The game seems to lack some hindsight and QA testing which leads to overpowered abilities, bad mapping of controls, and other issues which really makes the overall score tank. The game basically screams for a chat system as I find myself seeing players spam 'hello', additionally it needs more sectors/cities, the current city is over crowded and with so many clients requesting to see other players, it's no wonder why the servers are having issues, the game just wasn't made in mind for a huge player base such as what we have now and because of the lack of foresight, a lot of players including myself find ourselves playing offline and for online mode to just invite friends in a created lobby. Other issues include the chat system its self being very annoying and requires a mute button, I seriously wish I could play main story quests with friends which is a let down seeing as some quests are very very hard. The game also screams for a friends list, inviting friends to a lobby is tedious as you have to switch from controller to mouse just to invite them using the steam interface, an friends list in game would solve this issue and would keep friends in an easy glance to read. The game also screams for clans/guilds which it lacks as well as a trading system. The fact that you can have multiples of the same clothing but not be able to trade seems like a design flaw.  Another issue I found was that the game lacked any sort of height depth, with all the graphics way at the top of the screen, as well as it being a dragon ball Z game, the first initial thing I tried while in town was to fly, which I was presented with just a jump instead, the jump its self is useless as all the things that you could be able to pass is blocked by an invisible wall.    Overall   7.9/10, great game. get it, a fresh take on both mmorpg and fighters.",

There are downsides to the game (like all games) but its a fun game to progress a few hours a day.   pros:  -You get to customize your playstyle how you like. Melee heavy, powerful finishers, or a high health build -You can have different characters be your mentor (cell, frieza, goku, ect) and learn their ablilities  -Different races have weakness and advanatges  -A different story line than the other games. Its a breather from the other dbz games that follow the story line, if you read or watched the series, you know what to expect. -Its a challenge. The effort you put into your character, the easier the game gets. (Still tough) -online capiblities. Havent explored this much since Im still doing the story line and not maxed level -repeatable quests and rewards, helps gear and level your character as well gets your sempai to take notice -You can create teams with friends and play along and help each other   Cons: -Some fights seem impossible. Certian 'bosses' have anti flinching or a sheild you must break before you can do damage, all in all they're pounding on you and taking massive amounts of damage. -The bosses 'learn' your fight style. If you like to charge in and brawl it out, itll continue to run around, block,ect. -Again, some fights can be unfair, after a hard boss fight, you have a chance to come upon a new enemy at random (or part of the story) and you may have to fight several opponents alone -Leveling can be bit of a pain. If youre following the story line with out doing side quest, you wont make it. You can be as far as 10-15 levels behind and chances of winning are slim. So you have to grind out quests here and there. -Servers arnt relaible, continuous disconnections -Some abilities are buggy. I know a few melee attacks can be spammable (metor crash) but so far it hasnt worked for me     Over all, like other reviewers said, If you like/liked Dbz, Im sure youll enjoy this game. Flaws or not, its fun and a time killer.",

The game makes zero effort to introduce the characters so unless you are already a fan of the show you will more than likely be a little lost and the story will just be flashes of characters you don't know. It is still a fun game though. If the combat wasn't as much fun as it is the item grinding would kill this game. It's totally random and gets very frustrating.  There's a lot of little things that are starting to really bug me. Stuff that either shows they were rushed near the end or they starting putting less effort in. Spelling mistakes in the dialog (Beersu instead of Beerus is the last one I noticed. There have been many. Trunk',s with a comma and an apostrophe was another), either sounds are missing from certian parts or they were never added when they should have been (Vegeta transforms in silence during his training missions. Every time. It just looks silly.), the battle music fades in and out at seeminly random times (I've been mid combo when all of the sudden the music was gone and replaced, only for about 3 seconds, with the exploration music and then abruplty back to battle music), TokiToki City theme is really short and the repeating over and over gets annoying (And it reminds me of Chumbawamba's Tubthumping and there is no excuse for that), characters have about 2 lines they repeat over and over during battle no matter how far into the story you are (Piccolo: 'Where's that power coming from?! *10 seconds later* Where's that power coming from?! *start to power up* 'Where's that power coming from?!) but the grinding is honestly the worst part. It's totally random no matter what rank you get and there is no sense of reward or rarity of items becuase you have the same chance of getting Krillin's baseball cap as you do Super Saiyan 2 or a Dragon Ball. It's kind of funny that the grinding that everyone seems to be praising as giving so much replay value is the one thing that will keep me from ever starting over. If I had to unlock everything for every new character I made there is no way I would ever have more than 1 character. There is JUST enough fun in the battle system to keep me coming back to play. Don't buy this if you're looking for a brawler with RPG elements becuase you will be frustrated and dissappointed. Buy this because it is the best Dragon Ball game so far....and if it's on sale.   6.5/10",

Xenoverse manages to spice up the experience by altering key events and giving you a new focal villain to deal with.  Those who are fans of the previous Dimps DBZ games such as the Budokai series will sadly feel a bit let down. While the gameplay is fun and can get very frantic, it embraces the 3D flying aspects of more recent games than the traditional 2D pure fighting game style that their games were praised for. If you are looking for a strict fighting game, Xenoverse is not that. It is a fun experience, but it is not what some people were looking for.  Now that the server issues cleared up from launch, the game runs solidly, though I have experienced server hiccups still. Sometimes in-game connections can get spotty, and I have had a few missions end up with everyone swinging at an invincible Krillin as the server struggles to realign everyone.

            "review_text": "Hey everyone, really quick here is my personal review. Total: 7.6 (Not Bad, could use some improvement though) Graphics: 7 Mechanics: 6 Story: 8 Controls: 8 Gameplay: 8  Graphics - 7  Not my favourite thing, the graphics to Xenoverse are not super appealing. The corners are a bit jagged, and I think a little more anti-aliasing and a bit less contrast would be useful, just to cut back on eye strain.  Otherwise, it is definitely Dragonball, and feels like it.   Mechanics - 6  I've heard and seen a lot of complaints about characters being too fast to hit and hit boxes not functioning. Enemies can be a pain when they are faster if you don't have a higher level. Also, some CPUs are inherently stupid and just fly in circles fast enough you can't hit them with any form of aimable attack.  However, the game does offer plenty in the realm of unique attacks, each with different mechanics to make it more or less useful to use for your character. The amount of coding to go into these moves is impressive, even more when animations are accounted for.  Story - 8  Very easily the best Dragonball Game story I've seen, period. It didn't just use Dragonball's story as a backdrop to a fighting game, it adapted the game to the story. Every detail from Character Building, to the stages, to the XP system worked for the purpose of story progression. A unique story in the future is by far what I'd enjoy.  The Post-Story is the one thing keeping me from putting this higher. I dislike that Broly, a character only about as strong as Cell and weaker than Buu, ended up being the final boss after beating both Beerus and Demigra, both Gods.  Controls - 8  I'm sad to say my biggest disapointment here is that there is no run ability in Toki Toki City. Being able to run (Or Fly) would make travel in the area so much more convienent. Otherwise you have to walk at the slow speed to the stores or Parallel Quests before rejoining the main story. Otherwise controls run fairly smooth.  Gameplay - 8  Between the story and other options, Custom Characters and moves work out very well as a reason to be drawn to the game. The Mentor system makes me happy, as it highlights and mirrors Goku's own training throughout the series. The Parallel Quests even explain a big chunk of the story, explaining why they exist is to halt the Butterfly effect from occuring due to the changes made by your very presence at events.  The big, crippling injury to Gameplay is the low drop rate of skills from Parallel Quests. You can spend hours working on farming a skill and not get it. In some cases it comes in a run or two, others it can take hundreds.  However, the game starts by throwing you right into the story, with the massive battles starting between Goku, Freiza, Cell, and Kid Buu. This gives you time to test the controls out for yourself a bit before the actual tutorial, a battle against Future Trunks, takes place.  My Favourite Things, In Order: - Character Customization - Thrown right into action - Each move is different - No Character Clones - Voice 8 Easter Egg  My Least Favourite Things, Why, and How to Fix Them: - Male and Female characters within the same species have different stats. This annoys me, because it makes playing a Female Strike Character not so valuable, because her stats will be lower. Similarly (Though not usually what I dealt with) Male Ki characters were also not as strong. Removing this system would be good for all involved, as it hinders character customization to build off gender stereotypes. Plus with Majin, it allows a more Kid-Buu like character to be made. - 'Ki Spamming.' Super and Ultimate Moves don't have a cool-down between use to increase variation. Some have a set-up, but others such as Ill Flash or Symphonic Destruction start almost immediately making it hard to dodge. While I understand Ki Spammers usually get killed by someone knowing how to work around the move, it is probably better in the future to add a brief cooldown to make it more effective to vary a moveset in a DPS way. - Characters. I know this is going to be a sticky subject, but there are very few story characters to play as of various races. Namekians only have one, Piccolo, and the Frieza Clan has one (technically 3) in Frieza. Buu's three forms are present, as the only Majin as well. While I understand the story limitations, these characters were included, plus a slightly different model between full power and standard Cell, and Goku and SSG Goku. I feel the memory that one of the two Cells, the Freiza Henchmen, or the Saibamen used could have been better utilized to add King Cold or Dende/Slug. Given a new series is on the way, the next installment in the Series could better use those spaces for new characters from Dragonball Super, however. I'd reccomend going through the characters most commonly used in Online Mode, and Online Battles, on top of just Polling for which of the show/movie characters people like the most and figuring out which should be added to the Game. I ensure you, nobody will miss Appule, Saibamen, or Cell Jr. in the Character Selection screen. - 'Grinding' Grinding for skills is obnoxious in this game, with the Random Number Game making it hard to get some of the most desired items and skills. I think it might be more effective to have the Randomized drops take into account average score (per player) compared to current score per mission, and number of games to help determine if a skill drops from a Quest. Otherwise, adding more to the Skill Shop would be helpful! - No Transformations. Aside from Super Saiyan, only Kaioken exists for Transformation Skills. It could find better use to add other Transformation skills to other races, especially Freiza Clan members or Majin. Adding a better regenerative ability to Namekians (Drain Stamina for Health, maybe?) and Humans (Drain Health for Ki and Stamina) could replace the existing transformations and make sense within the story.  Overall this was a good game, and if another like it is made I will pick it up! However, in it's current state it will really only appeal to people who are big fans of Dragonball, and not just people who like games. This is something that time and tweaking could change.",

Unlike most fighting games it focuses on knowing when to use an ability or combo as opposed to how quickly you can press a series of buttons. (Pressing R Trigger + button for supers and pressing L+R Triggers for ultimate attacks, combos use X &amp; Y, some other side things like grab or basic ki blast all in a simple easy to use package.)  To those who are perhaps not so good at fighting games that have high demand for perfect combo sequences like myself, Dragonball Xenoverse is an excellent fighting game that you might enjoy more fully. As for those who like a competitive play worry not, while simple in controls it's still about timing and strategy and I encourage the experienced fighting game players to give it a try as well.",

If someone is directly in front of you, your ki blasts and other attacks can all completely miss. However if you're slightly off to the side and out of the blast area, it will usually connect. The combos don't always chain, and when they do, they tend to knock the opponent out of the chain. This is especially true with the most simple 'hold down the ki attack button to rapid fire' combo.  I wish that instead of such a big hub world (which you have to walk around, no running or flying) they had spent more time on the fighting aspect.

Short story about my struggles and events in xenoverse: So my friend and I both planned to farm dragon balls, to unlock all characters for the achievement. After grinding the same mission over and over again for like 100 times (if not more) I managed to get my very first 7 dragon balls. Me and my mate grew apart in xenoverse and I was left behind for grinding the remaining total of 14 dragon balls (2x shenron).  I decided after a week to give it a shot. Managed to get 7 dragonballs in 10 missions.  So as of today I only need 3 more dragonballs for the last character, but I guess Shenron ran out of balls. Stopped counting after 50 missions of how long it'd take to get one ball again.  On the overall the community is pretty messed up with it comes to pvp. You win, they leave, you gain nothing. You lose, you lose rating. Players for doing missions together are so far pretty cool! Their mic can be so now and then in the middle of a hurricane, but other than that you can depend on them.   The AI for your team when you play offline is crap compared to the enemy AI. But as a player you are pretty strong and fastly responding so it gets balanced out.   The story itself is pretty amazing! Truelly loved it, reliving all those past events and ending with an epic climax.   This game will easily get you 50+ hours if you want to complete everything.   I am at 60+ hours and I have only finished the main quest and the PQ's. still got like 40% left to do for a 100% completioning rate. So it is worth the buck!

There are never any lobbies and it takes a billion years for anyone to join you.) -Beam clashes (remember those cool beam clashes from games like dbz budokai tenkaichi 3? Yeah.

You can place points on to a select status to increase things like your health . Clothes gives you status boost too and some you can buy later after play the story. Characters can use Z souls which is like a special boost during battle or at the start.  Cons: Only 3 DLC Limit characters ( NOT ALL CHARACTERS FROM THE SHOW ARE IN THE GAME like Eighter ) Custom Characters can not change there aura color RNG Makes obtaining skils,items and clothes etc a pain in the but. Final Battle of the Final Boss is a complete joke i can beat him at level 3 after beating the game. Game is a Grindfest meaning you have to fight a lot to get to max level. Online game seems to be wonky as you will be connected for like 10 - 30 minutes then get disconnected. Custom Character Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2 does not change there hair style its only a power increase ( I hate this personally )",

It is very cool to play as a custom made character with legendary moves like the speacial beam cannon and the kamehameha but that is really the only fun that the game really has to its name. After finishing all of the story missions you get to play over 50 parallel quests to get clothes and moves for your character. But all of the moves that are given from these have a random chance of dropping making you spend hours to get that one move. This I feel ruins the whole replayablity of the game and makes it more of a one time deal.   7/10 would recomend for dbz fans, 6/10 for people who aren't fans",

The game is also constructed around rpg mechanics with ranDOOM drops for specific missions, point distribution, and item usage. You can make a build according to your play style, but you'll probably are going to min/max depending on the race you use.  In a nutshell all of my favourite features of this game are: 1. Epic dragonball z fights that you partake in as your character or one from the established universe. 2. A wide amount of choice regarding playstyle and clothing. 3. Little funny bits of character interaction whenever a fight is happening (e.g. Characters responding to your race.) 4. Simple combat system and infinite juggles. 5. Doing parallel quest 02 as final flashing kid gohan in the face repeatedly. 6. BY JOVE ITS ON PC. And I haven't had any issues running it, bar server problems.  Lots of small complaints I have. 1. The lock system works well about 80% of the time, that 20% of it ♥♥♥♥ing me over really drags the game down. 2. God awful lip syncing, at least in english. 3. The engrish is pretty strong, if you know what I mean. 4. This game is an absolute grindathon if you're trying to nab one specific item, I FINALLY ♥♥♥♥ING GOT IT THOUGH. 5.

Stats either need to be variable on a piece of clothing (which gives replay incentive similar to MMO's), or need to be removed altogether. Also, all specific player pieces need to be color customizable (I.E. Piccolo's cape) - Item collection. Item collection in game is distracting from the fight.

Dragon Ball Xenoverse, to me, is a return to the need for skill over speed. Yes, people will spam their ultimates and supers. But in this game, there's ways around everything.   Now, if you get caught between Super Saiyan Gohan's super kamehameha spam and Super Saiyan Goku's super kamehameha spam, you WILL die. So just a piece of advice, for way down the line: When you reach that point, just keep both of them in front of you, casually sidestep their ultimates, and just spam those tiny little ki blasts.   You'll also suffer greatly during the infamous 'stealth' mission, once you get to that point. I won't spoil why it sucks, but just know that you need to take the time to Z rank everything, including the parallel quests, up until you reach that particular mission. It will be a pain, but you will need the levels you get.   Aside from that... This is more like Tenkaichi than Raging Blast, but with custom characters, and a stamina bar replacing the little blue meter. If you liked Tenkaichi, consider getting this one. Also, the story is different, but ah, spoilers. ^_~",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game, yes.  Why? Well, it's because it's the best dbz game in history.... albeit also the ONLY good dbz game in history...  *alert potential spoilers, you have been warned*  At any rate, here are the cons of the game:  Vast amount of blast supers and ultimates, but in the strike department, this game is seriously lacking, there's one crucial one, and the rest are mostly just... meh... Being a strike based build is a waste of time, especially when blast supers and ultimates are easier to hit with.  PvP is literally dead already. Why? It's because the sayjan race can have unlimited ki attacks, until their ki runs out. so they can just spam their ultimates at you. And if they pair it with that strike skill I spoke of earlier, they also have unlimited ki. Go figure. Now add in a spice of super armour (no stagger occours) when equipping certain z-souls... Yes, who would play against that? it's basically a legal cheat.  Character customization, while being a bliss in just being there. Is fairly limited. You need to wield clothes that gives stat increases or decreases, so that they fit your playing style, which means you'll end up with one outfit you like best, and then never try anything else on. Oh, and you can't change colours on all clothing. There are a few races missing. from the dragon ball lore. Nothing that is quite impressive in the series, but even so, they are still lacking. Can't think of one in particular, but that is mostly because I don't know what they are called. And no... As a sayjan, you cannot go ape  Here's one thing though: You can't do squat about your basic attack patterns, if you want something different, you need to change class and/or gender. (yes, genders have different attack patterns) I get the idea, but it annoys me, since I love the grapple on the female sayjan, but hate it on the female majin, which is currently my main.  Oh, and grinding, there's also grinding, and let's not forget about grinding. Did I mention grinding? Yes, there is ALOT of grinding. Drops are random, and NOT guaranteed to drop in the first place. you'll spend tons of time going through the same quests to get that specific skill, or clothing piece. and there aren't that many quests to do. all of them are the same, safe for 2. where you will ''search'' for dragon balls.  And by search, I mean look at a dragon radar, land near the ball, and pick it up. Coulda been done better, but it's nice change.  The main hub?... god that wasn't the best idea, jumping is pointless, and you can't even take off... Waste of time. It'd been better with a menu. On the other hand, this would remove some immersion. But it could have been done better. alot better.  Anything else that bothers me about this game? Let's see here... In the all the quests, you'll often face multiple enemies at once, who are experts at stun juggle attacks, also ultimate spamming sayjans, and alot of super armour.  Good thing you can bring 2 npc's along XD (even if they are just there to be obstacles for the enemy)  Now then, the money system is also pretty pointless. Once you have everything you need from the stores, money is overrated. the only thing you'll be spending it on, is health capsules (healing pots) and the like. Which are rather cheap, once you start accumulating money in the millions.  Oh, and the chat, is limited to commands. there's no free chat. BORING.   Now then, what's the good stuff? the ''nitty gritty'' of it?  Lemme tell you;  The story mode. It is EPIC. you will not only visit the different eras in dbz lore, you will face it altered, trying to correct it! See, in the very first story, you'll face a raditz, who is stronger than the old radditz you know. So strong in fact, he broke free of gokus grapple, and survives, while goku still died. Bummer. You're sent head first into battle, and save his behind before that happens.  And before you know it, you'll be taking on titans in dbz lore.  The level system is well thought through, though the current max level is a bit of a weird thing... How many games has the max level as 99? Seriously, couldn't they go that one number higher?. It wouldn't mean much, but 99? At any rate, you can invest points in several areas, including max health, stamina and ki, as well as the power of your basic attacks, strike supers, and blast supers.  Invest the points wisely, you can't redo them without gathering all 7 dragon balls and wishing for a redo, which brings me to the next point: The dragon balls.  You obtain these by fighting other time patrollers during your quests (Not human fighters, rather an npc version of them) And then you have a chance to get a dragon ball. Once you have them all, you can make a wish, yay. Do so carefully though, as the wishes aren't as straightforward as one would think. but there are things you can only get this way.  Now then, what else is nice? The master system. You can gain a master, which is one of the characters from dbz lore, and they will teach you their skills. Pretty handy. You will get some of the best ultimates this way. Also, after a quest, they may give you an item. Sometimes, during battle, if you are struggling. They will come to your aid! alright... Vegeta versus vegeta, this is gonna be intere-wait what?!  Also, character customisation. I know it's not much, but it's the only dbz game that actually does exactly what everyone wanted. A game where YOU could create YOUR own character, and toss them into the world of dbz.  Now, if only they could have done better with the main hub... ah well, I guess there's always next time. Here's hoping for a xenoverse 2! (the ending certainly delivers a chance for a sequel, at least the vanilla ending. I have not played any DLC yet)   Now, do the cons outwheigh the pros?  Let's talk about price.... This game, is a whopping 50 euroes on steam. Not a small amount. and no. Don't buy it for that price, wait for it to be on sale, then buy it.  It's not worth it's price, but it's pretty damn close to being so. If only the main hub, and multiplayer aspect had been better. Perhaps an overworld like a traditional open world mmorpg.  But I guess we can't have the cake AND eat it this time, huh?  Well. In any event, thanks for sitting through this lengthy wall of text, hope it gave you some insight in terms of buying or not. Remember; even though this game has it's faults, I love it. why? Because it's the only GOOD dragon ball z game in the world. and it's not just the best of the worst. Nope. This game makes the others look like badly made flash games.",

Cons: The controls are complete crap for a keyboard. Trust me, the game hase controller support so USE IT. The GT DLCs are a bit iffy. SO....MUCH...GRINDING You don't unlock Super Saiyan by story which is a shame. It took me about 2 days to get Kaio-Ken x20.  Overall: This is a fun game, and a homage to all Dragon Ball fans, we are truely in the Dragon Ball golden age. Don't let the controls push you away, because that's my main issue, use a controller. Game looks AMAZING and if you rage quit for a week, it gives you goodies while your gone! What a nice game, and it truely deserves that 89% possitivity rating. If you like Dragon ball, and or Z, get the game. AND FOR SOME REASON YOU LIKE GT, Before I club you like a seal, they'res DLC, and DLC for the new movie. The game is a bit over priced, but with a long story. TRUST ME you will get your money's worth.",

Story felt long and interesting and the gameplay is super fun in my opinion. Once the story is finished, you can replay the story missions, complete the side missions (Parallel Quests) or take the battles online and play PvP or PQ's with others. Eventually I just started replaying PQ's for new moves and 100% completion, but honestly unless you play the same PQ over and over in a row, replaying the PQ's never got boring because the gameplay kept me going. Definitely try it out if you love Dragonball Z/GT.",

If it's the latter fly away and charge ki. Repeat until they die to death. Freiza deflected most of my attacks. He yelled 'This may kill you!' and hit me with his ultimate.  Just clinged onto life. Got kicked in the face. K.O Retried. Retried again. Retried again. Retried again. You get the point. Was about to give up. Remembered how Krillin cut off Freiza's tail. Used stratergy above replacing Meteor strike with Destructo Disc. Won in 2 minutes with 3/4 health left. Player appeared. Killed them with the meteor strike strategy. Got a three star dragon ball.

From the time-travel element, the battles are different enough from the original series it felt like it is really fresh and a new experience as a whole, creating some great scenarios in the storyline that actually makes me feel as though I am having an impact in the game, rather than playing the part of passenger on a sightseeing tour of my favourite scenes. I love the fighting mechanics with the Ki gauge is used for skills as normal and a stamina gauge for dashing and teleporting so you don’t get hit as much or just getting the ♥♥♥♥ out of town while a big ♥♥♥ Ki beam coming up yo ♥♥♥, which is a GREAT improvement from other DBZ games. The overall gameplay style is similar to that of the Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z that I had on the PS3 and played for a long time.  It’s also possible to fly at high speeds around the large, free-roam maps to find materials such as different types of capsules to make items for boosts or hp gain. At times I have my falling outs with the game with some quests (Bardock I’m a Melee player) ;P but that’s normal right? It’s a nice challenging full blown game with a drop in drop out elements with it too that I like.  People have hissy fits about how it started off with the online not working at times but they did keep up us up to date with the facebook/ social media so its not as bad as people say, but come on what games these days have a great launch take WoW (I love this game but I’m just giving a resent example) most launches are bad for the releases but it works out in the end so why get pissy about it?

Granted, I'm a little biased, but this game fits me just fine. The premise is that the past is being changed by Mira and Towa, and you've been summoned by Shenron to help Trunks and the Supreme Kai of Time change the past to be the events that actually happened. It's a different take from other DBZ games, where you're just re-enacting the story. The story in this game is solid, though, and while it does seem to start a little on the slow side, once it starts picking up, you'll want to see what happens next.  Other than the story, there is PvP and Parallel Quests. Parallel Quests are basically optional missions that you can partake in and receive unique skills, Z-souls, etc. which all help your character become more powerful. The only issue is you'll more than likely be grinding for what you want in the game. PvP can be either 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3, or you can have a unique Endless battle, where it is 1v1 with up to 4 spectators. The winner of the match fights the next person in line, and it keeps going from there.  Having a custom character in a DBZ game is incredible, A lot of people came up with some great characters, while parody characters are hilarious to look at (from Kaka-carrot-cake to the Pillsbury doughboy, I've seen a lot of unique characters).  There's not really much else to say about this game. If you're on the fence about it, I'd definitely get it. I purchased the Bundle Edition within the week it came out, and I have no regrets at all. Of course, if you're not a fan of DBZ, you may want to look at gameplay just to make sure it's your type of game. If you've played Dragon Ball games before, you're going to enjoy this one.",

            "review_text": "If you are sick and tired of reliving the same old sagas over and over again in other Dragonball games, then consider giving Xenoverse a try. The storylines have enough twists and 'what if' scenarios to make it feel fresh. Is it the best Dragonball game though? Not necessarily. The AI kind of sucks and the character roster is smaller than other DBZ games. The game also plays more like a situational MMO instead of a fighting game. You have a main hub, then you go to different stations to pick up and participate in quests to level up enough to take on the next bit of the story. I didn't find the MMO-like gameplay an issue, but for fans of the DBZ fighting games, this may take some getting used to.   Despite the flaws, there are many good aspects about Xenoverse. The character customizer is awesome and having your character be an integral part of the DBZ story is very rewarding and satisfying. The character roster, while limited, still contains some good characters with fun movesets to experiment with. The voice acting is amazing, with most of the show's actors reprising their roles. Finally, this game is riddled with fan service that fans of the show will definitely enjoy.  Here's what I would like to see: TEAMFOURSTAR DLC!!! If you don't know these guys, they edit and redub DBZ to get the story across but in a shorter amount of time and with funnier dialogue. They have done an amazing job adapting DBZ into their DBZ Abridged series, so I would love to see what they would do using the alternate universe storyline in this game! I think it would be hilarious, and the actors who work at TeamFourStar deserve a lot more credit than they get.  Overall rating: 7.1/10  Pros: +Character creator +Fresh story (written by Toriyama) +New villains +Voice Acting from original show +Lots of content to experiment with  Depending on the person: +/- MMO elements +/- Solid but bland combat +/- Server issues  Cons: -Grinding -Occasionally cheap bosses -Bland new characters",

The game runs pretty smooth, and aside from the horrible lip sync the animation is well done. There is one gripe I have as far as game play in fights, I have noticed that if your opponent is knocked down beam energy attack do zero damage even if they hit... so I guess you could say the gamplay mechanics could use a little polishing... The whole masters thing is a little underexplained, still trying to figure that out. Also, I don't know if I am just having issues connecting with their servers at the moment, or if there just isn't many people worldwide who play this game but I have not yet seen an online match room made. Another side note on gameplay, the single player stuff is just... so easy, very nearly boringly easy... However, the story makes up for it pretty well (also maybe online play is where the real challenge is...) I am not 100% on this yet but I doubt there will be much replayability for this game if you can't get online and play with randos or friends.

(Grinding is a problem either way).  - Random drops (you will have to replay lots of hard quests for that super power).  - Not possible to turn off ingame cutscenes in parallel quests. Since you will repeate those tons of times they will get repetitive and annoying. - Some minor bugs like missing sounds from some attacks - Servers are still slow resulting in sometimes long loading times even in single player.

Not a full selection of powerups.  3 letters sum this up, RNG. It's painful. If the drop rate was a little better this game would be pretty awesome overall, but fighting though the tough levels gets old when you get no reward for it a lot of the time. Combat in single player feels tight but unless you have a great connection with your opponents online the lag can make all the difference. I've been hit by stuff that went no where near me on my screen, yet while playing with a friend on his screen it was spot on. Can get pretty frustrating. The SSJ you have to fight get pretty irritating after a while since they tend to cheese blasts. Overall this game is pretty good but unless you like grinding a whole lot it might no be for you.

Camera control isn't bad in open spaces but some of the tight spaced maps make me wan't to stop playing the game at times.

The first problem you run into is the lack of online entertainment. What I mean by this is easy to explain. Have you ever taken a bite out of a chocolate chip cookie just to find out it’s raisin. Well that’s online Xenoverse. We were promised an online community where we could battles other players or cooperate with such players. We got more of a glitchy interface and a lack of player communication. This ideal drawing from the online battle system I ran into when I got the game. I asked for a ranked battle and waited and waited and waited until eventually two rooms popped up and the one I clicked ended up being full. After being thrown off of the screen I loaded the online battle a second time and waited and waited and waited until I got the room that was below the previous room. Remembering that I clicked ranked match, I got a match against an individual who was 30 levels above me. Long story short I lost. Pass the online battle we meet parallel quast. This system was better but not great. My first try with it ended with disappointment. There was a total of 3 rooms all of which were way above my skill set. After this I started a room for myself and waited and waited and waited until I got 2 other players and we started the quest. It felt very similar to fighting offline with little to no player cooperation or even communication.   So my conclusion to this game. Well not bad. The games online interface sucks and fighting with multiple Npc at a time while fun meets a frustrating mood once your teammate goes down. So why does Xenoverse rate so well? Simple Xenoverse doesn’t throw its failures down your throat allowing for a limited enjoyment. I’m hoping that Xenoverse is a stepping stone for future DBZ games and that dimps and bandai learn from its failures.",

I'm furious with this they straight out skipped Frieza forms 1-3 and Cell fourms 1 and 2 and only have final and full power forms and it makes me furious and gohan teen only has super sayian 1 and up no normal teen Gohan so you always have to play teen Gohan as a super sayian  There are more flaws but none as big as the ones I mentioned don't get me wrong the games good and fun but it just wasn't what i was expecting....",

I would recommend, however, that you purchase this game when it is on sale.  EDIT(9/11/2016):somehow on quests such as the full power cell PQ and the Return of the Great Ape Fest PQ causes me to lag not only in game but also while of the game when I hold a key down on the keyboard. Typing this portion of the review also made me lag especially when i held a key! Several weeks Prior to this, I palyed the Perfect Cell PQ and everything in game and after I stopped playing(when i failed to get an ultimate finish on that PQ) ran smoothly without any lag whatsoever. (Don't know if this is just me or not)THis hasn't happened in anyother PQ that is 4 stars or lower in difficulty(those are the only difficulties i stayed on because of my low level).  I f youre gonna buy this, it may be a better choice to get the console version instead of the steam version ONLY to be safe.",

That being said though, XV is NOT a fighting game. It's an incredibly grindy action RPG. Skills and passive abilities are all random drops in fights, and specific builds for your characters can be infuriating to make at times.   If you're familiar with the now-defunct Dragonball Online, just try to ignore how much of the game is recycled from DBO. 12/10, getting a sequel later this year",

            "review_text": "So I am gonna start this off by saying that I've been a watcher and an admirer of all things Dragon Ball for 15 years. Dragon Ball Z is my favorite show of all time and it's very sentimental to me since I watched it with my uncles a lot as kid and I still do to this day with Super and Kai. So you can rest well knowing this review is written by an almost lifelong fan of the series, or you can view it as biased, each to their own. This is probably the Dragon Ball game that is most true to it's source material since the Budokai games. It nails the art style, moves, fighting and characters down to a tee. The only thing I was disappointed with is no blast struggles. I would have loved to reenact the Kamehameha vs Galick Gun or struggle with a player online or a friend. The fighting is flawed but still fun in parts. The tracking can really suck resulting in wasted hits and special/ultimate attacks, you will experience a lot of missed attacks in this game. If you can cope with that like I do, that's great but there's no denying that it can be annoying. The story mode has you going through parts of all the indivisual arcs of the Z series (Saiyan, Namek, Frieza, Cell Game, Buu and unlockable Bardock and Broly stages). It's pretty enjoyable overall if you know what's going on, no severe grinding is required to match the skill of a certain opponent and it's all pretty quick compared to the parallel quests. The parallel quests serve as side missions where you can unlock attacks, z-souls, outfits and zeni (currency). These are just battle stages with some dialogue potentially pushed in. The difficulties of the quests are seperated. Completing these can be a task considering that you may have to grind due to the difficulty and time restrictions of some of the higher quests. It's not primary to play through these but it's there nonetheless. I personally found trainers to be a promising concept but it was executed in a pretty lack luster way. Trainers are there to teach you moves that they use in the actual story. For example, Vegeta will teach you the Galick Gun and Final Flash amongst others. The only way to progress in the training once you learn a move is grind in the campaign or parallel quests and get good grades. You could also use the most recent move they taught you in missions but I've found this to be optional. It can be a grind to make it through training and it's kind of disappointing how once they teach you that last ultimate, you kind of just move on to the next trainer. The leveling system is straight forward and what you'd expect a modern leveling system to be, gain EXP to level up. Once you reach level 80, this can begin to be a grindfest since you will rarely get above 60,000 EXP. So if you're planning to play this for a long time, keep that in mind. The online overall is really fun, if you can find someone who's playing it. You will more commonly find people playing online parallel quests than online battles, but in my experience online battle are a ton of fun, especially when you and your opponent are neck and neck and don't use items. Performance is not a problem, this game isn't costly to run which is good for a modern gen game. Although if you're playing on a casual laptop, don't be expecting to be playing at HD resolutions or high graphics. In conclusion, Dragon Ball Xenoverse is a must play for gamer DB fans even for casual play. You will hit a few grinds and later on you will have more difficulty as you play, but overall the game is worth the £40 price tag and definitely worth the £10 price tag on ♥♥♥.",

I was a huge fan of the Budokai series on PS2 way back and I played some others like Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3 which were okay games but I perfered the classic fighting camera and the QTE's in the original Budokai games made it feel like the show when Tenkaichi did not.  The reason say this is because when I bought Xenoverse I wanted that Budokai feeling I had when I was a kid. A game where it felt like I was apart of the show or getting to see some dream fights I had as a kid. Budokai captured that for me but Xenoverse did not sadly.  I didn't like Xenoverse that much because of the pacing. Yeah, we've all seen the show in a million times in other games where Goku goes Super Sayian for the first time and you're like 'What the hell is happening' and when you realize its one of the best moments ever of DBZ. Suddenly, this just became your favorite show.  This game didn't capture that. It wasn't as epic as it should have been. Any of the big scenes in Xenoverse weren't even close to captured as the main show and it made the single player feel rushed. I would perfer if they just brought another games version of it over and recycle the voices lines instead of this.  Next is that I don't like they tried to make it like a MMO, without the tools that make a MMO. Its like they went half way. Oh you can see other players but you can't really interact with them. Maybe they did this because there might be kids purchasing the game and they don't want to have to deal with someone spamming the N word or something.  Lastly, the combat for this game is actually... pretty good. It felt polished so the gameplay was there and that is the only thing that made this game enjoyable and got me a good 25 hours of it before I stopped playing it. Only bad thing about the gameplay is online PvP is sometimes laggy and pot spamming and that makes the game unbalanced. Who thought that was a good idea?  Overall the game is okay. I'm mixed about it. If you're a DBZ fan I recommend it and if you've never heard of DBZ skip it. This game won't convince you to like the 90's show or get into that much at all because of how they tell the story of this game. If I wasn't a fan of DBZ I would of hated this game but it was fun for a little bit because I wanted to recapture my childhood again.  6.5/10  - Recommend for DBZ fans only.",

            "review_text": "A must have for any fan of the Budokai/Budokai Tenkaichi Games. Sagas are abridged, so not recommended as the first introduction to Dragonball. For fans of the series, there's plenty of nostalgia candy. Game design choices are hit-and-miss. Controller Support had no issues (plug-and-play Wired XBox 360 controller)  There's a good selection of playable characters along with different outfits (i.e. Saiyan Saga Vegeta, Goku Ginyu); however, skillsets are locked for the playable characters.  You can use practically every move from the series and some new ones (Yamcha's Saibamen death is even a move); however, some of the best skills require grinding and/or heavy RNG to acquire.  Grind can become an issue for desirable skills, outfits, and Z-Souls. Some items only drop when certain mission objectives are met, and even then they're not guaranteed to drop.  Clothes have stats, which would've been fine if they didn't also have trade offs (+2 to X, -2 to Y).  Really hurts making a perfect look &amp; build combo.  In PvE, Saiyans are by far the superior race to cheese content due to Super Saiyan. During the Super Saiyan state, ki gradually decreases; however Supers and Ultimates consume no ki. Spamming AOE Ultimates remains highly effective throughout the game.  In PvP, it's a bit more diverse, although expect to deal with said Super Saiyan Spammers.   Couple ending notes regarding the Create-A-Character: You start the game with one character slot, eight in total. The other character slots are unlocked once you beat the main story. Your items and skills unlocked are shared across all characters, even if you delete your first character. The dragonballs can be used to reset your stats or appearance (can't change gender)   Overall, a great game for fans of the series, especially if you ever wanted to put yourself into the world of Dragonball. In terms of value, wait for a sale. The DLC (specifically Resurrection F) are a nice enhancement for endgame.  Also, some bundles (not the one in the Steam Store) do in fact still have the Pre-Order bonus (Gold/Crystal Battle Armor and Super Saiyan 4 Vegeta)",

While both of those games are still incredible in my eyes, the fighting system in Xenoverse is hands down the most responsive and most importantly fun DBZ simulator I've ever played. Providing players with a new campaign that riffs on prior DBZ lore we all know and love is one thing, also giving the player an in depth character creator allowing you to make your custom z warrior is just icing on the cake. The combat system may seem simple on the surface, but their are layers of complexity waiting to be unearthed by those willing to invest the time into this unique fighter. All that said, the story is extremely repetetive and grind heavy with difficulty spikes that will test even the patient of indiviudals. These factors can easily disuade many from entry but I promise the payoff is whole heartedily worth the investment.",

So I'm only recommending it as an offline game for now, but definitely wouldn't pay full price until they figure something out, I'm lucky to have gotten it at 75% off sale.  Edit: since posting this review I learned that you have to reach a certain point in offline missions to be able to play online.",

The game feels great with a USB controller but is equally playable with a mouse and keyboard. The online multiplayer is fun (quests &amp; battles) and you can show off your gear and moves that you acquired to other players. I recommend this game and give it an 8/10.  I give this game and 8/10 because of the online DRM thats required to play, which doesnt seem optimized to well and has gone down a couple times rendering the game basically useless while it was down.",

The game has it's downsides though like the insane difficulty spikes and hub world size and not being able to run that fast in it. I bought this in the sale so it was like £8 but you might as well get Xenoverse 2 because they are about the same price.",

An overall great DB game. A note though. The game is quite extensive and the levels do get much more difficult as you progress for story mode. I ended up grinding in PQ's(player quest). I managed to reach 81 after grinding. Quite OP if you have the right build. I'd recommend xenoverse to any DB fan and a suggested game for people who don't know DB at all. ",

The character creation is an awesome addition and is really fun (Just add more hairstyles,eyes etc.) The next thing I want to talk about is the character roster: This has the main characterrs of the game but it was dissapointing seeing the size of it. I got the bundle but even with the dlc characters it was pretty underwhelming... Guess I'm used to BT3, lol. Besides that I think the moves and Supers and Ultimates for all the characters were very impressive. As for the fightting mechanics, I wasn't so impressed. It was good enough for me, but that isnt saying alot. Nonetheless I think its usable and that you should all get this game. The plot was fun and not the same story over and over, and it was enjoyable. I'd probaly give this a 8/10 and I think that all DBZ fans should get this and have a ABSOLUTE blast!   I'm excited to see DBX 2 and I hope they just fix up those faults. Thanks for reading ^.^",

In Parrell Quest no. 19 you have to fight 2 fighters all alone. So basic avoid move is to hit a when being hit to tp behind enemy. But in that quest it doesn't work and makes it hard as f***. But you need the xp to make game better so. You have to do it solo to which is just bad design.  Overall don't buy the game.",
