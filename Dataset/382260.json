Yes, I would love the game even more if it had online muliplayer, but the game its self is really fun, reminds me of a supermeat boy with some witty comedy here and there.  Though its 'Not as good as Dark Souls' You will die like you are in Dark Souls. You will die a lot, and probably curse at your screen on more than one occasion.",
