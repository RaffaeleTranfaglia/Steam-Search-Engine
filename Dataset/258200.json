            "review_text": "So, I got this game for free through Humble Bundle... In a way, it's bizarre that this... thing, actually has a price, as it's effectively a demo for the full game. If you can't be arsed to make your way through the whole of this review, all you need to know is, this is a great way to make you realise how this game could be fun with friends, but not on your own, and not as it is.  Being older than I appear, and growing up in a time when Steam Sales would sound like magic beans rather than allowing me a way to convert pocket money into actual jollies, I would spend my time leafing through the back pages of White Dwarf, imagining what it would be like to be able to play the games contained within. One such was Talisman, and I spent a terrifying amount of time imagining what the fabled game would actually be like to play.  Now I know. I'm really glad my 12 year old self got that gift for free.  Should you pay for it? No. No. The game could potentially be fun with friends, and this version is fine for working out the mechanics of the actual game, which you are definitely not buying here. It's kind of astonishing they still charge you extra to buy the tutorial, although I have been informed it was originally released as a work in progress before the multiplayer was released. That still doesn't mean there is any point in paying for it now, and playing it alone seems desperately sad. I cannot imagine why anyone would benefit from playing this game rather than the main one.",

            "review_text": "Hey! Now, don't click the thumbs down button under this review just yet, read the whole thing first! I'm not trying to be rude to the creators, I'm just listing the negative aspects of this game so people like you don't waste your money on something like this, when you expect something like 'Talisman: Digital Edition'. If the developers fixed these issues, this would be a fantastic game! Sorry for rambling on. Enjoy!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I'm a big talisman fan and was happy to see a cheap digital version of the masterpiece, but after I played it for some time I noticed the many problems the developers probably shrugged off and thought 'It's cheap, let's just give it the quality of a flash game with great graphics!' It was singleplayer, no multiplayer options at ALL. Later I noticed that it said 'The Solo Adventure Game'... So, that was MY fault, but that means there should be AI, right...? No. That would be too much effort. It would only make this game have a chance at being decent and not trash. Let me take a look at the box for the true Talisman board game. 2-4 players? Hmm, TWO to FOUR players, NOT one.  Another thing I hate is that there is no save feature. Can you amagine playing talisman with no friends in ONE sitting!? I can't! Now, even games from the mid 1980s (The Legend of Zelda) had save features. Now, they may be save codes, but they still had them! Now it's like a requirement for even the most simple game to have one, as long as it isn't an arcade game, where saving your 10 minutes of playtime wouldn't be required. Here it is, though! Playing Talisman with my family in real life, takes weeks. We play for an hour or two, then leave it how it is, then come back a couple days, then we play again. We take our time. If we did it in one sitting, it'd take about 10 hour add or take a few. Now, I don't know about you, but I can't sit in a seat staring at screen playing a digital board game for 8 hours (With less people it'd take less time).   They have more charecters which is slightly more enjoyable, but I never end up using them. These characters feel like cheap excuses to cover up the many problems with this otherwise decent game. They also have quests, which sounds fun, but It's basically chores to do while trying to get the Talisman. They're a LOT less interesting than sidequests in your typical RPG. Yep, that bad.  This games acts like a demo, which would be fine, except it costs money. Imagine getting the demo for a game like Undertale, and then a screen pops up saying 'If you want to play this one hour demo, gimme a dollar. Oh yeah, by the way, I removed all NPCs. Screw you.'  This game also acts like a tutorial... Imagine playing the newest 'Legend of Zelda' game, except it was 6$. So, you get the game, thinking it was just an amazing deal, and you find out it's just an hour long game telling you about all the mechanics that you can use for completing puzzles. And that's all there is. Puzzles, and no monsters, no bosses, no shops, no NPCs; nothing but puzzles and dungeons that are filled with only puzzles. Now, obviously, this would never happen and Talisman Prologue isn't THAT bad.   With the price, EVEN IF IT IS SMALL OR ON SALE is not a good deal and is NOT worth your hard-earned cash. This 'demo' (even demos should be better than this) gets a 3/10. I would recomend this game, at MOST, 0.50$. 7$, is just too much for me.  I tried giving this game a chance, I really did, but it does not feel like the vast world of Talisman. It feels like a dumbed down empty demo. If you want the true digital version instead of the demo, check out Talisman: Digital Edition. That one has multiplayer. And a save feature. Hallelujah!  (The sad thing is, I probably spent more time typing this up than actually playing the game. xP)",

It's a great price now during the holiday sales and a very good translation from the board game to the computer. The main goal for the game is to move around and though the board to get the Crown of Command. Each turn you'll move to a new location and battle monster, gain gear or followers, or have to deal with an event. Talisman is a classic board game and this solo only version is great dip into video board games for anyone.  The prologue has several different character to play and each one has a either a few different quests to explore or the standard game quest to go get the crown. The prologue is single player ONLY if you are wanting multiplayer you'll need to pick up the main game.  ",

I like the fact it gives you some goals and a mini-story as you play the main characters from the full Talisman game. Another nice touch is being able to play any new characters you unlock in the full game if you have that too.  Only downside is when you get a spell you can only cast on another player, as you are the only player. It would be good if these were removed from the pack in the prologue.",

I dont support any game that promotes developing gambling habits with the use of cards and dice - the gambling part is also promoted in towns and outpost throughout the game itself as a feature - it is normal for boardgames and RPG to have it - but here its everywhere you stop to heal up trade and rest.  The RNG is such a bad fator in this game that it requieres no skill what so ever to play- its just random results over and over. Only thing requiring a bit of added effort is making the onetime use raft after finding the axe and the right spot to chop tress and crosing the river to the harder part of the game - unless you wanna fight the nearly imortal Sentinel - and hope your armor will protect you so you can grind him down with multile tryes. The drawing of the Lion was the best drawing in this game all thou it posess an interesting invoirment it very much resembles the Monopoly board game setting, but im sure that the motivation for making this game wasnt only money but fun which the video game version offers very little becouse of the total lack of skill needed to play it -and when you do make a result its pure luck not effort or skill.   So No -To playing cards and roling dice. Even thou its recourlered by a generic fantasy setting. -It may lead to gambling habits in Real Life which could be devastating for any person and all around them.  ",
