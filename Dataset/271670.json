            "review_text": " May 20, 2015  If you aren't a speedrunner, I wouldn't consider 10 Second Ninja. I decided to buckle down and really work at the game after a frustrating introduction, and quickly completed it with some effort. The full content is around 4  minutes  long, with later levels only adding portals and enemies that take  two  hits to kill. The only appeal of the game is finding routes to optimize times, but other games do so much more in the genre.  The game is built on Game Maker, I only knew this after the 2nd cutscene gave up a Game Maker error report and crashed the game when an image couldn't be found. The program seems to take process priority along with nearly 500MB of RAM, slowing the Desktop and all other activities if you want to Alt-Tab. FPS is good, and I assume the high priority is to make sure the clock is accurate.  Controls are simple but inconsistent, not really fitting for a precision platformer. The sword hitbox can be gigantic at times, even allowing some kills through walls. Normal ground behaves more like Ice, while Ice really didn't give me much issue. Sometimes the ninja would run with no buttons pressed after restarting, while other times it would ignore my inputs (mostly in the Hard mode 100% run, wasting precious time). The 10-second max means most levels are very limited, with only 4 of the 40 levels spanning beyond the screen. I'm kinda shocked a ninja in a platforming game can't wall-jump, while a famous cube of meat puts this ninja to shame.  The game requires Stars to progress in the game, so expect to repeat and perfect levels from the start. Beginners will get trapped in the first world until they can improve times for Stars. At least the community seems friendly, with some helpful strategy videos to complete the game. I don't know if the developer cleans time records, but there's a cheater with a 100% time under 5 seconds that needs wiped. At least the music in the Bonus area was really good.  Overall, the game is too one-dimensional. Super Meat Boy, Stealth Bast Deluxe, and other platformers allow speedrunning without limiting level design and cutting mechanics. 40 short levels, no variety in traps or enemies, and no included level editor means content is slim. It's bundle fodder, which is where I got it, and the store price is insane. There's nothing really unique here. If you're a speedrunner that has exhausted every other game, you could still find other games with more content. The cutscenes may be longer than the gameplay, but they try too hard to be memetic and get tweets. A hashtag in a cutscene, yuck. Considering all the levels can be reasonably completed in 240 seconds, you must see the cost-per-hour here is awful. It had potential, but the title restricted the gameplay far too much.",

            "review_text": "10s Ninja is an extremely fun, and fast-paced game, while the campaign only takes 45-60m, the main focus of the game is completing every level in the fastest amount of time possible, with 5 worlds, 8 levels per world, and 3 stars per level, there's alot to do, and the achievements are not only witty, but also mark important checkpoints (like 3 stars on world 1).  Overall I reccomend this game , but you must realize: the point of this game is not beating the campaign, but rather getting 3 stars on every level, and even past that (if you're up for it) getting to the top of the leaderboards.  If you aren't much of a completionist, I don't recccomend this game.  ",

            "review_text": "10 Second Ninja is caught in a strange position for me. At first glance (as well as when you play it) the concept seems more geared to be a mobile game than a PC game. However, the pacing is more fitting of a PC/console game. Completing each level in 10 seconds or less is not hard at all, even if you aren't used to fast paced games. With practice, avoiding spikes and falling objects becomes easy. The real challenge is getting 3 stars on every level, which can take some time.  If you are considering buying it, ask yourself this: 'Am I going to try to 100% it?' If the answer is no, you aren't going to get much out of the game. Playing through each level only once won't take much time, and is especially not worth $9.99 in that regard. If you are a completionist (or are for just this game), definitely pick up the game, but still at a discounted price. I only heard about it and bought it because I crafted a 90% off coupon for it (s***, it was 99 cents!). At that price, it was definitely worth it.  Of course, getting 3 stars on every level is often brutally difficult, and at times frustrating. You will have to time your jumps and attacks perfectly , which will take loads of trial and error (and error and error and error). This is a turn-off for a lot of people, but a selling point for others. It is entirely dependent on whether you enjoy fast-paced games or not. Completing each level with 3 stars left me saying 'Damn, I can't believe I just did that, let's do the bonus levels!' and not 'Wow, I just wasted 5.8 hours on that?'.  In the end, the question I ask myself is 'Did I have fun?'. Yes. A lot of it. There were some levels that were just frustrating (I'm looking at you Deathcube Level 1), but most of them were a blast to complete. Definitely pick it up when it is discounted if you enjoy fast-paced games or are looking for something new to try.",

The resolution won't change when in fullscreen by the way.    Despite its said issues above, 10 Second Ninja is a good game for platformer lovers and speedrun maniacs. Plan your route well then hack through enemies as quickly as you can, under 10 seconds. And then, try and try and try and try...  after 10000 retries  ... and try and try and try until you get that f*cking 3-star on that level.",

            "review_text": "The game is  very  short, but has replayability in the form of some 'bonus levels' after game completion. If you're not worried about 3-starring every single level you're probably looking at 2 hours of gameplay, including cutscenes.  Having said that, it's definitely 2 hours of good fun. Killing the robots and 3-starring a level feels nicely satisfying and is complimented by sleek simplistic graphics and a fun short story presented in little animations inbetween worlds.  The game introduces few new mechanics along the way, but just enough to keep me interested. The progression curve could've been a lot better. Especially the final world seemed to be much easier then some of the previous levels.  Although I've only ran into a couple minor issues with the game (had to restart the game once), I've seen many people with unresolved bugs in the discussions. It's definitely something to note.  PROS:  + Pleasing simplistic graphics + Controller support + Quick satisfying gameplay + Fun story  CONS:  - Very short - Unfixed Bugs - Flawed progression Curve - Probably overpriced  I'd recommend picking it up during a sale or in a bundle; I don't think it's worth full price.",

That includes bosses and some of the ridiculously hard to reach enemies as well, which of course means you will struggle with every 10 second level for up to 10 hours.  But it is SO MUCH FUN! I recorded myself doing this once and it was fun to watch the frustration built up until that final moment when you get it just right.  The levels are well thought out and you are essentially competing with yourself for the best possible scores. There are also ridiculous bosses that add a bit of flavor as well.

If you get it somewhere else, cool, play it, but if you're looking for a fun game to sink a little bit of time into I'd suggest going online and playing 'flash games' than spending $10 on this. If you're looking for a game to sink a lot of time into at once, this definitely won't be the game for that either unless you easily get hooked on playing short levels like this game has.

You must terminate all of Robot Hitler’s defenseless robots before the round ends using only your sword and three ninja stars. At the end of each mission you will get stars ranking you on how fast you completed the stage. It is VERY difficult to get 3/3 stars, and heck, sometimes it’s even difficult to get 2/3 stars. The boss fights require you to have a certain amount of stars before you can play them, meaning that you cannot progress with the game until you unlocked enough stars.  The game is quite comical in its story and art style. After you complete the main 4 worlds, there is a bonus world (which I have not completed) and a world that you unlock from getting a lot of the stars (which I also haven’t even unlocked). One thing I like about it is how easy it is to play in short amounts of time. I will however recommend that you buy it on sale, because $10 seems a bit much to pay.
