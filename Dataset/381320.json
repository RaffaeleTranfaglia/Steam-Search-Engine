    "description": "Bezier is a dual stick blaster set inside a vast computer built deep underground. The story traces the principal's escape from this &quot;Noah's Ark&quot; gone wrong. A simple shooter on the surface, the deeper narrative pulls in his relationship between evolution and god, family and love.",
