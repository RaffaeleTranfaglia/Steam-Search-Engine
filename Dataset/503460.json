            "review_text": "  This reminds me of the game Ketzal Corridors for the 3DS which has you spinning a weirdly shaped object around until it can fit in the hole. It's a fun game to test for spatial recognition, and in that regard it plays well.  The main nit pick I have against it is that the rotation of the blocks aren't in fixed increments you're just freely rotating the blocks using the right stick which does make it feel not as responsive as it should. The game itself allows some leeway to the shape of the block though so you don't have to get it EXACTLY right.  Interesting time waster I guess.",
