            "review_text": "This game is soo underrated, it's so sad you may be more familiar with the sequel Driver: San Francisco, but this game is more than worth a try. Althou, as a veteran of the Driver series you may notice that many of the game content is from Driv3r, like sounds, physics and the entire engine. But that is not a bad thing, Driv3r was a very good game in it's time, it was just pulled down by the fact that it was a kind of a GTA ripoff. Driver: Parallel lines instead goes back to the Driver-roots. This game shines with an well sold storyline with an intensional twist and good drving-physics, in deneral the atmosphere is very believeable. Personally I'd like more cars like the Cerrano with an awesome V8-sound, but that's just a personal opinion. Overall a very good game and a must for all Speed Junkies/Diver-fans/car enthusiasts.",

However here's some reasons why I would recommend the game for everyone.  + Works more than fine with low-end pc. + Story is good + Great soundtrack in 70s + Nice car customizing + Big open world map + Lots of sidejobs + Graphics are playable for a 2006 game  There isn't many negative things to say about the game but I just think that there should have been more things to do when you're not playing the story for example grand theft auto games. I'd rate this game 7/10.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Nah, actually, screw it. This game is just not playable as it keeps crashing.  I'll refrain from any comparison because the first two Driver installements had so much magic in my eyes that Parallel Lines simply can't compete. So, how does it stand on its own?  Rather fine really. It's more of a GTA than a Driver, but it's not a bad thing. Especially when you can drive bikes and helicopters. To this day, the game still looks more than acceptable. I can't say the graphics bothered me, except maybe the face models, which isn't really that important for a driving game.  Now the story is kinda usual. You get betrayed and decide to take your revenge. You know the drill. It just works!  The OST is absolutely fantastic so long as you stick to the seventies. The modern era OST is absolute garbage, which is rather sad in my opinion. Some great stuff got released that year, why did they solely focus on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ electro?  Anyway, let's get to the PC release. The game is pretty much entirely customizable. It supports up to a 4k resolution, you can edit the graphical options and what not, even the driving sensitivity. Which I heartily recommend if you're playing with a gamepad because the sensitivity is a bit too high. Also, I'd suggest lowering the circulation because you simply can't drive any fast without crashing with the default options.  BUT THEN. The game keeps crashing all of the ♥♥♥♥ing time. Get out of the garage? Crash. Finish a mission? Crash. Failed a mission and wish to restart? Crash. I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. Luckilly, the game saves automatically everytime you do something. But still, that perpetual crashing really makes finishing the game a chore.  I'd say pick it up on sale, but it's already 5 bucks so yeah, if you need a fix of GTA like, go for it.",

            "review_text": "Hello, So i have played driver for about 15 hours at the time of this review and i think it's safe to say that it's a good game, I will not be comparing this game to other open world Titles because that would not be fair on the game,  So this game takes place in New york and a little bit of New Jersey, The map is so big i would often find myself fast travelling instead of driving there, The police in new york are possibly the most brutal i have ever seen in a game if you start speeding and they see you they instantly pull out the shotgun and start shooting, The city of new york is big and stays true to most of the buildings locations in Real life new york how ever the city feels empty and Uninhabited there is nothing special about anything in the city the only thing I stopped my car at was to look at times square and even that felt dull, I should also mention the lack of a Jump feature I often found myself wishing Jump up onto a ledge instead of running around the long way to get up there, also Pretty much in any open world new york based games i play i always want to see the land marks but with this you can't even get to the statue of liberty! ok so now that i have had my little rant lets talk story  You play as a guy who's only name mentioned is TK (The Kid) Anyway TK is doing small time get away driving, so he gets hired by slink or otherwise the tut guy and sends TK into the life of hardcore crime, there were a lot of missions that had interesting gameplay mechanics like one mission for instance you have to face against a tank, anyway so *SPOILERS* TK Gets framed and goes to Jail for 28 years *SPOILERS* When he finnaly gets out it's 2006 and he has one thing on his mind Revenge (Because why not) anyway so for the next few missions You're taking out all the people that betrayed you with a predictable plot twist along the way,   Now The story racks up to be about 9 hours long but that's all it really needed, you can explore the city for Jobs such as being a get away driver, checkpoint races, ect. Now here's the fun part car Customization, I have Spent a little while customizing my car to be the fastest there is and it really is quite fun speeding through the city Listening to Addicted to speed,   SO over all Driver Parallel lines is a good game the Map is dull and boring and even more so during the 2006 era but it really makes up for it in it's Customization Era changes So i reccomend you get this game But just don't expect an amazing Action packed game of the year",
