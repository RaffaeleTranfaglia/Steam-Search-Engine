Very fluid dynamic gameplay... ;) If you like tower defence youd be a fool not to play this.  Your tower is in the middle. You need to allocate the amount of workers between repairing, building upgrades to your tower and collecting resources between each wave. When the enemies build up enough you charge your gorilla-like Troll around punching, pushing and generally being a nuicance while your towers rain pain on the invading savages (you did build some towers by now right?!)  There are a few levels of upgrade (so far, I hope) and 4 types of towers to build, one in each corner of your main tower. Its pretty simple yet well done. Did I mention its free?",

Graphics make it fun and a bit more engaging, but otherwise its at its core just another defense game. My game hours were enough to beat the 'campaign', get every achievement, and unlock every building, and max out my resources. And, well, since it was free, I'd say I got my money's worth.   The one annoying and shady thing the game does (as other reviewers have mentioend) is ingame is a link to auto-add their DLC skin pack for like $2.00. Also lame, also not worth it, and also skecth that they kinda make it too easy to accidentally buy.  TLDR: The game is good, if you get it for free and need an afternoon to kill",

            "review_text": "A fun little tower defence game reminiscent of flash games from a few years ago that were extremely fun and addicting, but suffered from a lack of content. As with those, One Troll Army is pretty fun to play but all of the game's content can be completed in around 3-4 hours, after which you unlock a 'survival mode' that offers an endless version of the game's campaign. One cannot truly complain about the lack of content though, considering the game is completely free to play with no microtransactions that I'm aware of except for some cosmetic things for your troll.  The game itself focuses around a troll who offers to protect a fledgling goblin settlement from being raided and destroyed by invading migrant beastmen and to do this you are given direct control over both the settlement and your troll itself.  The troll is controlled in a manner similar to a real time strategy unit, or an action roleplaying game character; he can move around, be told to attack enemies and has access to several abilities as well as stat and ability upgrades. The settlement itself is controlled through menus and sliders, with goblin workers that are assigned to perform different tasks to gather resources or upgrade buildings. It's a relatively simple progression system, with goblins gathering resources to upgrade buildings that either improve base defence and towers or allow you to upgrade your goblins so you can gather resources even faster. Each building upgrade also gives you more goblins, allowing you to do more things at once and do them more effectively.   Though this sounds a little like a more traditional real time strategy title, it is in fact a wave-based defence game. Each wave is split into two different roungs, with the first being a non-combat round during which you can control the economy and upgrades of your settlement. During this first round, enemy beastmen will begin to approach the settlement and hang around on the outskirts, waiting for enough of them to appear to begin an attack. When enough enemies arrive, the will initiate the combat round of the wave in which all goblins hide inside your settlement and you have to fight back the onslaught with the aid of hireable orc mercenaries and towers capable of firing upon the enemies. When all enemies are defeated or your settlement is raided, the combat round ends and the next wave begins.   This, unfortunately, is the worst part of the game. If your settlement is raided (I.E, you lose against an enemy wave), there are absolutely no negative repercussions for this loss. All of your resources remain and the difficulty of the next wave will be lowered to compensate for your inability to proceed. This leads to situations in which there is absolutely no reason not to purposely lose every single wave and just focus entirely on upgrading your settlement to maximum, since enemies cannot steal your gathered resources or kill your goblin workers to upset your progression (this does mean you don't gain gold from looting enemies, but since you can trade resources for gold and other resources at a very good rate, this is hardly a negative).   Once you have upgraded all of your buildings to maximum level, have fully upgraded your troll and and completed all three of the 'campaign' levels in the game, you have pretty much seen all of what this game has to offer. It's a fun little game, but it ultimately has some serious design flaws that makes it unlikely that I'll play it again. I enjoyed my three or so hours time playing, but it's not worth investing more time than that. Still, the fact that the game is completely free means that there's no harm in trying it for yourself and having some fun.",
