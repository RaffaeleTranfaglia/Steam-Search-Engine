            "review_text": "For the people bashing the only boxing game I can find on steam besides some arcade one about beasts... cut it some slack. Do your homework before you buy as this is not a triple A title being sold by EA.  Is there anything wrong with this game? No there isn't. Graphics are as good as they come and do not interfere with game play. The game play itself is relatively simple and sort of copies the usual boxing controls we're used to. The right stick just tapping it diagonally left or right (upwards) initiates a jab, going left or right initiates a hook, and going bottom right initiates an uppercut. The punching system sort of feels arcade-ish to a point but has it's moments of simulation. Regardless, the impact system is rewarding and it's nice seeing an opponent go down after countering a punch, putting a few combos together and finishing with a nice hook. The movement system is a bit unfamiliar however the dodging system is again rewarding. The time slows down, your stamina rises, and your fighters ready to deliver a blow given you tell him to.  I like this game. This isn't fight night as many other reviewers are saying but there is enough depth in this game to keep one busy. Train your fighter, make him fight in tournaments, single bouts, make money, spend it at the gym or on your appearance.   For what it is, I'd give it a   RATING : 6.95/10.      Gameplay   B-     Story / Campaign   C+     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   C+     Overall    C+      ***update***  I wouldn't buy this if you're barganing on playing your buddies for fun. I haven't found a successful method of doing so.    ScreenShots",

Also i like the fact that you can customize your character a little bit and train him, the fights are really enjoyable too :D  And now the bad news:   The bad news are that this is an exact copy of the mobile game,nothing new is added in this game(except from achievements and cards of course) , i was expecting more something like entrance customisation or improved gym and character abilites, the only change is also that the game is a little bit more difficult that the mobile game.  Final thoughts:   I recommend this game because the overall experience is really good and you will have lots of fun playing online or single player or locally  Diothorn's rating: 7.5/10",

Still, it looks good? I don't have any past boxing game experience to compare this to other than punch out on the nintendo and Rocky on sega master system....and compared to those, this game is incredibly advanced.   It has a brief tutorial, unfortunately the tutorial seems kind of confusing. Maybe it's my lack of boxing experience. I don't know. I got frustrated with the tutorial for goodness sake!  I played using an X360 controller, and it seemed to work fine. most of the moves were done using the analog sticks.   I played my friend, he beat me up....A few times. Would I recommend it? Possibly, I guess. If you are into boxing games. The only real downside I experienced was on rare occasins the game pad would be unresponsive, or the game it's self would slow down with poor FPS.  Still, the game is completely playable.",

It took me about 4 hours to get all acheivements and all in game items with 100% completion. I have yet to try multiplayer so I do not know if people play online.  Overall it is a quick and fun boxing game. Could use more leagues for single player or something.  _____________________________________________________________________________________ So far I have only played Real Boxing for about an hour and I so far am enjoying it. Graphics aren't bad and the gameplay is pretty good. The right hook seems really funky though. The game itself consits of a carrer mode featuring multiple belts.

You fight, you win credits if you win the fight, you train and/or purchase higher strength, speed and stamina stats, rinse and repeat.  I got the game in a Humble Bundle, so I'm not overly concerned about if it's worth what I paid for it, but if you're dead set on buying it, don't pay full price...

Each time you get hit or knocked out, you struggle with the same thoughts: Can I still win this fight? Can I still win this tournament? Should I change my tactics? It is a really exhilating moment when you watch the winning ceremony after defeating a strong opponent. I haven't tried the multiplayer mode yet but I've really liked the singleplayer mode so far, though it seems to be pretty short because there are only 3 tournaments with 9 fights each. However, the farther you get, the more challenging is the game. Earning the achievement for winning each tournament without getting knocked out will be exciting.",

            "review_text": "More a brawler than a boxing sim, this is no Fight Night, but given the woeful lack of PC boxing games, I'll take it. My only real fault with the game is it's clunky as crap sometimes. You can dodge an incoming punch, but the movement is sometimes too clunky for you to move in and counter in time. Fight Night (my favourite boxing game franchise, so naturally my go-to comparison, I make no apologies) offered very fluid controls, this feels much heavier and .. well just heavy, and I felt like I was moving on a grid (like the original tomb raider, you know what I mean), it really broke immersion and I never felt I was fully in control of my guy. That said, very satisfying to KO folk. It's interesting though, the fewer rounds you set it to play as, the more damage you'll do. My first match I set to 15 rounds, and I ended up going the distance without getting the opponent's health bar down halfway. Set it to three hours, however, and you'll get two KOs per round easily. For the best balance of realism and arcade brawler I guess go with ten rounds. Minigames to level up your boxer are repetitive but more difficulty is added to these too as you go through the escalating boxing tournaments, which was a pleasant surprise that caught me off-guard. Sadly, these involve not just the buttons but the analogue sticks, and I often screwed up because I find it difficult to judge an angle to aim the stick at, so when it wanted the right stick to go up to the right at 45 degrees, I often missed it by going too far 90 degrees, or vice versa, which was frustrating and felt like a cheap fail. In lieu of more polished boxing sim alternatives this will serve well enough, but it could use a bit of polish. More variety in unlocks wouldn't go amiss either, the gear and especially the hair and stuff is far too limited, and you stand a good chance of fighting a clone of yourself, which is amusing but kinda weird :P",

            "review_text": "Real boxing is a split decision for me. On one hand, I want to recommend it as I have had a bit of fun with it. But on the other hand, there are a few things that keep me from whole heartedly recommending it. The graphics are good enough and the animation is fine. The customization of your fighter, although limited, is a nice touch. The gameplay though, drags down the score. The hit detection is not refined. I counter attack and miss about half the time. I stand in front of my opponent and jab, but wait, he didn't move and neither did I, yet I didn't even touch him. I try to move backwards to regain stamina but instead I move up or down. I attempt to dodge, but the button didn't register, again. I have a hard time with a fighter, go back and fight easier opponents, train then go back and knock him out first round. Yeah, that's realistic. The leveling up system is kind of broken. I have ideas on how to improve it, but let's face it, I'm not a developer, my 'improvements' might just break the game. But don't let all these negative comments drive you off. It can be fun. When it is an actual battle and you win by unanimous decision, it's a great feeling. Or if you are taking on someone who has better stats than you, somehow play it smart and end up knocking them out in the third round with only a blip of health left, it is rewarding. The game does the feeling of the fights right, the atmosphere, it just falls short in the gameplay department.  It has so much potential, but potential that is ultimately being wasted unless the developer picks it up again. It's time for the developer to get out of the corner, listen to your trainer and then give it one more go. With a few improvements, this game would be a great title and worth well more than the 4.99 that I picked it up for.  Give it a shot if you're a boxing fan, but don't expect too much out of it. On the plus side, it is a great excuse to listen to some Dropkick Murphys .",

This should be a good indication of how good of a simulation it is. If you are going to play it, be sure to adjust the round and time totals and also turn on the blood. I would highly reccomend playing with a contoller. I found the keyboard controls to be nearly unplayable. Even with a controller, the controls were sluggish and occasionally unresponsive.   The mechanics of the game are pretty basic. You have a health bar and a stamina bar. The stamina bar determines the strength of your punches. It is short and regenerates quickly. Your health determines how many hits you can withstand before getting knocked down. There is a block and it will block any three consecutive punches where it will then break and place you in a stunned animation. The sway mechanic is a joke. You tap the block button when you see a punch coming for your head and if you timed it right, time will slow and give you a chance to swing back with bonus strength. However, there is little rhyme or reason to it it seems. There will be times when they 'dodge' the punch but your arm crumples up against their head after connecting with their character model. When you get low on health you are allowed access to clinching up to regain health. This is a button mash game which starts off easy but becomes quite difficult against later opponents. Standing up from a knockdown is played the same way but the difficutly picks up after the 2nd time you go down.  There are only 3 stats in the game. Strength is for damage. Stamina is for your health and stamina bars. Speed is for the speed of your punches and how fast you walk around. You upgrade them through minigames that you gain access to every 5 fights. They aren't very enjoyable. Minigames is the right way to go but they made them feel more like a chore than a way to make your guy stronger. Thankfully you end up buying most of your stats instead of playing those games. You can pick two perks for your fighter out of 8 or so. They can make your punches cost less stamina or help you in the button mash clinch/standup games. While your characters stats feel like they don't matter, having a strength 5 points above their stamina will give you incredible amounts of damage. Strength feels like very much the most useful stat, especially early.

The animations are always the same, all the fighters look alike, the two ring girls are exactly the same model. The training part are 3 oversimplistic mini-games. The progression feels tedious. They couldn't even bother to record the names of the fighters by the announcer, and there only like 20 of them. 'And the winner is...' and you just see your face like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also every third fight is the fight of the decade according to the announcer.",
