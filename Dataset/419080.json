    "description": "Stuntman and engineer in one? No problem with Bridge Constructor Stunts! Build imposing ramps and loops to reach your goal in the diverse stages. But building structures alone isn't enough this time: you sit behind the wheel of the vehicles yourself and have to maneuver them skillfully to the goal.",

            "review_text": "Game is just one big OK! First the game title is completely tabula rasa, why would you call a game Bridge Constructor when there are no damn bridges. It would be more appropriate something like a Trucks Stunts or Construction stunts...etc  Yes what separate this game from others of this type is that you actualy drive and perform stunts. It has good tutorial so beginers should get an easy start, but after some 10ish levels it is more and more challenging.  Bridge Constructor Stunts is very decent casual game that you can play daily 30-40 min while having first coffe, at least I did, and enjoy it. However I cant agree that it is worth 9,99 for what it has to offer, so my suggestion is to wait for at least 50% discount.",
