            "review_text": "Alright.   When I started writing more reviews, I told myself that I should do so after finishing the game. But this here. This game. I... can't wait until I've finished this mess before I write down what exactly I think of X-Blades.  You see, the game suffers from three big R's. Repetition, Recycling, and Redundancy. How so?    Redundancy   For a start, you'll be spammed - SPAMMED, I tell you - with the same enemy type in one of the mind-numbingly short levels for minutes. You better have a durable thumb (or forefinger, depending on wether you play this with a controller or keyboard and mouse), because you'll have to spam back attacks to control those monster hordes. And it's not really entertaining at all. This will go on for every single level. Even the boss battles. You'll be swarmed by mobs.    Repetition   It's not bad enough that the level design is already redundant with the endless monster hordes. Oh no, it gets worse. Because every single level will be the same. Bit of running around, bit of smashing things, button mashing, next level. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. I last for about 2 or so levels per sitting. I just can't do much more because it's so incredibly badly made.    Recycling   Oh dear. They did not. - Hell yes, they did. See, it's not bad to use a level again at a later point in time, in maybe slightly altered form, to give the game a nice little looping back. But X-Blades takes it to a sadly very, very lazy extreme. See... you go through the whole dungeon twice. At day and at night. The exact. Same. Rooms. And you do the exact. Same. Thing. Again.   For a game which claims to be of the Hack and Slash genre, X-Blades does a terrible job at introducing something which makes it stand out in the genre. The claims of the reviews that X-Blades is anywhere near as good as DMC is preposterous, even ridiculous. You better check out Metacritic first, and maybe a gameplay video on Youtube. Also, you should probably search for something superior to this.  Even if the game is a bit over 5 years old, this is no excuse at being so utterly terrible. 2009 brought us Overlord II, Dragon Age Origins, and Batman Arkham Asylum.  Think about this.  THINK ABOUT IT.  And keep your hands away from X-Blades.    Oh, in a slightly belated addition: I didn't talk about the gameplay, story, and any of that, did I now? Well. If any of it had been good, I miiiight have forgiven the triple-R offense of the game. But sadly, nothing noteworthy of a story to be found here.  The gameplay and controls feel stiff and rather ininspired. I played with an X-Box 360 Controller for Windows, and, bad as that is, I sometimes didn't notice the controller had lost power and disconnected from the receiver. It took me several seconds to even bother to check the controller at times, since X-Blades's controls have the tendency to feel a little sticky, at least to me.  Next, I'd like to talk about the music briefly. Sadly, the tracks are repetitive, and the in-game music was much too loud for my taste. I had to reduce it to near silence to be able to enjoy the music even remotely. That being said, it was most of the times highly unfitting for the current mood of the game, or at least what I perceived to actually be the intended mood. A tense moment was completely shot to pieces by much too heavy and fast-paced rock music (double offense for the track being the bad, generic kind), and the rest of the time, the music wasn't really adding anything for me. In fact, it felt more like background noise of the obnoxious kind.  Tiny little excourse to the voice-acting - there actually is some in the game! For some reason, even though I selected English as language, the voice-acting was in German... and... meh. MEH. Sorry, but it really, really destroyed the game even more. The voices didn't fit, they sounded uninspired, and the bickering back and forth between Ayumi and the dark wolf boss thingy was painfully childish and immature. Unnecessary, in other words.  Oh, right, the story. To be honest, since I don't plan on finishing the game (yeah... there's only so much mind-numbing stupidity I can deal with), I have nooo idea what the story is about. And even as I read up on it, it seems like it is all over the place. Something of an artifact, someone being possessed, getting repossessed, un-possessed... whatever. I have no idea. I really don't.  Maybe I should also add something about the character design. Good? Good. Or rather, bad. See, there are sexy heroines in tight, short outfits, and then there's Ayumi. I actually felt horribly uncomfortable with her. She looks much too young to wear little more than straps passing as an excuse for clothes. I don't view her as sexy. She has some adorable about her, and that makes things really awkward really fast. Add to that the uninspired childish bickering mentioned in the voice-acting paragraph of the review, and it gets really, really, REALLY awkward and weird.   So, with that added to the already terribly done R's... nope. Not looking any good here, X-Blades. I'm going to play Alice: Madness Returns next, to have some really good Hack and Slash.",

The music is great, the artstyle is amazing if you like that sorta thing, and the combat is over-the-top and plentiful. There also seems to be a story trying to get out there, but it's pretty much negligable, as all it does is set up the boss fights (barely), and gives Ayumi a reason for being, and staying, where she is.  Great play for a mindless weekend!",

            "review_text": "Before I say anything else, I'm just going to say that instead of playing this game, you should get Blades of Time instead and play that. It is basically this, but actually good.  The first thing about this game is that it is SUPER buggy. It is so buggy that it detracts from the gameplay. Sometimes you are just jumping up and down infinitely when you are just walking forward or not even pressing any buttons and its really annoying. Another thing is that this game is broken sometimes. By that I mean that this game essentially became unplayable at certain points due to poor level design. Within the first 10 minutes of gameplay, the game had already locked itself and I couldn't advance on. I needed to beat this ice monster and both the entrance and exit were blocked. Except the fact is that I didn't have any fire moves like they wanted me to have and I didn't have enough souls to buy the fire move. Now WTF is that? 10 mins in and you couldn't program for a lack of souls? There was actually no possible way for me to move on other than reloading the game completely. Aside from that, the movement blur was really distracting and it was way excessive compared to Blades of Time.  If the gameplay and bugs weren't so bad, I probably would have liked this game because I actually liked the environment crafting and design for the most part. The graphics weren't that bad for its style of game and the music was pretty good for the game.  This game is basically a buggy and worse version of Blades of Time, which is actually really fun and good. I cannot recommend this game, but I do recommend that everyone play Blades of Time instead.

The higher level abilities are fun and have a cool cutscene before they are activated but near the finale of the game all you end up doing is spam high level abilities so the cutscene quickly becomes annoying. Music is top notch, voice acting and script is a mediocre, enemy AI is basic. Fan service is top notch though ^^. Definitely worth it if you get it on sale, not worth buying at full price though.",

            "review_text": "  I don't play much hack and slash games, so playing this title has earnt its originality in my eyes.   I myself am acquainted with old visuals and have grown very fond of this particularly because of its rigid graphics and textures. By playing this game, it gives my brain a break from the freakishly new realistic AAA games out there. The gaming world is evolving so fast that I cannot keep up with the advancements; hence I linger behind and give this dead game my time worth playing.   Many people complain that this game is too repetitive. I am a human with daily routines that are in fact, highly repetitive. It’s a fact that we humans are repetitive. So I am used to the repetition. It’s not painfully repetitive, the game does throw you something new to fight, new items to obtain and with the new items you can fight new bosses, with different environments. Granted it’s a low budget game so they recycled most of gameplay from time to time, but this just helps you grind your way to get those new items you’ve been saving up for.   The soundtrack is amazing, no other words for that.   I did not care about the storyline so much because this game is just pure stress relief. The story is average, simply when I play this game; you got to be in the mood for killing. I’m sorry; you just can’t expect to play this game for just the story.   Many people prefer devil may cry over this game. This is because DmC is way polished, but I couldn’t be bothered to play DmC, so playing blades of time has been such a cheap experience you got to play for yourself.   My rating: 7.98/10 so that’s 79.8% as a personal metacritic score.  It is an underrated gem in my opinion, which will soon grow to become a cult classic in years to come.",

Combat was repetitive, lackluster, and completely disengaging. The story as it was presented was a loose concept void of any actual narrative quality. If you are 11-14 years old (or of a similar mindset), are only interested in a skantily clad, over-sexualized female protagonist and don't mind heightened levels of mind numbingly repetitive gameplay, I would recommend waiting for this game to go on sale.

It's a functional game with good mechanics, and performs well despite it being kind of old and ported during an era where ports were notorious for being nearly terrible across the board.  But, oh man, this game is so repetitive. The only variation in the gameplay is that various bosses have different strategies and puzzle-like solutions. Otherwise, try to imagine a horde mode dynasty warriors. No objectives to capture, no events, nothing, just endless mooks, and a boss every so often. That's basically what this game is like, with a little bit of a cheesy story break every so often.  It shows up in bundles frequently for $1 or less.  I can't recommend the game in good faith, but if you can find it in a bundle, I don't think trying it out for a bit will cause you any harm. You might like the game. Opinions and all.  Blades of Time, the Spiritual Successor to this game, is better in every possible way.",

The jumping alone was frustrating early on. For some reason, holding space when jumping disabled double jumping, and you apparently can't double jump any time you perform any sort of action. Maybe something just wasn't working right, but that started me off with a frown. Attacking/ shooting while falling and landing in combat felt pretty clunky in general too, and the biggest reason I put a game down immediately is clunky basic controls that will be prominent for the entire game.   Having played each Devil May Cry, I was excited when this was compared to it. The 2 basic melee attacks with 0 actual combo diversity was a terrible smack in the face really fast. Maybe you unlock them later on, but I'll never know. It didn't feel like I was really hitting enemies either, and the animations made it feel as if I were just flailing my arms in various directions trying to hit whatever is around me. The ground pound ability that I bought had a 2 second wind up every single time which got old fast.   tldr: I didn't enjoy it, and I feel it's a mistake to relate this to Devil May Cry. If you want a good game that did what this wanted to do, go play Darksiders II. Maybe Blades of Time will be good. I hadn't heard of it until now.",

The story presented starts as fairly similar to the Kill Bill the movie bar scene, but youre ovewhelm by scenes of pokemon monstrousityes that are inocently discused by an anime style when there trully grotesque.  The obvious sexual offencive content it present highlights with the total reveal of the protagonists behind. Even the intelect of the main character is equal to a uneducated girl teenager which suports the above statement of characterization. The first boss is a hunk of a werewolf, and in litterature's most recent modern critisim even the Red Riding Hood story is revealed to have sexual conotations meaning the wolf in the story devours the girl and the grandma- you know what that devouring is refering to.  Here in X-Blades the video game you have that element as well where the first boss is presented in the same michevous manner. Only in this case hes guarding a curse which by the cartoon animation its a obvious ripoff and very similar to prince Ashitaka's curse from the movie Princess Mononoke from Gibly Studios.   The cammera control in this game is horible wich makes simple jumping on legdes very dificult, the combat is genderic and requires basic skills to master like spamming the left click for incredible sword twirl atacks being one of them, the shooting guns while in the air is obviously a similarity to Tomb Raider and Devil May Cry. And speakign of the devil as a mythological and religios presentation of evil - one of the characteristics of that character is to collect souls- wich the main protagosnt here also shares, since the curency for unlocking skills is gathering souls of slain enemies. Which futher encompases the goal to demonize women as devils and the above mentioned refferences. Which in my oppionion are insulting, offencive and obvious submessages and should be to anyone. Since women should be treated equal and not be a object of any unfair treatment- especially the treatment as a object wich this game promotes. Theres absolutely nothing inovative about X-Blades exept the level of groutesqueness that it presents on many levels.   ;-} ",

It's average and since I'm not really used to a mouse and keyboard, I tend to havetrouble with dealing with many enemies at once and it was particularly the first boss that bothered me. I mean, you had to fight a giant spider-looking thing while dealing with relatively resistant enemies. At least the framerate's great. With my 2.2ghz dual core with a 650mhz gpu with 4gb ram is all it took in order for my notebook to be able to run that game at 60fps. There are also the skills that you can buy for a certain number of souls. Some as cheap as 300 souls, others ridicoulosly expensive at a whopping 25000 souls.  Anyway, my point is if you like hack and slash games that have a decent difficulty, feature a female protagonist and like tomb raider style adventures and someone who has a curse and must raise it; then look no further, this is the game you're looking for. If you don't like that sort of game then don't buy it. It'll be £7.00 wasted from your wallet.  Hope this helps!",

Even so, she actually stands for herself, since you can improve her in a lot of customizable ways as bullets for your guns, and magic powers like a fireball.  The game looks ok, it has some of those elements that make look nicer than it should, in some older games. The controls are simple and work well in the keyboard, it is not necessary to play with a gamepad.  As its flaws, the enemies, even the first ones, can look a bit hard to hit and take a bit to kill. The Targeting system works, but sometimes it doesn't, so it can be hard to hit that enemy. As the character has a wide range of attack, it almost serves the purpose of making for the flaws of the target, but it doesn't.  Also, the magic may take a while to charge, which is not really fun, even though you don't use mana.  Well, you can buy this game, it has some good elements of fun and you can appreciate the game.

            "review_text": "Score - 48/100 Personal rating - Game-starved genre fans only need apply Had I played a demo - No purchase  'You can't judge a book by its cover.'  For most things in life, that old adage rings true. First appearances are most often not representative of something's value.   When it comes to video games though, there are a decent number of things that can be almost instantly determined, and such was my experience with X-Blades.  The graphics are a strange dichotomy of fantastic and bad. The 3d modeling is acceptable, the animations are rather clunky, and the texture work and set-piece design are phenomenal enough to make you forget about it all. Until the cutscenes, anyway, which are SO low-resolution and SO compressed that you'll be looking for the Youtube quality button in the corner, trying to switch up from 360P. Thankfully, the game is extremely well-optimized, with my old desktop able to get framerates in low 100s at 1920x1200 with everything maxed (AA on 4x).  Speaking of graphics, I can't type up a review of this game without mentioning its most advertised asset. I have seen some ridiculous fan service before, and seen main characters in AAA games that I would have hidden from my mother as a kid, but this game's heroine, Ayumi, takes things to an entirely new level.  Her outfit is so ridiculous that she is seemingly naked from more angles than not. Her hair covers more of her body than all her clothes combined. Her boots cover more of her body than the rest of her clothes combined. Hell, even one boot covers more. Her thong literally disappears into her impossibly-tall butt crack, and the camera is far enough back that should you play all the way through this game, you will be treated to a full moon for 8 straight hours. Her bra-esque top is by far the most sensible thing about her outfit, and if that doesn't just highlight the absurdity of it all, I don't know what would.  You know a game is pushing that envelope when the obligatory softcore-porn fanart pics come across as nothing but redundant. Don't get me wrong, I like a well-sculpted butt more than most, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm not lying when I say her outfit couldn't possibly be any skimpier unless it just consisted of strategically-placed k-tape and pasties.  I am a sucker for good music in a game, and I'm happy to report this game satisfies. The driving soundtrack in this game is pretty great and more than once, I found myself nodding along happily while I slaughtered wave after wave of enemies. I even checked the game's data folder for MP3s so I could keep them (they're there, in .ogg). Even in just my short while with the game, however, I noticed themes being recycled, which is understandable yet unfortunate. In addition, the sounds are cheese-tastic. The voice acting is stretching to be considered B-quality, and all the other sounds are completely forgettable. While that in itself is not a problem, overall the game will not win any bonus points for audio.  This might all sound pretty decent so far, but the real meat of the matter, the gameplay, is bland at best. There is one attack (the X button), and several unlockable skills. No combos, no strong/heavy attacks, no aerial launches, and no strategy. Just X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, rage attack, X, X, X, X, X. It gets very repetitive very fast. While some people might not mind that kind of repetition, I don't think anyone would deny that a little bit of strategy would make the whole thing a lot more palatable.  This is especially true since character movement is so disjointed and... clunky, for lack of a better word. Ayumi tears around the levels at full sprint, but doing anything else just breaks her rhythm. Attacking slows her down and leaves her vulnerable just slightly longer than it should, there is no dodge button, and jumping is entirely useless. There are no valuable aerial attacks, and jumping actually slows Ayumi down, so if you're trying to leap out of danger, you will come back down in worse shape than you left. If all you're doing is touching the left analog stick, Ayumi's movement is incredibly smooth and fluid, but as soon as you touch any other button, the action gets choppy and frustrating.  Level design is rather lame as well. For the most part, each area just drops you in a little self-contained arena, where you will be spamming the X button over and over and over and over and over on little endlessly-respawning waves of weaklings until you earn enough rage (basically mana) to cast the one or two spells that can damage any applicable 'boss' creatures. Repeat until he/she is dead, and move on to the next arena.  Games of this genre are at their greatest when they set everything up for frantic high-speed slaughtering. This game introduces so many little quirks, niggles, and idiosyncracies that I just can't recommend it over any other similar game. I would suggest going and playing any of the Devil May Cry games, that new Metal Gear Rising game, or even this game's own spiritual successor Blades of Time (which is supposedly better in every way, and not a direct sequel).  For the vast majority of things, it is undeniably true that you can't judge a book by its cover, but when fundamental things such as character controls and basic gameplay mechanics frustrate me and nothing other than music impresses me, I'm perfectly confident in my decision to skip this one. Take this review with a grain of salt, of course, as it is always possible that I'm just not the target market at all, and so this game went entirely over my head. I've always found the concept of 'fun' to be more or less universal, so I kind of doubt it, but whatever.",

It was on my wishlist for a little bit now (I'm partial towards simple hack 'n slash) and when it went on sale recently, I got it. Remember reading about always use a controller, so I plugged it in and got going. When I first started, the graphical fidelity was pretty good. Should it be held to a higher standard? Maybe, but I think it fit the trick for now. Then Ayumi start talking, aaaaaaand I lost it.  Hacking: 7/10, pretty repetitive. Build up rage, earthquake, repeat. Slashing: 6/10, annoying rage meter. Game explains nothing about how to use it, once you get it it's not bad though. N': 4/10 Poor plot, incredibly annoying protagonist. But seriously, that a** crack?! What the hell!  Do I recommend? If you don't mind being mindless like me.",

            "review_text": "This is a weird game. It's sometimes very fun, and sometimes ridiculously boring and horrible. To start off, the story is poor and almost non existent, with even worse voice acting to accompany the few cut scenes. The levels are okay sometimes, but other times they take forever, especially when you have to sit there and figure out what you need to kill to pass the level. This takes even longer when certain enemies take certain spells to kill, but the enemies are never consistent. Sometimes you need to use fire, and later you many need to use lightning. All the while you are trying to figure this out, you are getting mobbed by never ending enemies. Tat being said though, the game is at a comfortable difficulty, so its not really all that frustrating. Though the most frustrating thing is the toughest enemies you will find in this game...pots. Dear god those pots. The hit detection is so horrendous, you will spend a good 30 seconds trying to break a pot. They seem to just break whenever they feel like it...it's so annoying. Oh and rolling is horrendous too...yeah, rolling. Rolling is so hard and random to acheive that there are two levels dedicated to just managing to pull off rolling three times to beat the level. It's a disaster. Jumping is a mess as well, though still easily doable.  Some good things about the game is the combat is ok, with plenty of upgrades and spells to keep things interesting. Other than spells, you can use swords and guns to attack foes, making for nice, varied gameplay. There are hidden artifacts in the levels to find too, which give you special upgrades.  The best part about the game though is your character, Ayumi. You get to enjoy the nice view of a woman clad only in underwear and a few shreds of armor, but even this does not distract from all the downsides of the game.  Overall its not the worst game I've ever played, not even close really, but it sure isn't good. I wouldn't recommend spending more than $2.00 on this",
