I cannot stress enough how this is totally different from the from version of this game. Cutscenes are gone, visual controls are garbage, all robots, vehicles and buildings appear as being black so it is very hard to tell what is yours and what isn't. Pyros shoot nothing just a flamethrower sound and I can't speak for most of the other units in the game because your technicians won't capture the fort in the beginning of the first forest level and basically the game can't proceed. This game is major leage broken and an absolute crap remake of a really good original.",

This port is also amazing, and adds a nice layer of polish to the game. Not to mention there are plenty of new additions which do wonders for it.  If you liked the original Z, buy this. Simple as that!",

            "review_text": "This remastered version of Z: Steel Soldiers brings back alot of memories from my childhood, Z: Steel Soldiers was my second ever PC game and so i've put alot of hours into it.  When this remasteed version hit the STEAM stores i just had to buy it, seeing as how many hours i put into he old classic. Below are my thoughts about this remastered version...  - The developers have kept almost everything from the base game intact but have updated the game with new visuals, new models, UI etc. to match that of, for example, the older C&amp;C Generals games instead of keeping the very old and outdated graphics from 2001. (By the way, all sounds are that from the base game.)  - The devs are constantly updating this game, some features from the old classic game wasn't compatible with newer systems and so the devs are working around the clock to roll out updates frequently, just about two days ago the old cinematics were re-added to the game. (Skrimish is due around this month.)  Based on my own personal opinion i recommend this game, the only flaw i've encountered is that some of the later Campaign missions are extremely difficult but aside from that this is a solid return of an old classic!  Zod is back!!!",

But a terrible remake. - game crashes a lot - mouse doesn't bind to the screen with dual monitor setup - no fullscreen windowed mode - no keybinding option - actualy no keybind this game at all - loads of bugs  This is what happens when you give a great game to a ♥♥♥♥ indi developer. First and last game i will ever buy from TickTock Games",

            "review_text": "This game really needs an option to fully give commands etc while in Pause mode. I want to enjoy a game in peace, rather than permanently be hurried stressed and frustrated. Why does this game no option to give comands while in Pause? Because the human brain has unlike the computer AI no capability to do everything simultaniously.... and if a human tries to do everything everywhere simoultanisly in a everlasting hurrytimepressiure all you ever get is stress and frustration..... and this is exactly the oposite I want. I want some rest and enjoy a game in peace without any stress, without any hurry. This is why I really hate any game without the option to pause it and still fully control anything. This is acrtually the most important feature for me. My brain want to rest and enjoy and NOT be permanently stressed while playing. So why is there no Pause option and no option to look around, give orders and and do everything while paused and then enjoy the action? Why do you developpers want to stress us permanently while playing by disabeling most actions while paused? This game has potential.... but without a propper pause button and still being able to do everything in peace and without any time pressure..... I will delete this game. Because real life has allready enough stress and while gaming I just want to rest my mind and enjoy, but no artificial homemade unnecesary stress.",
