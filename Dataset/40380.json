            "review_text": "Nail'd is an insane, over-the-top crash&amp;burn racer something like Burnout in feel, but on ATV or MTX vehicles.  The Chrome Engine is used to great effect here. It looks gorgeous and runs butter smooth. The handling model is appropriately arcade, with some subtle hints of challenging handling model, namely in the need to rotate your vehicle in the air to ensure a safe/fast landing. The reward for taking that control is that you will get boost added to your gauge for every landing you make that is perfect.  The level design is pretty awesome as well. The tracks sprawl and are completely populated with tons of set pieces and hazards that make the race even more engaging. All of the tracks also employ sections that completely disregard gravity or the laws of physics, and it makes for some really fun sections of track.  Sound design is adequate, and the soundtrack is a pretty solid metal affair. It is in the game directory in OGG format, so that is pretty awesome as well.  To further the enjoyment, there are a wealth of new parts you can unlock and install on either your ATV or MTX vehicle. The interesting thing, unlike most racers with 'upgrades', is that these parts aren't always a clear betterment to the ones you have installed. Each part carries some bonus or some malus with it, so it is up to you to choose the parts that will balance the various characterstics of your ride as you see fit. Really nice depth to tuning there.  Overall, a pure arcade racer with some awesome levels, interesting upgrade system, and great presentation.  Get it for cheap, give it a go.",

They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank, Fuel burning fast on an empty tank. Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns. Their prowess is potent and secretly stearn. As they speed through the finish, the flags go down. The fans get up and they get out of town. The arena is empty except for one man, Still driving and striving as fast as he can. The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, And long ago somebody left with the cup. But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns. And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.  He's going the distance. He's going for speed. She's all alone In her time of need. Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse,",

That may sound odd, but most racers tend to have the same effect as a side-scrolling-dodge-the-object game. But in this one, I actually get the sense of competetion with the AI. The music really feels like racing music - not just garbled loud music.  I also like the way every track ends up with multiple paths you can take - but none are obvious 'short-cuts' you take to win, which one you should take depends on your racing style (like sticking to the ground or jumping through the air).  The game sometimes appears on sale for $0.99-1.99 (think i paid $1.25-which is why I gave it a shot). But I think it'd be worth the full $4.99 easily. One of the best cheapies yet!",

Do you want a game that will actually make you dizzy? Do you want a game that entices your 'HOLY ♥♥♥♥' inner nerd? If you answered yes to those BUY THIS GAME. It will be the best .99c you ever spent on a over the top fun racing game. Yeah the online doesn't work no more but ♥♥♥♥ em. The game on it's own is worth it. BUY IT.
