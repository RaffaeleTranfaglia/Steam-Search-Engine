            "review_text": "This game is not for people who are even semi-serious about poker. I'm a fan of both poker and city management games, so I thought this would be right up my alley. It probably would be a great game, except for one thing; bad AI. The other players don't play at all like real people. They will 'check' the whole game while they have a straight flush. And it almost NEVER fails that one of these idiots will raise the bet by 50-80% before the flop. They are impossible to bluff, too. I have sat down and tried to play this game three separate times, with three different strategies. Every time it has ended in frustration and anger. That is not how a game is supposed to make you feel, not EVERY time.  I also feel that it is relevant to note that I have played a lot of different poker games (I'll estimate around 20) and this one has BY FAR the WORST AI.",

If you are looking for something after Poker Night at the Inventory, then this might be your kind of poker game. I got this on sale (75% off) and I thought it was worth a shot.",
