You get the gernade launcher and your on a mission to do something to proceed the story and the game suddenly ends when you enter a door out of no where. You don't even get to use the gernade launcher except to access the magic end game door. It is very obvious that the game is not intended to end here but for some reason they just end it and released the game.",

            "review_text": "**Disclaimer: I played the original release of this game, before it was pulled from the Steam store.**  Do not buy this game. It's an incomplete version that was tossed out the door when the Kickstarter failed in order to salavage a little cash. Whilst there is promise in what little there is, it's very short and ends abruptly (The ending has since been patched, but I gether there's little improvement.  The version I played had a tutorial level which instructed you on features that never actually appeared in the game. Obviously these were intended to be included but when the money ran out they were omitted, but the tutorial wasn't updated to refect that.  If you drop by the discussion area you can see the many complaints from those that paid for what they thought was a full game met with evasion, protests and (to be blunt) outright fibs from the publisher and developer that this was intended to be an episodic franchise, despite the fact it was not labelled as such in any description, and, more damningly, the 'final product' was identical to the demo given out when the kickstarter launched.  It's also worth noting that the publisher blamed the QA department for the complete lack of a proper ending (The original release of the game just ended when you enter a room and you were met with a couple of paragraphs of text saying you died), not, say, the developers for not actually doing things properly. It's the kind of desperate buck-passing that I might have found funny had I not paid to play it.  I have to say I'm disappointed that Steam brough it back after it was pulled. Even though the price has been slashed to refect the content, Steam really shouldn't be letting the publishers or developers get away with such shoddy practices.   TL;DR - Don't give these shysters your money.",

            "review_text": "This game needed more work before release.  The game's premise says you're in space, but with your character's insanely limited stamina and crazy jerky jumping mechanic, you could swear you're on Jupiter. You can only see about 5 ft in front of you so enemies will leap at you from outside your visual range, resulting in unavoidable damage. Enemies' hits will also register if you're standing a few feet away as well, and the guns are so weak you just end up kiting all your enemies which really isn't fun.  Good premise and neat graphical style, but clunky and broken gameplay elements--would not reccomend.",

It has an interesting story and you start of seeing a good variety of enemys and the use of the flashlight effecting the enviroment in different ways is a great mechanic. Sadly though this is where the good points end because this game is unfinished and never will be finished as its last update was in 2013. So i would not recommend it which is sad because had it been finished properly it could have been a decent game.",

Its shame that the story isnt complete, but what was done, its fun and make you guess what the full picture would be, since it show some quality and even that some things here and there could be better, the overall worth your time if you look at what is delivered and not what it should had been.   I find hilarious all the people pointing out the game is incomplete, broken and blackslashed the devs, this game is most of the time on sale, mostly because this wasnt the full project, devs run out of support and had to publish the game, most of this so ofended player bought this game for something like 2.50 euros and still come whining just like they had spended 60 bucks in game, sure, you have all the right to be upset for incomplete story, but make all evaluation around what is missing and not what is there, just show some lack of common sense, since there are many games compete that you pay full price and not even worth your time less your money.",

            "review_text": "I'm a little torn here. I liked most of the game, and I don't mind the movement or the move-and-shoot-stuff others mentioned. I mean, you're not a marine, you're some random crew member just woken from cryosleep crawling through a ship infested with aliens, who, after such a long time, don't expect any attack. So to me there's no reason why you shouldn't succeed where the marines failed, even though you're not a trained fighter.  And I don't mind reading a little. It adds to the feeling of a) the game being retro and b) nobody being there on the ship.  Some minor bugs annoyed me like the go-here-markers on the minimap didn't always work which ended in me crawling through the level to find where I'm supposed to be. But that's just a minor thing. On the other hand, I like the way the game works with light and the overall feeling this creates.  Despite of the following issues, I recommend the game. It's nice to play and I totally liked the atmosphere.  What really bugs me is that you get the feeling that this game should have been longer.   * Medium Spoiler Alert *  Not in comparison to the price, but there is nothing indicating the ending. You literally open a door and there it is. And you have just gotten the last piece of equipment and have used it once to clear an obstacle. I can't shake the feeling that there was like 15 more minutes of gameplay planned but then the budget ran out and they put the ending behind some more or less random door.   * Major Spoiler Alert *  Oh, and the ending explains too much. Seriously, I could have lived with not knowing what the Angels were. What I gathered so far was enough: Weirdly powerful aliens, the real threat. Or have the info seeded into the game proper.  I always try to fix things so here is my try on this: Just imagine your mentoring voice telling you 2-3 times to meet him in the Toxic Materials section and how he longs to meet you in person. And that he's got a way to escape from the ship. This way there would be a build-up to this point. You could even have a little twist like him not indicating he's a sort of AI, but saying 'I dug in here and have a means to escape, but I can't do it alone.' Of course people would wonder, like why someone is still alive. But that's not a bad thing. Having a feeling that things just don't add up. And then the ending would come as a relief. 'So he's artificial, that's why!'",

To reiterate, it was still fun and interesting, it just didn't feel as complete as it could be.",
