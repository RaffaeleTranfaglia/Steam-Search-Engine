Using a polarity mechanic, Ikaruga allows you to switch the color of your ship and absorb fire of the same color thus breaking the formula of 'bullet hell' shooters where you simply avoid all fire. Ikaruga brings with it a sort of challenge that beckons the player to keep trying because while the game is incredibly difficult, it is also fair and always follows its own rules. It is a pleasure to play.  Since its original arcade debut, Ikaruga has seen release on the Dreamcast in Japan, Gamecube worldwide (which still commands a high price today), and XBLA. Now that Treasure has graced us with a PC release, it's a good time to try this real 'treasure' of a shooter.",

Unlike Radiant Silvergun, there are only two weapons (standard shot, and a series of lasers), and enemies have two color schemes (black and white) as suppose to three (red, blue, and yellow). Ikaruga has several improvements over Silvergun: The game is more fast-paced than its predecessor, as well as greatly reducing the clutter on the controls (you no longer need to press multiple buttons Simultaneously to initiate a special move). It does have its flaws: the game is rather short and can be beaten within 25 to 50 minutes, the visibility between enemies and obstacles can be hard to tell at times, as well as the lack of proper power-ups (as enemy chains only effect the score and rank). Nonetheless, Ikaruga is a fantastic title in its own right and if you're a fan of bullet hell games, or various Treasure games like Dynamite Headdy or Mischief Makers, this game is for you!",

Ikaruga epitomizes a real arcade experience in all of its glory.  My only real complaint is the lack of online co-op, but I'm sure that would be laggy as hell if they did tack that onto this release. I just won't bother Treasure with any of that, and see where this game goes post-launch. Besides, this game stands on it own even without online co-op.  PS: If you shoot down 100,637 enemies, online co-op becomes available.",

I'll try to analyze the individual elements of the game without gushing over the gameplay too much. Sound - The music is amazing. Its driving and compelling, while at the same time not overpowering the sounds of the game. Seriously, youtube some gameplay footage and listen to it, it is really good. Graphics - This would have to be the one 'weak' spot of the game, if there even was one. the graphics are absolutely beautiful, but slightly dated. the art style of the game is second to none, and there is NO question about when you get hit, what you need to dodge, and whats ccoming at you. You will NEVER say 'I didnt even see that shot, that was lame.' Story - This is a shoot'em'up. the story is, the topodascreen army is waging a war against your keyboard, who has sent one lone ship to fly upward into their base and destroy them. In case you didn't catch that bit of sarcasm, no, there isn't a story, but who cares. GAMEPLAY - If you want to feel accomplished after beating a level, get this game. If you want to feel like you're learning and improving as a player, evenin death, get this game. When you want to feel that refreshing frustration of a really diffficult (but not impossible) challenge, get this game. If you don't like your video games spoon-fed to you, get this game. Seriously, this is a fluid experience that really respects you as a player. You will beat it if you're talented, you will die over and overr again if you're not, and if you keep at it, you'll IMPROVE as a player, and then win! and feel GREAT! There's no hand holding here. You will never even see the last level unless you beat previous levels...The way its meant to be.   100% Recommended.",

            "review_text": "---This is quite a long review, but this is based on my many years of experience of having played the game since it came out on the Dreamcast---  Ikaruga is the 'spiritual successor' to the once darling of ebay, Radiant Silvergun (this was because that game was only available on the Sega Saturn and as such would often fetch a high price).  As is typical of Treasure, the game excels in a few key areas: style (which includes technical and graphical prowess), gameplay and boss fights.  Stylistically Ikaruga still looks amazing even by today's standards, and features some of the most beautiful artwork of any game I've ever come across - just take a peek at the cards for an indication of what I mean.   The style is married to what seems like a very simple gameplay idea that focuses on two different polarities: black and white - something they explored in one of their earlier games called Silhouette Mirage. During the game the player will encounter enemies of either one of these polarities, and will soon notice that they may inflict more damage upon enemies if they are of the opposite polarity. Likewise if players are shot by a projectile of the opposite polarity they will die.  As you can imagine things get a little tougher as you progress through the game, however it's here that the many intricacies of Ikaruga's combination of style and gameplay become apparent. For instance one should bear in mind that it can actually become more difficult to play on Easy difficulty than it is to play on Normal, for on Easy the enemies do not fire any bullets for the player to absorb. Absorbtion of bullets not only add more points to the player's total, but also allows for a super attack that can clear a set number of enemies (depending on the level of the superbar prior to its unleashing and on the polarity of the player and enemies).   Leading on from this one of the most important parts of the game is its 'chain' system which might sound simple enough, but which offers a great deal of challenge from the offset should the player choose. This core aspect centers on shooting down three enemies of the same polarity to create a chain, which adds a multiplier depending on how long the player can keep it up. This invariably leads to players frantically switching during the course of play in order to accumulate points, to not get hit and to maintain that all important multiplier.   With experience the player can calculate the exact number of enemies that may be dispatched with their super move depending on the level of their superbar, and this is important so that players who are striving for higher points do not accidentally destroy more enemies with the super move than they intend to - thereby possibly ruining the chain multiplier. It gets a lot more intricate than that, but this is where the amazing fun and challenge derives.  A typical Treasure trait is to also incorporate epic boss fights and while it may not be on the same awe-inspiring level as those found in Radiant Silvergun, they do offer a worthy and interesting challenge. As an intersting sidenote, Blizzard later incoporated Ikaruga's polarity mechanic in their Twin Val'kyr boss encounter (which was part of the Trial of The Crusader raid instance), and I feel this is testament to the type of challenges that can be offered by a relatively simple gameplay mechanic.  In conclusion then Ikaruga is a truly amazing game because it introduces a relatively simple idea for any player to easily pick up, but which at the same time offers many intricacies and challenges for those willing to delve a little further.",

If you think you're going to walk into this game and beat it easily (without unlimited continues) you're wrong. It's very tough but also very rewarding with its dual phase mechanic. If your ship is black, you absorb black bullets and die in one hit. If you're white, it's the opposite. You have to use this mechanic to survive as the enemies will be blanketing the screen in bullets and lasers trying to kill you with alternating colors.

Gameplay is extremely solid. At it's most basic, Ikaruga puts you in control of the titular ship, which has two abilities - you can shoot, and you can change the Ikaruga's polarity. The polarity mechanic works thusly: Enemies are color-coded, and you're immune to projectiles color-coded from enemies which share your present color. This may sound simple on paper, but the game is a bullet hell with little tolerance for failure. Staying alive is a constant struggle and requires unfaltering attention as well as considerable ability to sort out visual noise, so this isn't a good choice for those in the mood for an easy play. Those familiar with Treasure will know that their games are often incredibly simple yet exceedingly difficult and often expect complete mastery of mechanics to progress; Ikaruga certainly carries on the tradition. The game rewards several different approaches to play and has a bevy of settings, providing replay value in droves.  Those who do well enough may find themselves butting heads with a certain stony foe from a previous Treasure game...  Visual and sound design are stellar, with compelling enemy designs and an excellently composed score by composer Hiroshi Iuchi. The spartan black and white design motifs further emphasize (and almost feel like an extention of) the game's mechanics, and the music certainly makes me feel like the last survivor of a botched rebellion going solo against an empire with the power of a god behind it.  All-in-all, Ikaruga's not going to be everyone's cup of tea since it's an incredibly hectic game, but I feel it's immaculately constructed and that any shmup junkie who hasn't yet ought to take it for a spin. The game is incredibly lightweight - having originally been designed with Dreamcast-era hardware in mind - so it'll even run on nearly anything!",

Seriously, those explosions. I have never felt quite so good when killing a troublesome boss.  Cons: - A menu annoyances. To my knowledge, once you select a game mode, you can't back out if you clicked something you didn't mean to. Effectively, you have to play a game and kill yourself or reset the game to get back to the title screen.  - No real explanation of the story. There is a plot to this game, and it's not an excuse plot.

While it's certainly nowhere near as bad as it was in Radiant Silvergun (There, you had to chain to upgrade your weapons, which was *essential* to defeating later bosses), I still don't particularly like a scoring system that effectively forces you to memorize everything that happens in an entire stage to hit those elusive S++ ranks. Granted, I'm also terrible at chaining, so take that as you will.   Overall, Ikaruga has earned its reputation as being one of the greatest shoot-'em ups ever made. Fantastic level design, creative boss designs, good story (in the versions that actually have it), great visuals and music. What else could you ask for?  Before I go, though, one word of warning:  While far from the hardest game in this genre, Ikaruga is still difficult. Like, really, really, really difficult. Dark Souls doesn't come close.  If you're not up for that, I would advise you avoid this game.",

It's one of those games that are seemingly simple to play, but HARD to master.  With multiple difficulties, anyone can jump in and see what the fuss is about. Replays and the ability to replay levels will get you better aquainted to what the game has to offer.  I can't recommend this game enough if you are a shmup fan.  Ikaruga ladies and gents. Buy it!",

            "review_text": " Disclaimer:  Playtime should probably be around 75-100 hours, as I played the crap out of the GCN version back in the day (which is still sitting on my shelf).  This is in my humble opinion the best shoot-em-up of all time, and while I'm not a hardcore fan of the genre, I have played enough to feel that it's a decent title for that mantle. I've rarely played a game developed by Treasure that disappoints, and this is probably their best.  The incredible visuals (which have aged exceptionally well), the amazing musical score and sound effects already set this game apart from many shooters. However, the unique 'polarity' mechanic and simple, straightforward controls truly make this game remarkable and unique, even compared to others developed by Treasure.   The ability to absorb attacks that would otherwise destroy you, and to have control over this mechanic for every attack in the game, adds a level of depth and strategy that isn't typical of games in this genre. The mechanic is easy to understand, but often extremely difficult to apply optimally.  This mechanic is displayed throughout the masterfully crafted stages, which is the trademark of any Treasure game. You would be hard pressed to find a shoot-em-up developer that can create stages that seem so chaotic and tense yet are so deliberate and organized in design.  I should warn that this game isn't for the faint of heart. It's disgustingly difficult to master and really demands a lot of concentration and pattern recognition from the player to find success. The only payoffs are bragging rights and hi-scores, which both come with a sense of accomplishment that you've overcome such a difficult game.",

Having since played every version since the Dreamcast I can definitively say this version is the best. Full HD glory for one of the finest bullet-hell shooters ever produced. Experience a game that is not only impulsive, but tactical. Requiring you to think fast, and switch your absorbing shield quickly in order to absorb some bullets, just to dodge others. Ikaruga is one of the few games out there that will produce a zen-like experience as you get better. It goes without saying that I recommend this game immensely. Over ten years have passed since I first played this game and got lost in its splendor, and it has not lost a beat since then.",

The concept is still unique; a scrolling shooter with no powerups, no screen-clearing bombs, and brilliant level design which means that sometimes the best way to survive and score highly is not to shoot everything on the screen as quickly and indiscriminately as possible. This is a game that rewards patience, careful thinking, and the 'twitch' all at once, a game that will humble you for your first few attempts but at the same time leave you saying 'one more go' over and over again. Ikaruga is not just a great game; it's a milestone in the history of gaming, the very apex of the scrolling shooter, and Treasure's magnum opus among masterpieces, made all the more amazing considering that it was originally designed, developed, and scored by only four people. You get the point by now - this is a 'buy' at any price, and it's great that Steam will allow a whole new generation of gamers to experience Ikaruga's brilliant simplicity.",
