            "review_text": "When I played the first Evoland game I enjoyed it and thought it was a nice little parody but really nothing more. That is why I was pretty hesitant at first at buying the second game. Then I saw some videos of the game and decided it was worth a shot, and boy am I happy about that decision.  First of all, Evoland 2 brings back some of the main unique elements of the first game, mainly the mashup of many different video game themes, and my god does it do a good job at that! From 2D top-down perspective to 3D navigation, from turn-based battle mechanics to real-time fighting and puzzle solving, from card games to shoot 'em up, this game excels in variety.  In addition, unlike the first game, Evoland 2 has a solid plot which in my opinion was very nice and enjoyable (no spoilers here).  For completionist this game is pretty much ideal as it offers many not-so-easy-to-find collectibles (non of which are missable, hurray!)  And finally, one does not simply write a review of this game without mentioning THE SOUNDTRACK. The music is so, so good! I find myself sitting and listening to the soundtrack of this game over and over again (including now as I'm writing this review).  So, what are you waiting for? JUST BUY THIS GAME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! You won't regret it!",

            "review_text": "Evoland 2 is a grand adventure game that has the feel of a JRPG without actually being one. It is a  huge  step up from the original. If you haven’t played the original Evoland, I recommend not bothering – just skip to this one. It takes all of the half-finished ideas from the original and finishes them, combining them into a huge, story-driven, humor-driven, genre-sampling experience that will leave you feeling like you’ve explored everything that retro gaming had to offer.  The gameplay starts out resembling Zelda’s hack-and-slashing, but it doesn’t stay that way. In fact, I won’t even claim to pin a genre onto this game – it throws  everything  at you. I wouldn’t dare spoil anything more than that. Half the fun is getting to see what crazy scenario the game serves up next. (And in case you're worried -- gone are the random encounters from the first game! This game has no random encounters at all, with the exception of one particular dungeon...)  Don’t be fooled by the constant barrage of borderline-plagiarism jabs and references to famous games – between them lies a decent, well-told story about time travel, nostalgia, war and politics, and the changing of eras. If you get immersed in the story, you’ll find that it occasionally drops thought-provoking details which keep you guessing and ultimately come together to paint a complete picture of what is really happening throughout history.   As a fair warning, this game has  very  slow pacing. Expect to spend 30-60 minutes in every new area. Try to get immersed into the story and the world – if you’re the kind of gamer who wants to get things over with as fast as possible, you’ll probably get bored and annoyed with this game very fast.  As another fair warning, due to the genre-sampling nature of this game, you’ll probably encounter one or two areas you’ll absolutely hate. The genre-change areas go on pretty long (30-60 minutes each) but I enjoyed their length – they make the alternate gameplay feel less like minigames and more like valid representations of the various genres, something you’ve got to settle into and get a feel for before you can graduate from them. It’s a game about trying everything, so you’ve got to have a mentality of being willing to man up and complete an area even if you don’t like the gameplay – because what you don’t enjoy at first you might acquire a taste for in the end. (Although, if an area is giving you too much trouble, you’re free to switch the difficulty on the fly anytime you’d like.)  As much as I praise the game, it has its faults. It could have been a 10/10 game, had it not been for a handful of issues:    Wonky collision detection. You get used to it, but you never really stop noticing it.    The ending is a bit abrupt. You can still get some answers if you read between the lines, but the ending of the story isn’t told nearly as well as the rest of the story.    Various glitches, especially one which can sometimes make objects invisible.    Some weird inconvenient quirks with the interface design (like having to set sail to leave a certain island even after you can fly)    Some jarring plot holes can be created by playing some quests in different (not unintended) orders. For instance, in one scene a character freaks out about there being two copies of a book – even if you already completed a quest where they got a copy made.    In the middle of the game, time travel gets a bit tedious as the only easily-accessible portal is pretty far out of the way, and you have to walk there and back dozens of times.   I give Evoland 2 a 7.5 / 10. It’s a bit rough around the edges and not perfect, but it’s one hell of an adventure! It's very much worth playing for fans of Zelda or retro gaming in general. I loved it; It made me laugh with clever references and fourth wall breaks, it really impressed me with its sense of story development, and it compelled me to keep playing just to see what would come next – just like a good adventure game should. Just make sure to go into the experience with a mentality of patience and expect a 20-hour game, and it might just leave you with warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia by the end.  (Achievement hunters: I got about 95% without a guide. The game includes some cool treasure-tracking features that make it much more enjoyable to find all the secrets than in the first game. However, a few secrets are unfairly hidden and don’t show up on the treasure tracker at all, and you might have to resort to a guide to find them at the end. It’s about 20-25 hours to 100%.)",

The bad: -Some bosses are a bit irritating to deal with due to RNG values and overly large HP bars (Cherry is a good example) -Some of the one-time sequences go on for long enough that they wear thin -The platforming sections can be a bit wonky sometimes -There's no journal or guide for a decent portion, so if you lose focus you end up wandering a bit until you end up back on track -Unfortunately, i could never finish this game due to a single dungeon with unresolved game breaking bugs ignored by the developer.

The most unique part is that (because of time travel) everything you find and see has an 8-bit (think Legend of Zelda), 256-bit (think any SNES RPG), and modern 3D equivalent (think Final Fantasy IX+), and more. Getting to a new era to see how things are in each version is exhilarating. Add in a bunch of parodies from a bunch of game genres and you got a very fun and surprisingly fulfilling game that's much more than just a parody.   If you're a fan of old-school RPGs you should check it out.",

This game is like a love letter to a lot of classic games and I truly believe you'd be missing out on something if you didn't play this game.  Unlike Evoland 1, this game did everything perfectly. No jokes were dragged out, no freature/gameplay element overstayed its welcome... Everything was portioned just right. The music was really great, too. If you've played Evoland 1 and avoid this one because of it-- Don't. This game is so much more better, trust me.  At its core, it's a Legend of Zelda-esque adventure game with time-travelling elements. But as you advance in the game you'll soon see that this isn't everything this game has to offer. There's a little bit of everything everywhere: Tactical RPG, RPG, Platformer, card games, .. and much more that I don't want to spoil.  Most 'genres' are only introduced once, and like I said, never overstay their welcome; as quickly as they come, they also go. This was made very well in my opinion, I believe certain moments in the game would have lost their charm if they happened over and over again.  The story isn't random at all and it all makes sense in one way or another. I wouldn't say the story was really great as there were some things left open that were never explained, but there's also a lot that didn't need an explaination as you could figure it out yourself. All in all I'd say the story was well written, even if it had a few plot holes.  Lasty, I can just say this: I rarely find games that make me want to finish them as soon as I start playing them. The game was well-paced and was very interesting from start to finish. I binge played it and I regret nothing. It was an amazing experience that I truly believe everyone should experience for themselves.",

Lots of fun mini events that borrow from other genres too, like arcade fighters, brawlers, and bullet hells. Enjoyable card game system built in. Full clearing the game took me a little over 20 hours and I enjoyed every minute of it.",

This sequel, however, instead has a well-crafted (if somewhat simplistic and over-acted) plot about time travel, fate, race relations, personal development, and the lessons of history. This is coupled with a time-travel mechanic represnted by 8-bit, 16-bit, and modern 3D graphics respectively, that isn't just a gimmick or a joke about game development, but a solidly integrated gameplay mechanic, with challenging but not frustrating puzzles, and loads of mini-games and constantly varying game modes that take you through a retrospective of genre development in gaming, and keep the game feeling fresh and fun throughout.",

            "review_text": "Like its predecessor, Evoland 2 is an ARPG that plays with the idea of letting you switch between different 'dimensions' - that is, graphical and sound styles mimicking those of the 8-bit era, the 16-bit era, and the modern 3d era. Perhaps more importantly, this is not a purely cosmetical effect, but the in-game version of time travel: A tree that blocks your way in the 16-bit era may still be a small sappling you can easily walk over in the 8-bit era. NPCs can be born or die as you move through the ages, and even entire continents sink to the ground or become available for exploration depending on which time your are in.   Gameplay-wise, Evoland 2 primarily sticks to the classical mix of top-down Hack'n'Slash with puzzle elements that became popular with the early The Legend of Zelda games. However, many regions in the game deviate from this formula - in some caves, the game turns into a 2d platformer, but there also are sections emulating anything ranging from beat'em'up sidescrollers, turn-based tactical RPGs, bomberman, and even a Guitar Hero-style rhythm game. Most of these sections are not very long but nonetheless provide a refreshing alternative to cutting bushes and pushing statues.  Evoland 2's writing is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the time-travelling plot opens some interesting questions concerning things such as whether or not destiny can be changed, or who the protagonist actually is. Sadly, these questions are never really explicitly touched upon, and get overshadowed by the game's often cringeworthy attempt of being funny - I do get that the game is supposed to be a bit of a parody of various video game classic, but how does this justify cramming half-arsed jokes and references to other video games and memes into every other sentence? If I wanted 'LE EBIN MAYMAY XDDD', I'd play Borderlands, for hell's sake.  Despite of this, Evoland 2's wild mix of genres and art styles still makes it a fairly enjoyable game that clocks in at approximately between 15-25 hours, depending on how much of a completionist you are.",

It's byodiful, it's got so much content in it that makes me think the developer is an actual time traveller to have enough time and money to put it in. But...BUT...and this is a big butt (I'm so sorry). This game...this game is hard as nails at some points. Ok, evoland, I get it, the first one was pretty much just a joke game, and now you want to make sure we're aware you're a proper game now, I get, but for the love of god, don't put the words 'Challenging but fair' on your default difficulty, this game is challenging but fair the same way dark souls is challenging but fair on its default difficulty. A lot of the bosses have the infuriating tendency to use a move that is ffffricking specificaly made to take advantage of you in the dickiest way possible 'YES, EVOLAND, I'M AWARE I GOT KILLED, COULD YOU TELL ME AT WHAT POINT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE THIS BOSS CLUSTER BOMBING THE ROOM?'  But the question with difficulty is 'Is it difficult in a good way' to which I would reply 'There is no good kind of difficulty, I wouldn't thank my landlord for making me go through a death gauntlet to get to the empire biscuits' but its actually quite good. It feels very retro, which is bloomin' ironic because funnily enough most of the excruciatingly hard parts take place in a retro feel.

The most prominent issue I have with Evoland 2 is its inability to take itself seriously. It lingers in a weird limbo of humor and seriousness without fully committing to either. It’s littered with dank memes and clichéd, self-referential jokes which downplay the game's attempts at evoking emotions.  Dungeons, upgrades, levels, collectibles, dialogue options and NPCs are all ingredients to a decent RPG adventure but they’re not enough for an excellent one. The progress in Evoland 2 isn’t easily perceptible because the story is a convoluted mess. It sort of keeps moving and throwing twists, most of which overstay their welcome.  I also begun to hope that the NPCs would alter their lines the second time I spoke to them because I found myself repeatedly doing that by accident. The occasional meaningless yes/no choice adds nothing to the script, and there were some cases of continuation errors where my characters were talking about an obstacle they hadn’t yet seen in the game. Then there was the quite literal manic pixie dream girl calling me and my party member a bunch of pessimists, continuing to spout a mass of motivational quotes, which made me skip dialogue until my wrist hurt.  Music isn’t bad, it’s mediocre. The Haunted Forest area has an uptempo rock tune with a church organ giving it a Castlevania vibe and making it sound like a comedic boss battle. Compared to the music in Zelda, for example, Evoland 2 sounds like a Disneyland ride. Zelda’s Lost Woods tune is more ambiguous in its harmonization. It creates a contemplative ambiance, despite being upbeat.  The 3D environment simply fails to appeal. The saturated colors and the low-poly props look like they don’t belong on PC. The isometric world doesn’t encourage exploration because you can’t view a single vista in perspective.  Minigames in Evoland 2 are fine, but their framing isn’t. There’s a library with eight small puzzles. In Professor Layton the puzzles pace the gameplay through interesting locales. You’re compelled to investigate and just happen to come by tiny puzzles here and there. In Evoland, I ran from NPC to NPC and solved all eight puzzles in a row for 'study credits'.  I could say that the main problem is that Evoland 2 is a jack-of-blah-blah and master of blah. While that is true, one of the biggest problems is that it doesn’t induce nostalgia. It falls into the trap of covertly name dropping specific games, without the pleasure of mastery that the referenced games provide.  I play Ocarina of Time annually and I know others who do this. Why? Because I get something out of it every single time. Sometimes I think about Link as the Hero with a Thousand Faces and sometimes of Ganon as the face of good that has been corrupted. But every time I find pleasure in the mastery. It’s subtle, it’s elegant, it’s titillating. Evoland 2 is none of those.",

In the two hours I have played so far, I have seen so many mind-numbingly cliche sequences that if I didn't know any better, I'd say this game was just a paint-by-numbers exercise in game development. I've already gone through the boring tutorial, the forced stealth section, the generic coliseum, and I decided it wasn't worth continuing when I hit the sewer level filled with insta-death pits and bats. That's not even mentioning the plot so transparent that at least 2 of the major 'twists' are already in plain sight, or the unimaginative characters.  I'm sure that there are people who will argue that it's satire, or a loving parody or somesuch. Thing is though, simply implementing a well-known setpiece doesn't make something satire. Satire requires you to implement it, point out its prevalence, and then give an alternative, or twist it somehow so it's not the same as every other time you've seen it. I would have greatly appreciated it if, for example, midway through the stealth section your companion just knocked out a guard blocking the way forward, letting you bypass the circuitous route through the patrols. Instead the concept is played completely straight, right down to the cardboard box.  I want to love this game. I really do. I might even keep struggling through its numerous flaws in the hope of finding something good underneath. But if you want a skilled satire of RPGs, I suggest you look elsewhere unless you have a strong desire to waste a few hours on tedium before anything fun shows up.",

I'm afraid to invest any more time into playing, so I'll see if I can get a refund. Hopefully they'll fix these in time, but for now, buyer beware.",

So many genres are cross played here that it becomes hard to keep track but thats not a bad thing at all. One minute as a turn base RPG (like Chrono Trigger) then as a top down space shooter (bit like Galaga) then a Fighting game, then to a 2D brawler (think Streets of Rage) then to a match 3 type game (like Puzzle Quest) then back to whatever it was to start off as.   It is all done so seamlessly and nothing feels shoe-horned in for a 'just coz' feeling. And as a fan of most of the Genres they throw in im all for it.

This sequel I did not find out about until about a week or 2 ago...and I wasted no time in getting it. NO REGRETS! But anyway, time for the nitty gritty.  This game has a very healthy dose of video game pop culture references, even moreso than the first game. Not only references, but playstyles and genres! It has strategy, puzzles, side scrolling, fighting, running, vertical/horizontal shooters, CCG, and even rhythm games...essentially it's video game genre mash up.  One thing I can't really comment on is the controls, as I was playing with my PS3 controller the whole way.  PROS: - A unique game, utilizing many different gameplay styles in one game. - Tons of references to big titles/series (LoZ, FF, Super Mario, Chrono Trigger, MGS, to name a few) - The story brings back memories for fans of Chrono Trigger (at least for me it does, and if you haven't played it...what are you waiting for?) - A great game to introduce younger generations to the different arcade/console gameplay styles of the 80s/90s  CONS: - Jack of all trades, master of none. It gives players a taste of many different styles of gameplay, but doesn't really satisfy cravings for any of them. Each gameplay style is very simplistic, so don't expect Fire Emblem level strategy or Yu-Gi-Oh level of complexity with cards. Every game referenced does their thing better than this game does (naturally), but no oither game has it all like this one does (yet) - Story isn't very engaging and I would almost say the basis of time travel/global disaster is a little overused. However, it doesn't take away any enjoyment from the game as the primary appeal is the combination of gameplay itself.  Overall, I'd give it a 9/10. Very few games nowadays make me eager to play and more importantly continue to play until the end and this was one of them.",

            "review_text": "First off, let me say that I'm a fan of the original Evoland. It was a simple game that had a unique gameplay thing that I've always wanted to see: graphical progression from 8 bit all the way to high definition polygons of the modern era. I think the original pulled it off with a simple charm to it. Having said that, it was also short and a little too heavy on the meta humor, not that I think that it's bad or anything. The second Evoland from my experience so far does indeed take this premise and give it more life. They play with the concept more and you're given alot to work with, and it's not just there for jokes and references, although they'll still give you plenty of those. Gameplay is tight and the characters are funny but functional. When it comes to the kind of gameplay you'll experience, I would compare Evo 2 to a platter of appetizers and finger foods. You get a little taste of various genres and playstyles, and there's just enough to give you a taste of each. a little caramel turn based strategy, some autoscrolling shmups covered in garlic butter, a creme freche platforming that switches from 2 D to 3 D constantly, that kind of thing. If each was expanded upon greatly and given a little more polish, I think they would be solid as standalone games. evo doesn't do that to the extent that I described though. What you get is good, but it's limited. It leaves you wanting more at least, so I give it that.  Unfortunately, there's a large batch of downsides to this game, on a technical level. There's a rather unpleasant sound freezing that occurs once in a while, which is like when a sound effect is interrupted and you hear a very loud screeching noise. I've also encountered difficulties with windowed mode and resolution changes. Although you can press alt+enter to bring up this mode, there's not much you can do to change the resolution, and I'd appreciate it if you could at least do this from the menu. The worst among these problems is a very bad screen freezing bug, which prevents you from playing the game period. It's fixed with a restart, and with the checkpoint system in place, you won't lose hours of progress thankfully. Still, it's a noticeable problem that really makes the game tough to recommend, but since I still want to finish it in spite of these problems, I can say that the positives outweigh the negatives. It has much room for improvement though. Let's hope the devs one day get to that.  I give it two thumbs slightly pointing upward, as most of my complaints are from hardware issues, possibly on my end, possibly from the game, but I had little issue with the gameplay itself.",

There are several of these genres/games that I either don't get or dislike for various gameplay or design reasons, and all of these are unskippable and integral to the game itself. There are no alternative paths; if you come across a section you dislike, you'd better buckle up, go tryhard mode, and beat it, because you can't leave it now. These sections also all vary in quality, from cheap ripoffs of the original games, to well-designed homages. The 'Jack of all trades, master of none' saying definitely applies here.  I'm not actually sure what my verdict on this game is. It's pretty good, I guess. Not amazing, but ok. I love me an oldschool fantasy RPG with decent story, and this game definitely hits that mark well. I'd prefer if it were less scattered in execution and was less heavyhanded with the pop culture references, but it was alright. I enjoyed it for what it was. Unfortunately, it's a game stuck in the past so much that I don't think it really realizes what it's not. And it's not an improvement on any of the genres it emulates. Which is a royal shame, because some of the aforementioned game formulas could definitely be improved upon with just a little bit of originality. And there is zero originality to this game. Every single piece of it you'll have seen before.  This may seem like a negative sort of review, but it really isn't. The controls are tight. The story is good enough (though the twists in the story are often quite obvious). The transitions between game modes make sense and are oftentimes brilliant or seamless. The pixel art, like most pixel art, is passable. The 3D animations are pretty solid. The attention to detail in a lot of areas is fantastic. The music is forgettable or sometimes annoying. The puzzle design is really solid. It's a good game. It's just not a great game. Grab it on sale and enjoy it for what it is. Through all of my gripes, I had a blast, and I'm sure you will too.",

I didn't mind though as it was fun throughout. The mashup of genres was really neat and it was fun getting the collectables. I was pleasently surprised how good this game was/",

It took the concept from the first game and integrated it into a full RPG with a story, along with several stages that are not your typical hack and slash or turn based fights - Including a Street-Fighter style boss fight, an Isometric beat-em-up stage and LOTS more. Loads of pop-culture references which to me is a huge plus. The music is also great, and fits the different settings like a glove. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",

Over the past few years there have been many new games come along that try to capture that retro charm and feel from previvious generations. This is one of the few that does it right.",
