            "review_text": "Before I write my full review a bit of a disclaimer. I had to use a walkthrough to get through this game. Particularly very early on. With that said, Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting is very much a game oozing with mystery and the unknown. You're trapped in the basement of an abandoned farm looking for clues. What you find, though, is conspiracy upon conspiracy and what amounts to supernatural forces at work. Or is what you experience just a figment of your imagination? I'm a fan of games that treat the player with more questions than answers by the time the credits roll and this one doesn't disapoint. I'd love to see more from Viperante. It's not a perfect first-person adventure game, but if you're a fan of horror and don't want jump scares, this one might be up your alley.",

            "review_text": "I have to say that I enjoyed this game, but only through the use of a walkthrough. There were far too many times that the game would unlock a door after you read something and not tell you in any way that anything had happened. This led to being stuck rechecking every single area over and over. And the navigation system was clunky at best. The only reason I bothered to finish it at all was because I was interested in the story. And even that went out the window with the completely lackluster ending. I really wanted to enjoy this game, because I was so intrigued by the story, but in the end I just can't recommend it.  tl;dr - I got it on sale for $0.79 and I feel like I got my money's worth, but just barely.",

            "review_text": "Right, so I am a huge fan of horror games, and when I saw a new one that had apparently come out of nowehere, I was excited to see what it held in store for me.  The first thing, the fact that it is a point and click horror wasn't quite to my taste. Now I know that some people love point and click horror games, but it just didn't feel right. Eh, mixed point on that. But then we get into the actual gameplay and hoo man.  The puzzles start off mildly complex and require you to flex your brain, and only get more intense from there. I won't outright say what they are, but one puzzle that comes aout.. a quarter of the way in, and serves as your introduction to what ends up being a core component of the gameplay, was rather absurdly difficult and nearly had me give up on the game then and there. I managed to perservere though, with the help of a walkthrough.... a walkthrough that was written back in 2012. Over three years ago. Welp. Seems like this didn't come out of nowehre after all, just out of nowhere to me.  But yes, the puzzles which had been slightly difficult before get more and more so, and end up requiring you to wander back and forth throughout the area of the game you've already explored, to find what has changed after you solve a pzzle. I wouldn't have minded this as much, if there had been clues on where you were supposed to go. There weren't.  Then there's the fact that this walkthrough from three years ago exists. I don't mind that, but the edition available here is supposedly the 'enhanced edition'. Nothing at all had changed from the experience the walkthrough guide had, as all his solutions were the exact same in this game. Maybe the graphics updated or gameplay changed between the two version, but for nearly seven dollars, this game felt like a rip off.   TL;DR: Point and click obtuse puzzler from years ago. Buy the original if you want to play, it's probably cheaper.",

            "review_text": "Outstanding horror game!  This was a serious breath of fresh air for me, I've played many of the so called 'horror' games that get talked about such as F.E.AR. Amnesia, Outlast, Dead Space, etc and found them to be mediocre, nothing like the original 90s classics like RE, Silent Hill and others which always had a unique way of making you terrified without constantly needing things to jump out at you.  This game brought me right back to the 90s, pure raw atmospheric storytelling, you have no Idea what is going on and it is scary as HELL, the story is very mysterious and many of the puzzles are challenging and require some thought and a pen and paper!  I highly reccomend this game, it was an absolute love letter to the horror genre which has became too focused on jumpscares, overused Unity assets and YouTube reactions recently. My only complaint is that it would be nice to be able to change the resolution in-game, windowed mode had me occasionally minimising the game by accidentally clicking outside of the window while moving around, but this is a minor complaint.  Buy it and you will NOT regret it!",

            "review_text": "I played through it, but I can't honestly recommend it. It has an interesting story, with a number of twists, but a lot of the puzzles have the solution 'go find a walkthru because you won't figure this out yourself'. A particularly bad one is a computer with a 'web browser' that only accepts certain very specific key phrases- if you fail to guess exactly what phrasing the game wants, it will fail to find anything at all. There are at least 2 spots where failing to guess the right phrase will leave you completely stuck.   Still, it has some atmosphere and an interesting story-line, but don't get it unless you're willing to stop occasionally and look up the 'proper' solution.",
