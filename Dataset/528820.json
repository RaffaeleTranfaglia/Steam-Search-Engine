            "review_text": "Wonderful game, a great addition to Legends of Eisenwald. Really big map and a lot of things to do. Taking over enemy castles initially was hard but it was because I tried to capture them all. I changed my strategy and started taking a few and protecting them and it worked much better. Once I captured all, enemies stopped respawning, and I needed to defend my lands only against a few raubritters.   Side quests are good, many have a nice touch of humor. I really liked Underwater Bees, I think it's hilarious :) Political references are nicely done as well, not sure what others complain about. You can forget about it after all and treat it lile any other story, stories tend to repeat themselves century after century. Other pluses are: + Plenty of enemies to max out your army. + Patrol in your castle - I brought them to max level and they were able to defend my castle twice against rogue knights! It's worth training them often. + Autumn scenery. I wish original LoE had some of them, looks really nice. + Interesting quests that make you think and explore the lands.  + Huge map, I think it's the size of the biggest map in LoE. + Enemies respawn stonger. I captured all castles about a week before November 8 and chased a few bandits. Some of them got so strong I lost a battle. Don't chase bandits with skill ambush in forests, they will destroy you in the first round.  There are a few minuses though: - Saves related crashes. After a few ones I read up on forums and found that it's best to use quick save (F5) or rename standard names. For some reason, standard names saves are very likely to cause crashes.  - No endless mode. I know it's one map smaller game but I can't help wishing for some random quest generation and armies respawn. I realize it might become boring but it would be so cool to enjoy for a while a victory and rule over my lands with an iron hand :)  9 raubritters out of 10  ",

Watched various Youtube vids about the game, looked decent, started to play it and found it annoying with all the political rubbish. Why listen to rumours in the tavern which have absolutely NO baring on the game whatsoever, just political messages. Wish I read more of the reviews first. Can't believe I paid for this game......MUG.",
