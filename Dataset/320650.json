            "review_text": "I bought this because I'd enjoyed Cradle of Rome, but this didn't feel half as strategic.  On the good side, this is extremely reasonably priced in the sale (currently 69p), the graphics and design are quite beautiful, and real thought's gone into creating a non-distracting storyline.  However. it may have been because I chose to do games against the clock - but I found that the only way to get through many of the levels was to click as fast as possible all over the board to amass enough 'wealth' to finish in time. Which seemed pointless.  Also, each level includes a hidden object round - which is fine. The problem, for me, came with the occasional challenges that you have to pass to get back on to the match games: one protecting daisies from being blasted, and the one that entirely blocked me from going further: one clicking on an expanding flurry of snowflakes. Both of these were all about extremely fast reflexes, and clicking furiously for a couple of minutes.   I'm not adverse to fast-action games, but I'd not expected them to crop up in a match game, nor to be as challenging as they are, quite randomly in a completely different genre. I bought the game for relaxation, and quick-thinking strategy, but it ended up being a frantic click-fest.",

            "review_text": "Season Match 1 was stupid, but fun to pass time. Season Match 2 crams in more mini games with horrible controls. The art for the 'enemies' you match battle against looks like it was stolen from a different game due to style choice. Not fun even for someone who sort of liked the first game because it's not enough like the first game. This game auto pauses, which SM1 didn't, so that's a plus. The screenshot ability didn't work for me in either game.",

But it's still angry. Definitely angry, very scary enemy.'   'Are you fighting poo?'   Still not sure but at least I won.  Recommended.",
