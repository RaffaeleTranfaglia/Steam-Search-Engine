If I had to rate game on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it a solid 8/10. This game is definitely a buy!",

        {
            "review_text": "It is unfortunate, and personally, I enjoy the Serious Sam series a lot. A LOT.  but alas, this is NOT a true serious sam game. this is a VERY SHORT knock-off.  this, my friends, is a joke. even compared to Serious Sam 'the first encounter', or worse yet, 'serious sam 2', Serious sam the random encounter is a flop. definitely NOT worth over a dollar. I beat the game in roughly an hour. but, in keeping with my professionalism-review-code, I will now proceed to dole out pros and cons.  WARNING: my review has some spoilers. fair warning has been given.  Pros: - It has very low req. specs to run. Your computer could very well be several years outdated, and still run it just fine. - amusing dialogue, with references and fun character. - an okay number of iconic guns. - amusing gameplay style makes fun of the old random encounters of the old JRPGs. - Colorful graphics. Granted, there are people out there who hate any graphical level that is any less detailed then, say, DOOM 4. but personally, I enjoyed the old retro-gaming look.  Cons:  - Very short, you can beat it in an hour, even if you DO loot every possible crate on the way. - some of the weapons are unbalanced. the cannon is too powerful, the rocket launcher is too weak, etc.... - very linear. they give you the illusion of there being multipule paths to choose from, but such is not the case. - uninteresting bosses. for example, using two grenade launchers and one serious damage powerup, I killed the final boss in a single shot. and the final boss didn't have some sort of 'ultimate mode' or something? And that wasn't even mental, either, which brings me to my next point. - too much emphasis on a character that never appears. Mental. All throughout the game, Serious Sam and his pals keep talking about killing Mental.....but Mental wasn't even the final boss!!! Mental makes NO appearences WHATSOEVER. this is actually quite annoying, and is one of the main downsides of the Serious Sam series as a whole. - random weird characters. I mean, who ARE these two guys that follow Sam? Some random afro dude and some random cowboy. they don't get their own background stories? memorable NAMES?? Original weapons? (eg. Excalibur for king arthur, Mining lazer for Glitch, A knife for Jeff the killer, etc.) These two feel less like allies on the field, and more like two extra guns. - Fails to capture the feel of Serious Sam. Serious Sam may be a bit hardcore about destruction, but he's not an idiot. this game portrays him as being a fool who only cares about shooting mental, and hates puzzles. It makes him look like a musclebound pretty-boy with no head on his shoulders. this is NOT how Serious Sam should be. Serious Sam is sarcastic, makes puns, is fearless, and will often stop in mid battle to give a witty one-liner, like 'Alien bulls? that's a lot of bull. *kills it* There. 100% alien beef.' He's also quite the ladies-man, as well. and somewhat....shall we say....'rougueish', from time to time.  - Where's the C-4 charges? and the quadgun? and the buzzsaw-gun? or even the plasma pistol! WHERE ARE THEY??? It's sad how they didn't put those awesome guns in the game... - The animations are 'passable'. but not very good at all. Personally, I enjoy retro-appearences, but just because it's retro doesn't mean the animations have to be so TERRIBLE. I mean, look at 'Gone Home', or 'Lone Survivor'. those retro-style games were both made by a SINGLE GUY EACH, and yet their animations were surprisingly good. - Lack of depth. even the 3rd serious sam game had sufficient puzzles to prevent yer brain from going numb from all the raw combat, but this game's terrible excuse for puzzles wouldn't even float in a Pokemon game. Seriously.  So yes, on with the final Verdict. I give this game a 4/10. Slightly below average. I say this because with all it's flaws, it was still an okay way to kill time. it was okay, going through endless mode for a little while. I've actually seen worse games that had higher expectations. still, that's no excuse to make a shoddy game. this game is currently being sold at a price of exactly $4.99, but it's only WORTH about....eh, I'd say $1.99, to be fair.",
