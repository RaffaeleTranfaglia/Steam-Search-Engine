            "review_text": "There might be some nastalgia playing into my review of this game. It's recalls my favorite time in gaming, when titles like Terminal Velocity and Descent Dominated PC gaming. The tourtorial is a bit lacking so taking some time learning the controls from the options menu first will go a long way, the instant action option is a nice touch and multiplayer (with some system tweaking) is workable and entertaining at lans.  To address the Negative reviews:  There seems to be a trend of people assuming that this new wave of old games getting re-released on steam are similar to 'remakes' available on consoles. These are more like diving in the bargin bin at a local retailer. They aren't repolished with new fixes for modern machines, most will require a few extra steps to get running and this should be expected if you are buying anything before 2009. This one is no exception, luckily there aren't as many issues as with some other titles. I was able to get it up and running by right clicking on the gamelauncher.bat in the install folder and running as administrator. After running it once this way it launches fine from steam. Just so you don't think I have some odd setup that might be old enough to be compatible:  i7 3770k 16 gigs of ddr3 Geforce 780 Win7 x64 240gig SSD ",

However, it should be sold in such a state that it launches and is playable. This game can't be launched, and is not playable.  (note: there are some folks having luck with a 3rd-party patch)",
