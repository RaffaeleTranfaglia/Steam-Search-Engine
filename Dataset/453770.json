            "review_text": "Although I'm not a huge Solitaire fan, I really do like this game.  A big part of that for me though is the Day of the Dead theme - here it has been done so well - and has included a great deal of authentic imagery and mythology that it's a must get for anybody who appreciates the culture surrounding this holiday.  Beyond the look - and - feel of the game the gameplay itself is mostly fun. As I said I'm not a huge Solitaire fan but this game has done a nice job of adding in enough variety to keep things interesting. I've probably played less than 1/4 of the way through but have not found anything to be especially challenging - but at the same time I've enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to any Solitaire fans even if they aren't Day of the Dead afficionados.  (I have a large collection of Day of the Dead art and hope to figure out a way to include this game in a small video frame of some type on the shelves with the rest of my collection!)",
