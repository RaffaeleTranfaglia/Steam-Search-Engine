The aim of the game is to collect all the shiny stars by manipulating the size and height of the central block. This is done by left or right mouse clicks, plus moving the mouse up or down. It's tricky to get used to but it'll soon be intuitive to you.  The music is great and I love the way the screen twists around while you are moving through the 'corridor'.  Nice work!",
