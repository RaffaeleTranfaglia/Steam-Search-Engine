            "review_text": "If you played any door games in the past, such as Trade Wars, Legend of the Red Dragon, Tele-Arena, and various other games played on BBSes, or later MUDs in the beginning of the internet, then do yourself a favor, and buy this right now, you don't need to read further.  I'm such a person. I played lots of door games, had a BBS myself, and been active on various BBSes for a good number of years, starting with a 2400 baud modem and going all the way up to 56k, then broadband.  I saw SanctuaryRPG suggested to me, and as soon as I saw the store video, saying this was Steam's first ASCII game, and saw the very nice ASCII graphics indeed, I was sold instantly. I didn't looked up the reviews, nor checked the forums, I didn't even expanded the more info on the game. I just bought it.   So when I tried it, I had the biggest surprise of my life... this game is pure genius. Only with a text game you could come up with such a brilliant, deep, very deep, combat system. Yeah, you heard me right, this text game has better combat than all graphic games out there. And yet, you see nothing of the combat itself. I won't spoil it, but it's real good.  Don't be fooled, its no rogue-like in the common sense, you aren't a letter on a grid, and move one square at a time, with enemy moving after you. This is played more like traditional door games. Not MUDs tho. You don't move with directions. The rogue part is the permadeath, tho you can play softcore. But I highly recommend you play the way its intended, classic with permadeath.  The chip tunes soundtrack is very good and totally fit the game.   I'm currently the owner of a tavern, serve drinks to customers, entertain them by smashing potatos on top of my head, amongst various other things, and sometimes they give me a gift, or leave :)   Still reading? Go buy it now!",

I've enjoyed-the-hell out of this thusfar - my only real complaint would be that it's perfect tablet material but control system which kinda requires a whole keyboard and there's no many ways around that...  If you like the look of it - the odds are you'll like the game more tho - and there's a DEMO so, chop chop, try it!!",

            "review_text": "The silly cousin of Diablo made with ascii art and a epic soundtrack. That sounds pretty awesome and trust me, it is!  SanctuaryRPG is a game envisioned and programmed by a single person. You start of this game creating a character. Selecting between various races/classes/weapon styles and more. After that you'll select between hardcore mode (die once and you lose your character) or casual mode. Then your adventure starts into this wacky ascii world filled with enemy encounters, silly dialogue and lot of random loot. Just like in Diablo you will get that feeling of glee when you find another epic or even legendary piece of equipment.  Graphicly the game is .. text based. I grew up past the whole textbased era of games but for it only being text it looks good. For me it doesn't add or detract anything to the game.  The music is a great feature of this game. Every tune just fits the scene. For example the blacksmith theme has a blacksmith hammer clanging with the tune and it sounds awesome. There are a lot of various battle themes (all of them sound great) which is important because you will be battling 80% of your time in the game.  One of the things I disliked about the game was how you lose all progress when you die. Ofcourse that's normal in a roguelike game, but deaths can be very random and the game isn't short. I got past act 1 on a 2,5 hour play session, was feeling very strong only to die by a random encounter. After you restart you get the slow unlocking of abilities and story arc again and they are the same every time, so that can get a bit tedious.  I haven't finished the game yet, don't know if I ever will (random stuff can and will kill you eventually, it seems) but what I have played so far is a lot of fun and I can feel the passion that creators have put into this project.",

You will love this game until you are defeated by an enemy and realize you have to start at square one, no matter how much time you have put into your character. I think some games are fine with perma-death, but this game isn't one of those games. SanctuaryRPG is way too big and expansive to have perma-death. I know that there is a softcore mode, but that mode makes it way too easy as their is very little punishment for dying contrary to what the mode description says. I would give this game a 9/10 or maybe even 10/10 if it wasn't for the permanant death. I'll still reccomend this game because there is still a lot of fun to be had, just be ready to lose everything when you die in SanctuaryRPG.  6/10",

The ASCII presentation reminds me of old dial-up BBS door games, but the story and combat go beyond arcadey games like those. Combat is a strategic balance of managing your resources (damage, health, mana, debuffs) while whittling away at your foe. Combat is combo-based and you're rewarded for long chains of attacks which tempt you into fighting without healing. Permadeath makes the game more exciting since it encourages you to take risks.  Quite a deep game despite the deceptively simplistic presentation. Very compelling and detailed, plus it's got a sense of humour. Great game!",

The combat mechanic first looks like you just need to spam '1 2 3 3 1 2 3 3' all over again, but once you reach New Game + and go into Inferno, you'll need to learn how to use the combat mechanics and will see that they are actually very well made and in depth.  Crafting mechanics are pretty boring and grindy, but it still is a plus to be able to craft and retrieve crafting materials  In short,awesome RPG for every potatoes out there.",

This is the first ASCII rpg I've played, so a lot of the things I like probably just go with the genre.    Options  'You wanna go over there? Sure Oh lookie, a stone! You... want to eat it? Sure I guess.. Whoops, looks like that wasn't so good!' You get loads of minor choices when playing, most are irrelevant, but they're very entertaining :)   Complex  The system is more complex than I thought it would be. This means the first few runs will mostly be of learning the game mechanics and reading, reading tons of info about what how when everything. Once you start getting the hang of it though all speeds up.   Brutal  About speeding it up... you have to watch out, the game can be brutal and one-shoot you before you realise what happened. Learning how to tweak your stats and how to pace the story progression is vital. And this is just in normal mode.   Music  Great variation of animated bit-like tunes. Tons of sound effects for the different actions/events.   OS  As of this review the game is only available for windows. But good news! It works flawlessly with wine :)   Overall  If you like rogues, buy it, it's that simple. If you get frustrated easily or are quick give up then this might not be the game for you.",

The hard part is surviving and winning. Ugh! It's like 0-60 in a matter of minutes. One minute you're feeling pretty good about defeating enemies and the next you're screaming obsenities because that enemy just killed you even though you had more than half your health, all because it blinded you, froze you, and made it so you could use one attack and oh whoops, that one just so happened to be the one that lets you regain health.  Or maybe I just suck. I dunno. Anyway, it's a fantastic game and you should definitely give it a shot if you're looking for something old but new to play.   P.S.

After nearly 5 hours of playtime on just the demo, I grudgingly (and happily) have to admit that I couldn't be more wrong. This is an interesting and excellent game that reminds me of what would happen if Zork, Aniwey's CandyBox, and Kingdom of Loathing made a freaky three-way lovechild that has a bizarre obsession with potatoes.   PROS + Fun and engaging retro-esque gameplay + Demands your attention during battle, unlike a lot of turn-based RPGs where you can just autoattack your way to victory + Quirky and goofy sense of humor + Really good music + Potatoes  WASHES = Challenging and punishing, like most roguelikes seem to be. I find this enjoyable personally but be warned! = ASCII graphics. I don't mind much personally since they're fairly well done, but YMMV.  CONS - Heavy RNG reliance and it often bites you in the butt (example: I'm playing a Paladin. One of the class 'perks' is you deal 25% less damage unless you have a Heavy shield. After about 2 hours into the game, I've found dozens of Light and Medium shields but no Heavy!) - Pretty dense information-wise, definitely has a bit of a learning curve. Doesn't help that the official wiki is pretty sparse on some details.   On the whole: Extremely engaging for any dungeon crawler looking to delve back into the 'good old days' with a little text-based romp. Very, very good for the price.",

Ok, continue//  This game presents me with loads of PTSD from my hours with Zork but here; you're given s o m e t h i n g to project unto. SRPG is an ASCII game that's part rougelike, part RPG, part DND, and part 'magic is still the best' It gives you a story it does, but it also allows you to go exploring in the various areas you walk through. Its also got a sense of humor, which is nearly suprising but I couldn't tell you why.  Its really really hard on the eyes and presents you with walls of text to try to pick through. Kinda like my reviews. The music is music. Its not incredible, The graphics are ASCII and are moderatly impressive, if only because I could'nt manage to do it.  Good luck trying to figure out how much acid it takes to get the 'blue slime' to actually look like what a slime would look like. ASCII isn't the best for amorphous blobs like that. Faces look really silly to me but that's really not the point.   Should you get this game? Yes. Experience it. Don't play it with a headache though.  7/10",

The mechanics that are used are superbly designed and allows for a deeper tactical experience than your typical JRPG/Rougelike. The controls are surprisingly fluid (for what kind of game this is) and acute. I could go on and on about how it broke every negative expectation I had going into it.  So long story short is this: Don't be intimidated by it's archaic overtones; it's only a year old. Don't think this is a 'mash 'attack' to win JRPG'; it's more than that.  I'm just sucked into this simple little game. I'll update the review once I've played more.",
