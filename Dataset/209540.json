            "review_text": "Strike Suit Zero is a space flight combat game and takes its inspiration from numerous different franchises, most notably Homeworld, Freelancer, Colony Wars, Star Wars, Gundam, Macross and Freespace. As a huge fan of Mecha animes and space combat in general i just have to love this game. Just finished it and sadly its not that long, but maybe there will be some cool dlcs. Pick it up if it goes on sale, right now its not worth its full money, sadly. Its a good game, but they could have done better, for example entering huge ships and destroy them from the inside would have been awesome. Lets hope for good DLCs or other devs that grab that idea.",

            "review_text": "I will recommend this game but extremely cautiously as you'll have to be an arcade FPS flight fan. If steam had a 'so-so' button, I would choose that over a thumbs up. I enjoy this genre but I have a feeling majority won't. I should also mention you cannot freely fly around in space. You may freely fly around the battlefield.   You are a fighter pilot from United Nations of Earth versus galactic colonies. Generally, you will be assigned minor to major roles as the battle rages on. This may include taking out turrets, specific ships or guarding one of your own friendlies. As you fight, your teammates will be doing their own thing against the enemy. This is a neat concept but the game didn't go as in-depth as it could have. Essentially, you can change your targeting system to whomever you'd wish at any moment but unless your specifically supposed to take out 7 enemy fighters, you'll have no idea how many enemies are left.   The game controls themselves are okay. The rolling feature is okay but doesn't feel extremely effecting in dodging opponents fire. The flying itself takes a bit of time to get used to. Once you are accustomed to the style, most likely you will excel in the art. There are no cool gimmicks to do loop-to-loops like Star Fox or any crazy barrel rolls. Boost at least was included as well as a feature to 'brake'. They did add an arsenal of weapons to choose from. The basic weapon given is an energy weapon in which you can choose to shoot it rapidly over time or all in one burst. This weapon needs time to cool down in order to be fired efficiently again. Pressing the D-pad to the right will switch from an energy weapon to a chain-gun/machine gun sort of weapon. I personally like this one as the enemies health can quickly degrade. Missiles are another feature within the game. These can also be changed given what you like most or what you deem important for certain missions. Upon completing a few missions, the player will be given the opportunity to use other ships and even transform their ship into a space mech. The space mech can only be used when the player accumulates enough flux from landing their shots on enemies. Upon pressing A to transform, the mech utilizes it's own special set of weapons and missiles that can literally fire at many targets. This is a high light feature of the game. Overall, the flying experience is pleasurable and the combat experience is mediocre at best.   The visuals are very nice and use somewhat of a luminescent look. The sounds are decent as well as the dialogue. There isn't much variance when it comes to explosions or when weapons are being fired. A cockpit view as well as a ship view is available to choose from which is greatly appreciated!  As I've stated, a few people may find this game exceptional while others may stop playing a few missions in. It is fun, but it can feel like a grind after a while doing the similar missions over and over. I also found the difficulty to sort of jump at times.    RATING : 6.85/10       Gameplay   C+     Story / Campaign   B     Visuals / User Interface   B     Sounds / Music   C+     Replay-ability   C+     Overall    C+       ScreenShots :",

            "review_text": "This game suffers of death by a thousand cuts  At first, i was very much taken in. There aren't many space games anymore so it was nice to have one. The presentation of the game was nice, with voice acting for important characters, and the combat was decent (even though the controls are extremely clunky).  However, after a few hours of fun, you start noticing the many problems this game has : - Dogfighting is almost inexistant. It's so hard to aim, you're better off using homing missiles to blast small ships. - Since small ships are not much more than flies, you keep encountering middle-sized or big ships to make it an actual game, but the number of different ships is very limited, so the game soon gets very repetitive, blasting one big ship after another one. - Also, the arcade gameplay means you can crash into a space station of a big ship, and you will only lose your shield, which soon regenerates. I don't ask for a strict simulation, but this is too much on the arcade side. You have no fear of big ships or close fly by, because the worst that can happen is losing your shield temporarily - The HUD is a complete mess. All enemies icons are the exact same red. A big ships can have 10 or even 20 icons on her, because there is one icon per gun. So unless you get way too close, you usually are never sure what the heck you're actually shooting at. You can't even make out the difference between a fighter and a gun of a capital ship. - The sound effects are highly annoyings. Low health ? You get a constant beeping sound. Being targetted by missile ? another slightly different beeping sound. You locking-in on another target ? ANOTHER beeping. And you have to listen to theses constant beeps very closely because you have to notice the 'being targetted by a missile' sound (you have to use your EMP at the right moment to avoid it). That constant beeping is driving me nuts. - And finally, the checkpoints. Born Read Games said they wanted the game to be difficult. Well, spacing out checkpoints, while reloading all ammo (making it easy to choose the low ammo, high damage weapons), and refilling all health wasn't the way to go. Especially when all checkpoints are in the 'dead' moments of the gameplay. Usually reloading a checkpoint means you have to suffer through 2-5 min of nothing much happening, before finally getting to the part that is actually giving you problem. More checkpoints, but no health/ammo reloads would have made the game much more enjoyable, and maybe even more difficult.  I will stop that list here. There are other smaller issues, but i don't want to flog the dead horse again and again. Especially since i wanted to like this game, and actually enjoyed the first few hours on it.  On the whole, Born Ready Games had good intentions, and i know they had a limited budget, so they probably couldn't do everything they wanted with the game. However, there are way too many small things that make the game annoying, repetitive, and just a chore to finish on any difficulty except easy (which is way too easy).",

            "review_text": "Another day, another Kickstarter. This time it’s Born Ready Games and their first foray into the space combat genre with single-player-fighter-turns-into-mech game: Strike Suit Zero. Raising $174,804 with the goal of $100,000 and achieving the stretch goal of mod tools, Strike Suit Zero is another shining example of what crowd funding can do for small time developers. Strike Suit Zero—or SSZ—is a space combat game similar to classics like Tie Fighter and the Wing Commander series, but with one big caveat: you can turn your fighter into an anime styled mech.   You take on the role of Adams, a faceless, voiceless pilot who has apparently fallen out of favor with his superiors. You have to earn the trust of your commanders and comrades in order to be allowed to take the helm of a fighter again. You know, a real rebel story, where you’re Starbuck and everyone else is completely incompetent. The story hinges on some cliché elements, like a woman fused with an AI construct, a commander searching for his white whale, and Adams being the chosen one, all of which are totally mismanaged and telegraphed from the get-go.  You spend most of the game with your wingman and commanding officer, Reynolds. She’s a fiery, but effective, leader who will deliver such witty monotone one-liners as, “You know the drill, Adams” and “I’ve got your back.” It’s unfortunate that the voice actor seems as if she’s taken twelve Ambien and just wanted to go sleep instead of offering a moderately appealing performance. That seems par for the course when it comes to all the voice acting in the game. There was plenty of opportunity to use the voice work tactfully, but for some reason the best mechanical use is, “They’re going after Adams.” This line is repeated constantly with no context and sometimes no real reason other than to fill quiet time. It’s unfortunate that Born Ready Games didn’t seize more opportunities to use voice chatter as a mechanic rather than ambiance that breaks immersion and falls flat.    Mechanically, the game is pretty simple: cycle targets, shoot targets, win the game. It’s fun for a while, but becomes repetitive. Missions are long and don’t vary much. You’ve got the typical escort, kill, bombing run, and capital ship battles that are tried and true tropes of the genre. You can unlock new weapons by earning medals and special objectives, but you really don’t need to grind in order to progress. There’s nothing really new or earth shattering, either. The controls work well, but you’ll likely find a flight stick or gamepad better-suited to gameplay than a mouse and keyboard.  The defining disappointment though, is the very thing that separates the game from the rest of the genre. The mech—also known as Strike Suit—is incredibly underwhelming and mostly boring to use. You gain a resource called Flux, which powers the fighter’s Strike Suit mode by dealing damage to enemies, thrusting, or taking damage. Think of it as a rage meter from World of Warcraft. You use Flux each time you shoot or fire rockets from Strike Suit mode. You can gain Flux while meched out, but the amount is reduced greatly in order to get you to use it more strategically. It just feels like the mech could use more unique abilities beyond shooting and firing rockets to make it more appealing.    If there is one thing SSZ does well, it’s visuals. The space-boxes are beautiful and do a great job of immersing you in the universe. You really feel like you’re in space, dog fighting, looping, and bombing. The ships are all nicely rendered and have a distinct visual style inspired by countless space operas and animes.  If you’re into future-tech animes and flight combat games, you should have plenty of fun playing SSZ. If you like the idea of a fighter that transforms into a mech and expect to get something out of that, you’ll be disappointed. Only around one third of the thirteen missions feature the Strike Suit, which you don’t even use in the first couple of hours. There’s about 5-6 hours of content though, so you will get decent bang for your buck. If that’s not enough for you, there’s always Freespace 2 and the mass of mods being made to this very day.  This review was based on a day one retail copy of the PC version of Strike Suit Zero developed by Born Ready Games",

            "review_text": "Strike Suit Zero is a sweet space battle action shooter.  Compatible with Oculus Rift, the well opimized animations and graphics give the player a good sense of diving into the emptiness of space right into the faces of enemies riping them apart with canons, missles and torpedos. A great variety of types of ships will make you set priorities on your targets in order to keep the allied fleet alive. From fighter ships to huge Frigates and Titanic space carriers. The targeting system is awesome, the explosions are nicely tone, you can even see the debris left behind from the ships killed. The battles are impresive and well set. The game also introduces you to a great feature which is getting a ship that can transform into a mecha, changing your movements into vertical and shoot some kinda AA Gatling canons that rip your enemies into shreds.   2 things i didn't like on this game.",

            "review_text": "This game is getting way to much hate, hence the reason I felt writing this review, since it has caught my heart as being one of the best space flight shooters I've ever played together with that PS1 game back inte the days, what was it called let me look up... ah yes, Colony Wars, awesome game.  So there seems to be a lot of complaints about the difficulty of the game. Let be break it down to you, the type of incompetent people that like achievements nonetheless that brought WoW from the glory of its TBC days to the disgrace of post WotLK days, are also the same type of people complaining about the difficulty of this game. If you're one of those people, stay away from this game, and any other game that has an exceptional potential for stimulating gameplay, because we don't want you ruining them.  Else, you'll have an absolutely thrilling experience as the game progresses. I still have fond meomeries of the intense, adrenaline rushing and stimulating gameplay as the story and missions kept escalating. The finish was awesome, as were the extra missions added by DLC, especially the 'Impossible Mission'.  The music adds an amazing atmosphere and works well with the graphics and artstyle, creating a great experience beyond just merely the gameplay.  Now there are only two downsides.  The first being optimization for the final mission, which they might have fixed or at least improved since I last played it, which was quite a while ago. The second is that, since the experience is so great, it also feels a bit short, although having some replay value due to its stimulating gameplay.  All in all, I'd love to see a sequal, building upon the good that this game already has and improving it even further.  Pros: (+) Stimulating, exciting and escalating combat and gameplay. (+) Great music. (+) Nice atmosphere. (+) Sufficiently good story.  Cons: (-) Possibly lingering optimization problem for final mission. (-) Would be great if the game was considerably longer.",

They get unlocked throughout the missions. You get new weapons the same way.  You are always moving forward, but you can slow down a bit when holding S and speed up when holding W. You shoot and aim with mouse. You have armor (your HP basically- depleted means death), thruster (short speed up - the max speed you can achieve) and shield (your second HP bar - it regenerates when not taking damage; depleted means that your armor can be damaged).  3 difficulties - easy - should be medium if you ask me; medium - this is hard; hard - not trying this one. NOPE.  This game is hard. They place upgrades behind challenges. You are weak if you dont get the upgrades. You won't be able to progress without them. I am not a fan of these space games so it might be me.   When you complete a mission, the game shows you your score and gives you a medal, a new weapon and an upgrade if you have completed the challenge. Weapons and upgrades are not tied to the difficulty, so you can only get them once. However, scores and medals are.  I hate the challenges! 'destroy all torpedos shot at the carrier'- you are supposed to defend the ship called The Carrier, but there are small ships shooting at you and the carrier. There are 3 bigger ships shooting regular rockets, missiles and torpedos and then one giant ship shooting multiple torpedos, missiles, rockets at you and the carrier. It's one big cluster♥♥♥♥ of rockets and you are supposed to destroy all of the torpedos and the ships! I have destroyed about 70 torpedos and still ♥♥♥♥in' failed the challenge!

Graphics are good (1920x1200, graphics options maxed out), but not outstanding. The engine handles the big fights with lots of ships and explosions at the same time very well, with almost no framedrops. Would be nice though if the background had a higher resolution.  Controls are very intuitive, but there is quite a learning curve to use the ship optimally. I see some people complaining on the web about (lack of) checkpoints, but there are plenty in my view. About 2 or 3 checkpoints in every mission (missions take 10-30 min), you can't manually save however. Storyline is not that great, but who cares, you get to blow up fighters, bombers, frigates and sometimes even cruisers, and lots of them! You can also fly in realistic in 3 dimensions, meaning you are not stuck in a sort of 'plane' that some space games have.   Personally I like the soundtrack that comes with the game, but that is of course very subjective.   One thing irritates me bit though, the game has a lot of very loud explosions.

Then I lowered the sensitivity of strike suit mode to match that of the ship. After that the gameplay opened up and I must say that it is now smooth like butter. Nothing is more satisfying than whizzing around a capital ship in strike suit mode and stripping away all of its turrets leaving it as a defenseless husk ready to be taken down.

            "review_text": "Strike Suit Zero is a fairly pretty but poorly executed game. Little thought was put into what makes a game fun rather than frustrating. You will most likely spend half of the game trying to accommodate its awkward control layout and the other half regenerating your shields.  The controls aren't at all natural. It will take a few levels until you learn to adjust to the clumsiness of it all. Once you do you'll immediately be hit with a completely different control scheme as the 'Strike Suit' mechanic comes into play, turning your space ship into a powerful mech warrior. The transition between control schemes is jarring and hard to get used to, I'm not sure I'll ever really be comfortable with the switch.  There will be times when the enemy A.I. will play dirty and seemingly cheat. They are incredibly accurate and agile, with the ability to stay directly out of your line of sight no matter how fast you turn. They can manage to fire directly at you at a 90 degree angle from hundreds of metres away and hit every shot. They will also often fly in groups, sometimes four or five abreast, in order to take you down. Meanwhile your team mates are miles away fighting their own one-on-one battles.  When the time comes that a mission requires you to carry an extremely valuable payload with a disadvantaged vehicle, you will often have to 'lone wolf' the entire mission. On the other hand, when you're in a capable enough vehicle, you're often tasked with protecting similar ships in similar circumstances. For some reason when it's your turn there is no one around to help which is incredibly unfair as you're left to pick off the enemy one by one with a less than capable ship when it shouldn't have to be your job.",

Strike Suit Zero has a good story and can be entertaining at points however those are the only positives I can state about this game.. If you are to get this game.. get it on sale..

Robot mode lets you turn a lot quicker, and it can lock onto lots of targets at once. Highly useful. However, the game (so far) doesn't have some of the stuff I miss from Freespace, like missiles designed to take out specific ship systems. Pretty good for an inexpensive game.

The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2. It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.  Worse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships. When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.   The game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.

There is a decent difficulty curve to the game at first and you can adjust it. There's also the ability to upgrade your ships by means of completing challenges in each level. This kind of adds a certain difficulty as well because you have to pay attention to what you're doing. The player also has to select their loadout at the start of each level and based on what they will be facing, you have to be calculative as to what is ultimately chosen. I got through the game at a decent pace around 10-12 hours with 13 missions total, which is pretty good for a game in this genre. There's also a scoring system in the game which attributes to the player getting service medals. The higher the performance in the level, the better the medal awarded. If you can pick this game up around 10-15 bucks, it's a pretty good deal. I don't think everyone should pay the 20 it is at now for regular price because there are many other games better suited for that change, if you're going to cough it up, and not everyone appreciates this niche of gaming.",

(DLC isn't worth buying unless on sale)  -Achievements are hard to obtain for some missions (further discouraging play). -EASY to get lost within missions due to their vast size, hard (often impossible) to tell 'up' from 'down'.   Other: -Voice acting could be better. -Game could greatly benefit more ingame (outside of mission) content (ex: ingame model viewer)  -Could use better camera options.  -Could use better oriented DLC (ex: a strike suit that has higher performance for more diffictult situations) -Could use better story eliments and detail. -Would GREATLY benefit if a 'Free Mode' was added (ex: free flight to just fly around, no objectives) -Multiplayer CO-OP would GREATLY help with difficult gameplay plus VS.

It's a pretty repetitive space shooter with a nice visual flair to it. The call backs to many different space genres of cartoons and games is nice but it's shallow and not too engaging. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have $5 to spare and are very bored at the moment.",

            "review_text": "I did not recommend this game for a few reasons:  First reason: No multiplayer. I think this game, with tweaking, could be good for multiplayer, but that doesn't seem to be on the horizon yet. However, if you're more of a single-player type person, this point need not apply to you.  Second reason: Does not offer a demo. At least what I could find. This game, at the time of this writing, is on sale %75, and I bought the entire Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle for $9.99. However, that's ten bucks I could have saved had I tried a demo first.  Third reason: Not what I thought it was going to be like. Let me elaborate on this a little. First, it was my clumsy fault that I didn't notice that this game didn't support multiplayer. Some of you may remember playing a little Microsoft Studios game called Freelancer, which was an amazing spaceflight game. If you're looking for a game like that, this isn't it. I completed the first mission, and sadly to say I got kinda bored; too bored in fact to finish the second mission.  Overall, the game and its graphics are nice. I wish I had a nicer graphics card to take advantage of the wonderful effects I could see in the trailers. However, the gameplay is very repetitive with little reward.",

Game starts off a bit slow, but picks up after mission 3 once you get the Strike Suit. The game can spike in difficulty very randomly, but never to the point of impossibility. The only thing I would hold against it is the bonus upgrades. Some of them ask you to complete a secondary objective of some sort. However, many of these objectives go against actually doing well on the mission. Very often, when I replayed the mission to get the secondary objective, I ended up doing far worse rating wise then I did just playing the mission normally.  All in all, a fantastic dog-fighting, large-scale, space combat game and well worth the price of $20. Even better when it's on sale.",
