    "description": "In Super Flippin' Phones, you flip phones out of people's hands to warn them about an impending disaster. Unfortunately, no one in the mall is listening to you because they're too busy with their phones. While slapping away phones you evade cops, save humanity and unlock new officers, floors and outfits!",
