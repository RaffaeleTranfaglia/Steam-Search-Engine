Worth the 4-6 hours needed to read, you'll probably want at least one re-read as well. Very good for such new devs.  Only downside is none of the backgrounds feature CG from the game beyond backgrounds, really wish one was the fire wave one.",

The artworks pleasing, the soundtrack is 'VERY' good.(seriously, I bought it), and it gives a lot of accurate and strong references to old 1980-1990's Nostalgia. This will at times take you back to the past with some of its references...  It also presents an accurate depiction of the dangers of Highway rest stops. As I can attest to from personal experience. Seriously, those places suck.  A great buy even without discount.",

            "review_text": "This is the first time I'm doing a review on Steam but I feel the game deserves it after this emotional rollercoaster ride.  Let me start off by saying that I am generally not a big fan of VN's. Most of them don't manage to keep my attention for long enough, be it due to bad writing, boring characters or scenes that drag on for too long.  Highway Blossoms however get's everything right. The dialogues are well written and at times witty. The characters are interesting, likeable and relatable and the development they go through, especially Amber, will keep you interested from start to finish.  The overall story offers a sense of adventure, comedy, action, drama and romance.  The artstyle for both the scenery as well as the characters is unique and gorgeous.  One of the things that stand out the most for a VN like Highway Blossoms is the Soundtrack. It's something worth listening to outside of the game, but it also makes the game shine. It makes you appreciate the story even more and gets you so much more involved in the context of the story.  For both VN lovers as well as those that have never played an VN before or even those that so far weren't impressed by regular VN's I'd highly suggest giving this game a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "During the Steam Sale I mass bought a bunch of VNs and Highway Blossoms was easily the best.  The characters were relatable and interesting. Even the tertiary characters managed to be very memorable.  The relationship was believable because the story took its time instead of just jumping into it. Although this came at the cost of blue balling the reader at least 4 times, pehaps more depending on who you ask.  There aren't any choices that lead to multiple endings or anything but there really didn't need to be. The story is already quite long and entertaining.  Also the music was quite good had a spaghetti western feel to it which I liked. Reminded me of a movie that liked when I was a kid. Can't remember the name of it sadly.  But the very best part was the lack of weeb pandering. It takes place in the American Southwest and doesn't mention Japan once and that is a breath of fresh air.  There were a couple of minor things that niggled at me while I played. I thought the MC was around age 23 when she was introduced but it turns out she's 19 and they even directly address that she seems older than she is which kind of bugged me. Also the MC never specifically mentions she's a lesbian. I do actually kind of like how they didn't make a big deal out of it and you can figure it out by yourself pretty quick by the way she checks out nearly every woman she encounters. But still one sentence saying 'I never was into boys.' or something to that effect would have been nice.  The biggest weakness of the story though would have to be that it tries to be sad at times but it's REALLY bad at it. I'd give detail but I don't really want to spoil anything. I'm a sucker for tearjerking moments and stuff too, so for me not to be phased it must mean a lot.  Still definetely worth the buy. I got it during a sale but I would have gotten it at full price just to support the people who made it.",

            "review_text": "Highway Blossoms was an enjoyable read, if not without its share of faults. The lead characters, Amber and Marina, are both likeable, their interactions together often cute, and many of their quips genuinely amusing. Having the story set not only in the United States but not in a high school was a breath of fresh air. Although I can’t say I’ve played a huge number of visual novels the premise of road trips is interesting and unlike anything I’ve seen since Katahane.  That being said, the story is at its strongest when it is not being a discount National Treasure. The treasure hunt plot felt unnecessary in the long run, and the story could have easily been a sightseeing tour on the way to California, finding the beauty in nature and growing closer without the motivation of money (still, I can see the treasure hunt being a metaphor and the actual treasure not being anything gold). There is also some drama in the tail-end of the story that is resolved far too quickly and cleanly.   Despite these faults I can still recommend this to anyone looking for a yuri-themed visual novel. The music was above average compared to anything else I’ve heard in the genre, and despite there being no voice acting the characters are highly expressive even thorugh static sprites, which often move around the screen to give the impression of animation. The artwork for the sprites is quite good, but the CG art is inconstant, some of them giving Amber noticeably shorter hair than she has.   Pros: +Great characters  +Good music +Unconventional setting  Cons: -Story feels unfocused at times -Inconsistent art",

Besides that I usually am not a big fan of visual novels, including the fact that this game is more of a kinetic novel, because you don't make choices yourself, you just sit back and take in the story. I wasn't sure first, but while I was putting all the games into my cart in summer sale I was like 'why the hell not' (it was -15% too). Surprisingly this is the first game I played after the summer sale and i totally didn't regret it, even though it was a wise idea to play it at night with everybody asleep if you know what I mean!  First of all it's logical that this game kinda speaks to me with the homosexual protagonist, so there was a reason I should at least enjoy this game a bit (which I totally did!).  I am not experienced with visual novels, but i think the game and gameplay is kept quite simple, which doesn't bother if you've got nothing against some reading and sinking into the story. I DID sink into the story a lot, it's really nice and cute and so funny, i can't tell how many times I had to pull myself together not bursting into laughter afraid of waking up my parents! I got really attached to the characters, which made me kinda sad to see it end. The game took be about 8 hours to finish it. I also love the soundtrack, it gives everything the right mood! I especially love the acoustic guitar tracks, made me feel 'dem feels. And also the artwork is super lovely, kept taking screenshots even though you get a gallery after finishing it. To sum it up in a very subjective way, the game is so lovely and funny it is really worth playing it when you are into yuri! So if you are ready to enjoy a nice short and emotional ride on the yuri motorhome on some good ol' american highways then just go for it!",
