            "review_text": "A very good yuri VN that requires the player to be observant and apply some detective skills. One of my favourite things is the score, especially the piano-driven tracks that play at certain times. It compliments the art style so well too.   The characters are also well written and (for the most part) likeable. The protagonist is quite timid, but she's clever and empathetic. I never really found her behavior frustrating. The romance scenes take some work to get to, but they're very nice.  If I had to give some complaints, there's still a few typos and errors in the translation at the time I'm writing this. Also, some of the choices don't make a whole lot of sense. For example, choosing option 1 at a certain point might improve the relationship potential for character A, despite there being no logical reason why it's relevant at all.  Another thing people may not initially realise - this is actually just part 1 of a 4 game series. The game still follows it's own dramatic arc, but the ending doesn't come with total closure.",

            "review_text": "So, here it is, the most anticipated Yuri Visual Novel developed by Innocent Grey is finally on steam, Flowers -Le volume sur printemps- . I finished the game several days ago, I'm planning to write the review after finishing both route but hei... i can update this review later right? before we get into the review, you might also want to skip the entire review and read the pros and cons at the end of the review.... just in case you guys can't understand my english. Alright let's not prolong my boring chat and go straight to review shall we?  ========================================== Story : 9/10 ========================================== Flowers -Le volume sur printemps- or Flowers -The volume of Spring- is an School Romance/Yuri Visual Novel where the reader will experience the love story of Suoh Shirahane (A girl with stunning beauty but also an quiet, anxious, timid girl) in a Japanese Catholic School. Story Presentation in Flowers is in Episodic Format or separated into few Chapter, there's 8 Chapter total (7 in non-canon route) where most of the chapter focused on character getting themself into certain conflict and there's minigame where you need to solve those conflict. The Story is well written each chapter where the character build their romance through action bit by bit not because the director said so, not only that but this Visual Novel also have good melodrama inside, so expect the feels train.  Now let's talk about the route, there's 2 route/heroine to choose one canon/Mayuri Kousaka and one non-canon/Hanabishi Rikka, remember how Suoh personalities i mention earlier? quiet, anxious, timid girl, the route you choose will determine Suoh personalities in the future, if you choose canon route Suoh will be more confident person meanwhile in non-canon route, Suoh will remain... well, same as before. I haven't read the non-canon route and i don't want to spoil the story in canon route, so here's my though about the canon route, it's amazing but ended with 'disapointment' and the chapter 7 is kinda dumb, it feel forced to resolve the conflict at that time.  Character : 10/10 ========================================== Now here's the first good part of the character in this Visual Novel, This visual novel introduce you Suoh Shirahane as the main character alongside the two main heroine and several side character, with the small cast character the writer could use every character potetial to maximum and yeah they manage to do that, every character is well written and developed really well include the side character, they feel realistic (not plot-device and not '2D character in term of story), you never knew what stuff they going to pull, everyone is unexpected in this Visual Novel. That's what the make the character here realistic and interesting, you also might find the character is annoying/un-likeable but that's what make the character them a good character.  ========================================== Art/Grapich : 10/10 ========================================== Second good part of the visual novel, The artstyle is gorgeous (thanks Sugina Miki), the character sprites is amazing, the CG is beautiful and tempting There's a lot of Visual Novel where you fap to H-Scene or Character, however this one... you can fap to it's artstyle.   ========================================== Music/Sound : 10/10 ========================================== Third good part of this Visual Novel. You love piano? then you'll love the soundtrack in this Visual Novel Too bad they didn't sell the OST as DLC :(  ========================================== Enjoyment : 10/10 ========================================== I really enjoy this Visual Novel, Great Story, Solid Character, Amazing Art, Beautiful and Calming Soundtrack What else not to enjoy?  ========================================== CONCLUSION ========================================== + Great Story + Each Character is developed really well, include the side character + Likeable and Interesting Character + Melodrama + Stunning Artstyle + Beautiful Soundtrack + Rikka Hanabishi - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minigame - Non-canon route is locked, you need to finish the game on canon route first before unlocking it - Sequel is not yet released  I recommended this Visual Novel, doesn't matter you love Yuri or not, you have to read it. What are you waiting for, READ IT!! I hope JAST USA release the sequel ASAP *I'll update the review after completing second route and you know, fixing grammar error and make it more easier to understand.",

From the beginning this game draws you to the very end, you can't eat, sleep, think about something else except the story, turns you doing. This game as a Cartagra, Kara no Shoujo or Caucasus, but without violence and sexual content, but it did't made the game worse or something, in oppose it looks like a beautiful fairy tale without tons of depression and blood. I really wait for the next games in serie. 10/10.",

            "review_text": "I'll start off with saying that this is my first review here on steam, so bear with me.  Flowers, Spring chapter, is neither my first visual novel nor the first yuri one. That said, I'm not such huge VN fan, so I can miss some things. The genral first impression has been very much positive for me, though I've been waiting for the game to get localised pretty much since I saw the CGs, which would be not too long after release in Japan. I was quite hyped and I was't disappointed when I finally got to play it.  One might or might not like the OP, but I think it's decent enough, Haruka Shimotsuki does good job with singing, only thing is you might not like the spoilers of sorts.   While in the game, there are plenty of settings, also character-based, so this is all nice. BGM is actually quite immersive and I think it goes especially well with the flow of the story. Character designs are.. yeah, what can I say, they are really nicely done. CGs are as good as they say. They are not overly simplistic and have this certain watercolor look that I personally like quite a lot.   Novel features two main routes but there are lots of choices to be made. I'm playing it without reading too much not to get the spoilers, so from my point of view it seems as some of them are short-branching and others will either push you furhter down your main route or stall the progress a bit. Personally I found the puzzles encountered rather hard to figure out, especially if your knowledge of japanese is limited. I had to do quite a bit of research on what is called 'Hanakotoba' before I got the first major one. If you're not googling walkthroughs, you'll have a bit of fun. I guess this comes with the territory, so I'm not really counting this as a flaw, maybe even the opposite for some.  It all sounds too good, right ? To be honest, there are things I didn't like. The translation does seem a bit weird at times. There are certian parts where I thought the lines were copy-pasted or inappropriately repeated. Not sure if it follows original text, but this seemed wrong. Might update the review later if I see this continues.  All in all this isn't such a major problem to really impact the game or the way the story is told. BGMs and CGs are top-notch and the way you will feel about the game depends mostly on attitude towards such stories. I'd certainly recommend it to most VN fans and a must-have for yuri fans out there !",
