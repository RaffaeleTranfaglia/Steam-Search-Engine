The percentage for health serves no purpose. I stopped providing input halfway through and it just kept going. Waste of an hour.   Do not buy this application.",

Also, I found it's not really neccesary to even do anything so I just let the game float on while I sat back and watched. Drugs are bad.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex Machina 2 takes the original games and ports it across into modern day computing. Recommended for those who played and enjoyed the original as a game of nostalgia. For those who have no idea what the original is like, this game is a short linear story, mildly guided in a simple fashion by the player. Some wonderful music pieces, alongside psychedelic art and narration by the one and only Christopher Lee.   Conclusion: This game is definitely not for everyone. It's really rather more of a short musical story than an interactive game as we know them nowadays.  If you've ever watched the movie 'Enter the Void' and enjoyed it, then you may enjoy this game.   For the Developer; I would also enjoy a Soundtrack of the game to listen to after I've played through the game. :)  (Players experiences may vary depending on the levels of ingested psychedelic drugs.)",
