However, gameplay feels a bit manic and repetitive. Overall, a wonderful remake and the art style does a lot to make the gameplay seem fresh yet retro but never boring.",

The system and upgrades feel natural and its a simple and easy mechanic to get, rewarding the gameplay well.  A good god-game I could say you'll enjoy despite its simpler graphics, and well worth the cost.",

            "review_text": "Main 30 Mission Campaign) complete # About 5 hours # thumb middle (not up or down)  Reprisal Universe is a populus game, basically. A 'god' game, like Black and White (*Sigh). You do not directly control your population, but rather build terrain, summon spells, and influence population and movement.   Pros: - Art style is awesome.  - Interface is sleek and clean - Map/world is almost exactly like populus.  Cons: - Scrolling the map is unecessarily slow. There also doesnt appear to be an option to just drag (like a right click/drag). You use WASD, which is tedious. - The actual playable space on the screen is a fraction of the screen. I can see why they did this, as an ode to populous, but it doesnt really make a lot of sense and the space you COULD have used to see more of the map is not used for no real reason. - Kinda shallow. You spend time either evicting people from their homes to force them to create new ones, which expands terriotory and overall army strengthm or you use powers. The powers look cool, but there isnt really any situation, at least IMO, that any power is particularly useful in a specific situation.  Neutral: I have never failed a mission and i use basically the same techniques each time. The levels dont seem to force you to adjust like most well designed games do. This is a bit of a bummer.",

            "review_text": "A lot of people call this game a Populace clone, but I don't know what populace is and so I'll have to give you an assesment based on its own merits. Reprisal Universe is a fun, fast paced, god simulator title that pits you and your tribe against other tribes. As the god figure for your own little band, it's your job to lead them to victory through manipulation of the terrain and use of your godly powers (conjuring lightning storms, creating volcanos, summoning heroes, ect.). As I said it's fast paced with a typical match lasting from anywhere between seven to fifteen minutes, making it a nice little game to play while taking a break from something else or whenever you're looking to kill a few minutes. That said, I find that it gets a bit repetative and can get old fast. As I said, it's a game you play for short stints not hours on end. It's got a nice pixelated asthetic going on for it as well. I also have to point out that Reprisal Universe doesn't do anywhere nearly enough to explain some of its mechanics, such as what exactly legacy points are (they're points you get for 'Reprising' worlds but beyond that the game gives no hint of what they actually do or mean and good luck trying to find an answer online, I don't think anyone else has a clue either) and what exactly happens when you level up one of your abilities. You can clearly see a progress bar advance, but I haven't noticed leveling up actually effect gameplay at all and I have no idea what stats, if any, have been improved because the game doesn't tell you.  The AI, both of your units and your opponents, is painfully slow on the uptake at times, but can still a moderate degree of challange. If you're looking for a real hardcore experience, however, you'll be disappointed. There is no difficulty adjuster and you can usual beat any mission the game throws at you by you second try if not your first. None have been so difficult that I have had to attempt anything a third time.  I personally recommend this game but please keep in mind everything that I have said above. This game is not without flaws, and although I can look past them because I find this a fun game to play while I wait for something else, I image that not everyone else might be able to.",

Repeat.  You do a lot of flattening. Tons. I tried to get creative and hinder the enemy with mountains or sea. I don't think it was worth the time. Maybe encouraging enemy tribes to fight each other instead of you would work.  I won't bash it hard for $7 and only 2 hours of playtime. It's stylish and fun. It might be great for you. So far, it isn't great for me.",

It has beautiful graphics and is a great break from instense games like CS:GO or TF2.  Don't get me wrong, thinking that this game isnt intense and a walk in the park. IT. IS. NOT. This game is a strategy game, and at the start, you will lose, but don't ragequit. If you're stuck, you can: Isolate your base into an Island. Break all the bridges that the enemy make when they're walking on them (I don't know why but it's really satisfying). Smoke, then throw the molly through tuns (Ok, maybe this isnt accurate but meh). And last but not least: KAMIKAZE EVERYTHIIIIING!!!  PROS: Addicting game. Great experience. Great Break from FPS games. So much content.  Cons: Rage-Inducing. Hard to start off. (Just like my... math homework). Controls a bit difficult at first.  All in all, great game. Shibby rate 0/10 I rate 2/1  I can't math.",

Using your elemental powers, you're meant to terraform your surroundings so that your people can build bigger buildings and produce stronger villagers. Being RTS, it's up to you to decide when to set your opponents on fire, start a flash-storm, turn their village into swampland, etcetera, and when to direct your tribe to focus on expanding, or on taking over utilising manpower, among other strategic options. Lovely pixel visuals, great accompanying soundtrack and all-in-all very well put together, making for a wonderful experience.",
