It's fun damnit, there are a few instances of bad camera angles, but nothing compared to my early experiences with resident evil years ago, I swear people forget what REAL bad camera angels look like. If that game started on steam Resident Evil two would have never been released.  To enjoy this game tou will need:  1. A freind or family member (they don't need to know anything about Warhammer, I used my wife:)  2. To calm the ♥♥♥♥ down! The game can get intense but it's a good intense. It can be enjoyed with some laughter and an acceptance that achivements* (such a B.S.. creation), and max score mean nothing. There are 10 year olds in Japan right now that trippled whatever you'll get anyways.  3. Alchohol, you can even make it a drinking game for whenever you hear 'Brother!' or 'WAAAAGGGGHHH!!!'  4. An appreciation for arcade classics. This is a shootem' up game, that's it. Boom boom, bang mutha flippin bang! It's back story is a 20 second cut sceen, but that's all it needs for what it is.'  8/10 My wife actually loved it and wished it was longer.    ",

            "review_text": "I bought this game first and fore most because this was literally the only game I could find on steam that two people could play simultaneously on the same screen.  This game is plain and simple in it's purpose with its top down 3D approach. The game encompasses your player moving through the map at a steady pace. There is no sprint or dodge, but movement is highly recommended at all times here. What makes it fun is having a buddy to play with, as I couldn't really get into it playing myself. Would I recommend this game? Only on the pretense you're playing co-op. The game is fun, there are characters with their own respective power ups that you can choose from. On top of being able to use your shooting ability, a melee attack is supplemental to what your character has. There is also a power up that your character is able to use given a cool-down or given you pick up a power up laying around the level. Over the course of the game, you unlock different (constant) abilities in which you can decide which one to give your character. For the most part of the game, you will be using one joystick while aiming and firing with another.  The  graphics  are decent, they neither go below or above, simply satisfactory. The  sounds  in game for the guns are sort of meek, and don't provide any exceptional experience for your cochlea.   This game has as much playability if you like the Warhammer series. I found it to be an average game as it doesn't do anything to really separate itself from other games in it's genre.

It's not trying to be DOW1 or 2; there's nothing strategic about this title. But by crikey, there's PLENTY of firepower, and enough Astartes goodness in the shape of Devastator Marine, Assault Marine, Techmarine, or Librarian to provide adequate variety and replay value. Lots of power-ups and unlocks for the hordes of greenskins and tyranids assailing you. Visually beautiful environment and modelling, good sound effects, and includes choice of Imperial Fists, White Scars, Blood Angels, Ultramarines, Salamanders or Blood Ravens Chapters to spread the Emperor's 'benevolence'. Would love to see multiplayer in a future patch. Co-op is a dud - you have been warned. Otherwise, for only $10, well worth the purchase.",

            "review_text": "Kill Team is an isometric shooter set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, where Humanity's last hope rests upon the shoulders of genetically engineered super soldiers defending against xenos and heretics such as Orks, Tyranids, Chaos, and quite a lot more, too. Even if you are not familiar with the universe, you may have some fun with this game. However, if you're big into the lore/tabletop game, you should definitely consider a purchase.  In Kill Team, there are four classes, two melee, two ranged. Although they all practically play the same, it is interesting to experiment with different classes for each mission. Power-ups dot the landscape of each level, which enhance your character for short bursts of time.   The campaign is as you'd expect, run around and blow stuff up real good. Don't buy the game for the story, though. If you're expecting Dickens, you're in for a nasty surprise.  There is also a survival mode, where a relentless wave of enemies charge at you, and you ( and preferably a friend) must push them back. It's mindless fun, but an excellent distraction as you do whatever is in your power to top the leaderboard on your chosen map.  And finally the co-op. It may only be local, but it is great fun when you've got a friend to kill some time with. Just remember you need at least one controller for co-operative play.  Overall, Kill Team is arcade fun only made better by a friend. If you're into Warhammer 40,000 it is definitely worth it.",

Story was cool: There's an Ork ship heading towards an Imperial Forge World. You, as a Space Marine, force yourself into the ship, and must travel along the ship to find and kill the Warboss, and to destroy the ship before it hits the planet. But on you're way, you encounter Tyranids, that the Orks have used to fight and entertain themselves with while they were travelling to a bigger fight.  I recommend getting this game.

If you enjoy the 40k universe and want some simple fun, this is well worth the price of entry. The visuals are respectable, and the sound and voice over is well done. If you buy into this knowing what it is, and if that is an experiece you appreciate then you will enjoy this. I own this on the consoles (both the ps3 and 360 versions), and I am often away from the TV's, so bought it again here on steam because it's just plain fun.",

The voice acting and music are solid, both informative and thematically appropriate. The graphics are serviceable, and the physics interactivity is balanced just right to give weight to the combat without the bounciness Havok can occasionally lead to. It also allows for a bit of strategy, as heavy objects can be moved to provide cover. And the combat feels right, too - the Orks come at you in a tide that feels *almost* - but not quite - unstoppable, the weapon sounds are mostly sufficient, and set dressing crumbles and explodes all over the place.  Add to that well-placed checkpoints, nicely-balanced difficulty curves, a fairly wide range of skins and rather nice level design, and there's a fair amount of game here for a not terribly onerous price.  There are downsides - an anaemic options menu, a lack of mouse control in the menu and slightly sluggish controls in-game, and of course the occasionally infuriating automatic camera - but for this price it's a really fun game for a quick 40K topup in between dinner and bedtime.",

            "review_text": "Kill Team is a decent game, which is first and foremost recommended to the WH40K fanbase (purely for collection at the very worst case scenario if something in this title doesn't fit your liking) as well as any player who loves a simple, straightforward shooter with the top-down camera perspective. Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team has a well designed atmosphere, and by immerging the player into it, the game easily incinerates time at a fast and fascinating pace. Slaying hordes of xenos is what this game is about, and the title says it all. As an action shooter set in a legendary universe where there is only war, Kill Team does a decent job for depicting and brining forth what the 41'st millenium is - Death and Carnage  On the downside, the game does possess a certain feeling of inflexibility to it, a feeling of an old-time shooter which could of been a bit more openworld, but this can be merely my subjective opinion, especially considering the fact that this is a shooter, not an RPG with a freedom of movement and action. Still, always knowing what will happen next, even if this was not inteded to be so by the developers obviously reduces the element of unexpectedness, which for this type of a game is a bad thing. There could have been more weapons, skills (each class of the space marines only has one unique skill, thus making 4 skills in the whole game) and content. The lack of 'flavour', however, does not only affect gameplay; The interface too feels somewhat mediocre in it's seemingly formal minimalism - in this game, you won't find detailed icons of weapons, items or various skills, reducing the interface (which often has an important role of adding a distinct image to the game) to simple text and primitive looking 'buttons'. The enviorment detail of the levels is nearly, if not completely, unchanging throughout all of the game, with minor differences in the palette color and doodads between levels at it's very most. This is justified though, because the game is set on an Ork Kroozer - a galactic warship of leviathan proportions (my apologies for the spoilers).  This game would be so much more immense and awesome if it would have some type of a Team Deathmatch or Deathmatch multiplayer mode, this is where the game would actually shine, and shine bright at that. Alas, this was not to be, because the only closest thing to multiplayer in Kill Team is a 2 player Co-Op mode, by either playing the whole campaign (which consists out of 5 levels, and they aren't that long) or by playing Survival Mode which, to no surprise, is about survival against endless hordes of greenskins. Again, there could have been more levels, but there isn't enough proportional content, and if the game would be, let's say, twice as long, then it would simply become stale and repetative. Out of the other, more minor downsides, sometimes the camera angle becomes annoying, with the player having no possibility to rotate or alter it in any way whatsoever.  Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team, in my opinion is a good, absorbing game which should undoubtedly be played and experienced by any WH40K fan, with it's atmosphere and it's simple yet addictive gameplay being the titles most evident upsides. This game is great if you and your friend want to have some simple fun and blast through incoming tides of the menacing greenskins in Co-Op mode, or if you just want to indulge in the opportunity of steeping into a little bit of WH40K lore - the choice is always yours.",

            "review_text": "WH40KKT, or just 'KT', is a twin-stick shooter that has you play a Space Marine against the invading Orks. One stick moves, the other stick shoots. There's also some special weapons, and occasional 'special moves'. Given multiple types of Space Marines (Vanguard, Rearguard, TechMarine, and Librarian) they are armed very differently and they fight very differently. Vanguard is a melee specialist, while rearguard is a shooter. TechMarine is balanced, while librarian is a lot like a wizard with spells.   Ammo's unlimited, and there are weapons 'upgrades' that can be unlocked through repeated play. You can also equip up to two perks (a lot like the Halo Spartan twin-stick game) The problem usually is the enemies are just too numerous, even given your powerful weapons, so the game is really meant for co-op. There are many random powerups such as heal, rapid fire, double / triple / quad fire, righteous fury (double melee damage), power shield, and a few others.   The main problem with this game is with its various shifting viewpoints. Generally with a twin-stick shooter the view stays static. However, this game will rotate the camera very often. This is VERY annoying, as the game shifts almost at random from isometric, to sort-of sidescroller, to sort of 2D shooter, to sort of top-down, to behind the shoulder... and more. There's even one where you were looking at the enemy behind you where you need to run forward (i.e. pulling the stick toward yourself).   The difficulty is... high. There are only like 6-7 missions total, but each can be played through by 4 different space marines which would have very different styles. And high scores are recorded separately. I think I died at least once per mission, and while there are many checkpoints, there doesn't seem to be enough in the later missions (or I just suck at these in general). In the end I had to engage Cheat Engine for a little help, but yes, I did finish.   There are 10 collectible 'wings' on each mission and collecting all ten gets you a certain bonus achievement. Unfortunately some of those are next to impossible, as they are often in the oddest parts of the level or a part of special sequence that you can't divert from.   For example, one mission had you engaging a small 'minelayer'. When you shot out one engine, the craft drifting spun around, then crashed toward you. You ran (and if you don't, walkway collapse and you die) and engage more enemies until you reach a section of walkway that is stable. If a wing pops up right then and there, will you be able to grab it before you lose the chance?   There are occasionally other bugs and a few WTF moments. On some levels you *can* fall off the edge of some walkways. There's a common bug on 3rd level where you encounter a 'boss' creature who may kill you before you can even start moving. As you can't tap past the cutscenes, this gets very annoying.   All in all, Kill Team is a fun little shooter, but I think the Halo version: Spartan Ops, is better game overall. This game does give you multiple space marines to play with, but it's not balanced quite right, It probably gets better in co-op though. It is rather exciting to play.",

The overall feel is spot on for the univere it's set in and it's just enough game for the purpose it was built for. And that was to build up hype for the Space Marine release. My one and only complaint about this game is that there is no option for online multiplayer. But so long as you have at least one other friend into the 40k univers, this should be too large an issue.  Now to the truth of it. Unless you are an avid fan of the 40K univers, this game is not for you. It was a shallow story at best so you will really have no clue as to what you are really doing or why. The fluff codex doesnt supply enough information to immerse yourself in the fiction and the light customisation such as weapons and skins will have no meaning as they have no real impact of the game and are severly limited  For the fans of the univers I do though highly recomend this game.

Play difficulty is also somewhat balanced, and the lore is pretty accurate.  On the other hand though, everything sort of just stops short of greatness. The lore doesn't introduce anything new or refreshing, certain weapons are either inaccurate or don't really differ from others (high RoF rocket launcher? Really?), the weapons don't feel as satisfying as in Space Marine, certain missions feel unbalanced or rigged unintentionally against you, music is recycled from DoW2, and most of the animations which make all previous Warhammer 40K games so satisfying and unique are gone in the name of fast, unending action.

Update Aug2015: I can play through the first level, now! ...only to crash during the score tally.",

Having played through every mission at least twice now I am very happy with this purchase and what I am seeing in the level of detail and authentic feeling from this studio. The game runs very smooth and is a joy to play with a dual stick controller. I did have several glitches with textures, animations, or the camera while playing (tyranids react poorly to the melta gun on the kill cam for some reason), but only once did it feel 'broken' with a stuck camera. On second playthrough at the same point, the game worked fine. While the unlock system did not make such sense as to why I suddenly got a new weapon or perk, aside from mowing down greenskins, it gave a nice sense of progression and gave reasons for replay as different classes. The game is SHORT, but I liked that. It really made it feel like I was a Space Marine on a tactical mission. If they didn't finish the mission in 5hrs, where is the sense of urgency? The game plays and sometimes feels like a budget arcade shooter, but the nice polish put on it made me appreciate the work put in. As an example, shell casings eject from your weapon and bounce across the floor with real physics, and at one particular heavy point in the game I completely covered the entire area in spent rounds. The physics and detailed character models made this truly feel like something you would expect from Games Workshop. I would definitely buy a second installment or expansion with more missions. Time to dust off that copy of Space Marine I have sitting around.",

I got it for a few bucks and am happy with it. Like I said, get it cheap and PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER.",

I'm writing this review based on 1 completed campaign match. I had low expectations to the game, due to the above mentioned. The menu i was taken into, looked very 'old' and unpolished, and i was a bit suprised over the lack of graphics options in the menu.   As the game started, i was instantly struck with the feeling of mobile/tablet game graphics. And being a simple twin-stick shooter, i have no idea why this game isnt out solely on mobile devices. - That being said, i actually really enjoyed my 20 minutes of playing the mission, and will definately revisit the game for another one!  OVERALL:   Graphics   5/10    Gameplay   8/10    Music   7/10 ",

I have had the game crash on me in several instances - like when I shoot too fast from upgrades. I have had the camera lose me, and not follow me around on the screen - only to have it then crash.  That being said, I have enjoyed my time with this game as a mindless activity to play with my son. The controls are simple, it is in a universe that I enjoy, and completing it is achievable in co-op with a child.  If you can tolerate the technical issues with this game, it can give you a few hours of enjoyment in co-op. 100% cheevos is achievable as well.",
