I got this game very long time ago to get archivement for something, dont exactly remember, anyways I do understand it's an indie game and I shouldn't expect much from this title but honestly it's just crap. Don't buy this, it's pointless. For this 1€ you can get better things, trust me.  Pros; works  Cons; everything what left",
