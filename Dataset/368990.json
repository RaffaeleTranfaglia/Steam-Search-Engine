I figured at the very least, I could get 3 cards out of it. By the time I bought the game, Steam's new 'Two Hours before you get cards' rule had gone into effect.  This game should have come with the cards, automatically. The real Despair is that I had to idle this HORRIBLE game 2.7 hours to get the cards.   Some people have compared this game to the game   Bad Rats  . Please, don't insult   Bad Rats   by comparing this game to it. You can actually get some enjoyment out of   Bad Rats  .  I made multiple attempts to play this game. With each attempt, I became more irritated, and less enthused. If this game was free, it would still be too expensive.",

If you have none if not two in a game, it's going to be terrible like demonstrated here.

Take 'The Forest' for example.  Cons  - Dull - No graphics option - Not a real story line  Conclusion: With that game of a price tag, don't buy it. Instead buy an icecream!  0.5 / 10",

Everything about it screams out rushed and half finished, right down to the fact that your battery number indicator is still in Russian (playing English version). Graphics are pretty hideous, especially with the neon colours to indicate interactable objects. There is no guidance on what you're supposed to be doing and I found my way through based on blind luck. Overall it is a very poor attempt to build suspense and fear. At one stage, arguably the game's 'peak', you start to be chased, but I had the flashlight off at this stage, so I lose control of my character and off he runs into the darkness, and every now and then an 'E' symbol appears instructing me to press 'E'. From what I gathered, my character was pulling down stuff behind him to block the persuer but how on earth he could see where he's going is beyond me. Also the finale glitched up for me, and I ended up clipping through the scenery before the most comical out-of-nowhere 'THE END' appears onscreen. Watching youtube videos revealed I missed out on a cutscene but even with this new information I still had no idea what was going on. Just avoid, even if it is up for like 10p. Your time is more valuable.",

It’s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of spookies to find, but what makes it special is what’s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.A brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as your charecter, is ritually executed along with his family. your charecter's spirit is then bound to an amnesiac ghost and returned to the subway for vengeance against the spookies forces. It’s a story that doesn’t make total sense for hardcore Bad Rat scholars, but it’s well-acted. It makes decent use of the controls, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly badRat, the comic-relief ogre, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army.",

Generally the enviroment is revolting - mismatching, misaligned, obviously tiled textures, unexplained invisible walls and platforming elements which serve no purpose, or, better yet, non-solid objects. Additionally, everything looks the same, so getting lost in intentionally looped mazes along with low FOV (which can't be adjusted) makes a great recepie for nausea.
