            "review_text": "Albeit the game being fairly simple, it was incredibly fun to play through! It's just challenging enough, the shop system is great and there's many ways you can build your character. You have skills like leap, slam, fireball, lightning chain... You can mix both magic and melee and it is actually works pretty well!  You also have some melee skills which are based on strength and agility, so you can stay pure melee and still be very efficient. The best part is that you can build a castle if you want to! There's only one tower type, but you can stack them on top of each other or put many of them next to each others, then you can put troops on them to defeat ennemies for you! You can also put stairs and get up on your tower to shoot enemies from afar if that's your playstyle.  Pros:  -Addicting. -Fun. -Great shop system. -Great balance. -Local multiplayer.  Cons:  -Always the same waves, but there's 3 levels of difficulty and bosses gains more abilities in harder ones. -All 3 game modes takes about 5 hours to finish total. -Basic graphics.",
