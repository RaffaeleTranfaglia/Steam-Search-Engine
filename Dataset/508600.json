            "review_text": "Your base consists of a 6 by 6 grid of land tiles, and all the tiles can be flipped in unison to reveal 6 by 6 more land tiles. Part of the strategy is choosing when to flip your tiles during a fight.  Your base needs oxygen and adding more people requires adding more trees to compensate for oxygen usage. In fast mode people use more oxygen than normal. People fight melee, but if there are defense towers, then they battle first before any melee takes place. You'll need a warehouse to collect stone, wood, chests, or fuel and then choose what other buildings (hospital, armory, artifact house, shields, trees, walls, offensive towers). Chests are opened with keys.  Gameplay consists of flying your base from node to node through space, where nodes are either enemy bases, enemy super-bases, repair nodes, stores or treasure. Enemy bases either wait to be attacked or attack immediately. There are 6 enemy super-bases, and conquering them unlocks new weapons. When all 6 super-bases are destroyed the game is won.   Pros:  - Combines game mechanics from the following genres: Tower defense, Roguelike, 4x  - Randomized maps  - Artifacts  - Early game tension  - Every enemy base you wipe out opens new weapons, which adds some variety.   Cons:  - No save. I have beaten the game both in easy and hard modes in one sitting perhaps under an hour. So the lack of saving is not as bad as you might think.  - The tension seems to wear off later  - There are still some bugs  - The game defaults to Russian and it's tricky to get it into English again. It's sort of an introductory mini-game 'decipher the language to find out the English setting' :)  - The game gets pretty grindy near the end. Not being able to save is a big minus.   Is it worth $1?  No it's worth $2 or $3 - maybe even $5 after it's polished. Get it while it's cheap and buy 3 copies to share with your friends!   Is it better than many games you pay $50?  Of course not! Why would you think that? Whenever you pay more money you automatically enjoy the game that much more. Especially when titles are developed by armies of people and all of them are throwing each other under the bus and the bugs are left to the player base to catch and gripe about in the forums. Actually this game (as far as gameplay goes) is at least as good as many higher end titles (like Civilization for example).   Is it fun?  I think so. But buy it yourself and find out! Get a refund if you don't like it before 2 hours are up. I think it's well worth the time to give it a try.",

            "review_text": "I experienced some game changing bugs that really destroyed my gameplay. About 50% of the planets i could not even explore because my people just ran in to the corner of my 'spaceship' and waited there. So if i sacrificed some turrets to take over a planet i could not even loot it. You can not even save the game. You have to play through the whole game in one sitting. Yes i know this is a very cheap game but if these things were fixed i would most definitely give this game a thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "Well, well, well.  This one is an interesting one indeed. Basic premise of the game is thus; you're a space faring fortress, on a mission to eradicate a virus of some sort (which I only learned from the game over screen, har de har.). You cruise around the galaxy visiting stars which either contain resources (resource gathering, management), settlements which must be attacked and defeated (tower defence time, ya'll.) in order to claim their resources, and finally stores, which allow you to buy extra resources, repair kits etc., or repair stations that allow you to repair and upgrade your towers. This continues until you have a force capable of taking on a-la 'boss' settlements.  So.  The game is pretty fun, in a play windowed whilst watching YouTube in the backround sort of way. The graphics are simple and unoffensivce. The soundtrack is surprisingly fitting and unobtrusive, given the price tag. The gameplay is very happy clicky don't think too hard sort of fare.  However.  It needs work. It be a little buggy, occasionally you'll begin a new game, and resource platforms won't load in. Speeding up time (which allows your little minions to collect resources, fight, etc. quicker) often causes your citizens to run backwards and forwards helplessly. But nothing that won't be easily fixed, I suppose.  There really isn't a whole lot of content. It's going to get old really fast without a stream of updates adding more stuffings.  There isn't a save feature. This needs sorted. I can't sugar coat it.  However. I got this for eighty pence. You may as well give it a shot.  Also, click the flag on the lower right of the title screen, unless you can read Russian ;)  Peace.",

It's a simple game where you fly around in your bio planet and build towers to fight the planets you go to and steal their resources for yourself. Has not a lot of replayability, but it was super fun to go around taking out bases and getting the best defence.  Also, trees&gt;walls.",

Also this game doesn't have a save system so don't think you can start a new game, save and load it back up to continue where you left off, you have to do it all in one go. Unless you leave the game on then you should be fine. All that aside its a fun game to pass the time if you have nothing else to really do.",

            "review_text": "First Game: No idea what to do, so I started placing things randomly to see their effects. Had no idea what anything I placed did due to lack of tooltips, so I just had to guess. Pretty simple, but annoying, when a simple tooltip could have helped me out immensely. Started to click on places on the map to try to go everywhere. Had no idea that I could rotate the starmap until a bit later, and started to explore and find that exploring gave me a few things. Again, no idea what I was doing but was clicking along to try to figure things out. Found out that I could rotate, and tried to make my way to the highlighted star that was told for me to go to. Made it there, got a warning that it was difficult, and died.  Not a fan of the game, wouldn't play it again. I got a feel for all of the mechanics, and just by struggling through and figuring out what everything did, I learned that there seemed to be little variation to the game other than grinding slowly planet by planet until you reach enough defenses to win! No interesting tower combinations, some interesting base layouts, but overall, there doesn't seem to be much to make this game stand out.  I could have just played a starcraft 2 arcade mode game if I wanted to have this type of experience and saved myself the trouble.",
