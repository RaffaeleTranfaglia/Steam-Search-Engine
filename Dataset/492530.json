            "review_text": "BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was looking at the medieval games on steam because that interests me. I stumbled across this game. I was surprised at the price. Luckily i had $3.00 on my account. I watched the trailer and immediately bought it. If you like medieval games where you build and create and army, this game is perfect for you. There is no cons (at least for me). Best $2.00 I've ever spent. I'm not exaggerating. I highly recommend this game. P.S If you see people saying 'the graphics suck. They could definitely be better!' Or 'the fonts suck' DO NOT listen to them. This game was made in 2004. DON't listen to those reviews. Base them off of mine or people that aren't idiots and don't say dumb things when not looking at the release date of the game. Thank you for reading my review!",
