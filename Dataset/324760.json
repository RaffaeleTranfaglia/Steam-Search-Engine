The only downside has to be the menus - they're really scrappy and not really functioning well with the controller, but thankfully there's a mouse pointer for that. It would be lovely to see an update to tidy up the menus in the future.  That said, the gameplay is top notch. At the price it's on here for, you won't get better monster truck physics anywhere else.. it's tough as nails but great fun too, with lots of content to keep you busy :)",

For a $4 game and the controls patch. well worth the money for any Monster Truck fan. The best MT game since Monster Truck Madness 2. Now if we can get a track and truck editor or at the very least a track editor. :)  I think people were a little quick to through stones at the game. Its not like it was a AAA title at $60.",

The graphics are GREAT 3. It's crazy cheap when on sale   Cons: 1. AI needs to be dumbed down a bit because they are way too fast in racing and win all the time in freestyle    I recommend 11/10",

Crushing puny car's like nobodies business...  Unfortunately this game is fundamentally broken atm. The menus' don't funtion, the mouse seems to be disabled, and it's a hot mess...   This game is only 3.74 and has licened Monster Trucks.... it's nearly unplayable in it's current state, I'd say buy it anyway for the LOL's of owning a game that gets removed from the steam store... If you don't care about such things avoid buying this game like the plague.. The dev's have time to fix the issues though, so lets hope they get to it..",

Floaty physics, laughable graphics and settings (Resolution is set as 'high') and seen before gameplay.   The lowest price on ITAD has it listed as $0.74, so it might be worth it then if you are desperate. Maybe.",

What I found was a buggy, impossible to use, unfinished game that truly felt to me like someone's half finished term project from school. The UX design was atrocious, when the menus even worked at all, and there was no sign of controller support whatsoever. This game needs 3 months of solid dev work to get it finished and polished out to the point where it'd be worth money at all.",

Since that debacle, I have deleted my positive review and pulled that video from youtube. I can't support any dev that attempts to bully people into censorship. This could be the best game ever made and I'd still say don't buy it. What they did was unethical, and disgusting on many levels and it will likely cause their company far worse damage than that single negative review ever did.   Devs, it's simple, really, if you can't take criticism, don't make art or consumer products. And instead of going after negative reviews with legal action (that you can't actually take because that isn't how the law works) how about you reach out to the people that actually liked your game and try to build a community? You know, be positive and grow organically, instead of being toxic and unethical. Just a thought.",

I feel ripped off still getting it in a bundle of 10 games for Â£1.39. That's how bad it is... Controls are awful... I started a championship game and well, I couldn't move!? For about 60 seconds. Had to restart it. Exited. Uninstalled.",
