            "review_text": "That dirty old Napoleon was a true son of a ♥♥♥♥♥.   For a game to choose such a narrow slice of history, the Napoleonic Wars, and do it so well is truly a hidden gem among strategy games. With one exception , this is a game you can pickup quickly and move into battle / conquest mode with minimal reading / tutorials. The tutorials are there and cover every feature in detail should you need them.  Pick your country wisely when you play this game. Starting off on the wrong side will test your patience and mettle for battle. I started as Great Britain and ruled the seas...but those pesky French kept drawing my ships and transports into battle. I would end up winning but these spoiler attacks slowed me down a lot. Enemy AI is competitive at the strategic level and in combat.  The one daunting task is understanding the military units. You can make upwards of twenty different types of land combat units in MoE. TWENTY. Knowing the difference between a Marine brigade and a Dragoons brigade is a must. Knowing that armies, during that time, needed supply trains as much as they need fighting brigades is a must. Knowing how to position your troops and their fronts for maximum effect is a must. Put too many troops in a single front and you incur an attack penalty!  Given the narrow slice of history involved, MoE is probably a niche strategy game. Still, I'm very, very happy with my purchase. If you play Hearts of Iron III, Crusader Kings II, and / or EV IV, you should add this game to your collection.  ",

I continue to recommend this to my friends over something more complicated like CK2 or EU4.  7/10 ",

And Italy is a very interesting country after all. But a Hard campaign when it comes to unifaction. But never the less, this game is truely remarkable, the best napoleon based game on steam! I only hope they make a War of 1812 Game soon, America vs Britain.",

Over all it's only about 20% of what most Paradox games bring to the table, if even that, but on the flip side it has all of the basic mechanics of paradox games.   That being said, March of the Eagles is a perfect starter game to get into the strategy games of Paradox, as this will teach you the funamentals and basics that all Paradox games are built on, without being overwhelming to the point of turning you off.   After you get this game down, other paradox games that are much larger in scope, will become much easier to understand and learn. (That doesn't mean it'll be easy!, just easier).",

            "review_text": "March of the Eagles is Paradox Interactive's attempt to squeeze the era of the Napoleonic Wars into a grand strategy title. Though MotE succeeds in its ultimate goals, the game itself stands on uncertain ground. It struggles to find its place in the library of other grand strategies as it focuses solely on the military and geopolitical aspects of the Napoleonic Wars. While some consumers may find this acceptable, fans of the Europa Universalis series (which closely resembles MotE in both style and mechanics) may be disappointed by lack of political depth. On the other hand, being a grand strategy title with large barriers to entry and a sharp learning curve may keep casual strategy gamers at bay. In completely unrelated culinary terms, March of the Eagles can be perceived as too lean for hardcore Paradox fans while also being to beefy for newcomers to the franchise. Despite this, the game still remains enjoyable and fulfilling to those who stick with it. Though most of the game involves preparing supplies and armies for the inevitable attack of the French, some smaller moments also break through. Having my 5th Portuguese Dragoon regiment march from Algeria to Sweden collecting the banners of defeated regiments was great fun. All-in-all, March of the Eagles is a pleasant experience for those gamers who want to experience the military side of grand strategy and have always wanted to reshape the history of Europe.  Pros-  - Reliable engine (no crashes seen) - Fair mechanics  - Various factions to play  Cons-  - Poor tutorials - Based around military ( Personal preference) - Lack of faction variety  Score: 7.5/10",
