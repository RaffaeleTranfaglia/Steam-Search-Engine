            "review_text": "The game isnt entirely horrid but I can only recommend for Usagi fans only. The best thing about the game is the art but the combat/ai is horrid, unegaging and its almost impossible to die. Its a pure masher and most of the time the enemies are too dumb to even get on the same line as you to attack you properly and are no threat. Gameplay sucks basically and overall this manages to be worse than the C64 game released in the 80s.  Waste of the stellar art.",
