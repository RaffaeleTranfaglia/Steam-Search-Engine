Shepard struggled building a fish tank. This 8 year-old kid was clearing out the Vorticon home planet while Shepard was telling everyone what his favorite shop on the Citadel was.  Shepard is a joke. Commander Keen is the real Spectre.",

Try to avoid the gaps and collect as many points as you can (not as easy as it sounds mind you ;) ) Since everything kills you in one hit, prepare to start some levels over and over again. But considering the age of this game, it's still very entertaining (come on you know you love MS-Dos)",

This pack features 5 games made by ID software and for the current price it's almost a give-away.  Qua controls it can be challenging at various times so be patient with this part you can definatly get the hang of it, The keys are for the rest simple and straight forwarded though the pogostick is the hardest of all to control. Give it some time even i had problems with it when i fired the game back up after so many years.  For those familiar with the keen series it should be noted that the commander keen complete series for steam does not contain all the official games but instead only the games made by ID software and apogee. For more details here is a small list:  ======Included: 1. 1 Marooned on Mars 1. 2 The Earth Explodes 1. 3 Keen Must Die 2. 1 Secret of the Oracle 2. 2 The armageddon machine  ======Not included: The Lost Episode aka keen dreams (softdisk) Aliens Ate My Babysitter (formgen) Commander keen Gameboy color (David A. Palmer Productions)  With all that out of the way i'd like to mention one more thing before i end this review. Ever heard of the term: Dopefish Lives? Perhaps you've seen an easter egg of it in one of your favorite games or childhood cartoons even. If you do this is where it all started. Go ahead and play the secret of the oracle, it will find you eventually ;)  All the best!  (s.i.e)",
