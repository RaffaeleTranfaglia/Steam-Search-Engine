            "review_text": "Well... It was nice.   10 hours and I had beaten this game 100% (not all achivements though). You know, nowadays it is rare to me, to actually finish the game. Usually it is too long, with not so engaging story, and lots of fetch quests. This game on the other hand, was fun, was fresh, and, dare i say, was 'handcrafted' (see, what I did here? ^_^)   Closest analogy, that I can think of this game - is mix between Bastion and Neverhood. Creator of this game do not shame themselfs from this comparisson, proudly wearing 'badge of honor', on their sleeve. Hell - they even made one of the optional 'door' levels - full reference to Bastion.   Lets now talk about pros and cons. (+ and -), as I see them.   - Probably poor control scheme on keybord. I used controller, and had lots of fun, but some fights and 'dodge puzzles' will be probably be hard without fluid movement. - Story ends abruptly, and lacks 'impact', in comparison to whole 'crazy journey', that is leading to it. It's not because it is bad, but because game world is bright, colourful and funny. If I would give any advise to developers - I'd said to make like several minutes long animation film, and give it as an 'end prize'. (I know, that this requires work and time, but without it, I cant think of any possibility to make ending of this game feel 'good', or like an actual end.) - There is no 'full completion' bonus, and some side quest reward just appear in game later down the line. I got at least several of armors/helmets/weapons, in quantity higher then 1. I suppose it's fine, but I just wanted even more content, I gues. - Some in-level passes closes behind you. Not a generally bad thing, because it allows 'different routs' for beating levels, but still annoyed me from time to time (cause I tried to look at all available to me nooks and crannies)   + Fixed camera angle. This is actually wery good, because not only whole game looks super nice, but also there are a lots of 'secrets', that use this camera angle thing. + Difficulty. It is well balanced (for controller at least). At no point in game was I frustrated, overwhelmed, or needed to 'grind' anything. I died several times on bosses and some 'puzzles', but was not mad at game of control sheme at any time. Nicely done. + Visuals - 10/10 (and some warm fluffy thing on top of the score) + Humor. Game doesn't take itself too seriously, or too unseriously, creating fun 'living' world, that you can totally belive in.  + Music. As I am gettig things - it was specialy made to this game, enlarging game experience even more. + No need to 'open all doors', to beat game - so around of 70% of the game is optional. Also, there are several ways to complete like hath of the quests, which is super nice, and allows you to play 'your way'.   All in all - I do recoment this game, to buy and play. It is not 'the new' Bastion, or Undertale, but a good game non the less.",

            "review_text": "Totally excited about this game! Have already completed the game once and now hunting all the achievements. Here is why I'm in love with this game:    Colorful and crazy game world where almost every pumpkin is trying to share its thoughts with you. It's made so organically well that after some time you'll find yourself actually living in this world.    Plasticine setting suits the game really well. There are not so many plasticine games which you can't imagine being made not of plasticine, you know. Don't open the doors is a great example (alongside the Neverhood of course).    Hack'n'slash game mechanics. If you love games like Bastion or even Diablo give this game a try. The controls aren't casual like in the Diablo though so be ready to run and evade from attacks a lot.    The story is weird in a funny way. There are tons of dialogs and I read each and every of them. Sometimes I was laughing obscenely loud :)   Of course, you can find some disadvantages, especially if you're tempted hack'n'slash player. The combat system is a bit clumsy and there is no enough variety of weapons, skills and other RPG related stuff as for me. But I didn't actually think about all of these things before my first game completion :)   Summarizing, if you love hack'n'slash games or games with a rich game world and an addictive story or hand-crafted games with a soul or games with talking pumpkins then I strongly recommend to think about purchasing this game. If you love all of those, then buy it immediately for sure! :)",

            "review_text": "The combat is clunky, the controls unresponsive, the resources are very limited and most of then spawn once, plus most enemies (even the more annoying) dont drop anything useful when dead. Projectile enemies can infinitely stunlock you (most enemies really), and the absurd difficulty spikes on certain spots turn the experience into trial and error only, The more you play the more unfair bullcr@p the game throws at you. The art style and absurd story are the only good things i can salvage from this game. Do not buy",
