Concerning gameplay - well, here we have some tried-and-true approaches: four standard (to be honest not completely standard - JUST LOOK AT THOSE SCARY ELVES!) fantasy races, eight typical classes, several also typical play modes and a really great amount of different (but always picturesque) maps. Is it entertaining? Oh yeah - especially after level 4 or 5 when a player actually gets enough abilities to choose between them and starts using some strategy thinking instead of constant clicking. Then it becomes just more and more interesting. Can't understand all the fuss around its monetization system. If you don't want to buy smth in the game you can always craft it. The crafting takes some time but it's fair and sensible. NO unique items or any advantages for donaters.",

Of course, did the same with War Thunder, Shattered Horizon, The Stanley Parable, etc. I'm a marathon player; I burn the camo at both ends!   Sure, it needs improvements. The game requires a patch immediately after installing it, but it downloads at 56K modem speeds! This isn't the first game that relies on a launcher to update a game, but 100MB taking 30 minutes to download is appalling! And having never played this kind of game I could have used better tutorials on crafting and why I should craft some things over others. And speaking of tutorials, 9 classes equals 9 identical tutorials if you want to earn a class point for each one. And you are forced to watch the same badly done cut-scenes over and over with no option to skip them. Those voices! UGG! Better to just skip the tutorials altogether and earn your first rank by playing a round or two.  The game has various classes and after you get past rank 5 there's supposed to be only 2 of each class on each team, greatly extending the matchmaking wait significantly. But if the devs want to make money (and they do) they will find a way to reduce the wait times. Speaking of which, the money you can spend on this game is for actual improvements to your skills and equipment vs just cosmetic stuff. This can lead to a P2W mentality, but a lot of games survive regardless if they're still fun to play. It's certainly easier to rank up in this game than others I've played. War Thunder would take years to rank up all of your crews if you simply ground your way vs paying to upgrade, for instance. I've spend $85 on that game already!  I'm not very good at reviewing games, so that's all the ramblings of a Christmas Crack Monkey you're going have to put up with for now. Bottom line, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for casual and addictive fun.",

This is just a first impression of the game and to agree with other comments on this game it does have Pay to Win features, but over all from what i've experianced it is fun and worth trying out.  The game has great characters that have their own skill sets that seprate them from all others. The combat is very enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty good compared to most games with a bit of humor to the animations. Character costomizing is not bad, with a few customizing cash shop items avalible to those that want to spend a dollar or two.  Down side to this game sadly is that there is a very small player base at the moment, if the game catchs on and more people start playing que's to battles should improve, till then its a very very long wait till you get to do much of anything.   Over all 7 out of 10, if battle que's get shorter 9-10 because nothings perfect lol.",

        {
            "review_text": "So let me sum this game up. This will be comming from someone who likes playing MOBAS regularly.   1. Moba with only a few maps giving you lanes, not the same kind of lanes in a traditional MOBA since, but lanes none the less that allows you to flank and take objectives through an ambush type of take over.   2. Most, if not all other Mobas give you a plethora to chose from of many different character types, set with there own powers and themes. This game gives you the bare bones to which you build off of allowing you to create your own champion, tailored to you and your play style.   3. No item store like DOTA2 or LOL. You literaly build your character through time and progression.  4. You gain materials to build things after each match regardless if you win or lose. The more you win, the more bonuses are gained hence, the faster you can get your items built for your character.   5. 8 classes, many different ways to level each one giving you technically more then just 8 classes.  Tank, Paladin, Sapper, Sister Of fire, Inquisitor, Berserker, Ice Witch, Gunner.   6. The games currency, is a pink gem that you can get through progression and time played along with getting a total of 5 after each time you level. Almost everything is reliant on this, respec, crafting and upgrading. You can literally earn everything honestly without ever going to the item mall.   Over all thoughts thus far  I honestly believe we have something great here. The game is well made on a nice engine and runs very nicely. There are a few graphical gripes, but nothing that completely ruins the game for me or my experience from the over all presentation. This game has a long ways to go before it can hit that sweet spot where DOTA and LOL currently sit at, but this game has the potential of being a staple in the MOBA market, maybe one that can make other DEV teams strive to become or even surpass. Thus far, I am having a blast and I already started to make friends on here and the community over all has been really nice to play with. There are a few toxic members, but thats in every gaming community no matter what you do.   Now to the one spot where everyone wants to know about.   'Item mall is it buy to win'   Buy to win for me is, you can buy all the best weapons in the game and armor at a premium cost and absolutely tank everything and not be effected by early adopters of the game. It's safe to say or atleast from what I have looked at, you CANT do that here. I was reading in the community hub that it was and had to look myself. There are boosts that are offered to get you more of those pink gems, but that was really all the differences they offer, not the crazy armor and weapon buying that people were claiming in the forums. The boost is pretty much you get additional gems with the completion of certain aspects of the game. Not really game breaking considering half the people that do this wont be around very long or just don't have the time to keep up on the boosts themselves and let it expire.   oh and one more thing, the crafting system is pretty nice and offers a similar experience to that of Warframe. Really nice idea to have something that allows us to make our own armors and weapons.   'Now off to work I go, thank you for reading'   Devs, more game types and a server browser please.",

To begin with, the game's recommended system settings are not nearly powerful enough to run the game at any sort of decent FPS. Even having a 4gb of RAM, I had to heavily downgrade graphics for it to be playable. Also the loading times were very long. The options for classes looks interesting, and the 'dwarves' in it have a unique style element of their own, they all wear a sort of bouncy spring shoe to help them move a bit faster. (Personally I am not a fan of the change to traditional dwarves, but I do appreciate the effort.) There is a short, brief tutorial mission on how basic movement &amp; combat works. However once that is up, the game literally forces you to go into a PvP match.  Literally, you can not do any thing whatsoever beyond go and do a PvP match after this. Having wanted to try this game out last night along with Sins of a Dark Age, I figured when no one queue'd up for a game, it was just because it was late/early. Today I queue up again, and after 5 mins of waiting I am already bored and wanting to go check on my AdVenture Capitalist progress instead.  So, I have to give this game a truly atrocious 0/10, as I can not even engage in the core game elements, not even against bots. For a game that is so heavily featured on my store stream, I am sadly disappointed in this title.  Buy this game if you: Dislike actually playing games, and prefer instead to sit at a loading screen, staring blankly.",

But seemingly everything is ripped straight out of Warhammer it's comepletely amazing that this even got on steam with this much stuff completely ripped off.  the Animations are well made. but there is a complete lack of feedback in mellee and ranged combats.  The free to play model is fair, but you will quickly hit a point where sinking money into 'premium time' is clearly the only way the games progression is balanced.  There is plenty of gear slots and assorted things to slot into your gear. but there are only really 2 primary Stats to increase  There are time sinks scattered through the crafting and upgrade systems that feel straight out of an iphone game and seem to only be in place to bait out the inevitible 'ah ♥♥♥♥ it ill spend real money to skip this' you are also at the complete mercy of RNG with crafting mats rewarded after each match for......something.. there are no side objectives or anything to really influence how you get these.. just keep playing and hope.  The Maps are really nice, most of them have moving components and other little quicks that bring some variety in how they are played out.. if only half of the modes where put together correctly. Maps like the Siege of ♥♥♥♥ing orc monkey village is backwards... and has the attacking team already in the castle and pushing out for what will always end up as a 45 minute meat grinder as there is no real way for defencive teams to win on any siege mode maps unless your teams composition completely ♥♥♥♥♥ on the attackers.   i dont reccomend this one.

Really sadly the only and seriously only bad thing about this game is that  it's PAY2WIN all the way which means you can pretty much complete the game using real money, you can get max level, you can get best gear in the game, you can get enough potions to make you immortal for the entire game, you can buy amulets which boost your stats and also you can buy a 'bot' of some sort so when you are not playing then he will 'play' for you resulting in you getting sweet loot without moving a finger, have I mentioned you can buy VIP which almost more than doubles the loot you get?  Example: Once I went into a game withm my level 11 tank with decent gear for which i didn't pay and then further into the game i realised there is a guy on the enemy team who had all the available gear for that level, he even painted it which requires money like the game was so unbalanced because our team couldn't even kill him because he had enough health potions to keep him going for the entire game, he died like only once when our entire team ganged up on him, but that was it he just kept on killing everyone with two blows after that. This experience really proved to me how unbalanced the game gets when someone pays 2 win. This game has amazing potential, but the developers just ruined it with the cash shop.",
