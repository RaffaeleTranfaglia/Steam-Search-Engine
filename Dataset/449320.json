            "review_text": "Dino Eggs Rebirth is a classic RPG (be it indie) game. In this game you literally take a travel through time in both the story line parameter as well as the presentation. For its a follow up game for a much older yet fun game. As good as it is , it has a very good storyline, but before you read on you must be warned, for this is a spoiler alert.  You start off your game as a person who accidentally ends up in a time travelling portal. He uses the portal to travel through time to millions of years ago, to the age of dinosaurs. Soon his mission becomes to save the dinosaurs of that era by bringing baby dinosaurs and eggs alike to the presemt. In the process he gains fame and money. A few years later his daughter too tries the same thing. Now thats for the story line (any thing more would be a giveaway) But this much I must mention that the storyline is amazing a bit rigid in orientation but amazing.  The games graphics are of early 80's to begin with, taking us back to the era. It is an indie game but has no bugs. (Although my computer at first refused to run the program). The sound is soothing and overall the game is presented as a narrative. Which is kind of fun.  There are many pros and relatively no cons to this time travelling game. But to name a few:-  PROS  1. Good storyline (very interactive, stops it from being dull) 2. Good music (easy on the ears) 3. Has a narrative styule of story telling (which is kind of fun) 4. Great level architecture (Each level is unique) 5. The dinosaur eggs may hatch any time within the level (which is neat) CONS  1. The game is a bit too easy to play (Which can be fun at times)  So overall the game gets 6/10 for being a mix of 1980's and the 2016",
