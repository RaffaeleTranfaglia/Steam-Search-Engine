            "review_text": "Absent is a free-to-play adventure game, where you're playing a student investigating on the disappearance of students, among them, his girlfriend. However, the truth is more terryifing that you can imagine.  Indeed, the plot could have been easy to understand. Disappearing people, paranormal entity, these themes, if well handled, can result in a good moment. However, here, after a while, it was so complex to understand that I lost interest in the story.   Also, as it's a point-and-click game with the good old mechanics of the cursor cycling through the actions, you may have an hard time by moments. I remember that for one achievement, you had to click on the door of the teacher's room. You think that the discussion will let you an option to show something. In reality, you have to use the item first, else, well, no cheevos for you. Also, don't forget to speak with everyone so that you can learn more about the school, the students, the town or to simply find the solution to go forwards.  Absent has also correct graphics: it has a nice retro touch. You're not staying in the school during all the game, but you visit the town, forests and even another world. The soundtrack is correct too.  For a free game, I must say that it's doing great. The game isn't short at all, can provide a good challenge, though sometimes, you wish that the clues were more obvious and the achievements aren't too hard. However, keep in mind that maybe, the game isn't for you if you're not into adventure gaming. It's not the best way to get to know the genre, especially with these mechanics, for that, you have better series like Blackwell or A Golden Wake or even other free gems that aren't on Steam.  Anyway, it will not hurt you to install it.",

            "review_text": "[Slight Spoiler(s)] 'It's not disappearance... IT'S MURDER!' So far, so good. I recommend you try it for yourself. It's sort of humorous, the characters are quick to the assumption of murder, the gameplay is all right and classic, but the game window is small. Be warned.  From what I've played, I would rate this 8/10.",

            "review_text": "Pros: +Great story and concept. +Puzzles aren't as impossibly vague as most adventure games, but still require your attention and some thought. +Using your credit card on any character with boobs, only to recieve the message 'I don't think they would like that very much'! +Being British! +Achievments for showing arbitrary objects to everyone you know. +free notepads with your meal combo! &lt;3  Cons: -voice direction and voice acting is questionable (bad). -Don't take relationship advice from Steve. He is a bad boyfriend. --The user interface is outdated, clunky, and almost as bad as the terrible graphic for curly fries (seriously, the curly fries are scarrier than the monster).",
