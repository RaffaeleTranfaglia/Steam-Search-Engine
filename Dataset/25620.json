Well, try to break a door secured with a masterful adamantium lock.”    Eschalon: Book 2 is a well-made turn-based rpg experience with great love for detail. Compared with its predecessor the combat mechanics were improved by adding a couple tactical options and increasing the general game speed.  In addition, the game difficulty can be adjusted to satisfy the needs of the hardcore gamers among us.    Trivia:    Like the first game, the game's development was largely kept secret; the developers of the Eschalon series believe that most game developers release too much information about their products, spoiling the game when you eventually play it.    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.    Chronology:    Eschalon: Book 3 (PC) Classic turn-based role-playing game (Fantasy) – 2014   Link to Steam review for Eschalon: Book 3.

Its a fun game,lots of ways to personally build your characters and different ways to play.Think you can just run around looting chests and such? Not in this game if a npc sees you rob them they will come after you to attack you. You can even kill the npcs if you want to.  Eschalon Book 3 is coming out Summer 2013 so if you do not want this one,I would say wait for that one.It is going to have many improvements from the 2nd and I imagine lots more content.",
