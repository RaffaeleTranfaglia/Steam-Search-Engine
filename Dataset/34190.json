            "review_text": "If there is one thing that I really like about this game is how easy it is to pick up and play the game without having a prior knowledge of how racing kart games work. You get lots of characters in game and different tracks and racers that you can earn when you do better in the game. I'm surprised that in this game, the House of the Dead Curien Mansion made it as a playable track. As you may know House of the Dead is a mature rated game :) The controls are great and the fun factor is in there. I believe they even came out with this game in the arcade as well. While we know a famous plumber won't make their PC gaming debut anytime soon it's a safe bet that this is the best racer on the PC hands down if your looking for a fun arcade style racer to play. You won't be dissapointed and the fun factor will be there. Be sure to get it on a sale if you can because websites that are authorized to sell Steam games discount it often.",

Also, since the game only recognizes xinput-enabled controllers, local multiplayer is unplayable for me without tedious modifications to my setup.   While the lack of online play isn't really excusable, there's no steam achievement integreation either, despite the fact that the game has its own ingame achievements. They might as well have linked these to steam, at least.  The game itself is fun and enjoyable, and it definitely fares very well against similar mascot racers such as the Mario Kart series, but this version is just not as good as the console versions due to cut features. I'm kinda glad I got it cheaper on sale to be honest.",

            "review_text": "Sonic And Sega All-Stars Racing is a racing game that features some of the characters from Sega games. It was developed by Sumo Digital, who also made Outrun 2, and released in 2010. You can also call it kart racing, since it has all those weapons and powerups, but eh. You can. One things for sure: it's drift and boost based. It was also released on other consoles and iOS.  As usual, game supports either keyboard or XBox360 controller. It will still show keboard layout no matter what. Also, Steam/PC version is pretty barebones. For some reason, Sega decided that it shouldn't support any online feature. No Steam achievement. There is no Internet multiplayer, only local one. So most of you will be racing only against AI. There are no exclusive characters, like X360 version had Banjo-Kazookie. And there are no DLC, meaning that there is no Metal Sonic or Shenmue hero in forklift.  So, what you will get is racing game. Imagine colorful characters of Sonic and heroes of games like Billy Hatcher, AiAi or the ever grinning B. D. Joe. There are around twenty of them, with eight unlocked by default. And then you got the awesome varied tracks, which may have drifty like Casino Park from Sonic, have 90-degree turns and be riddled with obstacles like Monkey Ball tracks, or just be spooky Curien Mansion. Which is censored or alternative name for House of The Dead. Now, pour in weapons and add in drifting mechanic. And then add modes like Grand Prix, Missions, Time Attack. And add in Shopping where you can unlock characters, stages and music tracks for Sega Miles that you get for successfully completing races.  Characters vary in venichles that they drive. Outside of the usual stats differences, their vehicles can be sorted into few categories. First, there are usual cars, that can be divided into light and heavy ones. Then you got flying vehicles, like Tails Tornado, that aren't affected by terrain, like snow. And then you will get bikes, which are fast and you can get boost easily by performing ground trick, of pressing up and then down. Seriously, bikes are probably the best, not even sure if it's so balanced. And yes, once again, stats change, vehicles have different acceleration and handling, and, for example, some may stay in air after jump long enough to perform multiple tricks while other are too heavy to stay in air for long. At least, thankfully, all the various tracks will catter to different vehicle types. Some are more straight, some will reward handling.  To little geniuses who wonder why Sonic has car: game itself has info in Sonic's profile that he drives a car to give other a sporting chance. The end.  And yes, tricks. This game heavily uses drifting mechanics and rewards you for drifting with boost. Drifting is very controllable there, you can take any turns with it or can even try to drift on straight road with some success. Though, you may want to release gas button for sharp turns. You can build up to three level of boost, that will activate after you release the drift button. I recommend you to release it as soon as you see three levels of boost and then drift again immeditly, there are some turns where you can do it twice! You also will be rewarded with boost for doing tricks. First, at the start of race, during countdown, you have to start the gas somewhere between '3' and '2'. Depends on each character. There are air tricks that anybody can do, you just have to press drift button while in air. But make sure to finish air trick before landing, otherwise you will lose all boost that was built up. Bikes, as said, also got ground trick where you just press up and down around. Boosting will also knock obstacles down, like balls, giant casino chips and zzzzzzoooooombies.  The game also got power-ups that are randomly chosen when you pick it up. It got a fairly standard package of them. Speeding up, bombs, rockets, rainbow that only colors screen for real players, but hits AI characters. You can also shoot boxing gloves and rockets back. Actually, you can knock off the incoming rockets by using weapon of your own, usually by shooting it back. What kind of powerps you get also depends on what place you are in. As for stopping players that managed to get really far in the first place, it got usual 'screw you' shooting star. The futher you are in the back, the more likely you will get good ones, getting triple rockets, or nuke rocket that you can detonate any time after launch. Oh, and they got all-star moves. If you are really lacking behind you may get All-Star weapon. Announcer will not be afraid to tell it to everybody either. It's really a jolly power-up, as it will not only boost you to allow you to possibly get into the top, but it gives a character-specific spin. Akira from Virtua Fighter will hit his Outrun-like car with dashing elbow. Alex Kidd will ride on his helicopter, being able to shoot little shiny missiles. And Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone will even lets you choose one of the three power-ups to use in this case. It shows off a great characters, variety and each one will play a short theme song.  You also got around 64 challenges to beat. What should I say, they are varied, changing between more standard ones and more of wacky. In one challenge you have to beat all Jet Set Radio Future tracks. In another you will beat up a huge zombie boss. Jolly. And yes, you can also unlock music tracks. You can then choose to play any one of them in tracks, making it more varied than having same song in all Billy Hatcher tracks. Pretty much all of music is taken from previous games. The only unique ones in the game are main theme 'So much more' and some other tracks used for menues, that sounds quite what you expect to hear from 90s racing games.  And since AI is the only opponent you will most likely get, he should be mentioned. You can disable 'catch-up' in options, but I would not recommend you to do this. AI just isn't strong enough to figure out how to stop you if you will be far in the lead. It actually manages to drag itself down, as the last players will keep doing All Star move that will hit main pack but will usually fail to reach the top. So, really, let this option be, it doesn't rubberband strong enough to screw you up without reason. you can still stay in the lead, it's just that single mistake will get you back into main pack of racers. Ai isn't that hard either. I was actually surprised that I managed to beat all the Advanced Grand Prix. And I was expecting it to be brutal at it's best. But I guess they tried to kept it fair.  AI also playes pretty well, althrough there are some constant thing about it. Some characters are better than others. Some drag behind. For sure, most of the time you will be seeing Shadow The Hedgehog on his bike on top. And you will learn to hate him, as he keeps popping up on top and getting on second place in Grand Prix, where you will even want to pay extra attention to drag him down too, so you will have more breathing air in total scoring. Bonanza Bros also somehow manage to stay on top. And then you got characters like Big and Eggman who keep staying in the last places and spam their All-Stars move. Which will make Eggman, for example, start spamming rockets around, but will fail to reach you. And you will be hearing announcer talking about them alot. Oh. AND AIAI GOT BANANAS, BETTER WATCH OUT! And then you got Amigo, who will somehow be on both sides: Staying on top and getting All-Star move going where he gets on top anyway. At least his conga all-star is fun, making others dance behind.  SEGA All-Stars Racing is pretty fun racing. Easy to pick up and play, addictive. One of the best 'kart-racing', especially on PC where it just doesn't have so much competition. The only shame is that it doesn't support any online features. It also has some exclusive content that you will not get in All-Stars Racing Transformed. At least from what I heard. Tracks are unique for sure.",

I expected as much, it being the newer title, but there are some issues I am already having with this one. Issues I feel make this game annoying as ♥♥♥♥.  I liked the idea of this one not having the 'Transforming' action of the next title, but I am having a hard time enjoying the game. Several levels are buggy, and lag a ridiculous amount. I had to stop and check my system, because I assumed it was a big update or something, causing the HDD speed to suffer. No, it is the game.  I don't know if that is just my rig, if something is weird right now, I dont know. But I find it annoying, and it does not affect all levels. The Billy Hatcher race has the worst of the first four tracks, really makes it hard to win a race.  I tried adjusting the config, but it doesnt seem to matter what I put in, as it does not save it apparently. Similar to issues I had with the Sonic Adventure games, and rather annoying to find big name products with so little bug support.  If the game runs fine, it is a decent title to play. Not nearly as good as Transformed, but it is obvious what things were changed, and why.  If you are considering a purchase, I would say go with Transformed.",

Being stuck on arrows is bad enough.. especially since my right hand would do better for using other controls. But the fact that It doesn't support a controller for some reason, or at least my brand new out of the box Logitec F315. I had to go download Joytokey just so I can actually play the game with a bit of comfort.  I am displeased about the lack of customizable control schemes.. but in a whole I still love the game.
