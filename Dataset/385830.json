The level is just walking left to right, shooting the same enemies in the same configuration listening to the same five seconds of music over and over. The developers were very lazy on putting effort into this game. They put a guide on steam guides advising you can change character, why is this not in the game? Pure 100% lazy. If you want gun upgrades, you'll need a lot of cash, to get cash, you'll need to do the same levels over and over. All levels will not give you any cash unless you beat the level, some levels will flat out not give you any cash because they won't end like Survival or the Sniper stage",

            "review_text": "Despite having a stupid name, this game has a good idea but unfortunately falls flat in execution.  The story sounds pretty cool: 'a small group of German soldiers are sent to a small town to investigate strange activities. The story writes itself as they face off against monsters, aliens and other baddies.'   From the sounds of it, this could've been a good good shoot 'em eup with zombies and guns. The sour note however, is that this game falls at even being playable in the slightest. The controls are terrible and hardly responsive, you constantly run out of ammo/ grenades considering that the baddies are bullet sponges.  'Burgers' also goes so far as to not allow you to USE your knife. O_o What kind of black magic is this? Its as if this game wa made to enrage gamers, instead of entertain them. Burgers are supposed to be tasty. They're not supposed to taste like rotting zombie flesh.  The game also has challenges that add some other gameplay aspects that are good but not used well at all some examples are some sci-fi upgrades, a mech-suit and other weapons. And its due to bad controls.   With this in mind, leveling up your character, and decent graphics don't do the game justice. If gameplay hardly has any redeemable quality, like with what this game has; then its safe to safe to say that this game was rushed, instead of developed. I doubt the developers even tested this game. It's a shame that this game blows like the wind, and it could've been fun, if it spent more time in development. 1/10  ",

            "review_text": "The first impressions I had from this game were not the best at first but it quickly changed my mind once I gave a fair shot. Burgers is inspired by games like Castle Crashers where mindless co-op fun takes place. The idea is not original at all but I see this is coming from a new developer in the industry so consider that when providing useful feedback or even when playing the game.  The story is about a group of soldiers who were deployed for a mission that turned out to be more dangerous than expected and not with the enemies they had in mind. In order to save the world (cliché, I know) they have to ignore their main mission for a greater cause. At your disposal, you have several sorts of weapons that you can buy with some funny names with different designs as well. As you advance in the game you will level up and acquire money for said weapons which will become very useful in later levels. Speaking of the levels, there aren’t many of them and I guess that the small price reflects on the small content the game has to offer. Still, it can be a quick side distraction for those dead hours or if you just want a quick gaming session without having to worry about complex tutorials or something similar.  At this point there is no local co-op which can be a deal breaker for some, however I believe that this a feature that will planned for their next game. Still, it was a big missed opportunity. In the end, I believe this game can be worth your time, just don’t expect a quality story driven game or even a original concept, otherwise you will be disappointed.  ",

It's a boring shooting/fighting game, scrolling left to right, 2D. I would have described it as a 'boring shooting game', but you run out of bullets quite quickly, and have to resort to your knife.  I made it up to the end of level 4. Fought the boss with bullets, grenades, flamethrower, and laser - until no ammo was left for any of the weapons; carried on with my knife, fighting the boss when my health bar was up (and spending ages running around in circles, waiting for my health to creep up so I could attack him again), but the boss stayed on full health. What a waste of time. [I read another review, which said that the level 5 boss stayed on full health - so, that player had a similar problem.]  For the first levels, just run left to right, avoiding the enemy - or shoot as well, if you want to. For other levels, conserve your ammo, and shoot the barrels of fuel when a mob of monsters are close. Use your knife against the monsters, then wait (or run away) until your health bar fills up. Save your bullets and grenades for the level boss.  Not the worst game ever, but it is a waste of time. Not impressive, even as an 'el cheapo' game.",
