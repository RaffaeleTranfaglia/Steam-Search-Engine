            "review_text": "The Archetype is an episodic indie horror game that puts us in the shoes of Archty Tolomei, a 9 years old boy suffering from several mental illnesses (schizophrenia, for instance), emotional and physical abuse from his mother and father (respectively). Each episode will contain a piece of Archty’s life, ranging from his adolescent years to his last moments on Earth.   Right now, I can only discuss chapter 1 since it’s the only chapter available at the moment. This review will be updated as more chapters are added.  In Chapter 1, we explore Archty’s childhood home. His mother and sisters have vanished mysteriously while his drunken father locks himself in his room, leaving Archty to fend for himself. With nothing to do, we begin searching around and uncover the truth of how the rest of his family vanished so suddenly. The story is mostly told through the notes scattered in his decrepit home and several side comments made by Archty when he encounters objects that either frightens him or bring about memories from the past. I like the story and following Archty’s tale might be an interesting adventure.  The game’s main feature is controlling Archty’s mental health and stabilizing him when he approaches anything that rattles him. Displayed on the HUD are 8 emotional traits: fear, despair, anxiety, envy, jealousy, sadness, anger, and guilt. The other 4 are libido, aggression, depression and solitude (I’m separating these 4 because they’re not exactly emotions.) These 12 influences the 4 main mental statuses. Archty can become suicidal, neurotic, psychotic and homicidal. Each are given a numerical value (0-100. 0 being neutral and 100 being, dangerous…we’re stepping into the…danger zone).   For example, at 100 anger and aggression, I observed that Archty’s homicidal tendencies are brought forward. If you disturb Archty’s father in his room, at this condition, Archty is allowed to pick up either a gun or/and an axe (both are openly found in the house for some reason) and repel the father (btw Archty has a hell of a throw if you use an axe to “take care” of the father.) There are other ways to influence Archty’s mental statuses but it’s up to the player to figure that out for themselves.   The mouse cursor is also detached from the camera, so the cursor doesn’t always follow the camera. You might be turning the camera to the right but the cursor is at the bottom of the screen. This is added to simulate Archty’s inability to focus very well due to his mental issue. This feature is annoying at the beginning and I simply had to adapt when interacting with doors and items. I wish this is optional because I just want to click “E” to select stuff. The HUD can be messy to look at with all traits on the screen at once but that is easily fixed by hiding it.  So far, the game isn’t scary but there are times when the situation shifts its direction and becomes more unsettling. Namely, when Archty is experiencing his psychotic episodes, he begins to hear whispers (random voices playing backwards). He will start hallucinating (the screen will start shaking, coupled with bright lights and impaired vision. I cannot say in confidence that this represents what a person with Schizophrenia would see through one of their episodes, however, I’ve worked with a couple of children with Schizophrenia, and some of the symptoms these kids have experienced (hearing voices that aren’t their own, clicking, visual hallucinations) are present in the game. The developers attempt to mimic them.   The two hostiles in the game, the mother and father, aren’t as threatening as you would think, with the dad wielding a bat, and the mother being a ghost, these two turned into the comic relief of the game. I say that because while I was playing, their AI was exploitable because they would not attack when I was near them. Giving them a bear hug is fine but walking away from them hurts their feelings so much, they want to kill you. I believe this will be patched but I found this glitch hilarious.   There is a scavenger hunt in the first chapter, in a form of gathering ingredients for a ritual to destroy a clingy apparition and I needed some time to gather them all. It took me about 5 hours to finish the first chapter. I got stuck for a bit.  The graphics is nothing to preach about. They’re pre-made assets from the Unity asset store so most likely, you’ll recognize the environment. Also, besides from the configuration menu that comes along any Unity game, there are no other graphical options. My small problem with the game is that there is no way to turn up the brightness. There is a flashlight but in my opinion, the throw of the light is terrible. I found myself squinting at times. That’s just me though.  I have no problems in turns of framerate drops and crashes but I’ve witness several non-gamebreaking bugs that ruins the atmosphere at times. I have read people reporting of crashing during start-up and I am unsure if this has been resolved. The developers are responsive and I’ve already brought to their attention several problems I have with their game.  All and all, chapter 1 is an okay start for The Archetype. It’s enough for me to want to see what happens next.  TL;DR  Pros: - Interesting story - Intriguing game mechanics (controlling Archty’s mental health can be difficult to manage) - Might bring some awareness to the mental illnesses mentioned in the game - Atmosphere can be unsettling at times  Cons: - Buggy  - AI is exploitable - Interacting with doors and items can be irritating - Game is too dark (needs brightness option) - Bare graphical options  - Reported crashes from a few players (not sure it’s solved yet)  If you’re somewhat interested in trying out the game after reading (or skimming) my take on The Archetype, I have a few keys I can giveaway. All I need you to do is say something in the comments below and I will pick the “winners” later throughout the week. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.  Btw, if you have the time, here is a video of me fooling around in The Archetype    The Archetype Video  ",

            "review_text": "This is my first review so here goes. The devs were nice enough to let me play and stream it before it released. I enjoyed Archetype greatly I found it build the creep factor great at least for me. The game play was good in my opinion, After playing the first chapter all I can say is I want to play the rest to fully enjoy the stpry they are trying to tell. I do recommend this game if you want a different horror experience. Sorry if this review isn't the best, im not the greatest at putting words on papper. All I can say is it's a fun and creepy game I enjoyed and thats what matters and the hell with everyone else. Sorry about taking so long to write this Devs.",

            "review_text": "I was able to try this game pre-release during a live-stream, and while there were some bugs here and there, the devs were awesome enough to hotfix on the fly, so they're definitely attentive to any problems that may arise, which is a definite plus!  As far as the game itself goes, I've had a great time with it. I feel it gives a great, creeping horror kind of feeling, which I get a lot more enjoyment out of than constant jumpscares, which tend to wear thin after a while. The disconnected controls can sometimes make things a little difficult to focus your view on, but with what Archty has going on in his head...well...it just ends up adding something to it. It starts to feel like a disconnect between your hands and your mind, which actually ends up being a pretty effective way to express his instability..It's not easy for him to focus on things, so why have his focus be locked to the center of the screen? It ends up disorienting you, forcing you to focus more on what you're trying to do, so that when the game does unleash one of its scares on you, it catches you completely off-guard because you'll glimpse something out of the corner of your eye, question whether you saw it or not, then get hit in the face with it when you go for a second look. So I can see how it can be frustrating, but thematically I feel like it really makes sense.   Now that the game's released, I definitely plan to start going through and seeing how various things affect the different states, there's chances for a lot of things here, and for it being a first game from a 2 person team, I was impressed. Definitely can't wait to see the effects the events of Chapter 1 are going to leave on Archty in the coming chapters, especially as the team hones their skills to the fine point of an ice pick, to bury in our mental states.",
