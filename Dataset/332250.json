            "review_text": "I picked this up as part of a Humble Bundle and it was a fantastic surprise. The colours, music, and modern take on the Odysseus legend were all beautifully done. The weapons were great fun too (the harpoon is awesome!). In short, there is no game quite like this on Steam (though the pure racing levels do remind me somewhat of Super Laser Racer).  Other reviews correctly note the short length of the main campaign (about 3 hours). However, completing the campaign unlocks additional levels, and a time trial mode. For some, these added features may still not quite justify the $13 price tag, but on sale it is an absolute steal.",

            "review_text": "Really nice F-Zero inspired game. This game has a cool anime style mixed with the F-Zero SNES graphics. Of course this looks a lot better than a SNES game, but you can see its style is heavily inspired by the F-Zero series. Gameply is fast and furious, same old controls can be used from the old days as well. Tight controls, really fun to play IMO. There is a nice story mode and I recommend this game to anybody that ever enjoyed F-Zero games in the past.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR: Very nice mix between micromachines and F-Zero, varied solo gameplay, lots of potential multiplayer fun! Too bad there is only local multiplayer for now  ------ Didn't quite finish the solo yet (some missions are hard ;)) but spent time enough (several hours, although many offline) to get a good opinion.   This game is GOOD (but hard)! You could view it as a mix of several games. The solo campaign makes you follow a tragicomic story of Penelope trying to find her husband throughout the universe. On each planet you'll visit, you'll get access to a special equipemnet that you'll have to use to finish a specific challenge, a classic race against opponents or defeat a boss: laser, teleport, trip mines and such... The level design of each planet nicely revolves around the specific item, making it easy to understand. With that said, you'll still needs good skills and concentration to win!  Didn't have a chance yet to fully test the multiplayer, it's more like a traditional Micromachines with equipment: choose a power then race to the point of being a screen away from your opponents.   All in all: - Story: Nice. Although plot keeps basic in writing, dev put much effort in making the story funny and distracting, and the idea of reusing a classic mythological story in such a way gives it a nice refresher. - Graphics: as anything related to taste, you may or may not like it. In any case, every detail (character design, races, ships) follows a coherent design and gameplay-related objects (like energy) is easily identifiable. - Music: I'm not particularly fond of the genre, yet it is well adapted to the settings. Serves the gameplay well. - Gameplay: while I regret a bit that you cannot manage yourself the ship's speed (it's at constant speed), the variety of powerups and evident effort in designing original challenges makes up for it and far more. - Multi: local only (for now?), but probably as fun as Micromachines/Rock&amp;RollRacing could be... Which is great! :)",

The visuals are beautiful, the music and sound effects are nice, the races and boss battles are creative, and the overall game is a blast to play.  The only negative is a relatively short main story (I finished it in about 2.5 hours). Despite this, the game is a blast to play, and I highly recommend you check it out.",

            "review_text": "I havent played enough of this game to give a solid review, however, i felt the need to write one from what i have seen so far.  Put simply, I think this game would be better off as just a visual narrative adventure. The character artwork, dialog and general story setting (as an almost side view of the odyssey) are fantastic and make me want to see it to the end. But every time i get to a race im just utterly bored. In my opinion there is way too much 'flashyness' going on, just lights everywhere and I can just faintly tell whats going on, or when im supposed to turn. Then, on top of the disorenting lights at high speeds the camera is zoomed in too close for comfort, which makes me feel like i have even less reaction time. Even more so the game has, in my opinion, a lack luster voice that speakes to you when you win or lose or start a match. I cant tell if its robot or human or alien and it seems so lazily done that I have to ask, why even? I mean, the levels I have played so far are so short that simply postive and negitive sounds would have sufficed. I would have even been fine with victory / failure reinforcing sounds be left at just the sound of the match start and when you get 'Wrecked'.   Any how, these things to me would not necessarily be a deal breaker. The main issue that I have with this game is the steering. Now perhaps I just suck alot, but even after playing with both a gamepad and keyboard, I find the steering to be clunky and lazy. Its a mission on its own just to get my ship moving in a straight line while racing and I feel like that is a huge deal in a racing game. Sure I could just slam on the boost and sloppily bumper my way through levels, but that just doesent feel right. Polishing this more would have totally saved this game for me.  TLDR; This game has some great asthetics, but the racing aspect seems to just be a means to an end to have active gameplay to an otherwise interesting narrative.",
