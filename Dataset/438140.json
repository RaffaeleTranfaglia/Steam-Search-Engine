As the Steam page very much tells you:  F2P: Play vs AI, short campaign.  B2P: Play online, play vs AI with difficulty options, longer campaign.  That having been said, it's a fun deck-building game with nice sci-fi art, played lots of it on Android and on PC pre-Steam. And if it interests you (and you're not just here because you saw 'free to play') then definitely give it a try.",

            "review_text": "Build a deck. Then DO something with it.  In Star Realms, you will build your fleet from a common deck as the game goes on. Much like with other deck builders, you start with a little purchasing power. Unlike other deck building games, you also start with a pair of Viper attack fighters. That's right; no dead or useless cards.  As you build your deck - really a fleet and supporting space stations - you will use your might to go on the offensive against your opponent. Each turn you will play cards with currency, or buying power, and attack power. The former will be used to buy better ships and stationsl the latter, you will use to actually attack your opponent and their stations.   Star Realms is fast and fun. The game plays smoothly. Its easy to learn. And while it will never have the depth of a Magic or even some other deck building games, what it does have are quick turns, fast, varied game play that is easy to pick up and just enough depth and variation to add some important decisions along the way.  Highly recommended for fans of deck building games.",

The digital version of the game is serviceable and a fantastic way to learn how to play Star Realms overall. The core gameplay is great and finely balanced, but the design of the digital version just pushes me to play the physical card game instead. The software is ok, but limited and the game isn't very clear on what you unlock if you buy certain versions of the full game.   If you're interested in learning how to play, this is a great tutorial and the campaign mode is fun for a couple hours. The gameplay will get you hooked, but the best experience is to play over the table, I think.",

Very little luck in the base game both gambits and events add quite a lot of luck, and I'm not saying don't get them but if you would rather the game be fully skill based you are missing out on very little by skipping those dlc packs. the other ship/building based dlc packs are both great.   People who get mad that this game isn't in it's full version should read the page. In no way was the dev  lying  to you. You simply didn't look at the page and got mad, so really you tricked yourself and shouldn't take it out in a  review  if you can call it that. That just says 'oh wow not really free to play dropped'",

If you like deckbuilding games (think of dominion) this is one of the best and PC version is really good, it runs well, interface works, visuals are good, it even comes with a neat campaign and online multiplayer (the paid version that is) and heck even the AI is decent. Yeah, if you are into deckbuilding games or are looking for a place to start getting into them you need this! Also its free, so try it out, if you like the gameplay the paid version is more than worth it.",

The problem is that these bugs are too common of an occurance, the game also does this non-realtime thing were its only updated at the end of a turn, IE you do not see your enamies turn in real time. I also have concerns over the buisness model as it heavily segments the player bases between the haves sand have not's.  and dev's if you are reading this, spend like a month or two just fixing bugs please",

It certainly wasn't as complex as Dominion or as thematic as Thunderstone. I wouldn't have belived Star Realms would become my favourite deckbuilding game.   Dominion is just as engrossing and if I had a chance to play it more I might prefer it. But here's the thing: Dominion has to work hard to be good. It has to have lots of cards with interesting mechanics and make the players track their turns carefully. Star Realms is just casually awesome. It is fundamentally more exciting in concept. There is anticipation in seeing what ships the trade row delivers (especially once you know what they all are), tough and dangerous decisions to be made in choosing what ships to take and how to built your deck, and tension in the direct competition of blows as you race to be the fastest to beat down your opponent — and pretty much nothing else to get in the way of those elements. If Dominion had cards as simple as Star Realms it'd be crap. If Star Realms had cards as interesting as Dominion it would blow every other deckbuilding game out of the water.",

Even with dozens of cards in its deck, the A.I will always draw the exact cards it needs 9 times out of 10, leading to six Bases in play at any given time that are replaced faster than they can be destroyed, drawing 7-8 extra cards a turn, accumulating more than a dozen trade points a turn and constantly inflicting 20+ damage every turn are just some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game manages to do.  Even if you argue I just suck at the game, I just watched the A.I play five scouts (1 trade each) and then buy the Command Ship which costs 8.
