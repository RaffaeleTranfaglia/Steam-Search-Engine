            "review_text": "I didn't hear about this game until about a week before launch, but I'm glad it did get pointed out to me. It's short, but sweet. My first run through took me a bit over 4 hours, with some getting lost but not finding every upgrade.  The Metroidvania style exploring is fun, although a better map would be nice. Toward the end of the game you get an upgrade which lets you see more details on your mini-map, but it would have been nice to have something like that from the start. Or at least let it apply once you've explored each area of the map.  For the most part, the boss battles hit a perfect level of challenge for me. A couple of them were pretty easy, but most of them required a number of tries, sometimes dying very quickly, but generally learning a bit more about their patterns each time. Some of them have definitely got some bullet hell going on, so hopefully you're into that kind of thing.  I found the music generally pretty suitable. The pixel art on some of the non-hostile fish was a bit blurry, but everything else looked quite good. I think a good job was done on the sound design, too. Especially the squelching noises.  If you're easily frustrated this might not be for you, but if you're up to throwing yourself into a grinder to get a little bit better at a fight each time, there's fun to be had here. Just try not to curse too much when you get trapped between an enemy and a wall and torn apart in a second.",

            "review_text": "I've really been enjoying this overall; I love the idea, and the graphical representation (it often reminds me of a short browser game called Small Worlds). There's been a few bugs, ie: when I had the first boss down to minimal health it just sat there and let me kill it, but nothing game-breaking. The biggest annoyance I've found is that the game slows down considerably when it pans in/out (which happens a lot) and when there's a lot of stuff moving on the screen (which again, happens a lot because: fish). This has made the second boss I encountered a real pain as there is a mix of fast and slow moving attacks..which both seem slow until suddenly the game picks back up. And the slow-down is really the only downside I've encountered thus far; I'd certainly reccommend giving it a shot.",

I backed the game on Kickstarter from the start and attended it's beta-testing! :P  So, yeah. You gotta try it. ;)  I just nominated this game for the The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Steam Award. ^_^ 2016-11-25.",

            "review_text": "The Earth is dead, well at least above sea level, and as the humans move to the sea and use up the resources there as well they are put into a desperate situation. They must send submarine like ships into a wormhole in the sky to see if they can find a new habitable place to live. That's where you come in. You are one of the brave pilots to go through the wormhole, but something strange happens. You return to Earth but a million years into the future. There appears to be no one left alive, and it is up to you to explore and discover what happened under the sea.  This is a challenging game, The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human, that will have you pulling your hair out one minute, and then getting lost in the music and the retro-graphics the next minute. The reason why I say you'll be pulling your hair out is because you are going to be set with a certain amount of limitations that you'll have to unlock, or solve in order to advance the game. The thing is that in order to truly advance you will have to take on the bosses, and none of them are push-overs. Hell the first boss might take you a couple of tries to beat, and it only gets tougher from there.  As I mentioned before this game has retro-graphics. You are not going to be blown away by any photo-realistic graphics, but you will feel like you are playing a polished game from the past. There are several different locations, all with their own look that will have you wondering what exactly happened. You will travel through ruined underwater cities, through a sea of pipes, a warehouse, and more. There is definitely plenty to see, not to mention the fact that all the bosses have their own look which might haunt you in your dreams if you can't defeat them in combat.  To be honest the difficulty in this game REALLY only centers around the bosses, outside of that its just a matter of dodging some projectiles, avoiding corrosive gas, and keeping very far away from snapping clams. That's not to say that you can't die while just exploring the underwater world, believe me I learned that if you go straight at a floating mine you will die on impact.  The game is broken up by the power ups you gain as you play. You'll get a harpoon gun, which shoots from the bottom of the craft, and doesn't aim further up than parallel to the bottom of the ship, you'll also get a saw that will power through shining vines, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The one thing I recommend doing is finding out where the second boss on is and then exploring every nook and cranny to see if there are power ups for your hull recovery or the hull strength. You will need ever single one of those power ups if you are going to survive.  Alright so here's the one issue with the game, and to be honest with you it's not a deal breaker, but its very annoying, and it has to do with the checkpoint system. You have to consciously interact with each checkpoint, while not fighting a boss, in order to respawn there. If you don't you will respawn somewhere far from where you last started and so you are left backtracking a ton, sometimes losing where and what you were previously doing.  There's also the area maps. I would have loved to uncover the map as I'm moving through the area so I know where I've searched on the screen, but instead as soon as you hit a new screen the entire map is displayed leaving you to wonder if you've been to that screen before, and if so have you searched EVERY inch of it. You never know what could be hiding in that section.  This game is not going to be for everyone. It is challenging enough that its going to scare away some of the people who don't like on the fly strategy and some luck when it comes to bosses, but that being said this is a game that you're going to keep coming back to because either you want the challenge, or maybe you just want to shoot the poor defenseless fish that can't actually hurt you, but you sure as hell can massacre each and everyone on the screen, over and over again. This game gets an 8.6 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "It's all relaxing exploration and taking in the atmosphere, wondering what happened to all the humans... ...untill you get run over by a giant worm as high as a skyscraper that spits it's babies at you. And the bosses only get more dangerous after that.  The good:    Beautiful pixel art underwater world with lots of (mostly) harmless fishies to admire, or shoot if you feel like it.    Fun exploration, every part of the map feels new and different, exploration pays off and the save system makes sure you do not have to travel too far if you get yourself killed.    Interesting story and haunting visuals of slowly collapsing cities.    Good save system that (mostly) saves your game right before bosses so you can decide to look for more upgrades if you feel overpowered.    And the bosses, oh those bosses. Every boss is unique and requires a different approach and sometimes clever use of the weapons you found to defeat them. Experimentation and finding the right tools can be the difference between success or failure.    Bosses are sometimes VERY difficult, but not in a very frustrating way, since you always get rewarded for experimenting with your weapons and tactics, plus you can destroy some of their 'weapons' to skew the fight in your favour.    The devs are very active with bugswatting and advice in my experience.   And the bad(ish):     The quicktravel map is not very clear, but gets the job done.    No total map view as far as I could find, but this is just a minor quibble.    One irritating save during 'The Chaingang' bossfight, but you can escape the fight if you explore the arena so you can tackle it later.    A few crashes, but nothing game breaking and it looks like the devs are on top of it.   So it's a lot like shadow of the colossus, underwater with monster fish and that is a very good thing.",

Non-linear gameplay. The story is told through in-game lore, not cutscenes, and it's up to you to decipher how the events actually happened. There's a logbook on the bosses that you fight. And lastly, the beautiful ambience music. Shadow of the Colossus: Simple, besides exploring, the other half of this game is fighting humongous creatures. All the battles are amazing and also pretty hard. Makes both finding and defeating the creatures exciting.  Oh, and lastly, dinosaurs didn't last 65 million years!!! They went extinct 65 million years ago but lasted about 160 millions. That really, really bothered me. Other than that play this game!",
