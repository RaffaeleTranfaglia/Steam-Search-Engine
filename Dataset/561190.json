            "review_text": "Bamboo EP is composed of two very distinct games and one amusing menu screen.  Bamboo Ball: A very fun little dodgeball-esque minigame that is distinctly lacking in features. The ai isnt worth spending much time with and the multiplayer is limited to 1v1. I breifly played the multiplayer and amdmitedly its great but I cant help but feel options for 2v2, number of pegs/balls, and ai difficulties would give this half of the EP more legs. As it stands Bamboo ball is the b-side of the EP.  Bamboo Hearts: A side scrolling ninja combat game that in some ways reminds me of The Legend of Kage, mostly how acrobatic the combat feels. The mechanics are simple but every fight is very dynamic. So far in my early playtime I haven't found a tatic or approach to even the basic enemies that guarentees and easy kill... and also the music is perfect.  Final thoughts: Bamboo Hearts is worth the price and everything else is extra. I'm really hoping for a Bamboo Hearts LP or Just Bamboo hearts 2 I guess.",

            "review_text": "Would definitely recomend this game to anyone, as long as they can handle a little difficulty. The entire package has an colorful and pleasing look to it.   As for the games contained there is Bamboo Ball is a fun/unique enough sports game with a little bit of challenge. Bamboo Moon is a enjoyable and relaxing title screen swimming experience. Bamboo Heart is a surprisingly deep and stands out to me as a game that I want to keep playing. I would definitely recommend this game just for Bamboo Heart as it itself is well worth the price of the game. OH there's also Bamboo Duel that you can unlock and play a 2-4 person multiplayer version of Bamboo Heart.  Bamboo Heart is a Katana Dueling side scrolling action game that is challenging but rewarding if you learn the mechanics and tricks. With quick, snappy controls, surprisingly deep combat, multiple character unlocks, and 'boss' enemies spawning in different orders the game feels incredibly replayable. I want to go back to this game occasionally just because it feels incredibly satisfying. (PS: Please make more of this?)  As for performance there does seem to be something wrong with Bamboo Heart. While there isn't anything noticable at the start, once kills start to rack up (around 50+) the game can slow down significantly. Besides that it ran very well.",
