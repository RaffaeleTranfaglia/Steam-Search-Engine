            "review_text": "This is a 'game' best played on some weed when youre really tired. Its extremely relaxing and lovely to look at- a perfect title to unwind with.   Its AI is rather ignorant and all battles amount to 'charge- jump over their charge- charge the other way- jump over their charge- ETC' so theyre pretty simple.   Quests are nonsensical (a man asks you to recruit members into his church? Wuh...?? Oh, theyre literally right outside the door, cool) and require little to zero thought, which makes this even more of a title to relax to.  Theres supposed to be some message about reincarnation or killing nature or something, but I never really 'got it' (because aside from the intro screens and some asinine quests theres no real story progression).  If you treat it like the 'laser light show' that it is- AKA 'kick back, let your brain go into neutral and look at the pretty things'- you may enjoy this one.  Otherwise, if youre looking for 'legit' platforming, story, quests or enemies, well....this unfortunately doesnt have much of any. Keep running right til the game ends.  As a member of the Cervine blood, I really wanted to like this game more than I did. It had lots of potential. Optimally, this shouldve been a 'Metroidvania' type of game- a maze which you couldnt progress through without 'X' skill.  Unfortunately, as a member of the gaming community since the mid 80's, Id suggest you pass on this one unless you really, really like deer or those type of quiet, pretty games that ultimately put you to sleep.   I wish Steam would allow a 'NEUTRAL' recommendation, cuz I honestly cant approve or disapprove, depending on how you take the title. Youve heard what I have to say about it at least!",

            "review_text": "This is pretty much Deer Simulator where you play through the life of a Deer. It sounds really interesting at first as it's a platforming where you play as a deer and fight for survival... however it is poorly executed and here's why.  Pros: ♦ Graphically Stunning (It has some pretty amazing graphics for what it is) ♦ Controls just work (Most peoples biggest complaint in a platformer/fighter is hitbox or jumpbox is off, but in this all controls seem to run smoothly when using a keyboard) ♦ Has nice number of Achievements (Not too many not too few) ♦ Has Trading Cards (It doesn't say it on the Store Page for some reason, but it has trading cards, which is why this will also be a con as it's misleading) ♦ Great intro Cinematic with Voice Over (It was one of the best cinematics for an intro, I've seen in a long time) ♦ Ingame sound/music is eargasmic (Really fitting and relaxing ingame sounds and music)  Cons: ♦ No full ingame options menu, only the Unity outside game one (This is annoying as the outside game Unity options menu is limited and normally buggy, from experience with most games that use it, it normally is buggy. Therefore, it's really annoying that you can't remap controls or fully change graphics or resolution options from within the game itself) ♦ No Tutorial to explain what is going on (This is weird as I just seemed to be running right the whole game not knowing what is going on, at some point it told me I had an inventory and I never even knew until like 15mins in. Also nowhere explained to me what I do with items) ♦ No where to fully explain controls (Only the unity input menu shows limited, not all of the, controls. This is annoying as I can't view the controls again within the game) ♦ The Storyline seems Misleading due to intro cinematic (I say this because after watching the intro cinematic, I thought I'd be playing to get revenge on Poachers, but in the time I played... nothing like that was happening) ♦ Doesn't state it has Steam Trading Cards on the Store Page (This is weird as some people factor that into the price of the game, therefore, it should state whether or not it has Cards) ♦ Weak Platformer (I say this as it was very, very weak platformer as all jumps could be made easily and nothing seemed challenging. The only time I died was when jumping from above to down below, where I couldn't see and landed on Spikes, I never missed a jump) ♦ Puzzles don't reset and are hard to grasp (There are pushible blocks everywhere and half the time they don't make sense at all and if you push them in the wrong way, they don't reset, so if they become stuck... then that puzzle seems uncompleteable) ♦ Many weird blocks that seem like they should be reachable, aren't (I found this weird as I saw many things that seemed as though they should be reachable but aren't. Even if they were reachable with powers, at the time I saw them I didn't have powers as the game had just started) ♦ Baby Deer that follow you are glitched (These are suppose to be where you respawn and you can tell em to sit, however if you tell them to follow you they will for an extent and then stop or not jump up to the ledge to continue following... really weird) ♦ In game it gives you a sprawl of text when talking to NPC's (I find this weird as the Intro Cinematic had epic voice overs.. I would have assumed all NPC's would have some kind of voice over as well) ♦ Days don't seem to be do or mean anything (Nowhere explains what days are for, if they are there for a speed run or something, it makes no sense as there are no highscores or anything) ♦ Dieing ruins the game for me (When you die it seems you become small again and lose all your progress, this concept is good for people wanting a hardcore no die game, but when it takes ages to grow your deer up and you have no idea what you are doing because the game doesn't explain it at all and then you die and become a baby deer again... it just feels as though it ruins the game as you have to basically grow your deer up from scratch again which is repetitive and takes ages)  Overall, I know I am nowhere near finished this game as I've only played 35minutes of it. However, in that time, I just seemed to be running right, killing things here and there and jumping through days with no real goal other than to fully grow my deer up in the most repetitive way possible. Therefore, I found this game to be very confusing, have little to no explanation of anything, puzzles seem to be there but it's hard to tell if it's just a random block or if it's a puzzle and overall seemingly very, very repetitive running right doing the same thing over and over again for the 35minutes I played. Hence, for a $15 game it is graphically pleasing, like very pleasing... however as it is very repetitive and not very well explained, I wouldn't recommend this game. It however, does have Steam Trading Cards and Achievements so if they outway repetitive unexplained gameplay, then by all means do buy this game.  PS: Will I finish the game? One day if I want 100% of Achievements I will, otherwise unless someone can explain what to do and explain that it's not repetitive to me, I probably won't.",

For all the care that went into the art and the game systems, it's really sad that not more was done to make the moment to moment gameplay interesting or fun.",

It wasn't nearly as special and unique as I'd seen it hyped up to be, what with the kickstarter and everything. I know it's also on mobile, and I definitely would've bought it on that format, because that's what a game like this is best suited for. I play games on the computer for a more involving experience than what I ended up playing.  It's worth playing, don't get me wrong - the worlds, environments and especially the music are just gorgeous and atmospheric. It's just so adherent to the standard platformer formula that I'd much rather play it while on the go rather than at my PC. If that doesn't make much sense to you, then I apologize.",

            "review_text": "This game has amazing graphics. It has good heart, and it does very well of portraying a beautiful fantasy world. The soundtrack is phenomenal, while it does get extremely repetitive past a certain point. However, I myself am not entirely sure if it was also ready to leave Early Access. This game could use a bit more working on, to say the least.  The game is very buggy, despite the amazing background. I was in awe at the backgrounds and levels at first, until it initially got repetitive. That's okay. I can handle that, my tolerance is very high when it comes to games, and it takes me a lot to write a bad review about a game. I was able to play this game full through, glitches and all, up until the boss round. For those, who don't know the boss is an eagle who takes you to her chicks, and you are to battle both her and the chicks and win. Then you've initially beaten the game, and can replay as an elder or another species to your will.   I love that idea. I really do. However, the boss fight was painstaking. The hunger level on this game depletes at an astonishing level, and I was left starving to death (when the battle began, my hunger was on full) mid battle. If you left to get food, the eagle would reset itself and the battle would have to begin all over again. If you fell off of her very high nest, she would pursue you to a degree, then stop entirely.  I had this bug, and I fell on the wrong side of her nest. I couldn't climb back up to summon the boss back to battle me, and I reset the game after a few tries. The wall up to her is impossible to scale. It's a sheer cliff. When I returned to the menu, I discovered my progress was 15%. The game had reset itself. I had to replay the entire game twice, repeating the same levels and the same maps, finding the same elders and the same people to speak to. Initially, it was very frustrating, and I wouldn't recommend playing it if you're in the game for the plot itself, not the graphics.   Along with, a certain bug, some ledges you must be a teen to scale, which is very frustrating, as you can get stuck in nooks and crannies and starve to death before you can age up to teen level.  I wanted to love this game, but I'll have to give it a thumbs down.",

The games world and platforms seem randomly generated and so there's no way to know how you are going to start out. On my first save I encountered a huge cliff that is *insurmountable* without the toadstool to help me jump higher and once I used that to get past I encountered yet another huge ♥♥♥ cliff that I needed a toadstool for, yet there were no drops anywhere.  My second save was much the same just 10 minutes later in the game. It seems I had to rush through everything to JUST be able to jump on a turtle before it jumped off the cliff and left me, again, stuck in front of these huge cliffs. Even as an adult deer I can't jump that. And that is the WORST part about this game, is that it's not safe. One person might have an easy - almost too easy - time, while another would be unable to finish it because of the games RNG.  And so I cannot complete it, and so I cannot recommend it, even though I really want to.",
