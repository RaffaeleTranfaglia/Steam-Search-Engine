The aim of this game is to use the various ingredients at your disposal to brew magical potions. Each potion will give you a power you can unleash with the controller. The talking skull was a great touch. I just wish there was more to do in this game. For a free download there is absolutley no reason you should not.",

You stand behind a table and toss various combinations of the 3 sets of 2 ingredients into the cauldron and discover spells that way. Beyond that there are a few random items on the table to play around with (crossbow, skull, xylophone).   You will probably enjoy it for about 10-15 minutes then get bored after doing everything there is to do.",

I feel like I've figured out the vast majority of what the experience has to offer in a short period of time. I do reccomend trying this at least once and using it as an introduction to VR when friends are over.  How it runs: It has some slight lag on my rig but I'm not surprised. Nothing that kept me from having fun or made me feel ill.
