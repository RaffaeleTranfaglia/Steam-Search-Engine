    "description": "2048AD - the year in which humanity was faced with bio-terrorism. The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells. Because of this, a special unit was formed by mercenaries who opposed human experimentation.",

So Strafing is useless. - No indication about being hit by bullets. - Autoaim but bad hit detection. You see an enemy stuck on a corner... can't hit him because his center must be vissible. - And stuck on corners they get, because there's no pathfinding. Enemies charge straight towards you or strafe by random event. ",

            "review_text": "Broken controls make this basically unplayable, even if you want to like it. Mouse movement is jerky and erratic, past a certain speed it will just stop. There's no sensitivity slider and no key rebinding. I'd like to point out that the latter was standard even in the 90's. My impression of the first level wasn't much better, endlessly repeated ugly wall textures and low resolution rendering make for a jerky, disorienting, motion sickness inducing mess. The music seems to be pretty good and the DOS aesthetics are right, but the game isn't functional enough to be enjoyable, and seems low effort beyond that.",
