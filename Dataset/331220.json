The gameplay is stellar and you always end up having a great time. The only thing they need is online multiplayr instead of LAN, otherwise this game is definitely one of the better games out there. 9/10",

Thief Town is a game where you, and however many other people, are placed in a game, with many other AIs. Your goal is to try and find out who the other people are by memorizing the way the people walk, etc. And when you find out who said player is, you 'stab' the player who you think is real, causing them to bleed. It's almost like Last Person Standing, but in a crowd of people. It is very hard how to determine who people are, especially in 4 player. 2 Player mode is just as fun.   DOWNSIDE!!! No online multiplayer.  9/10 ",

Very similiar to  Hidden in Plain Sight .  Its cheap. Its short. Its *mildly* entertaining in short bursts. I played with a group of three people and we quickly wanted to go back to our usual games.    No, I don't recommend getting this, simply because there is so little gameplay, and overall reaction was very meh for my group of friends.   Things that could be improved on? I don't know honestly. I'd say it overall lacks any kind of complexity that keeps a group interested. There is very little skill involved.",

For some idiotic reason every player have to setup his own control layout after joining. Gameplay is too random, there is no point in concealing yourself amongst other thiefs since the screen is too small and you can simply stab three guys at once and kill your foes by accident.",
