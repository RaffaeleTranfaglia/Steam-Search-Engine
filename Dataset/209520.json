            "review_text": "☺ Easy to play. ☺ Lovely visuals. ☺ Brilliantly realised Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps.  ☹ Unchallenging. ☹ Wonky physics. ☹ Drunk AI Drivers.  (Note: This game was played with a controller).  Mini Motor Racing EVO is a casual top down racer suitable for most ages, with easy to grasp controls and an aesthetic that greatly reminds me of playing with toy cars as a youngster.  While there is a decent selection of maps (and most notably the Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps are brilliantly realised), they quickly become repetitive as you play them again and again through the championships - in forward, reverse and with the camera on a slightly different angle (which is a surprisingly clever way of making the same track play a little differently). There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.  While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.  The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track. There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.  At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.  It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track.",

But.. physics are just outrages. Your car bumps on many invisible bumps on the road. If you improve handling it starts making circles if you turn a little bit harder. You can make you car fast and leap far ahead, but then you will chase the last ones and they will DEVASTATE you and make you lose the race. Yes, AI is stupidly aggressive, just going straight ahead to kill you, no matter what, on turns on long straights, etc.",

Routes are mirrored or the camera angle changes to the feeling to convey it would be other routes.  Through the editor it is possible to create your own routes and upload them to the workshop.

I struggled with the controls a bit on the Xbox 360 controller. So used to normal racing games where the analog sticks mimic a steering wheel, and that doesn't apply at all here. It's more like you move the stick in the direction you want the car to go. I found that incredibly awkward for a racing game. Maybe its just me.  I can't really recommend this for adult gamers, but maybe if you have kids they'd like it. There's not enough here to keep me playing beyond the first set of races. It just doesn't do anything for me.",

It will also appeal to anybody that really liked RC Pro-AM or Super Offroad, the cars have similar handling.

I did not enjoy being bounced around the track by the other cars. If you can keep first place you will not notice this however if your in second or third be prepared to get knocked around other cars. I have not tried online. I did bring this up in forum about 6 months ago and crickets so far. I dont expect them to patch this any more then they already have. AI is dumb to the point of being unfun.

No, it has a few issues like the commonly mentioned physics being a bit out of whack at times but it's such a great game and lots of fun. I will say this though, I actually prefer it on the iPhone and the controls are fantastic for that version. You're missing out on steam workshop and the TF2/Portal tracks that way but it's still great. The game has some good music for it as well, which brings up pretty much my only real complaint.. no way to download or purchase a soundtrack.",

This one has good visuals, tight controls and cool content from other games such as Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Fruit Ninja.The problem though is that you have to race the same tracks too many times for each championship, the other driver AI isn't very intelligent and there's nobody to play online. It's a good game overall, not great. I would recommend you wait for a sale if you are curious about the game.",

The cars are really cute, the maps are just the right size and look great, and the music is groovy to race by and suits each map perfectly.  Racing is mostly fun and the cars handle as you would expect, however the AI is a complete joke. Instead of actually racing intelligently, the AI approach is demolition-derby. This starts out as a minor annoyance, but as you progress through the different championships it gets worse and worse to the point you just want to scream.  A couple of times I encountered bugs in the car selection / upgrade menu that forced me to manually shut down the game. One time it caused me to lose 2 hours of progress because the game needs to close down gracefully before it saves your progress. To prevent future occurrences of that I had to QTD and restart about every 5 races :/  Multiplayer is dead and one of the achievements is so stupid (have $100,000 career cash in your wallet) that to get it you'll have to beat the game, THEN play an additional 10+ hours beating the same races over and again.  Wow the more I write the more I realize that, despite that I've beaten it 100% with all achievements, I basically hate this game.  4 out of 10",

The Isometric viewpoint gives you a good look at the nicely realised themed tracks, and it adds to the challenge in much the same way as it did in Rock'n'Roll Racing - by not letting you see too far ahead.  Physics are good, with the cars generally feeling well connected with the road. The road surface affects grip and some adaptation of driving style is required to succeed.  There is a decent roster of cars to choose from and unlock - and they can be upgraded as you proceed through career mode. I've only really used one, though (Gulf liveried sports racer), and I suspect that using one of the others now (in career mode) would mean starting from base-specs and having to grind my way through leveling up again - a shame you can't port your progress over to a different vehicle.  As with the three games I referenced, the AI is pretty wild. They basically do their own thing, and if you are in their way they try to drive through you. I've seen a number of reviewers suggest that the AI tries to 'take out' the player, but I've seen no evidence of this.  Overall, a fun game - though no classic.",
