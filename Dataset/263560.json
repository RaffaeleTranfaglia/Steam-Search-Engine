            "review_text": "Kickstarter success! What a steal, only $5. This is a great FP dungeon crawler RPG, heavily influenced by some of the best old school games such as the Wizardry titles. Very unique looking art design, and most importantly: no hand holding at all! The enemies offer fun challenges, it's not just generic trash mobs, with each level having its own unique elements and combat will require some use of tactics. There are different companions you can choose from, with many different viable party set-ups. Each main level has optional puzzles and hidden secrets; exploration is very enjoyable. The only downside is perhaps the music, which I thought didn't really fit the game. It would have been a much more atmospheric experience had the music been darker, more suspenseful. I chose to mute it and play to the Fallout 1 soundtrack ^^",

I want to support indie games, and the premise that this is based on - an homage to the choose-your-own-adventure books spawned of the 80's - is one very near and dear to my heart. At first, it even looked good, with the charming reproduction of pen-and-paper outsider art baked into everything you look at. But that charm quickly wears away, and what you're left with is grinding, bugs, and a seething, unfortunate sort of RPG genericness.  The battle system is quickly understood, and whatever quirkiness and customization the party-summon mechanic brings is quickly locked away behind a gruesome wall of grinding. The battles get very old, very fast, with little strategy beyond 'kill the guys with the annoying abilities first'. Even the outsider-art graphics get old, as you see so damn much of the same damn thing. I could write the story out on a bar napkin. By spitting on it. And then there are the rampant bugs, that make a dull experience into an infuriating one - doors that don't work, crashes when you return to town.  This game came from a good place, and had a good start, but it's awful. Don't do it. Not even on sale.",

            "review_text": "So addicting! At first, the game feels a little monotonous, especially the fighting. But once you get past Block 2, your party and the enemies begin to develop new and more interesting skills that may take a little strategy to handle. I love how your summons gain experience and level even if they're not in your 'active' party, that way you can switch party members to suit your needs, or if you're having trouble completing an area. SAVE OFTEN! As far as I can tell, there is no auto-save. Which is fine, it just takes a little getting used to after playing every game that has an auto-save function. So far I love the story and the humor, such a great trip to the past to what games in the late 80's used to be like. No crazy graphics (my crappy computer thanks you) and animations, while minimal, get the point across. From what I have seen or read about this game online, I judge to be about halfway through the game, and all I can think about is finishing it!   If I had to pick one thing I like most about Paper Sorcerer, it would be the replay value. I'm already planning my next summons for after I complete this playthrough!  And for everyone complaining about the visuals: This game is supposed to be a sendback to the RPG games of the 1980's, the era that this genre came to life through computers and consoles. Before games like this one were made in the 80's, you had to read a book to experience the Fantasy genre. The fact that this game, and the creators from Ultra Runaway Games, decided to pay homage to that industry-changing decade, makes me love it even more! Plus, it's called PAPER Sorcerer. Not just because it includes aspects from a paper-based RPG game... It looks like crinckled paper!  Sorry if that's offensive to you people who don't like the way it looks.   Anyways, highly recommended!",

            "review_text": "Paper Sorcerer is a tale of two vastly different experiences. One part being the popular genre of dungeon crawling turn based role playing games. The other part in the exploration of a sleek monochrome three-dimensional environment where areas are set apart more by their flourishing shadows than light sources. Each different stage you fight your way through and clear leads to widely varying stages both in combat to look of the three-dimensional environments.   Your player character, a sorcerer stuck in a magical book, summons a party of your choosing and sets off to escape. The game features difficult turn-based combat which serves as blarney for the grognards and a hit off the nostalgia bong for the rest of us. These two experiences juxtaposed to each other are quite disjointed, but in the end itâ€™s a game criminally under-priced. You should really give this game a try.",

While its old-school turn based combat would seem boring its unique Skill &amp; Energy system changes everything, so you no longer mash Attack and instead encourages you to find combinations of debuffs, buffs, effects, and damage type that is very satisfying. Love the minion collection and random loot with some great Skills &amp; Spells, as well as the set monster placement with only random encounters in a 'special optional (but recommended) dungeon levels'.  The art style blends well into the creative narrative of being trapped in a book, while the music is quite fun and as soon as it becomes repetitive new music enters at the right time. The puzzles are not overly difficult and the writing is simple but never becomes a bore to read.  My only want is more information on my enemies &amp; the effects I put on them. If I knew how good it was it would be worth the normal $5 for a couple weeks of play, but I scored it in a Humble Bundle and it is easily my favorite in the pack.  Would be willing to get trapped in magic book again: 10/10",

            "review_text": "Story of the game is pretty simple. You are an evil sorcerer that some good king sent some heroes to trap inside a prison, this groovy magic book that you (and many other evils) have been trapped inside of. You go through the levels to try and escape. You get to pick from a variety of possible team mates as you go like a Witch, Vampire, Werewolf, Minotaur, Ghost, Troll, Imp etc. You pick what you want and build a classic 4-person party. You actually get (I think) 6 slots total.     Pros:  - As advertised, basically a love letter to the early wizardry games but you don't have to grind like 10 hours to get off floor 1, so, that's good.  - The graphic look rules. Basically the whole world looks like black and white ink drawings, but the dungeon is a 3-D world. It's cool, if minimalist.  - Honestly, the first old fashioned RPG I've actually played and been enjoying in a while  - Seems to be lots of different approaches with your party. Each character offers something different. I can see playing this more than once just to test out different combinations  - Has multiple difficulty levels, something a lot of RPG's don't offer  - Offers a windowed mode and control remaping, both of which I roll my eyes at any PC game I encounter without them.     Cons:  - This was done by (AFAIK) a one man programming team and I have hit a glitch in town twice that causes no menu options to pop up. Save often.  - Speaking of saves, when you reload them all doors on a level are shut as if you just arrived. Minor annoyance.  - One of the one-man-team oddities, the game has no volume controls at all. It is what it is. Some people have been (here's a shocker) very rude on the Steam forums about wanting to turn off the music. I really don't see the fuss.  - The heroic knights in the opening cutscene have weird helmets that kind of make them look like Klan members.     Overall: definite thumbs up if you enjoy old school RPG's. It's not really the most complex game, but it's also not a pricey one and it will definitely kill some time. I'm definitely enjoying it. There's nothing here that will redefine a genre or do anything you haven't seen before, but it does what it does well.",

            "review_text": "If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs at all, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.  The most obivous difference between this game and most others is the quite unusual art style. The team making this game is obviously on a budget, and you can see some oddball errors (like inky shadows that are actually 2d planes you can see behind if you jump into the corner) but they decided to use their limited resources to make the most visually striking game they could, regardless.   The same can be said of combat, which is the real meat of the game. The game uses pre-generated character archetypes that you add to your party in a team of your choosing. The array of choices are unfortunately not overwhelming, and you don't get a very clear sense of who can do what until after you get them in your party, but if you save before the choice, and experiment a little, you can figure things out.   Combat revolves around energy (which is used only 1-6 points at a time, and where you recover 1 per turn) and cooldowns on skills, as well as an unusual defense system. Defense drops after physical attacks, and applies to both physical and magic attacks. Since very high defense nullifies direct magic damage, you need to pound a target's armor down to make them vulnerable to magic. Meanwhile, magic skills that debuff resistance to physical damage or can incapacitate a target are available, but only within the limits of energy and cooldowns. It's a game that has unusual depth to how much you have to think to get through even regular battles. (Especially on the brutal '1980s' difficulty.)  Unfortunately, the game also behaves oddly in many circumstances. Ability cooldowns don't take as long as they say they do in the menu, and sometimes last into the next combat you engage in. If you move the mouse while the 2d image of the town is loading, you actually make the perspective on the town move, as it's just a 2d cutout in front of the game's camera. There's an achievement that you can't unlock because it was accidentally made inaccesible.   There's also some balance issues, especially with overpowered skills like sleep, where enemies only wake up from normal attacks, while a skeleton that's using physical skills to kill the opponent never wakes the target. This tends to make status effect and damage-over-time characters extremely powerful, while the characters that rely upon direct magic damage are extremely weak because of the way defense works against them.",

This keeps you from completing smaller puzzles soon after which, in turn prevents you from finishing the games biggest, and really, only side-quest. Plus, this is very late in the game, so it's not like starting a new file is a viable option at this point. That's just insane. I could have overlooked the many, many typos, the bland and repetitive enviroments, and the forgettable music in favor of this being a cheap, yet entertaining old-school rpg, but when you encounter glitches that break your save file, that's where I have to draw the line.  P.S. Oh, and the hardest boss fight in the game is the third one, which, you know, is pretty dumb. Like, there are still a bunch after that point, but they're all so easy as to be no challenge.

That's pathetic. This is a subjective review of a project. God forbid someone have their own opinion on the internet.  Paper Sorcerer is a game in which we take on the role of a sorcerer who has been imprisoned in a book.  The soundtrack in Paper Sorcerer is made up of repeating the same short music blip over and over. There is an incredible lack of SFX and other gameplay audio. No Voice Acting, and repeating combat sounds really hold this game down. Audio- 2/5  This game features a beautifully unique art style, one that makes the world look very pleasing. This game contains well done textures and models- though in some aspects it seems as though the developers took the easy way out; such as blackness in place of shadows, or floating balls in place of enemy sprites. Nonetheless, the game is still very aestitically pleasing. 4/5  The story seems rather boring and underdeveloped. Nothing new or interesting. Standard 'Escape the dungeon' story we have seen countless times before and no character choice or decisions to be made. Very bland. 1/5  Mechanically, this game suffers. The gameplay is simplistic, with little 'customization' outside of changing a character's gear, or selecting new party members. We have no choice in our character's traits or class. There is very little environment interaction aside from opening doors and enemies are painfully easy to evade as they are do not seem to move. It is possible to complete entire levels with no combat at all. Combat is quite frusterating; The energy/attack system is limiting, and the inability to gauge the status of enemies makes combat confusing. 3/5  Major issues that impacted the score- Stationary enemies, lack of character customization, generic story, frusterating combat system.

While it's good, it's also got several bugs and ZERO audio controls. Chances are, you're going to hate the music in the game after a while and the only thing you can do about it is mute the sounds in your windows mixer.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game on after reading a review of it online (can't for the life of me remember where) and thinking that it sounded like a lot of fun. The game itself is only $5.49CDN and it almost feels like I'm underpaying for it, and while the game does suffer from a bit of grinding I personally feel that the aesthetics, music and concept of the game make up for having to do a bit of extra grinding now and again.  Graphically the game isn't a powerhouse but the creator supposedly based a lot of the visuals off of sketches he'd done with a ballpoint pen, and translating that into the game gives it a very stark atmosphere that lends itself well to the rest of the game.  The music in the game is repetitive and a little off-putting, but again it works with the rest of the game to add to the overall feeling of dread that the game delivers in it's execution. Also the sound effects are minimal, but not overpowering or obnoxious.  The gameplay is reminiscient of dungeon crawlers from the 90's, or more recently a bit faster paced version of Legend of Grimrock and contains a fair number of secrets to find on each dungeon floor.  You can also collect parts to make an evil puppet to go along with your party of Ghosts, Vampires, Werewolves, Frankenstein Monsters, Goblins, Witches, and Evil Sorcerors.  All in all if you're a fan of older RPGs then I would easily recommend this at the current price.  ",
