I have no idea how long the game is, but I played for an hour and left. My only choice now is to start a new game and I need to have an hour to cover that ground again, plus whatever to finish the game.  Sorry, I'm really not looking to solve all those puzzles again in addition to having to sit down for a stretch of who knows how long that is at least an hour. This is not a good game mechanic and it is this reason why I do not reccomend it.",

Because the game doesn't exploit the mechanisms it has put in place. It's very linear and after the first ten minutes, it's pretty much all the same  Because the puzzles are too repetitive and, again, don't exploit the original idea of folding and unfolding the crafted paper world  Because the soundtrack often ends abruptly for no reasons  Because there's no walk fast/running option. Seriously, the character moves sloooowly. I know it's supposed to be part of the general relaxing experience but it ended up annoying me and not relaxing me  Because the game is very short - finished it in one sitting of 90 minutes, getting all the achievements - and has no replay value  Because for those reasons, $10 for this game is way too much expensive. This game should cost $2 at full price  Overall, very clever idea, bad execution",

There's some nice atmosphere in terms of the varied palette and the art, music and sound effects in general.  But I feel the game failed to live up to its potential. There's no real 'wow' moments, like I got from games done in a similar spirit, such as Kentucky Route Zero or Monument Valley. Here are two major failings:    Puzzles. The puzzles aren't very engaging. I only enjoyed one where you flip through 3 columns of terrain to mix and match platforms, thereby forging a path to progress. The other puzzles are tedious at best. One puzzle requires you to count hidden symbols around the environment to crack a code. This is all done passively without any hint that it's even what you need to do. I used a walkthrough; no regrets.   Story. The game has only a basic shell of a story which isn't even marginally compelling. It is in fact based on a single haiku; a fairly cliché one at that. It's the kind of one-dimensional first introduction you get of Japanese culture in a western primary school. As a western developed game, I feel they took a traditional Japanese aesthethic but failed to grasp the spirit of Japanese culture or storytelling.   In short, I didn't feel Tengami had any real passion put into its development. Since it's lacking both compelling gameplay and story, I'm left wondering who I'd recommend it to. I think it would only be suitable for a parent and child to play together, or as a source of inspiration for game developers.",

If you're wandering about trying to solve a puzzle, it can take a long time as there's no 'sprinting'  If you like artsy pieces, you should try this game, otherwise it's not an amazing point-and-clicker.",

While a casual gamer or someone interested in art would probably find this a nice experience, I can't recommend it. Good game, but a small audience would enjoy it.   Other Reviews: I'm not sure what people are talking about with the save games. I had quit right after completing chapter 2, and pressed continue when I got back. And then finished chapter 3.

The story appears at first to be deliberately vague but the final credits shed a little bit of light on the overall purpose and meaning of the game so it's worth finishing to experience that.

Then go back to the start and collect all the stuff / information you need to solve the puzzle and go back to the end again. Repeat this for everything you missed at the first place... - the music sometimes stops randomly - it is often not really clear what to do. The Hint feature helps here a bit. However for the last puzzle there is no hint feature and it is absolutely not obvious what to do (My hint for you: Find a symmetric pattern). - The game is really short. I finished it within 74 minutes. If the Main Character could run, I guess I would have been solving it in 45 minutes. If he could teleport, It would last about 20 minutes. (You see: the thing you do most of the time in this game is watching the character walking... He is even slower when taking stairs. I was shouting at him to go faster and tried to push some keys to increase the game speed... no chance.)   So the game is really bad but the style is awsome.

I have to give this a thumbs up because I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this game. The game is incredibly relaxing and scenic, the puzzles require some thought but are not frustrating, the pop-up book style is well done and very unique. I actually enjoyed the characters slow pace and I didn't mind that there wasn't a real plot, this is exactly the kind of game I have been looking to play as a way to relax at the end of stressful day.  All those compliments said, I finished the game in less than 2 hours. I aknowledge that a lot of work and artistry went into creating each page of this game, but 2 hours of game play does not justify the price point in my opinion. I recommend Monument Valley, similar vibe, more gameplay.   I don't regret my purchase, this was a great game, just be aware if you decide to give it a go.",

He IS ACTUALLY RUNNING but slows down a little when he moves up stairs. It would look unnatural and not in harmony wiht the set, it he moves faster. Do not focus on the price, but on this special experience. As in your life, don't rush throught it, you'll dead regread it when it's over.",

Regardless, the visuals and music in this game are virtually FLAWLESS. This game's asthetic puts even your fondest memories of Okami to shame. I tried looking for flaws in even the rendering of the visuals and found none, and the music is a relaxing, interesting mix of japanese classical and electronic ambient.",

Wouldn't say any of the puzzles were particularly difficult but the mechanics of pulling flaps and folding pages made them a little more interesting than your standard basic puzzles. Don't think it's worth the original price but definitely worth picking up during the sales if you want to zone out with something peaceful for an hour during the holidays.",

I seem to enjoy these short stories, however the story* itself wasn't anything too special.  The way the story is told together with the gameplay mechanics is quite unique and new to me (The whole Paper-Folding mechanics). I enjoyed it and it's definitely something worth experiencing (if it's 75%+ off)  Cons: Lacking basic audio adjusment setting. Very short, so not worth the price.",

Visually it looks great and the folding nature of the world is unique. The puzzles were sortof OK, but I gotta admit I lost interest before reaching the end. I recently just finished it because it had been sitting unfinished for many months and ... you know how it is, sometimes you just want to finish something.   Would I recommend it, though? No. Only if this strongly appeals to you. ",
