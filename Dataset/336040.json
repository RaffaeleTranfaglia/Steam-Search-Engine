Now with the 3.0 update the game is pretty much perfect. The developers listened to feedback from beta testers all the way through and now we have a massive game with some of the deepest strategies you can find in a CCG. I highly recommend this game if you like TCGs and CCGs. I've played a lot over the years and this is one of the best, maybe even THE best.",

So far its pretty fun. If your idea of of pay2win in Trading Card Games is you can buy random card packs, then yes all TCG are p2w, and this is no different, but it does seem to have a lot cheaper entry fee than any TCG I've played.",

Any fan of Magic and D&amp;D will find a pleasant mix between the two.   The game is a free game but The Tripler is a must have for $10 there are no other necessary buys which makes this the only CCG that wont end up costing an arm and a leg over the years of playing.  This is a great game for friends because of the multiplayer aspect and trading cards can help optimize decks.",

You now have to pay to have the access others have. I asked the company in their message board and was told that they dont want any 'freeloaders' crying about their game, Real nice way to talk to a person, guess if you dont spend money they don't want to hear your opinion. Avoid this game unless you feel like spending big money to play.",

If chess was invented hundreds of years later then this is what it would look like. With so many heroes, monsters, weapons and spells etc, the combinations of decks must be endless. I 'm looking forward to getting more cards and get building. The game needs a few tweaks, but hopefully there will be further updates.  It disappoints me to see people leaving negative comments, particularly about the pricing model. Its a free game for crying out loud and you can play the single game without spending any money at all. Yes, you have to spend a little (or more if you like) to build decks quicker, but I can't see it being anywhere near as expensive some of the other games on here and this looks like its going to entertain me for whole lot longer.  Get involved!",
