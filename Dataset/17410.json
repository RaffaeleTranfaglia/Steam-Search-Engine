            "review_text": "Yes, I have 20 hours in this game. But first, some background.  Like with Final Fantasy XIII and Remember Me, I avoided this game because people complained about it when it came out despite me being hyped for it. I bought it when it was on sale for a dollar and regret not buying it day-of.  I can see where people can find significant flaws, especially playing now just before the new game comes out, but there's so much good in this game that I think it's okay to overlook. The story's a little undercooked, Merc annoys the hell out of me (the white guy who's talking in your ear for 90% of the game), and for such an important character, you see Faith's sister three times and she does nothing significant. The borderless cartoon animation comic-wannabe cutscenes between levels are tragic and make my heart hurt. The biggest complaint I've seen is also slightly true: yes, some jumps and parkour tricks can be difficult to pull off because of finicky controls and poor item interaction (like not being in the correct centimeter length from a pipe so you fall to your death despite staring right at the bloody thing).  But, honestly, the only parts of the game I got truly and genuinely frustrated at were the fights (particularly one boss fight with a ninja person *spoiler spoiler*). Thank god Catalyst ditched the guns because wow, I didn't get this game to play a shooter.  Despite all of this, which I guess some is enough to ruin this game for people, I cannot recommend this game enough. It is quite possibly one of my favorite games of all time, and I play a lot of games. I spent $200 on Catalyst and got the prequel graphic novel. I own the soundtrack to the first game and will probably get the next. I seriously love this game. So what's good?  It's art, pure and simple. And there's nothing else like it. Maybe some indie stuff popped up in hopes of scratching that virtual parkour itch, but nothing really compares to this full game of jumps and swings. It's like making Assassin's Creed first person and giving you complete control of every wall dash, every jump, every lunge, all those little tricky grabs and spins, and turning travel into the puzzle rather than combat or hacking minigames. Every tiny detail is carefully created and placed to challenge you and force you to think creatively, using the tools you learn in the tutorial on increasingly difficult puzzles. Even the fights can sometimes be enjoyable when you treat it as a marathon instead of an fps shooting gallery.  The game is gorgeous, even for today's standards (though Faith's model is a little choppy). The color contrast and choice in neon vibrance and bright white have been lauded for years now. And it always stands our, no matter how many times you play the game. In a world of greys and browns, this game is quite the visual gem and that can't be understated. Traveling over skyscrapers really shows all these contrasts, then busting into office buildings and cunstruction sites, subways and malls, put those big blues, oranges, and greens right in your face.  I'm a huge cyberpunk fan and there's not a lot of it. People want to think it died in the '80s, but I say ♥♥♥♥ that. Even if we don't have AIs or cyberspace, this is cyberpunk. A small group of rebels try to circumnavigate the system that the ruling totalitatarian government has created in this near-future dystopia. It's guilded, with high-rises and men in swanky suits, but crime and death in the cracks. This point's more about my personal interests, but anything cyberpunk is a win in my book.  The music perfectly frames everything going on. It's fast, it's calm, and it's creepy. People complain about 'Still Alive' but I'm one of the nerds who loves that ♥♥♥♥ing song. When i heard the composer for the main soundtrack was coming back, I immediately got the collector's for Catalyst. He's good. It's soft, kinda futuristic (as we'd like to imagine it) and is the perfect audial counterpart to the colorful visuals.  Then there's time trials and doing speedruns of actual levels from the game, which is always fun. There's hackers on the pc, so don't bother trying to be number one on the leaderboards, but it can be very fun to push yourself to beat your own best times. Some of the most fun I had in this game was discovering new and faster ways of completing levels, like trick jumps I missed on my initial run or near-glitches that let you skip whle sections. I suppose these types of things exist in all sorts of games, but it truly feels different in a game with the parkour gameplay like this. I also thought the voice-acting was well done, particularly on faith and Jacknife, even Merc (despite me loathing his voice).  I am a very big fan of this game, now franchise, and will likely love it forever. No, it's not perfect. If it was, would we need a sequel? But it's unique, fun, and stays in your brain. Granted, the folks around here bashing on it aren't likely to think about it again, but how are you to know you won't love it until you try it?  One scene will always stick with me. Faith's sister's first appearance is in a cutscene, and not one with that horrible cartoon animation, but a realtime in-game cutscene in first person. There aren't a lot of these (in fact, off the top of my head, I can only remember two). This one is a good length, the vast city is visible in the background, you don't have control over Faith's actions, and it's emotional. It sets up the plot for the game (which isn't dreadful, they just could've done al ot more with it) and the relationship between Faith and her sister. Faith's personality is on full display here, her drive to run and escape problems rather than face them, and we never see her face. Many fps games don't have cutscenes from first person where the first-person character actually does stuff that the player doesn't do. But it's not awkward, it doesn't feel weird, even when the two sisters embrace and you see Kate's head go over Faith's shoulder. It's fluid and makes me wish there were more of these throughout the game. Even outside of the parkour, the music, and the visuals, this style of cutscene will always stick with me.  TLDR- I love it, you might, there's problems, what game doesn't? You won't know if you're a hater or a lover until you try it. There's running, jumping, music, some iffy storytelling, and an overall unique experience. I've also heard it's good with VR. Give it a shot, it may just be your next obsession.",

There are cases where Faith doesn't grab a ledge and falls to her death, it is completly the games fault.  2. You start to look at the areas with another view - it is more like a puzzle. Not eveything that is suggested (with runner vision) is really that fast. Fighting is slow, you start to avoid it. You discover that the cases where Faith falls to her death.... are completly your fault. It is just really precise timing and positioning. (There are some invisible things you can get stuck on, but at least they feel consistent.)  3. You practice certain areas of a map over and over again. It becomes a puzzle-skill-choreography game.   4.   You discover  kickglitches.    You start to practice more and die a lot, lot, lot more in this game. Sometimes you ragequit. You get a dictionary and search for the word 'consistent'. You cannot find it. But: if combos work you feel like the greatest player who ever walked on this planet earth.  5.   You start to practice  out of bounds skips.  They look really cool.   No progress. You see some speedruns and you think you are the worst player who ever walked on this planet earth.  6. Irl you look at pipes and vents with disgust. In a potential run they slow you down. You look at your living room and mumble 'maybe I can avoid them by wallclimb-to-wallrun jump wallclimb-turnjump?' Your mother looks at you with concern.  7. Irl the missing runner vision annoys you. At the dinner table you want the fork to glow red. Even if you choose to ignore that and eat the food with your hands, because it is faster.  8. Your psychologist suggests to write a review.  tl;dr Unique concept, awesome graphics, difficulty depends on how you play it rather than the difficulty set in game. I rate this game awesome/10.",

            "review_text": "Mirror's Edge was developed by DICE and released in 2010. Unlike other DICE games, Mirror's Edge wasn't using the Frostbite engine, instead they went with Unreal Engine 3.  There is no game like it. The parkour is simply amazing here. There is no run button in this game - instead your character simply builds up speed as she runs. To complete an obstacle, you have to do it all in an instant, without stopping. It's not really about planning or puzzles, but more about instinct. You really have to give it to the level design in this game. Without right level design none of it would really feel right. All of that really make it feel very natural and epic. DICE really managed to combine cinematic feel (and i don't mean 30 fps) and gameplay together. I wouldn't mind for a open world though.  There is also a bit of FPS in this game. You can never hold on to a gun or reload it. You have to attack the enemy to get the gun, but it's easier said than done though. The game wants you to be tactical, even if you attack an enemy that only had a pistol, he will still gun you down if you just run out in the open to him like that. You have to use cover, pick the ones that are separated from the rest etc.  The gameplay component of the game, whether it's parkour or shootouts, is simply amazing.  The game also has nice use of aesthetics. They use primary colors mixed with white for the most part. It's so simplistic, yet so gorgeous. Musical department wasn't lacking either. Main theme by Lisa Miskovsky is superb.  Unfortunately this game suffers from one big problem - the length. It will take you about 4 hrs to complete it. I guess EA thought of it as an experiment project?  Additionally, there are also those terrible cutscenes in between the levels. Clearly shows the limited budget EA has given.  Usually i dismiss these 4 hrs long games. Most of them offer no originality and are overpriced. But due to unique nature of Mirror's Edge i will have to recommend it. There is really no game like it.",

Mirror's Edge is a parkour game where you play as the main protagonist, Faith, a rooftop courrier known as a ''Runner''. The gameplay is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, but it sure feels rewarding to get to the end of certain levels. There's also a speedrunning aspect integrated into the game, where you can try to beat the best times for each level, and compete against other people's times.  The campaign story is pretty linear, and isn't nearly as good as the gameplay itself (it's still a nice addition.) It's a about 6 hours long, a standard for the time and I feel like it's neither too short nor too long.  I would recommend getting this, especially if you're a fan of parkour and well coded gameplay mechanics.",

What I mean by this is that the capability of using the glitches (which actually require skill to pull off) can allow you to improve your speed on runs greatly. It is one of the best feelings ever to successfully pull of a difficult kick-glitch that shaves of 10 seconds of your time. The only time I have encountered a hindering bug was while performing a non-hindering bug so, what can you expect.  Aside from that, if you aren't interested in speedrunning this game still includes some of the smoothest freerunnung in any game to date. The genre created by this game is the best of it's kind and has not been bested, which only proves this game's greatness more.  TL;DR This game is godly get it immediatley.  ",

Very challenging game even on easy mode. The MC is sorta like Neo in the Matrix. Falling to your death is common. Dying from guards shooting you is common. Autosave works offen but you will have to rerun some parts a lot. Might get stuck in a deathtrap or two, till you figure out where and how to go. I thought it was funny and exciting falling to my death often. Just wish the cops would not be shooting at MC as much.    Not many hints of where to go, but there is one right way and many wrong ways. Trying to attack guards is difficult, better to run. Tutorial helps but for me gets stuck teaching combat moves(the 2nd Disarm). You will be shot at very often with no way to stop the shooting except to escape or hide behind something. You heal up quickly, so it is a good idea to stop briefly or hide when hurt. You will be hounded by the cops from air and surprised by ground cops on the rooftops. The combat is ok but hard to do. You can punch, kick, use your parktour, disarm, and pickup a gun and use it.   The forum has a lot of people complaining this game has game stopping bugs. It might not run on some computers. I had no problems sofar runnning game on a Quad Core computer with Win 8 (64bit) 8 Gig RAM.  Great view of the city from the rooftops. Great graphics. Good Story. Has a speedrun gamemode.

The controls are absolutely perfect. They feel like you're not doing a ridiculous combo move to move Faith around, but you're also not one-buttoning it. The story is amazing, and packs a punch. You'll love feeling like a badass, dodging bullets and slaying the 'blues' of the game. But, along with every person that has ever played this game ever, THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GUNS IN IT.",

The story itself is fairly short, but the replay value seems to be pretty good. There's lots of stuff for you to find around the levels, and beyond that there's time trials and races with leaderboards, if you really want to see how fast you can blow through a level. The music and art are downright breathtaking at times, there was more than one moment where I had to stop running and just look out at the cityscape.   Overall I loved this game, really glad I picked it up finally when it was on sale. The first few times I fell I winced and audibly gasped, it really sucks you in. The few hours it took to get through the story were incredibly exhilarating and visually stunning. Even the combat animations are just so incredibly smooth, you go from running along the side of a wall to twisting a dudes arm around and snatching his gun in a few seemingly effortless motions (if you get your timing right).   Only played through once, on normal difficulty, and I found it pleasantly challenging to downright punishing at times. Some of the sparring with enemy NPCs was ridiculous, but after a few failed attempts I felt like a total badass taking them down.    Highly recommend this game. Visually it's held up over the years, and mechanically it's one of the most thrilling games I've played. Parkour platforming and combat come together like peanut butter and chocolate in Mirror's Edge.  ",

It adds so much to the game without drowning out the sounds of the city when you would expect to hear it. It was also very captivating at times that you would want it to be. Faith's movements feel very real and fluid. It is extremely satisfying to jump from a high place and hit the ground with a roll. The story in this game is quite good, but not the best. This is because I was overwhelmed by the fantastic score and eye candy building interiors.    Though this game is outstanding in almost every way, it also has its faults. I found it extremely difficult to memorize the controls. Certain actions, such as jumping, are mapped to an odd place on the controller (Left shoulder button). However, I don't see it being mapped any other way that would have made sense. The only other down side that I have noticed would be the rare glitch in the free running mechanics. This is expected because no video game is without a glitch or flaw somewhere.   Overall, Mirror's edge is one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a long time.

I'm giving it a thumbs-up because the free-running gameplay is an interesting mechanic, but the game has enough faults that I really only recommend it when you can find it on sale.  All in all not a very good game, even though it seems to have a pretty rabid fan base. To be fair, the graphics are very good, especially considering it's a few years old, and the developers had some innovative ideas for how to play the game. Unfortunately actually playing the game just wasn't as fun as it should have been. Mostly the game suffers from pretty bad controls coupled with unforgiving gameplay mechanics, which results in having to replay sections over and over again. Most jumps and grabs have to be precisely timed and the distance precisely judged, but many times the button presses didn't register quickly enough, and it's in general pretty difficult to judge distances, so I found myself dying dozens of times when I missed jumps by no more than an inch or two - that got frustrating really fast. The control issue also raised its ugly head in the wholly mediocre combat. Many, many times the right-mouse button counterattack failed, which got me killed more times than I could count. I eventually grew to hate the combat so much that I just pounded on the first guard I saw, took his gun, then shot everyone else just to get it over with.  The other huge frustration with the game was the fact that for such a completely linear game it was often nearly impossible to figure out where to go. There was supposed to be a hint system that highlighted your path in red, but sometimes it showed up off in the distance, sometimes not until you were right on top of the path, and sometimes not at all - I wandered around a lot because of that. Even worse was the level where the devs decided to paint everything in the building red; I don't know why, I guess maybe they just thought it was funny to frustrate us even further.  To make matters even worse (or perhaps better, as things turned out) - beyond the spotty controls, oft-failing hint system, unforgiving mechanics and mediocre combat, the game took me all of 5 hours and change to complete. I'm not necessarily opposed to short games, as long as the story is engaging and gameplay is fun - The Darkness II is a perfect example. But this game was neither engaging nor more than moderately fun, and was far too short for the money they normally charge. Luckily I got this as part of the EA Humble Bundle, so I really didn't shell anything out for it. If you can pick it up really cheap then it's fine to waste time on for a few hours, but anything more than a few bucks is probably a waste of your money.",

The game is quite short but does offer a reasonable amount of replayability and has extra things to do such as challenges and time trials so its definitely worth buying especially in a sale. Overall I really enjoy this game and the only limitations/problems that i believe exist in this game are the lack of music whilst playing although this might detract from the action if it was present but also the play time.   The play time is an issue because the main story can easily be done in about 4/5 hours as I found upon rebuying and playing this game as i managed to beat it in just about 3 hours but the normal new player might expect to beat it in 4/5. Althought despite this being a flaw I think I have collectively (On Xbox and PC) played through the story about 5 times (I think) and have spent numerous hours trying to beat personal bests in time trials and challenges so for me this hasn't been a massive problem but just thought it was the main and probably only limitation for Mirrors Edge on the whole.  Have fun.  EDIT: One thing I did forget to mention was that the only real difference from the console version to the PC version that makes the pc version a bit less enjoyable is the exclusion of achievements from PC as some of the achievements were extremely challenging and a good thing to show off your ability at a difficult game. For example some of the ones i remember were completing the game without shooting someone and another for not hitting people i think.",

It really goes all-out with the first person view, most immersive I've seen without a VR headset. I've always wanted a game where I can walljump or roll in first person, and now I have it! Faith's acrobatics *feel* more powerful than pretty much any shoot-em-up or stab-em-up, it's simultaneously lower-power and way more superpowered than anything you can pull off in Skyrim. The fight sequences aren't too exciting, but it's a really nice change to disarm enemies with good timing (and then throw away the gun because seriously who needs guns) instead of blowing them away. Of course you don't have to throw away those guns, I'm sure my playthrough would have been a lot easier if I wasn't playing pacifist, but it felt more natural that way. Weird.  It's your standard Prince of Persia jumping-puzzle fare, which means there's spots that can be really frustrating to get through, but that only caught me a couple times. Checkpoints are pretty liberal, so getting stuck is always 'Getting past this part is hard', not 'great, I need to backtrack through half the level again'.  Other comments...well, it's always nice having games with female protagonists and no romantic subplots. The game feels a little short, but it was worthwhile, it didn't feel tedious. There's hidden collectables (like pretty much every Prince of Persia style game) but there's not a whole lot; completionists won't lose whole weeks of their life over it, thank God. It doesn't have achievements, which is really annoying considering that the console versions did get them. Despite the fact that it's a console port though, the controls still feel simple and natural. Fascinating bold use of colors in the game, I liked it a lot aesthetically.  So, yeah. In summary, it has cool aesthetics, and it makes you feel like a superhero more than any superhero game. Very worthwhile diversion that won't eat up a lot of time.",

This über-incomprehensible interactive 4D motion-picture by Electronic Arts of all publishers once again shatters the defining traits of a first-person shooter by incorporating athletic puzzles in the form of intense, high speed parkour throughout mesmerising yet infinitely hostile urban environments in what clearly is the plotline of a Cinderella-esque run-for-freedom merged with a theme highly reminiscent of elements from both Logan's Run and the Hunger Games series. Because who else has such superhuman strength, dexterity and apparent immortality as Faith in real life to scale entire metropolitan skylines while constantly on the run from equally-undaunted secret police dispatches? Oh, and although the game is quite dated it still refuses to run on almost all modern GPUs when at maximum physX settings. 7.8/10 would buy the upcoming prequel.",

Overall this game is a mixed bag of experiences with some great and not so great moments . Some parts are exciting like jumping on a train but for the most part you stack in close spaces doing easy linear platforming which gets repetitive .  Initially you are encouraged to avoid enemies which gives this game a uniqe feel . Unfortunetly toward second half of the game you often find yourself playing crapy first person shooter .  I think game fails to progressively add more intuitive options to gameplay . If you played it for 1 hour you pretty much have seen eveything that it has to offer in terms of moves .Sliding down the building like Jackie Chan is awesome but there is not enough of that .  I like the artstyle which is probably the best thing about this game .Animated cutscenes and aesthetic hights gives the game good atmosphere . It is a bit too bright sometimes but it makes the game look different . Music is good also but I wish there was more heavy techno for when you in danger .  Not much to say about the story . I did not really care for it because of complete disbelief in a person running away from bulelts .   7/10 Mirror's Edge is very much linear so there is almost no creative ways to approching a problem . You just move from point A to poing B with poor gunplay and minimal fighting options . There is a lot of downtime in this game to do mindless platforming which I find a bit boring .

            "review_text": "Mirror's Edge is a first person running game developed by DICE. You play as Faith, a free runner. The story is set in a modern utopian society with a totalitarian government. Invasive surveillance is a part of life in this city and runners help exchange information between parties without getting caught.  Gameplay is the most admirable aspect, its not perfect but its very innovative and first of its kind. I was skeptical of how the game is going on handle. I am glad that DICE persisted with the first person perspective because Mirror's Edge is very unique.  Graphics are good enough, some of the views from the tall buildings are beautiful and vertigo inducing. During the frantic chase sequences when there is a real rush to escape, vision tends to get a little blurry by the edges when leapt over rooftops and I could feel my stomach lurch forward at times. Playing this on my 24 inch monitor at 1920x1200 at highest settings with PhysX enabled is real treat.   On the flip side, Mirror's Edge can be frustrating in spite of DICE getting all the hard parts right. They made a game that handles free running extremely well. I never found the camera to be a problem and the controls on the PC are great. I loved the the chase sequences and getting the stunts right is not very difficult. The is hurt mainly by some intentional bad design choices - the scourge of all games. Weapons are extremely weak, it reminded me of Tomb Raider Legend and not in a good way - those of you who played it would know the reference, and melee combat is frustrating and unsatisfying. This only serves to break the momentum needlessly and seemed like an after thought. DICE have developed Battlefield games, so its not as if they are inexperienced in first person shooters, yet the gunplay in Mirror's Edge is very inadequate. I would recommend playing the game on Easy setting to avoid the frustration of combat.  Also, the game is quite short. On Easy I finished the game in about 6 hours. For a free running game to be truly effective, it must have the feel of an open city where the gameplay is not restrictive. I can understand that at times this might be necessary, but throughout the game, you will be in a huge city, which you cannot explore and the path is very linear - just like an old platformer.    + Visuals + Brilliant soundtrack + Decent story telling + Some segments are truly breathtaking + Tight controls  - Very weak combat - Crappy 2D cut scenes - Short",

Unfortunately, there are some minor mistakes that DICE have made.. First of all, it's not open world , there are stages ,but there is always two or more ways to complete them. Secondly , the combat sucks....a lot!! The enemy A.I. is programed badly and shooting is not fun..  Fortunately, you are able to skip most of the enemies but in some stages you have to fight..Also the story is bad.. On the other hand , the level design is excellent and parkour gameplay is very fun .In addition the controls are tight and you can easily play it lots of times and find other ways to finish a level. Mirror's Edge is a unique game..  I strongly recommend it.",

Why you may ask? Is it the story? Not really. The Gameplay? Well, yes, it's nice and all. What the hell is it I hear you ask? Well, this game, this little gem in the gaming world is something I like to refer to as 'aesthetically pleasing'. The beauty of this game is something that's inspired me and gave me a new view on the world and life, but I won't bore you with what I believe in and all that.   Take at look at the images on this game, see the colour schemes? That's right. There's only really ever 2-3 colours at a time most of the time. Everything is mostly white, but there are some positive colours as well. Like orange, green and blue. This use of colours just... relaxes me.   The city in which this game takes place is unknown, no name. All there is to suggest where this city is, is a clock within the game that shows an American timezone, Seattle, to be more precise.   This whole game, the way the world is presented makes me believe that there is a future without a gloomy outcome. I personally believe all cities should look like the one in this game. Even more so like how this very same city is shown in Mirror's Edge 2. In the 2nd game which isn't out until late 2015 to Spring 2016, the city looks way better and more like how I would want an ideal city to be like. It is so peaceful. It shows safety, order and peace. I'm not sure how to describe it. The city in this game is so... its just 'aesthetically pleasing'. The city shows progress and that humans can craft such wonderful things.

Parkour mechanics are spot on, movement is very fluid and controls are easy to master.   My only issue with the game is that combat sections are very tedious and boring. The combat breaks the flow and combat sections take the most tries to get. Most people complain about guns not being very well implemented, but to me that didn't really seem like an issue since they helped get through the combat sections quicker.",

You don't run into fights like in most games nowadays, you die too easily. You can take out one enemy easily, but they always move in two or more. If you're able to knock out or kill an enemy with your kickass martial arts skills you can pick up his gun, but you only have the magazine that is currently in it. The gunfights aren't exactly interesting, as its not a shooting game, but sometimes I found them necessary because I couldn't get around the enemies in that particular level. Of course the focus of the game is hardcore parkour essentially, you feel superhuman as you run across walls and jump across buildings. One bad step and you can find yourself plummetting toward the ground in a stomach churning fall ending with a sickening crack of bones and a splat. The cutscenes aren't interesting, they use an animation style that literally makes you feel like you're watching an esurance commercial. Honestly I would be sucked into the game, having a lot of fun when a cutscene reared its ugly head, and I didn't feel like playing anymore. Overall, the graphics are nice, the gameplay is fresh but sometimes repetetive, the story is generic and uninteresting, and the game is moderately hard to run. 7 / 10",

While it is still a rather fun and enjoyable experience, coming back to playing on PC, issues started to surface.  Before we get to that, I just want to toss a bit of praise toward the art design behind the game, with high contrast colors and sharp shadows. The Frostbite engine hasn’t age a day, making Mirrors Edge one of the best looking game out there, pleasantly blending a bright, anime-ish style and realistic models and lighting. You will often finding yourself looking around at the sprawling city around you, with light bending over windows, smoke stacks wafting through the air, and the city bustling beneath you.  Besides that, the games primary mechanic, first person platforming or parkour, manages to give you sense of speed and fluidity. When it’s working correctly. You will in frustrating frequency that a path that you have taken is a dead end or not traversable. Forcing you to break game flow for a path that you can take, which you would've never known otherwise. Either that or dying because of shoddy collision detection will have you plummeting to your death more than once. Regardless, if everything works in your favor, good times are to be had, providing a real sense of achievement when you pull off a course nearly flawlessly.  Where I wished Mirror’s Edge would have bared its teeth a bit more with its story, becomes rather forgettable and generic. What works for the story are the cartoon animated cutscenes that tell it, all being a nice little treat visually between levels. The animations are fluid and organic, forms flexing and relaxing in a realistic manner, all tied in with its anime influenced art style. I found myself racing through courses to get to the next animation.  Another thing that works for the game’s detriment in the gameplay department, is the combat system. While it has a fast and simple melee system which is quite good, disarming opposition of their firearms and using them is another story. You will occasionally find yourself getting slapped with the butt of a gun due to, once again, shoddy collision detection. Especially in particular sections where you NEED to get a gun to progress. It’s ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating and hurts the entire game.  Other than what was covered, there’s a few nitpicky things like a minor lack of level variety late game, level padding, and a bit of hyper accurate enemies in some instances. These issues don’t occur often, but enough to annoy if they arise.  With the samey, generic military shooter released year after year, Mirrors Edge was a refreshing take on a wholly new concept that accomplishes it with mixed results. While the art design is stellar, gameplay fun and animations interesting, the ever present shadow of bipolar collision detection, generic story, and pissy combat takes a huge toll on the game’s enjoyability. Mirror’s Edge is fun, when everything is working right.   Verdict : 6.75 -  Enjoyable ",

Even the much-reviled combat becomes fun once you get used to not attacking head-on, the way you do in most games. The aesthetic of the game - colorful, high-contrast, minimalist environments populated by realisticly-rendered characters - has held up strongly for the past seen years, which is more than can be said for most games. Everthing about this game feels clean and streamlined, but complex enough both pose a challenge and maintain interest in excitement.  The only two noticeable downsides are: the story, which feels as though half of it was chopped out as some point immediately before the game shipped, but doesn't really butt into the gameplay frequently enough to be an issue; and the collision detection issue when grabbing pipes, which is also not too much of an issue due to the high frequency of checkpoints.",

            "review_text": "Mirror's Edge is just like it's heroine. It attempts to hurdle some pretty significant obstacles, however, unlike Faith, Mirror's Edge doesn't always succeed.  The story is somewhat straightforward, but it's interesting enough to keep you engaged. However, a cliff-hanger ending and an only just announced sequel make for a slightly unfinished feel. However, more intriguingly, what did catch my interest was the way the story played out between missions; through stylishly animated cut-scenes, as well as scenes within the game engine itself, which also look attractive. While, as I am an animator myself, these cut-scenes are a pleasant addition, they feature a completely different art style. Both types look good, but the disparity is a little odd.  Mirror's Edge is a first person perspective 'free-runner' platformer whereby you take the role of Faith, making countless sequences of jumps, grabs and slides to reach the end of a partially open world stage. As a 'Runner', it's all about speed and momentum, with keeping your moves streamlined, flawless and silky smooth a top priority if you are to finish a stage in a set time, or outrun a team of enemies. This is an infinitely satisfying and thrilling game play formula that rarely misses a mark, inflicting gleeful vertigo in the process. To back this up, the controls are as tight as you could want, with sharp turns and tight slides feeling so, so right. On the PC, the game's graphics are phenomenal, the clean and crisp visual style perfectly enhancing the atmosphere of the futuristic, post-reform utopian city, and cleverly immunising the game's visuals to ageing textures. PC only PhysX capabilities only add to this, with rippling flags and shattering windows adding an increased sense of surrealism. Most of the time, you'll want to avoid tangling with cops and SWAT teams, instead using your agility to out manoeuvre them, but now and again you'll need to fight your way out. Hand to hand combat is generally the best method, with jump kicks and slides being the most efficient and elegant, however punches and kicks feel weighty and satisfying, but with no combo system or progression this feels somewhat paper thin.  The second halve to combat is found when hijacking a cop's gun, however, despite what you might expect, these weapons are in fact less effective than using your fists, especially seeing as how you cannot reload them. These guns are difficult to control, possess no sights or method of active aiming and are generic as hell. I don't usually feel this way, but the game could have been far better off if they were left out entirely and replaced with a better hand to hand combat system. Mirror's Edge has a way of bringing the pace to a halt. Unfortunately, for a game that relies on so much forward momentum, Mirror's Edge has a way of bringing the pace to a halt. It has a tendency to trip over its own feet, keeping you slipping and sliding blissfully along, only to have a intricate but tedious jumping puzzle or hazy objective put the brakes on. These aren't bad, but they're not particularly engaging, either; you're likelier to feel relieved rather than fulfilled when you complete one. In *all*, not some of these cases, you're torn from the experience and reminded that this is, after all, just a game.  Mirror's Edge is many things, and it stumbles often for a game that holds velocity in such high regard. But even with all of its frustrations, it makes some impressive leaps; a unique and adventurous game that makes some brave moves that pay of immensely. Having set a solid foundation, we can expect an impressive improvement in it's upcoming sequel. The first game however, as GameSpot might say... 'it just doesn't nail the landing'.  + Amazing concept and seamless, exhilarating game play design + Clean and crisp, visually pleasing visual style  - Flawed combat system - Lackluster and flow interrupting platforming sections  7.5/10 ~ Good  EpicSouls (Sam)",

Trying to visualize paths through the level while running top speed is challenging and exciting. Having a nice clean run for a while makes you feel like a pro. Sadly, Faith doesn't always want to do what you tell her. I had a lot of stupid deaths from her doing the wrong action. Despite these occassional frustrating errors, I still got loads of enjoyment from the game. The story is not all that interesting , but the gameplay makes up for it.

The main focus is obviously the portrayal of parkour, giving the player large, and tight, varying maps to traverse. The mechanics are simple, smooth and easy to pick up.  Mirror's Edge's overall theme is very minimalistic, delivering its world in large parts of white splattered with vibrant colours; with red used as a general waypoint for those who decide to use it. The graphics are aesthetically pleasing and calm, perfect for keeping your focus on your path.  My favourite aspect of the game is the music. It is clean, atmospheric, and when it picks up the tempo, it gets your adrenaline pumping and beautifully complements the gameplay.  Despite the short story, there is replay value in having a crack at the maps in time trial which is very enjoyable.  Overall, I highly recommend this game for a truly unique experience in the FPS genre. I look forward to any updates about Mirror's Edge 2.",

The most enjoyable part of the game is to seamlessly navigate the enviroment, quickly routing a few enemies, and continuing on without losing a beat. That said, the combat system needs work. Controlling the flow of combat is difficult and rough. Yet this is the only thing wrong with the game. The story is short, leaving the player with nothing to do at the end, but is well written and the animated cut scenes are stylistically and artfully well done, and the varying colors in the environment make every rooftop run like running through a neo-plasicism art gallery. There are other minor shortcomings in the game, but overall, the game's somewhat short story and levels are worth playing.",

It's difficult, especially in the later parts without runner's vision, but is still playable for even the most casual players. I enjoy the whole free running, and it's setup so that the checkpoints are fair and you will always be making progress.   On top of that, if you are skilled, the combat becomes smooth, and you'll be taking out armed guards from walls with your feet. You can take your time and carefully pick off guards one by one, or you can bomb-rush it and skip combat entirely (Until the last level. You need to fight then unless you've mastered every aspect of the game).  I don't care how much the game is, but as long as you get it under $20, it's well worth the price.",

This is a very interesting concept at first but after playing through this game I've come to realise the concept doesn't work too well. The problem I had with this game is that it seems to contradict itself. The game is supposed to be fluent with the free-running in first person view which should keep you immersed... But this didn't really happen with me. I would have my moments but I would end up in a room or some small area where I just got stuck for ages, so I would be in one place for a while trying to figure out what to do and/or even having to pull up a walkthrough, even worse there was a point where I'd keep dying because I couldn't figure it out and I ended up having to retry this small area too many times to count. The problem is that you can't really see all around you because you're just staring at walls (and sometimes the textures weren't too nice to look at) and the parkour is pretty much down to you, it's not automatic like in the 'Assassin's Creed' games, so the actual parkour becomes a puzzle and as a result you're likely to get stuck somewhere. The story wasn't anything special and it was a bit confusing to follow, also being chased by the 'blues' got pretty repetitive. Finally, of course the graphics are very, very beautiful except for close up textures, which I mentioned earlier. I recommend buying this game but I wouldn't suggest buying this at full price.",

The soundtrack also does a good job at hyping you up and getting you in the mood to parkour around. Also, the (limited) gunplay in the game is pretty solid albeit completely optional. This is one of those one hit wonder games like Psychonauts that is kind of short and has no sequel/DLC yet still remains popular, highly rated, and has a thriving fanbase that is begging for more. If it goes on sale for 10 dollars or less than I would definitely suggest you give it a try.",

Controls are really tight. Disarming and shooting feels clunky, but not exactly broken.  To describe this game is hard. It feels like an indie game based on how different is from other games. But it was treated like a AAA title. And for what it can offer, especially now with VR, there's nothing like it at all. It's the first of its kind, nails the coffin hard. Definitely pick this up if you're into game design, or if you're a VR developer improving the latency and FOV.  Story may be confusing for some, but it's actually cohesive than you think. Some characters not too memorable, some show prominent value. Great voice acting, great script. There's bonus content like music and concept art (with details discussing about it) and time trials which is actually a nice touch. A popular feature for many PC gamers unlike console gamers. Short game, but very interesting regardless.  The design is absolutely gorgeous. Extremely cohesive and balanced. Each level has a color associated with them. Art style is vibrant and consistent. Every inch of it is beauty.  To summarize, the game is not the most spectacular, but it has plenty of aspects to make it a gem in our history of gaming. It's not a full price game, quite obviously. But should that be a bad thing? No. Definitely worth having when on sale. Currently $20 at normal, would recommend 25% off. $15 is an appropriate price.  A new Mirror's Edge (Catalyst) will be coming to PC. Obviously not on Steam because... Origin. But let's not fret, Dice is treating the game nicely as a promising new IP/franchise. They're going to add more depth and character to the game. Beef it up with the new engine. Every aspect people love from this game will go to Catalyst.

How we rejoiced that the exploitation of our favourite franchises would end and new IPs would spring from the waters of EA and bring gaming back. Yeah 2008 was a pretty idealistic year. Unfortunately such a magical thing never came to fruition, but we did get one new IP out the door before the name ♥♥♥♥♥♥ began. Mirror's Edge was a first person platformer, for lack of a better word, developed by DICE and released on the 360, PS3 and PC.   Mirror's Edge takes place in a near future city in which it is implied that Big Brother takes a larger role than most feel comfortable admitting. The stark white buildings, bright bloom and overall sterile feel to the buildings you travel on and through do wonders to build this idealistic looking city that is perhaps a little too clean. While the setting is beautiful and immersing, the sheer brightness will mess with more than a few players' eyes.  You play as Faith, a member of a group of package runners that deliver sensitive information and items across the city, usually by way of parkour over the city's rooftops. Her character design is one that should be examined and emulated by current developers. DICE managed to create a character that could be fit and capable and even attractive without the hyper-sexuality that seems to plague the industry. It's a shame we don't get to learn more about her, the game tries to characterize her but ultimately falls flat with a mix of lacking clarity and a subpar execution of the plot.  The game starts off with a light tutorial to get you acquainted with the controls. Your basic movements are jumping, ducking/sliding, strikes and counters. However, context sensitive combos related to walls and objects can result in much more efficient and beautiful parkour moves such as wall running and spin jumps. The controls feel tight but the inability to really see where you're running without looking down can really hinder the timing of the jumps. This is a particularly frustrating fault due to the game's need for absolute precision during some of the levels and you will find yourself repeating some sections more than enough times. Faith's counter attacks against police and security can be used to obtain firearms, which are useful in a pinch but should not be relied upon. There is also an achievement for playing the game without killing a single person, so it is possible to play the game without weapons.   Once the tutorial is completed, the plot is set up, Faith's sister is framed for a murder she didn't commit and Faith does her best to unravel the conspiracy around this assassination and the reason that Faith's sister was targeted. While the plot has the potential to expand and explore the setting of the game, ultimately we're only given flashes of the world and are left wanting; made even more aggravating by a cliff hanger ending.  As far as technical issues go, the game is fairly clean. While the 360 version didn't suffer from any drops, I found a few moments when the PC version slowed down and the frame rate stuttered for what appeared to be no more than some glass shattering.  All in all Mirror's Edge was an experiment. Experiments are rarely flawless but often show promise and that is exactly what Mirror's Edge is; promise and potential a touching lacking in polish. However it's still an excellent experience.",

Some people have complained about the combat systems, but to me it's actually better that the combat is difficult and clunky as compared to a real first-person shooter. This is a running game and the protagonist is not Rambo -- so the combat reflects that fact. You can pass basically any mission without needing to kill people, and it just emphasizes the importance of becoming good at running and dodging.  The level in the glass-walled skyscraper where you have to parkour your way up is my favorite level. It's a beautiful level and has fun jumping/climbing challenges.  Be forewarned that you will likely not pass each level on the first try, so there is a lot of re-doing levels as you learn where to run and when to run. This pure gameplay focus is similar to a platformer like Mario Bros., and is NOT like a modern shooter game. The story is also throwaway and didn't add much for me. With the right mentality and approach I was not frustrated by this fact as the game is not super long. I enjoy running the levels enough and trying new approaches to the same problem that the need to re-run levels didn't bother me. Going back to certain levels and re-playing every few months is still fun. If you cannot stomach this type of approach and intent then don't bother! ",

Maybe comic stills would have been better?  if i had to say something bad, it would be the controls. sometimes the collision detecion between hand and ledge doesn't register correctly leading to unnecessary deaths.

It makes the world look surreal even though there isn't anything unreal in it. It's beautiful to look at everything in it. This is definitely one of the very high points of the game. The soundtrack is stellar. 'Still Alive' is a great dream-pop sort of song with fitting lyrics that fit the basic idea of this world.  Onto more banal points. The controls are slightly tricky but you get used to it and it becomes easy. Sometimes you can get lost in the maps. The challenge is reasonable. The replay value is very high if you are into time-trials and speed runs. The story isn't so amazing, not so well fleshed out.

            "review_text": "After a lot of thought, this still remains my favourite game. The feeling of running through buildings and jumping over rooftops is almost magical and has not been matched by any other game for me. The lighting, appearance of the levels and music is fantastic and increadably atmospheric, giving the feeling of true freedom of leaping across the dystopian City of Glass. Despite, its relative age now, the game still looks great and, partly due to its age, it runs incredably well and smoothly, even on older hardware.  However, the game is by no means perfect. The story and characters are lackluster at best and I didn't really feel any interest or excitment in finding out more - I only wanted to continue for the gameplay, not because of a drive to progress the story or save the characters in danger. The gameplay is also flawed to an extent. For a game about running freely over rooftops, it would make sense to make the game open world but instead the game is made of linear levels. Fortunately, in most cases, there are many ways to progress through the levels, allowing for better replayability as you try to find the optimum routes. The game could be better if these factors were improved, but they did not greatly negatively affect my experience.  The main problem with this game which does cause an issue, however, is its combat system. Firstly, in my opinion, I don't think the game needed offensive combat mechanics since the protagonist, Faith, is a Runner. It would make much more thematic sense for her to just dodge and run past attackers rather than stop and try to fight them. This is a strategy that can be employed most of the time but there are three times in the game where it forces you to fight. The first two sections can be somewhat avoided or minimised by following better routes but there is no way to get past the third section. These completely break up the enjoyment and faced paced action of the rest of the game as you are forced to stop and deal with enemies. The combat system itself is very poor so these sections are by far the worst part of the game. Disarming enemies for a not-lethal takedown (the combat method that seems to fit Faith's character best) is very hard, especially at first, as the trigger is slightly after when you'd expect. After my 8 or so playthroughs of the game, I am still not consistant at disarming enemies who kill you very quickly if you mess up, making me often have to try 10 or more times to get past the combat sections. The gunplay is mediocre and very simple, leading to combat sections feeling like they were added later to the game and didn't have enough development time.  Despite all of these flaws however, the increadble unique feeling that this game offers is unmatched by anything else and it makes me feel excited and in awe every time that I play this game even though I already know the best routes to follow and every level inside out. No other game has or continues to make me feel as thrilled every time I play it. I can't fully describe why I love it; it's just a very special and magical game to me.  Mirror's Edge goes on sale a lot and I've seen the price of this game go very low so if you have a spare few dollars, try it and see for yourself what an amazing experience running freely through the rooftops is.",

The campaign, while short, offers a lot of unique levels and environments with tons of ways through them. Level design is phenomenal; just the other day I picked up ME again and found a new, faster route through a section of the first level. It's a complex maneuver to climb up a section with some boxes into a vent that saves me maybe two seconds. Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound like much, but it's complex and actually difficult to do each time and it feels great to have figured it out on my own. Finding a new route or way to tackle an obstacle is an awesome feeling once you string it all together and make a perfect run. The replay value is huge, as the time trials are addicting (Especially the expansion pack) and challenging. In summary, ME has a short but sweet campaign, lots of replay value because it is so unique, excellent visuals, and a wonderful sense of speed and momentum that is unmatched by any other first-person game.",

Being a parkcore game, movement has to feel flued and, 'Natural.' Gunplay is very bad, and brought the whole game down a little. Luckly there is no need to use them, seeing how fist fighting is so fun and flued. All in all Mirrors edge suprised me quiet a bit, and considering its date of release I can tell why there is a cult following!

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, it really just depends on how many guards are trying to gun you down or how much space you have to move around in. I find that these spaces work when they're in a calmed setting, with infinite time to figure out what to do and where to go and with little to no enemies.  I also found that the story didn't tie up many of the loose ends it presents. By the end, I didn't really grasp why Pope was killed and why Kate was framed (don't worry, this isn't a spoiler).

You just have to jump at the right time and you win. The game's soundtrack is great. It isn't extremely replayable unless you are trying to do perfect speedruns. The visuals are astounding. It feels like you're seeing through Faith's view rather than a camcorder embedded in her skull. The game didn't have the best environments, though. It was mostly claustrophobic hallways (and the train sequence). Level 7 is particularly bad. It had one of the WORST jumping puzzles in the history of gaming. Other than those flops, the game is overall worth the 20 American dollars. Overall Score: 9 and 3 quarters out of 10.",

Mirror's Edge is well worth the price, and if it's on sale it's a must have.

In the future, the government controls everything. You're Faith, a runner who dashes along rooftops with all the agility of an urban Spider-Man for the underground. While the story is taken from a number of places, the execution makes it stand out. This is one of the best examples of first person platforming in the past decade. The systems aren't as tight as I wish they could be, and problems abound where you question why you missed a jump here or there.

I played through this game several times, and I earned almost all of the speed-run achievements on 360. Even completely out of practice I can beat this game in about two hours. I love the controls, and I think it's a perfect example of how to do first-person platforming right. It's just one of those games where the controls either click for someone or they don't.  As far as the rest of the package goes, I admit that it leaves something to be desired. The story isn't great, and while it is definitely possible to avoid shooting anyone in this game, there are a couple parts where shooting makes it SO much easier. It shouldn't be that way. It should ALWAYS be easier to avoid conflict. That being said, the other main complaint I hear is that the combat sucks and you can't avoid it. This is also a bit of a misconception if you ask me. Besides those couple parts I mentioned, it is actually easier to learn how to avoid the fight most of the time, but, well, it controls like a first-person shooter and killing folks is how people are used to progressing in a game like this. If you're fighting dudes, you're probably doing it wrong.  Besides that though, it is a fantastic game. I love the look of it, and the abstract-art-esque DLC is absolutely gorgeous.",

I believe ME has held up quite well. Props to DICE for gifting this gem to us.  Then again, maybe I'm a sucker for aesthetics. Admittedly, the straight-line parkour gameplay is ME's true weakness, but I seem to easily forgive that important detail given the phenomenal overall experience. I don't know if its my love for the whitewashed world of ME, the engaging electronic music, or the likeable (albeit few) characters making this dystopian world believable. Reflecting back on my original impressions in 2008, maybe the story seems a bit paper thin by today's standards? I have a feeling ME:Catalyst will solve that.  Oh, and did I mention I absolutely love the soundtrack? Still Alive is such an amazing piece to roll credits on. I get chills everytime...  ME is elegant. ME is beautiful. ME is art.",

The instructions don't really help a lot and honestly it's best to just ignore them sometimes. I got stuck and incredibly frustrated because I kept trying to use the Alt key to find the way to go like it told me to, only to have that not work out for me at all. Once I realised what was going on there it was fine though.",

It has a really enticing story to keep you intrested of the distopian world that this game takes place in and the wall jumping buliding climbing main character known as Faith and her goal to save sister from the corrupted government that framed her.  Neutral: The game is a tad bit short and can be beaten under 10hrs depending on what type of gamer you are but I guess you can get some replayability with the time trials...  Negatives: This might not appeal to all but... THERES NO ACHIVEMENTS. If the consoles can have it why cant PC. Stripping those features limit the replayability and challenge but thats just my personal gripe.  Overall: I definitly Recommend this game but I strongly say wait until it goes on sale because a 19,99 pricetag is pretty hefty for a game that only last less 10hrs but thats just my opinion ;)",

There are many ways each level to get to point A to pont B. Sound effects and audio are great, and the soundtrack is amazing.

            "review_text": "This is one of those 'good but flawed' games that pretentious ♥♥♥♥s like me keep going on about. Mirror's Edge was one of the first games to really experiment with first-person parkour, meaning this is the grandmother of titles like Dying Light.  This game has some good points, and some bad ones.  Good point #1: Gameplay. Although this was kind of an experiment in first-person parkour, the devs really pulled it off. The movement feels satisfying, the controls have great feedback, and the levels have a great sense of flow. It's damn pleasing to experience, as you jump across gaps, clamber over fences and run across walls.  Bad point #1: Combat. A game like this could have some interesting opportunities to use the environment as a weapon, but instead every encounter reverts to poorly implemented first-person shooting. The guns are as satisfying as a wet slap to the face, there's no way to tell how much health you actually have, and the fighting only gets in the way of the freerunning. Thankfully you can often ignore enemies (or run right past them) but the parts where you are required to pick up a gun are terrible.  Good point #2: Nice aesthetic. The artists deserve a pat on the back, because the game looks beautiful, despite its age. Most of this is done through use of colour, and looking out across the entire city is simply breathtaking.  Bad point #2: Story. The plot of Mirror's Edge is generic and forgettable. It's a bog-standard conspiracy story, which never explains why the villains are after you, and which has plot twists that are both completely predictable  and  nonsensical. Eventually I gave up on trying to follow what was going on, and instead tried to ignore the various info-dumps.  Good point #3: Level design. A parkour game without good level design is a bad game, but this game has great level design. The positioning of walls, fences and obstacles is intuitive, with a real cohesive feel. The use of colour also helps to draw the player's eyes towards certain points, and the methods of getting from A to B are logical and enjoyable.  Is this a game worth playing? Yes. Is it a perfect game? No. Will you enjoy it if you play it? Probably.  This is a game that I think really needs a sequel (and we'll be getting one soon), because there is actually some real gold in here, and it would be worth going in to try and make it shinier.

The one thing to beware of, that i noticed, is that when jumping to objects like pipes or poles that you climb or swing on, the tiny dot you have for a reticule has to be aimed directly at the object. Generally, this isn't a perfect game, but I've never seen first-person platforming done this well, and for the most part, it's quite fun.",

Cons: - The combat is complete garbage, avoid enemies whenever possible. - The game is a lot more linear than I expected when I first bought it. I feel like the game would be better if it was semi-open world, plus there are more situations where there is only one path than I think there should be. - The game is pretty short, only took about 5 hours to complete the campaign. (That being said it felt longer than that, I don't feel like I missed out in terms on play time.) - The story could have been a little better, but I found it pretty easy to look past.  Overall Mirror's Edge comes out ahead for me, I'd give it a 7~8/10. If you see the game on sale then it is definitely worth picking up. (Even the full price of $20 doesn't seem that unreasonable.)",

You keep moving. You don't want to stop. You can't stop. If you stop in a pursuit, you're good as dead.  That kinda brings me to its weak points; the game has unavoidable combat encounters where you have to defeat your pursuers (by disarming/beating them down or shooting them, there's no gameplay/story consequence for killing enemies) rather than going with the adrenaline of dodging bullets like a twitchy monkey. It slogged down that pacing, and the gunplay is intentionally sluggish. It feels like the weakest areas of the game. And the same for the hidden runner bags (collectibles that unlock concept art), which feel like they took away from the momentum.

Mirror's Edge - a show you watch despite clear cut baddies and good guys, telegraphed betrayals and stilted dialogue, but you can't stop viewing due to the strength of it's actors.)  Gameplay wise, it's great. The first person parkour is great. The levels are decently designed. My only gripe with it was 'Please... less guns' and 'For the love of Pete, Mirror's Edge, let me RUN.'  One of the greatest things about games such as Saint's Row, Grand Theft Auto, etc. is that you can take a little break from the main story and just mess around. Open world, freedom to TRY anything and see what works, what doesn't.  Mirror's Edge, unlike it's sequel, benefits, in a sense, from being story-driven and concise, so that on Faith's journey, you aren't hampered by being halfway between free to go anywhere and forced to follow the path laid out for you in level design/story.  I can't help but imagine how amazing it would be for Faith to be able to just step outside a safe house, plant 2 feet on the ground, put in some headphones and just... run. Anywhere she wants, doing parkour on the sides of buildings and over cafe patios, startling it's patrons, through back alleys or sliding under vehicles and then, when she chooses, taking to the rooftops for even more opportunities.

(around 4-5 hours for the first Time) Since you can play the Game only on the Difficulty hard, after you completed the Game once, you will probably play it twice anyway. At the End you will play around 7-8 hours to complete the Game on the Difficulty hard. You will need some more time to find every Collectable.  The cut scenes are mostly in a comic Style. I don’t like this Style very much, but since it’s a Point of View I thought its worth to mention it.  Multiplayer: Ignore this Feature, it’s full of Hackers. Hmm well if you want to use it challenge your friends but ignore everything else.",

I loved the aesthetics and when you knew where you were going whilst freerunning it felt really energetic and exciting. Sometimes though, when you tried to jump to a ledge that you could easily make, you'd just plummet to your death (those situations are a mix of it being your fault even if you don't want to admit it and the parkour mechanics falling short). Sometimes it was hard to find where you're supposed to go next as well. This isn't so bad if you're in an area with no enemies and can actually be kind of fun, but you'll end up in really fast-paced situations not knowing where to go, so you have to slow right down which kind of kills the adrenaline rush you get from lightning fast parkour.  I found the story to be a bit lackluster as well. It sounds good on paper, where it's implied that the city the game takes place in is basically NSAland, but the story within the world of Mirror's Edge that focuses on Faith and those she encounters wasn't very engaging. I didn't feel any real connection to any of the characters. I won't describe what happens because nobody likes spoilers, but there are twists and events that happen that you can call very early on.  Also you'll end up in situations where you have to do the exact opposite of what the game tells you to do, which is to avoid combat with large groups of enemies. Occasionally you'll have absolutely no choice but to use the horrible gun mechanics to kill literally everyone before you can move on.  Still, I don't want to sound like I'm too harsh on it. It was an experimental IP that came out almost 8 years ago which succeeded in some areas and less so in others. Overall it's a fun game when the mechanics work properly with attractive level design and an addictive soundtrack (the main menu music is beautifully done) but I would've been disappointed if I paid the full retail price for it.",

The melee combat is awful, especially the disarming mechanic. Put all these things together with checkpoint saves and a lot of trial-and-error, try-die-repeat to figure out how to get past an area, and you get a really repetitive, frustrating game. The fun bleeds away pretty quickly once you're having to repeat the same sequence of jumps twenty times over in order to retry the one jump you keep missing because the controls are so fussy.

I've remapped the keyboard controls to fit what I think actually works, but it still is just a steaming hot pile of poop. 5.5/10  Story: The story is decent.

            "review_text": "In a word: Janky.  Mirror's Edge is a game around parkour and flow. It however doesn't flow; not easily.  In story mode, there is very little flow. The levels are often broken up between puzzle-like climbing sections, where the aim is to get from A to B using the available structures, to arcadish shooter segments, running from A to B whilst being fired upon.  In both you are often funneled down a predetermined path. You must jump from here to here to progress. You must pass these dudes to progress. And very little of this lends itself to speed or flow.  To solve the puzzle you must stop and examine the environment, and to pass the shooters you must either stop and dispatch them with your own gun, or try to run straight at or through them as they fire at you (which doesn't work most of the time).  The best bits of the game are between these two segments, where you have space to move. Or when you are simply chased. But these are fleeting, and often the physics of the game conspire to ruin these too.  For instance, run at a wall straight ahead and you will attempt to climb it. Run at it at an angle and you will wall run across it. You can jump onto an object, or automatically vault it plummeting to your doom. Leap at a guys head and knock him to the ground, or stand on them instead. Or the most frustrating grab a ledge, or simply not and fall. Some of these dichomotomies rarely trouble you, aside in small spaces where the difference between the two actions becomes hard to maintain. But some are confused so often that it just leads to repeated attempts and failures. Of course maybe I'm simply bad at the game.  There's a narrative too, such as it is. It is very much a narrative of convenience. Things happen because they need to involve the main character, rather than occuring out of any sort of narrative cause. Take the premise. You are a runner in a city because the guvment is cracking down on crime. And so the crime lords need stuff transported outside of the city's transport system I think. These packages you're meant to be delivering? You never deliver any throughout the game. You never work. You are the worst courier the city has seen. But the crime lords are never seen either so I guess they can't be too mad. Similarly the police have not cracked down on you because of fear of reprisal. Until they do, in the first chapter.  There is race mode, which involves chasing down your own time and that of your friend's ghosts. You could probably try to beat the leader's too, if they weren't cheats with single second runs. Still, this feels like a missed opportunity, as a true race mode, competing head to head parkouring around the city, sounds like great fun (and I think is the premise for Speed Runner, which I'm yet to play).  All in all, this game has a good premise with poor, even sloppy, execution. Which is a huge shame. A sequel is coming out soon though, so perhaps this will improve in the areas above. In any case, either wait for the sequel to come out, or buy this in a sale if you're curious.  Wouldn't recommend. Maybe play like Sonic Adventure 2, or Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 or 3. It's not parkour, but the freedom of movement and the straight ignoring of physics to allow the flow to continue are there. And the flow is all that matters.",

And if bad gameplay isn't bad enough, there is this need to explore but there are almost always cops shooting you so you can't.

Oh and there ends up being death all too often, many times because of the above mentioned issues of not jumping right, or grabing that ledge etc. After dying, you respawn in a fixed spot that might be a bit further back and you will have to do hear and see the same stuff again, and maybe again, and again and again.

Encountering two or more enemies almost certainly results in death. - The game takes you through 10 minutes of tutorials and never reminds you of the buttons to push in the real game anymore (well except for E for interactions, which is not mentioned in the tutorials). - There are 'packs' to collect but they don't seem to be of any use (for achievements perhaps?)

This aspect of the game is very nice and very well deployed. You will enjoy the small learning curve and be bounding around as much as the limited storyline will let you..  Yes you dont get to roam around this game and play until you unlock the entire city.. BOOOOOOO to this... such a stupid idea for a game based around fun and creative ways of parkour.   Secondly and most annoyingly are the police. They are HORRIBLE autohit ai and designed apparently strictly to annoy the player that was enjoying the game otherwise.   In a game like this you want the police to shoot at a character and cause them to evade... however they impliment the.. if you are in line of sight you get headshot system.. and that is completely controdictory to how they want to to evade the police in the first place.. Make them miss and throw some aswsome bullet slowmo richoche in there. that way faith can feel like she is running through a shower of bullets and using her parkour to evade them.. in current it simply feels like a very simple system of.. is player in line of sight... if yes.. hit them if no.. no hit..   and lastly the storyline flow design.. you should want mirrors edge to be a theme park setting where if you plan to restrict the sandbox nature of the city in the story mode at least give the player a decent flow to the process of getting there.  The current early game is abysmal where you have most of your fun in the tutorial.. Then as you start the story you are introduced to stop and go jumping puzzles and cramped spaces... with short time limits on how long you have to traverse the cramped buggy spaces before you are shot up by spawned in police.  all and all had they simply allowed the story levels to propel the players through them with parkour encouraging designs they would had done alot better than the current system of Stop and go jumping puzzles.  This game has potential and im sure if they listen the sequel could be a blast. but they need to get rid of this auto damage aim and instead use cop bullets as a way to corrall the player into trouble or provide them with an oprotunity to use skill.   i see mirriors edge best form as being a highly cinimatic action movie style romp where the player never slows down and is flying from scene to scene... instead of repeating highly agrivating jumping puzzles over and over.",

Each grip has to be measured perfectly otherwise you will cling falling from the roof like an idiot (even if you've missed a few millimeters from the landing site chosen by programmers). You can not inteagire with the environment outside of some valves to open and to break through doors, also for attiavare valves must necessarily stand in front and you can not do to the side or at 45 °, which is not easy considering the cumbersome controls.  To summarize the whole thing is like CoD but without weapons: run in a corridor, avoid obstacles and follow the only existing path chosen for you by programmers. For me it is a purchase to avoid, I really expected a lot more from Mirror's Edge.  ------------------------------------------------------------- VERSIONE ITALIANA Ho comprato questo gioco con le migliori intenzioni, avevo sentito molte persone parlarne bene ed elogiarne le innovazioni che aveva portato nel mondo videoludico. Dopo averlo giocato non posso che ringraziare di averlo comprato in sconto a 2 euro questo titolo è un unico corridoio unidirezionale dove non ci sono possibilità di scelta sul percorso da scegliere. Ogni appiglio deve essere misurato perfettamente altrimenti non ti potrai aggrappare cadendo dal tetto come un idiota (anche se lo hai mancato di qualche millimetro dalla zona di atterraggio scelta dai programmatori). Non si può inteagire con l'ambiente al di fuori di alcune valvole da aprire e porte da sfondare, inoltre per attiavare le valvole bisogna necessariamente mettersi davanti e non si può fare di lato o a 45°, cosa non facile considerando i comandi macchinosi.  Volendo riassumere il tutto è come CoD ma senza armi: corri in un corridoio, eviti ostacoli e segui l'unico percorso esistente scelto per te dai programmatori.

Things that are completely broken (by design): Jumping and climbing: The game is full of these and I have never ever seen worse climbing. Far, far superior versions can be  seen for example in games like Saboteur, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider.  Combat: Even though combat is rare as most of the time you are meant to run past the opponents you still have to fight them some times. It's all just so unbelievably bad that I have no words to express it. IF you play this game, play it on easy. Difficulty only applies to combat and the combat system has nothing to offer to this game (except for grief).  Level design: Supposedly you are a good runner which means your character should probably know the city pretty well but frankly the character is completely clueless. Sure, there is a 'hint' button that shows in what direction you should go but in many cases its' just the general direction ignoring all obstacles. Also a lot of times you have to *guess* if you can make a jump or not. More often than not you can't which brings you to last autosave which probably was pretty far back.  Field of view: Horrid. 70 degrees maybe? In any event whatever you are doing you can't see anything. If you are hanging from a pipe or something all you can see is the damn object you are holding on to.  Enemies: They know where you are at all times and many times they keep firing at you even though they have no line of sight. They won't hit you but they know in what direction to shoot. Also, when arriving to new locations the enemies will be shooting at you long before even you know where you are. The police will turn from 'it's a nice day' to 'shoot to kill' mode in about 0.07 seconds.   Any good things? Fresh concept I suppose and the graphics are nice. Well, except that the game uses FAR too much white.  Overalll assessment: There should be no reason whatsoever for anyone to ever buy this game.

The screenshots and trailers paint a beautiful picture of freerunning across glorious, colourful rooftops with a seamless flow of wall-running, vaulting and ducking leading to extremely satisfying gameplay... But to be quite honest with you, you're going to be spending 60% of your time inside a claustrophobic building with little to no idea on how to progress. Runner vision shows you where your *end* goal should be, but often the frustration of having no clue how to *get* there by far outweighs the satisfaction one receives from actual free-running. When I bought the game I was hoping to be spending most of my time exploring the open-air environment - not stood at the end of a platform, scratching my head on where on earth to go next. Despite the 'next obstacle' often being highlighted in red, I found these areas simply not 'intuitive' enough for me to follow the supposed 'flow' of the game.  As much as the endless swarms of cops is annoying at times, it is rewarding to outmaneuver them through well-timed counters or simple evasion. As stated countless times the game looks fantastic despite being five years old, and the concept of Mirror's Edge itself is unique and very promising. The game sometimes rewards good intuition and reaction times in flying your way through the missions; but these moments are so few and far between that it causes the story mode to come as a bit of a disappointment. Time Trials soften the blow but do not heal it.  All in all I guess I just felt slightly let down after all the images the trailers and screenshots painted in my head, and the story itself doesn't act as a consolation by any means. If you've been dying to play this game for a long time, then go right ahead and you'll probably find it unique and interesting - but if you're browsing through games here or there and you happen to give this one a miss, it's certainly not going to be the end of the world.",

I'd probably recommend this if you've got nothing else piquing your interest and it's on sale, but not at full price, which it has returned to, so I'm gonna give it a not recommend.",

Although, when I started to get closer to the end, I started to notice some flaws. It is very hard (even with the view button) to keep on track about where you're supposed to go. Often I ended up running in circles until I got killed. Sometimes you even had to die in order to know what you have to do, which I think shows a bad game. The game is also very short, and the story seems like a semi-pointless school project. I'm having a really hard time trying to figure out if this game is good or bad. I've come to the conclusion, that I wouldn't recommend this game to most people, since you're more likely to just be more frustrated than entertained. I'm still eagerly waiting for Mirror's Edge 2 coming this year!",

You will feel empty inside upon 'completing' this terrible game as it does not bother trying to tell a coherent story worth the trouble.  I cannot write 'terrible' enough to convey how bad this game is.  Making it through the game without shooting anyone sounds like it would be a creative challenge, but instead, you are forced to slug it out in at least three areas with the enemy. They position themselves at exit points that take several seconds to get by, such as climbing a pipe or turning a hand wheel to open a door, so getting by while they are shooting at you is impossible. This is further complicated by the wonky disarm system that only works some of the time and the crummy combat controls.  Believe me when I say that I wanted to like this game - I played it all the way through after all. But in the end, I feel this game was not even worth the $5 I spent to get it on sale, and certainly not worth the few hours it took to play through it.",

The game is utterly unique, but by the end that wasn't enough and I was well and truely not having any fun.  There is loads of potential in the free running system, even if this first attempt fumbles. The game wants you to feel free and speedy, but there is no freedom when the path to progression is not just linear but narrow, and there is no speed when that path is not immediately obvious so you have to stop every five feet and look around for the specific ledge or rail the game had in mind for you next. Is this a game about zooming around the city, scaling walls and dashing between roof tops feeling the wind in your hair? Or is it a slow paced puzzle platformer? Because you need to decide, DICE.  In a lot of free running games, it feels too automated, because you just hold down a button and run and everything happens for you, so I like that this game puts the responsibility on your shoulders to catch this ledge, stick that landing, etc. But I think the pace could be held up better if you could basically get where you needed to go any which way you jumped, climbed or ran. That way the challenge wouldn't be 'find the ONE path forward the game has layed out for you' but rather 'you can get to your destination via any path you make for yourself, but can you do it efficiantly?'  Also the combat. I don't even need to qualify this. Nobody, not even the hardcore fans will argue that the combat isn't absolutely dreadful.  The whole thing clearly had serious budget constraints. The characters, the plot, the cutscenes, the world building, the playtime, even the mechanics, it all feels a bit bare bones. I like the characters, but I can't get invested in the concept of the Runners, because A) We're never shown why the government is apparently so evil, we just sort of have to take the protagonist's word for it while the city actually looks like a very nice and well run place, and B) It's never explained what the Runners actually... do. It's less like a complete game, and more like a pitch for a theoretically better game. But would I say yes to that pitch? Definately. The concept is loaded with potential. It just needs crap loads more tweaking. Hear's hoping Mirror's Edge 2 isn't just a love letter to Mirror's Edge 1 and actually takes the time to build upon what is basically a proof of [a very good] concept. Because with a fatter budget, and more open and flowing path to progression and combat that doesn't completely hault the all important flow, Mirror's Edge 2 could be really really cool.
