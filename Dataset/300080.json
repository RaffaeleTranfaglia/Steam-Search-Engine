            "review_text": "Runs better than Rome II and Attila combined. 10/10  -----  THIS IS NOT A TRADITIONAL TOTAL WAR GAME. There. You’re warned.  Of the handful of free-to-play, castle-style games I’ve tried, they have been a handful too many. Stronghold Kingdoms was either too lonely or filled with inter-House drama. Sparta: War of Empires was too deceptive with its trailers and required zero micro. Kingdom Wars had too many bugs and performed too poorly. Upon reading several negative reviews, I convinced myself internally that this game would prove no better.  Total War Battles: KINGDOM is none of any of those bad things.  KINGDOM, firstly, plays very, very smoothly and quickly. Controls are responsive and the game doesn’t waste your time. “But stuff takes forever to grow and collect!!” Not my point. When you are in-game and interacting with the world, you don’t encounter slowdowns, or annoyingly-long cutscenes, or needless exposition. The engine is a well-oiled machine, undoubtedly. The music is also really good, complementing the game without getting in the way.  KINGDOM’s depth really sells it, mind you. The Realm overworld map is hex-based in style, with each space viable for manipulation: elevation, irrigation, terrain type, etc. Building placement encourages wise structure layout. During battles, your formation and tactics matter in equal measure. (a qualm I have is that the archers’ ranged attack acts like an ability and does not auto-fire on enemies; I assume this is done to encourage micro, but it’s more tedious than tactical) Warfare requires very simple, but constant, micro. It’s not too overwhelming, but also not 'set and forget.'  And judging by the speed at which units gain experience and upgrade, there is so, so much more to do.  “But Gold makes it pay-to-win!!”  Accept it. There is no way around that. The amount of PvE and personal kingdom development, and strictly optional PvP (there's almost always a PvE option to quests), however, mean there’s more than enough to do without interacting with another human online. And the prices for most things is extremely minimal in cost. Need a boost this battle? Sac 3 Gold. Desperately need that bit of Wood absolutely right now? 1 Gold for your troubles. The costs do not murder the player’s treasury, and a variety of in-game methods offer the chance to accumulate Gold independent of any real money you spend on the game.  The game does not persistently badger you to share with your Facebook friends with annoying pop-ups every time you successfully gather grain, or pester you to buy Gold every 3 minutes. The option is up there, quietly sitting on its own, not bugging you. Mad props for not beating the player over their head with it.  TL;DR: Total War Battles: KINGDOM is not your average free-to-play, castle-style title. It is indeed better than the simplistic tripe that passes on most on mobile devices or sits in the back tab of web browsers. I would recommend people try it simply because it runs so blasted smoothly, but the profundity to the grand strategy of it all may arguably keep you hooked.",

This is a game you come in, do so clicks go away play something else and then come back when you remeber you have it. The problem is, this is basicaly a mobile to pc port. Mobile gamers are used to this kind of play and once you accept the game as a mobile game / browser game it does make sense and it's far deeper than you would think since water and terraforming are much more important than it first apears. Example. A farm crop tile next to water growth time is around 5 hours. The same tile 2 hexagones away from water 22hours growth time... See what I mean. Time managment.

            "review_text": "This game is awesome . People dont recommend this because they dont understand how the game works and they think its pay to win . Its not , everything (exept some cosmetic stuff) is free . You just need time to get it . For example if you want longsword knights , you can buy them for 400 gold (real money) or craft it what takes some time . Battle system is pretty interesting though not that good but it has good concept . The economic and building system is really unique. You need to find places for your farms , sheeps , cattle , woodcutters and quarry . Once you understand how it works , , its easy and interesting . For example , farms in order to plant and harvest need to have water/river near by . BUT if you do one mistake , river can go crazy and flood that farm and everything that will stand in its way . At that point you can try fixing it with lots of dams or just restart .Or you can accidentally cut down whole forest and you will be without wood. People just need to understand how it works . Production is pretty much just taking when its ready , you can have tavern and blacksmiths who will produce money but you need workers to that building so you need houses to have workers. Productions is slow , but you can get some resources by completing missions . OVERVIEW : Game is very good , good concept , soundtrack is good , battle system is interesting and challenging , production and building is also challenging and sometimes very risky . I totally reccomend this game to everyone , its not like any other Total War game , but it is unique . Try it , see yourself .",

In a Freemium game I think complexity is a winner for the developer when trying to shift gold and for the non-gold buyer who can prdocue the complex resources for the 'gold buyers'. Those with time on their hands and not much money can contribute more to the game economy this way. Like Settlers Online or EvE Online.",

One can't expect the ordinary Total War game, because it isn't. It is an online rts game and that's why I don't find it strange or annoying with long building times.  I would say this game is a mix between Total War, Civilization and Stronghold Kingdoms. Sure there are some bugs but it's still in beta and it's running better than I though it would on my laptop. So far I haven't felt that it's a pay-2-win game and that is also positive, since there are games like this out there that you can't progress in if you aren't paying a ton of money.  All in all I think it's a good game, and since it's free you should at least try it out for yourself and make your own opinion!",

You guys be careful what nickname you choose and if you want a reset in case you want to start the game from beginning cuz from what I'm seeing so far that's not possible.  Anyway considering its in beta I thing its great and there aren't many games out there where you can have a direct impact of the battle. Most of them have automatic battles and that really spoils the fun.",

            "review_text": "Firstly this is not the traditional Total War game so do not go in expecting that; it never claimed to be the full blown experience that you get with the latest masterpiece. It does however have something else to offer and that is a mobile or quick game when a long campaign on the latest Total War is just not possible.   The essence of Total War is there but made more accessible in a number of ways. Being cross platform is just a start but I do believe the actual mechanics of the game are easier to understand for those who do not have the time to invest in or concentration span for the main series. This game is a pick up and play kingdom building experience with combat, level progression and upgrades.  Would I recommend the game; well yeah it is Free to Play, playable, nice enough graphics which any hardware could probably handle, audio is good but not sure about the speech at the beginning. Don't get me wrong there are still a few issues that need to be addressed but nothing major. One game mechanic that may annoy some people is the lowering and raising of land near water; it annoys me sometimes :)  When this game is on tablet it will be great I think as having Total War on the go is a good thing. Used to carry a heavy laptop around so I could play the main Total War games on the go but that is just not practical now I have a desktop. This game is good for when you don't have too much time to play or just want to give yourself a break from more demanding games of the franchise.",

However, all resources can be collected in game, even silver and gold, and there is no type of resource that can only be bought with real money. The base building is combined with economy elements of surrounding building bonuses, and the terrain landscaping to avoid floods is a nice challenge. The battles are realistic and combine a variety of abilities to unlock and improve for your soldiers. The graphics are sweetly honed, not too demanding even for lower-end pcs, and you can also zoom a little. The only negatives are that to create a new game you need a new account, that it is hard to figure out what each unit excels at, that you can't skip the tutorial -which forces you to build some inconvenient buildings-, and that you can't have two in-game windows open at the same time, to sort, e.g., your army according to the demands of a mission. Definitely worth a try.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR at the bottom.   People need to realise that this is a game designed for tablet / mobile thus not a title between all the other Total War games but an offshot for a completely different platform. Imagine playing the latest Total War on tablet, not happening. How can you tell? Controls. Mouse only, no keybindings.  Mobile games are coming to steam! So are console games! Deal with it! To start a hate train because a game seemed to come to the 'wrong neighbourhood' is unsightly. They can do their part on steam too but you are not forced in any way to play them.  This game is also 'F2P' (Depending on your definition) which with most certainty includes microtransactions like most F2P titles (Big suprise there). Being F2P also creates paywalls which are either non scalable because the content behind it is exclusively for paying users or tough but not impossible to reach for players who do not want to spend real money. And in the end becomes a slowpaced game for everyone who decides not to spend money.  First of all I'd like to dispel some of the false or lacking information on which most reviews are based creating a maelstrom of bad reviews from players fresh out of the tutorial.   The most popular :  Harvesting wheat / felling trees -&gt;  8 hours waiting  After building your farm wheat fields start to appear around it, depending on the distance to water the time until they are able to be harvested differs. After the wheat is finally harvestable you are given  TWO CHOICES :  1. Harvest a single spot :  20 min.  = 20 units or 2. Harvest ALL spots :  8 hours  = 10 units / spot As you can see option no. 2 is the worst possible choice. If this is the reason you quit playing and gave the game a bad review then you should have paid more attention to what you are doing instead of causing a temper tantrum for no reason. It is quite a waiting game at the beginning, but every sane gamer would not stare at the monitor waiting for the counter to drop to zero, that's why this is more of an inbetween games game.   The most concerning :  Pay to win / Paywall (Paying users exclusive content) I think we all can agree that in a situation where you pit equally skilled players against one another, that the one who can pay real money to give him an edge in combat will most definetely win if the game is not heavily RNG-based. However the real question here is: Is the equally skilled player condemned to  never  overcome this hurdle even with zeal and competetive spirit? The answer to that is :  He can, with time .  Let me explain:  There are  NO  paying users exclusive : Buildings / Units / Buffs / Equipment,  every player has the same selection and arsenal . Unlike other mobile games where the best buildings and units are exclusively obtainable through real money. All players do not have acess to everything on the get go. You need to reach a certain level regardless wether you want to pay or not to have buildings (and their corresponding units) unlocked. Every military building comes with a selection of 3 to 4 different units depending on the building.   Example  : You build your first stable and it can house only one mounted unit. After building your stable you choose which one you want.  (F2P ALERT)  The first two of the three units you can choose without any hitch (100% free), however the third is behind a real money paywall (That shook you a little, right?). But against all odds you are able to 'craft' the third unit and kick out the one currently stationed (no money paid). Those units are statwise superior than the other but not unobtainable for non paying users. As for  Buffs  and  Equipment  those can also be crafted like military units and given to those or used on the battlefield.  As for the game itself. It is pretty slowpaced but steadily gains velocity as you progress. You start off with 1 of 6 regions and you have a restriction of how many buildings you can mantain within this region. This restriction gradually decreases the more regions you liberate and castles you upgrade within each region. Effectively increasing your playtime each session. I do not want to venture any further into the building system and the little tricks therein, because a little trial and error doesnt hurt.   The tutorial  is rather short and gives you the basics of the basics but not all the vital information you desperately need. In my opinion this is a bad choice of tutorial, instead of having tutorial pieces pop up when you need them, say changing seasons, new buildings, new units, new regions, small events etc. they leave you out to fend for yourself and figure it out on your own.  Along with the tutorial  the tooltips  also lack information as well as numbers. Tooltips need a desperate overhaul and the tutorial needs to be more than just an introduction to the basics of basics. To counter a lack of information a compedium of such would have been a nice way to make wating somehow enjoyable.    The combat  is a squad based rock-paper-scissors system (if that makes any sense). Every unit consists of multiple soldiers and counter or is countered by another unit. Lance &gt; Rider &gt; Shield &gt; Archer &gt; Lance &gt; and so on. Additionaly armor is a factor Mace &gt; leather + chain , Axe &gt; Plate. If that wasn't enough, in the beginning the two facing units charge each other to engage in close combat depending on your timing, you do heavy charge damage before the brawl begins or none at all (pre-emptive strike).  But wait! There's more!  Every unit can get one of two abilites purchased through experience acquired through battle. Making your units more diverse and useful in certain situation. For example switching your shield units with a your mounted units which are engaged with lance units (rock-paper-scissors, remember?) to avoid certain death for your horsemen. To top it all of you can have in your 9-squad army up to 3 and at least 1 siege unit. Ranging from ballistaes, trebuchets or mangonels. Ballistaes hit only enemy units for moderate damage, instantly killing weak armored targets. Trebuchets hit all units for a good amount of damage. Mangonels leave the area they hit burning and damaging any and all units that remain in this area. Every siege unit act as an ability with their own innate cooldown before you can use them again. But if you have 3 siege units and 6 fighting units and on the other hand your oppenent has 9 fighting units which disperse your 6 quite fast you have lost even with the siege units still intact und unscathed. (I don't think you can actually damage / destroy siege units) Quite the arsenal and not as simple a battlesystem I dare say. After every battle your units need time to recuperate depending on how wounded they are 10 to 20 min. or if unscathed not at all. However you cannot engage in another battle while a unit in your army is still recuperating. Yes, you can skip waiting with a little bit of moneyflow but if you are eager to fight battle after battle it can become very expensive and you should play another Total War game. The experience your units gain can be used to either upgrade the unit itself thus adding more soldiers to this unit, upgrade melee damage, range damage, armor rating or charge damage. Or as already mentioned purchase one of two abilites for this unit which may turn the tide of battle.  TL;DR: It's a F2P inbetween-games-(tablet)game with no content locked behind a paywall (no paying user exclusives). Paying players cannot exceed the limits of a non-paying player. Slowpaced at the start with steadily increasing session lengths. Lack of information may result in uneffecient use of terrain, buildings or units. Not a game for the impatient.  This  will  get downvoted to hell because those who do, are either those you didn't grasp the concept of the game or jumped on the hate train for the lulz.",

Total War formula revolves around the hybrid turn-based management/real-time strategy and it what defines it. Creative Assembly and Sega are probably exploring new grounds on the 'free-to-play' market, a realm filled with casual players who don´t mind spending a buck or two for a few gold coins that will give them an edge like upgrading a unit or instant harvesting of a wheat field.   Battles: Kingdom picks up the same battle mechanics of Total War Battles; Shogun and adds an hexagonal map were you build and manage your kingdom, similar to Civilization V, Master of the Arcane or Endless Legend. This is truly the high point of this game; you can actually terraform the environment to your liking, building dams to divert rivers and raising the terrain to your advantage. I spent hours just messing with all the options available. It´s alot more fun than the Beyond Earth terraforming features for example.   Honestly, this doesn´t feel like a Total War kind of game but it doesn´t mean its bad. Just make sure that before you venture into it, be prepared for something different that you are used to.",

Yes there are 8 hr cooldowns, but you're not supposed to sit and watch the cooldown. You can use gold or you can come back later. Its designed for short 5-10 min play sessions. Obv this doesn't sit well on PC as its not what we're used to. You can spend money to skip grind, but you don't gain utility value from spending so its not pay-to-win. However if you spend as much as you'd be prepared to on a standard PC game, you will probably be able to compete with higher ranks, but only if you spend strategically.   I've played 9 hrs (FOR FREE) - it's got some interesting base building strategy, like balancing expansion with managing water levels. You do have to wait to re-heal troops between fights which can mean you only have 1 fight per session, but if you overwhelm opposition you can get away with zero casualties and thus fight again straightaway.   Battles are more like a puzzle game than a traditional Total War fight, but still retains elements of setting up your formation to outwit opponent and making strategic moves mid game to counter act opponent's moves.  Biggest failing is that the game doesn't pit you against real opponents soon enough. After 9 hrs I still haven't fought a real person - I assume this is coming!?!?",

It's Civilization meets Travian meets Total War - and done fairly well.   To be clear, the idea of this game is to be a cross-platform thing you can dip in and out of: Battles are tres petit and your actions generally take several minutes to several hours to complete on the campaign map. With that in mind, it's not a typical Total War game to sit at for 18 hours solid conquering. If you come in with that expectation, you're going to cry.  Instead it's like so many similar time-based multiplayer online games (Travian, Tribal Wars, Clash of Clans - there may be haters, but they're good fun with work colleagues when you don't have a lot of time on hand). Only difference is that this is so far more immersive and much more fun. Battles are suitably tactical and challenging and deliver a quick buzz (handy for coursework breaks). So far, the campaign map's relatively well paced and there are plenty of new glossy things getting unlocked to keep me interested. It's a massive hex map that you unlock new theatres by defeating the army there - in each one it's a mix of terra-forming and town-building (lots and lots of little houses), trying to twist streams where you want them to make life more fertile and sustainably milk the land. It was an emphasis I wasn't expecting, but a lot of fun. I haven't felt at a disadvantage by not buying any things yet either.  Negatives... Haven't found any significant ones yet, other than it's eating too much of my productivity.  Give it a go - just don't expect MTW3.",

In the short time that I played KINGDOM I have already asked myself 'what's the point to playing this?'  Building different buildings and designing your own kingdom is a fantastic idea, backing it up with a total war style battle system makes it even sweeter, but KINGDOM, as others have stated, is basically a tablet game. The battle system is too simple to be any fun, your guys just automatically walk toward the enemy and there is little you can do besides move a unit to try and trick your enemy (lol) or use a dopey powerup.   As others stated, doing anything in the KINGDOM building mode is ridiculous, with the game trying its hardest to get you to buy premium currency to speed up every resource gathering task. If i wanted to play a game where I just check in for 2 minutes and then log out and not play for 8 hours I'll go break into peoples houses and water their house plants.  Also, building the kingdom feels very empty and pointless, the world does not feel alive at all, (no little medieval people using the roads or bustling about, or harvesting the resources) and since the ultimate purpose of the kingdom is to support the army for the dopey battles, there really is no point.  Unless its some kind of end of the road/ high level feature, the building part of the game does not intertwine with the battle part. Yes you build certain buildings to actually get your units for battle, but besides that there is no direct interaction between kingdom and battle.  My opinion to fix this would be to pull it off the marketplace, and bury the code with the E.T. Atari cartridges in a landfill.  No but seriously, what I would do is actually pour some depth into KINGDOM to make it almost more like a medieval sim city, then combine a fun addicting city/region builder with a battle system that plays more like an actual total war game like Rome II or Atilla, and your kindgom supports your army in way more depth.   They could even make it so your army invades other peoples realm and they try to plunder the castle and sack the village.  If you want to make a free-to-play game with microtransactions that's fine with me, but if the game itself is pointless/unfun, I will not play it long enough to even consider buying premium anything.  I love the actual Total War games, but please either fix this or kill it with fire.  Now if you excuse me my neighbors hibiscus needs watering.   ",

The city building is decent if simple but trying to build where you want in the geography is needlessly complicated-roads and bridges can only be built on certain elevations. Excavating on land next to a body of water flooded stone I managed to find, building dams and trying to release the water somehow to get the stone didn't work so I gave up.  Buildings and missions are gated behind a honor system which you gain by doing small quests(mostly just building up your city and battles) the early game is very slow and tedious. Building actions like gathering resources or earning money can take hours of time but can be expedited by using purchasable currency, also certain combat buffs can be purchased. Rather than have different outfits for your avatar or skins for units as their money maker his is where the developers chose to setup the gameshop, a clear pay-to-win formula.

Over a few days the gulf between me an non pay to win against a pay to win was evident and very frustrating as it is almost a guarentee that they win the PvP. I would get the same pay to win person over and over. Other non payers must be loosing interest, also being frustrated.  On the other hand you don't need to play PvP and can do quest/mission battles instead. However at 20 mins wait for a lvl 2 unit to heal if NOT PAYING means I waste too much time looking and waiting for things to click....  So the micro management, A lot of the time you do things and then find out you can't get what you need, ie you build a 2nd knights quaters to recruit more knights only to find you are restricted to only one knight. The reasource collecting is not bad at first but becomes painful as you progress with high costs and too many things you need to improve to increase your reasource pool, with things having different producer times you can spend hours on the game looking and waiting 5 mins between doing something and really when you look back you haven't actually achieved much.  It's a nice looking addictive game and the battles can be fun and frustrating, the tactics are quict simple and rely more on differences in army units and how quick you can click but over all there is little strategy to the game. The strategy is basically what to build where, how to maximim and prioritise reasources. ",

Matchmaking for pvp is abosulty horrible ill be matched against pay to win players who are very high ranked since they payed money. lag and connectiong issues is god awful nothing like spending 'gold' (the games currency) to heal troops than have connection issues and all your troops are dead ,and the 'charging' mehcnainc if you do it in pvp it never atcivates when you tell it too. im very dissapotied to even call this game a total war game becasue it is not a total war game its nothing but a cash grab and i except to see this game die within half a year. Am i against free 2 play games having microtransactions? No, because i know they need to make money but the way their doing in this game is horrible. im not aginst players paying to have 'boosts' as in they collect more resources faster or gain more XP but being able to pay and have god units or to collect one barrle of wheat for 8 hrs is just so dang stupid, and for all you who are defeanding this game (who are most liekly the pay to win players ofcourse their enjoying this) why put that much money into it when you can just go buy Attlia or SHogun 2 and have waaaay more fun? CA how about you acctually put money into a game that will work and be fun again for every one? instead of putting out this crap trying to take advantage of your fans.

I have to admit I downloaded because I have played all TW games since Shogun 1 and I belong to those who enjoy Rome 2 and Attila, even so it is raining DLC.  But the Game has sadly nothing to do with strategy or any other game of the TW line.  It is a of the shelf clone of most “strategy games” on Android or other mobile devices. Build a “base” that produces resources, improve resource output over time and create and “army”. The army consist of a handful of units that slowly improve. The battles are the real letdown – a fallback to the old column-attacker games. You have three columns with troops. You can shift your units from column to column or change them from front row to second row or third row. You have very little influence on the combat at all – just a defense, offense and ranged weapons bonus you canm activate from time to time.   Right now the game shines in no area at all. The aspect that I don’t like most is the glacial speed of the game. If you are not willing to invest money – and I am not at this stage – you have to wait until resources are harvested and your undying army units have regained health.   All in all an off the shelf Skinner box that has no special merits right now.

It's a tablet game and nothing more, if this were a play store or Itunes review the score would be very different. It's not a PC game, f2p or not, end of discussion. But if Sega insist on offering it as a PC game I shall review it as one.   5/10  I did have to think quite a lot about whether I could recommend this game and while it’s not a bad game per se it certainly isn’t a good game at the moment ( I appreciate it’s still in beta and a lot could change) . In fact to be fair to this game as a free-2-play it’s not too bad and miles ahead of Stronghold: kingdoms in both art style and mechanics.   On the positive side I thought that the building and settlement creation were quite well done though they are a little basic. Kudos to the team for pretty excellent terrain height, excavation and water mechanic programing, it really helps to create this felling that the world itself can be shaped to suit your needs. The time required for building and resource gathering was pretty good, not obscenely long as in most free-2-plays (read as free-2-wait). On top of this you can even find and mine premium currency allowing any player no matter how stingy to gain some of the advantages. In fact if the game was purely the build section then I would actually recommend it.  There are however massive issues with the battle system. And by massive issues I mean JESUS CHRIST WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? Yeah that level of bad. I do have to admit that most of my issues with the combat are simply that it is difficult to accept calling this a total war game. I am a die-hard fan of the series (hell I even like empire) and like many total war fans I love the complexity of tactics one can to utilize to win. The battles of Battles: Kingdom seem to have stripped all this away to be replaced with clicking to charge at the right  time….what? ..... WHAT?.... HOW HAVE YOU TURNED YOUR COMBAT INTO QUICK TIME EVENTS? QTEs in total war now, along with day one dlc you’d be forgiven for thinking EA had bought CA. That said Sega aren’t much better look what they did to sonic. I have't played Shogun 2 Battles but i see that the combat in that is turn based, why didn't they keep that? sure its not total war but at least it's still tactical not ♥♥♥♥ING QTEs!!! But my issues with the battles don’t stop there. I have a few other problems with it as well like why is there a cool down for ordering archers to fire? One unit fires on one enemy unit and I have to wait a good few seconds before I can order an entirely separate unit of archers to fire on an entirely separate unit of archers. The orders system is a nice idea but I don’t think it is well realised. The unit special abilities and general abilities from Rome 2 would’ve been a better style of system and each ability has advantages and disadvantages meaning that they are a tactical choice. The orders on the others hand you just spam every time the cool down timer is over.  How did they mess this up so badly?  Not something that gets my personal recommendation but if you’re a looking for a well-balanced f2p and you don’t consider this an affront to the good name total war then it’s not all that bad under the surface.",

            "review_text": "This game probably has the potential to be considered fun, but it certainly is not right now. The reason is that you are limited in every aspect of growth, required to spend Gold (pay currency) in order to complete tasks instantly. This becomes maddening very quickly once you realize you require gold for basically every aspect of growth that in other games you would unlock with time and experience. The best types of units require large sums of gold to hire, leaving player who do not pay incapable of feilding a force containing more than one of these kinds of units without playing for eternities or paying.   The actual battle system has very little to do with total war, instead playing like an automated combat rpg in the style of Disciples, where units are on a grid and almost exclusively deal with the units directly in front of them. Thus almost the entire combat portion of the game is fighting pre designed layouts of enemy units, which are designed to cause trouble for players without any of the top shelf units. This over simplification of combat reduces Cavalry to a rock-paper-scissors role rather than a strategic weapon; artillary peices are outright removed from combat and instead offers periodic direct fire. This bait and switch for combat would be tolerable if the system was not designed to make you wait up to an hour for your units to 'recover from wounds' for each unit that takes noticable damage during a fight.   After three hours, every part of the game is reduced to a painful crawl if you refuse to buy gold. Upgrading buildings costs several hundred of multiple resources, things you gather 20-40 at a time of. Combined with several pay mechanics like advisors and contracts there is just way too much content that is purposefully put in place to make you want to spend. I'm sick of the meritless 'well they got to make money somehow' arguement that is perpetuated by these sorts of schemes. They could of just as easily made the pacing much easier by increasing the amount of gold given to you and reducing costs, etc. There are ways to make the game bearable, they just did not want to do it.   If the game replicated the total war combat system in the small space the battles took place, reduced the arbitrary timers, and offered more in the ways of appearance items for those soldiers than I would of been interested. Sadly all we get is an off-brand Stronghold online game, which is doubly odd because most consider Stronghold the off-brand travian.   All in all, a very shoddy attempt at turning Total Wars into a mobile phone experience. The combat is designed to limit strategy and only respect hard counters and luck mechanics and the buildings aspect is the equivilent of giving a painter this gigantic canvas and asking him to pay them for every mark made on the canvas, all the paints, the honor of being there working on the canvas, as well as the 'canvas using' tax. There is very little 'Total War' anything besides the presence of units that look like they are from Total War.  ",

Ok the gold thing I dont mind so much. you dont get anything for free in this world afterall. and its 2 cents per gold. My main problem with this game is it ripped me off. I spent about $30+ building my kingdom up. I had 4 castle towns lvl'ed to 2's and 3's max number of farms, ranchs, fishing docks, and the whole thing sculpted with rivers encircling the farms and deep lakes teaming with fish. Not to mention the Army I put togather, max lvl. max lvl armour and weapons for all! Didint log on for a bit. Everything is gone. all the stuff i paid for gone. when logging into my account it starts me at the begining. So I would like to thank the developer for stealing from me. You lost a paying customer, and have ensured I will not be playing any future titles you produce.",

This as opposed to starting from camp and exploring in the immediate area then moving outward: but that would not prompt you to spend as much.   o A.I. matching for duels makes it frustrating to the point either you spend a lot of money to equip or you quit playing all together. The people you duel against are generally over powered in relation to you if you are trying to play free as advertised.   If you have patients and are able to place, your second castle in the lower right so you can place a third in the upper middle, in a few months you might be able to make some gains.   • In about six months to a year, you may be able to craft something.   There are many other examples but that should suffice to make a point.
