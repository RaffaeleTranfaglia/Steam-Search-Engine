            "review_text": "This is an interesting one, although not really a great one.  The world and lore it establishes are well-done and interesting. You get to encounter different sects, and you can ally yourself with them, betray them later, and then change your mind and do what they probably would have wanted if you hadn't already massacred their town. All of these actions have consequences within the world and how that world reacts to you. Those consequences follow through all the way to the ending of the game, which has a pretty impressive variety of outcomes. This is probably the strongest part of the game and what makes it worth playing through.  The growth and progression of your character is also well done. You can choose to play Geneforge as three quite different 'classes'. Every level up you get a set of skill points that you can apportion as you wish. The class you choose doesn't dictate what you can do, but it does make it easier/harder to level up certain skills. Skills range from physical combat, magic spells, the ability to 'shape' creatures to fight for you. General skills, such as Leadership and Mechanics, are also available. Pleasantly, these are actually very useful to find non-combat methods to progress through the game.  Again all of these things are well done, and are what make the game worth playing. Where it falls apart a bit, is in the interface and to a certain degree, the combat.  Combat is turn-based, and on the surface, can be quite tactical. Timing, and awareness of the positions of both your allies and your enemies are all quite important. Particularly, when you do have allies (such as the creatures you can 'shape'), you do have to take into account whether or not you or your creatures are blocking a path forward. You can use this both to your benefit and your detriment, by funneling enemies down a corridor into one of your stronger creatures.  In theory anyway.  The problem is that, at least in my experience, the game is rather easy. So, tactics more or less go out the window, when you can just click-click-click your way to victory. Positioning at that point becomes more of an annoyance, as you try to coax the pathing algorithms to make sure that you don't waste a turn because you clicked slightly to the left of something, so it paths all the way around and your turn is wasted. And it's even worse that the punishment for this is not death, but a test of your patience, more often than not.  Towards the end of the game, the challenge is upped, but by presenting annoyances, like poisoned areas that do damage to you and your creatures for just being in them. There is an optional area towards the end that serves as a pretty robust challenge, but again, the tactics aren't really that interesting at the end of it. It's more a battle of attrition that you just need to push through.  Overall, the combat side of this game seems like it would be great on paper, but it ends up being boring most of the time, and annoying some of the time. Very rarely is it actually much fun.  I should mention that the presentation of the game is quite old-school, and to top it off, there is no music aside from the title screen of the game. You just get some ambient noise in towns, and sound effects for all the actions. That's it. Honestly, some music would have made some of the more annoying slog parts of the game much more palatable. I mean, it helped a lot when I was just listening to a podcast or some music when I was doing it.  That being said, despite all the gripes, I would still totally recommend the game. Normally, I'm a gameplay over story/presentation guy, but in this case I can overlook it. What it does right, it does very well.   From what I've heard, the series just continues to build on itself as it goes on. Based on what I played, I'm very much looking forward to eventually going through the following games in the series.",

            "review_text": "This is an amazing game, even for its age. I really love the story, but what was even better is the closure you receive at the end in the form of hand-drawn story panels (this particular aspect really appealed to me). There are many different endings to find, which helps increase playtime/replayability and overall, I have put more than 50 hours into this game.   If you are a fan of RPG's and you don't mind dated graphics, you should definitely give this or the later entries in the series a try.  8/10",

The world you can explore is pretty big and the game has more than one ending, depeding on your doings and the relationship between you and the various factions that dwell the island. The game relies a lot in textual descriptions of the environments you explore and the people you meet to make up for the plain graphics and limited art assets. Recommended if you don't mind a slow-paced game with an 'old school' feel. Grab it when on sale with the rest of the saga.",

The area is huge, and the ammount of time needed to explore everything easily surpasses 60 hours. So if you wish to play an rpg that also implements the 'role playing'-part this game will hit right home.  The biggest downside of the game is the graphics. Even in 2001 these graphics were slightly outdated. However, if you don't need the sharpest graphics, this game will give you one hell of a ride.",

            "review_text": "I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay.   Pro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.  Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike.   LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.  Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.  Can easily engulf you in for weeks.  Lots and Lots of Text Con's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination   Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.  Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.  Overall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing. Heres to you, Spiderweb Software.",

            "review_text": "Geneforge (part 1) places you on a mysterious island dwelling in a fantasy world that is run by Shapers, the masters of creation. You, yourself a Shaper (or one of the two other classes), don't know anything about the island except it's declared barren, i.e. forbidden to go to. An accident of sorts forces you to try and discover the mystery that is the Sukia Island.  For those of you who love a good roleplaying game, here's one. The graphics and sounds are simple but the mechanics works and Fogel's script feels magical and creates a thrilling atmosphere that keeps in touch throughout the game. Why, the game even has replayability value with 3 different professions and 3 different distinct factions to ally with. This is rather lot for such a simple-looking yet deep game.",

However, I lost count of how many times I got wiped out in melee due to clicking the character (end turn) instead of the enemy (attack) which is a matter of pixels. Also frequent was the pathfinding deciding that instead of using the 3 action points walking to the enemy and 5 attacking them, it'd be more fun to spend all 8 running backwards and forwards around invisible obstacles. When most battles can end in 2 or 3 turns, each missed opportunity can lead to you being straight back at that damn 'you are dead' screen.  Possibly not for the easily frustrated.",
