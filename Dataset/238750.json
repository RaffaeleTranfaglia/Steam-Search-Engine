This game is very good. It's expansive, challenging but not unfair, and there's a good amount of character and party customization. It's the most RPG-y RPG I've played in a long time.   You'll travel the open world, come across riddles, puzzles, enemies and dungeons - some of which will be too high level for you. There is no level scaling and the world is crafted in a way that you're going to want to backtrack often to try and kill that boss you found who one shot you 10 hours earlier. And that's awesome. You're going to be battling your way through dungeons, barely surviving by the skin of your teeth and have to make runs back to town (actual runs, no instant click travel here) to restock on supplies so that you can continue. And that's awesome.  It's not going to be for everyone but this is a really solid, lengthy and replayable RPG with lots of substance that's built on its RPG systems and its gameplay rather than a story or dialogue choices or any of the usual modern stuff.   The only con is performance. Performance is poor in some places, and loading times especially are poor. This is exacerbated by the fact that the game freezes in the background, meaning you have to sit through the 30 second-1 minute load screens. This can get very annoying because you will often be making trips back and forth to town and there's a loading screen each time. The game also doesn't exactly look amazing and the dialogue and story are generic and half-♥♥♥♥♥. But from what I understand this is a game made by a small team mostly as a proof of concept to get this series back up and running, and it did what it set out to achieve and then some.",

            "review_text": "Here is a quick review for you from a M&amp;M veteran.  Pros: -Nice story. -Nice graphics although not too good but who gives a toss about graphics anyways. -Feels like Might and Magic. -Is indeed fun. -Has a nice hotkey bar that you can place your spells on so you don't need to open your spellbook 24/7. Makes things easier in my opinion. -They finally upped the magic damage so you can sometimes 1 shot entire crowds when you crit with your spells. -Decent sound effects. -The undead look super cool. -All wizard party is a wonder to behold. With crits added, your magic attacks can do a lot of damage and the game becomes even more enjoyable and easier. It is so good that I ACCIDENTALLY KILLED EREBOS INSTEAD OF USING THE SHARDS TO SUMMON THE LIGHT FROM THE VESSEL. ♥♥♥♥ER JUST DIED BECAUSE MY CHAIN LIGHTNING HIT FOR 2 K DAMAGE AND CREDITS JUST STARTED ROLLING. - Nice dungeon design. Although since it's tile based, it's mostly visuals, not too much variety, very few secrets, traps etc. compared to the other games. It could have been a gray labyrinth and from 'gameplay' point of view, the dungeons would have basically been the same. But still they mostly look nice in my opinion. - I like Ashan better than Enroth. Has a more interesting lore in my opinion. - Crag Hack is back my dudes.  Cons. Oh boy. - Not even half of the content of mm6 mm7 or mm8. Probably inferior even to mm9. This bothered me the most. You cannot even do the promotion quests of other classes for example. Oh and there is only one promotion for each class instead of the usual two. - 4 races. 3 classes for each and class design isnt very intricate. - Obligatory tile based movement and buffs. Didnt bother me that much but still, only turn based is a bit off putting. - TONS of sound effects and textures (mostly monsters) are recycled from Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic 5 and some others. - Basically one map. Really. One. Map. - Since it is so small no flying whatsoever. Very limited freedom. - WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF A BLOODY CITY, IN OPEN FIELDS, THE CITIES ARE BASICALLY AT YOUR HEIGHT. IMAGINE THJORGARD, NOW MINIMIZE IT TO YOUR HEIGHT. YES. THAT IS IT. - Unless you have like at least 2 casters, the DLC is impossible to do. - Level cap is 40. Yes. The content is that limited. - Obligatory Uplay login. Did not bother me but might be a bit off putting for other players. - Nearly all status effects last forever. I am not even gonna elaborate like this happens when you get that and such because nearly all of them are broken. Even ♥♥♥♥ing sleep doesn't get dispelled when you get damaged if I am not mistaken. You need to have casters or an endless supply of scrolls to negate status effects (which trigger roughly half of the time when creatures attack) or you literally cannot progress. - Feeblemind --&gt; Death.  Overall this isn't as good as mm6, mm7, mm8 or even mm9. But it is nonetheless enjoyable in my opinion. Perhaps a lot more enjoyable than the other games if you go full mage. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed. If you like Might and Magic get this. Just don't have super high expectations and you will enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "Addendum to the Might &amp; Magic (World of )X(een) Legacy.   It's not a bad game, but it's pretty average and a bit too much on the clunky side with a lot less freedom than previous games.  This game is somehow like a watered down spin-off from the Might &amp; Magic 3-5 World of Xeen. It uses the same base mechanics for Map layout, Movement and Combat, which was fine twenty years ago, but feels pretty clunky today. There is also a few inclusions from Might &amp; Magic 6 like the use of Hirelings and a few categories for Spells and Skills and the use of a Skill and Promotion system.   Character creation is more streamlined, but also more boxed in, because everything each Class can learn and to what extent is laid out bare and square with progress bars and totally locked in. You can't add more Points to a Spell or Skill than the Limit of your Rank. There are four Races, each with three distinct Classes that each represents the Might, Hybrid and Magic Class of that Race. There are no limits in regards to which Race and Class you make for your Party, but since the game has no alternative Light Source other than what Magic provides you are going to have a really hard time dealing with Dungeons and underground Areas without a Dwarf (with Fire Magic) or a Class with Light or Dark Magic. If you decide to take a Shot at the Might Achievement you would be really darksided without a Dwarf in the Party, just saying. There are also no requirements for Grandmastery of Light and Dark Magic as there is no kind of Alignment or Reputation system at all.   Combat is quite clunky. You can only attack Enemies that are on the same Line as the one you are standing on and only within a limited Range, which makes Enemy movements look really silly as they slide sideways into Combat and the only Tactic that you can really apply to Combat is to make sure to stand in a Corner, Tunnel or Doorway where the Enemies can't attack you from more than one Side and there is also a limit to how many Enemies can stand on the same Square, which means they will just wait and queue up for the Slaughter. You can only Escape as long as you don't have direct Enemy Contact, but once an Enemy stands next to you you can't move at all.   I can understand why there is no water-walking (no flight, swimming and climbing neither), because that part have been tied into the Story and added as a Roadblock, but I don't understand why there are no Town Portals or Loyds Beacons. Alternatively, you can move around from Obelisk to Obelisk once you have unlocked them and you can add Markers to the Map to remember where they are and what they are called which is visible on the World Map, but they are all quite remote. There is a Spirit Beacon referred to in the description of Primordial Magic as a Spirit Gate, but you can only have ONE one-way ticket for the whole Party despite having several Characters with the same Spell. I really hate all this pointless walking, which it becomes once you have explored it all, because there are never any interruptions or encounters on the Path. The Area Map which is the only Map that shows all the paths can't be zoomed in or out and since there are a lot of Deadends you'll be wasting a lot of time moving from Place to Place, especially when you need to buy a Rank or Spells. There is no free movement at all, but a lot of Maze like Tunnels across the Landscape, through Forests and rocky Terrain. Once you acquire the ability to walk on water you realize that there is remarkably little water that you can actually walk on.   The only really nice thing the Game offers is that you can add your own Markers to the Map, which is visible on the World Map and Area Map and helps a lot to find Trainers again and to keep track of Obelisk and remember where you've been and so on, but unfortunately the Markers you add to a disconnected Area or City is only visible within that Place.   There is also no kind of permanent Item Enchantment in the game. You can't make your own Items or Enchant them with Magical Properties. No point in lugging around anything else than Magic Items, that you intend to use.   Each character has an action bar with ten Slots, but only one. There is no switching between them or making more, which is really too limited.   There is quite a lot of Puzzles and Riddles in the game, which is a bit of a testamony to the old games, but the ones that require you to move around a lot and step on plates in different order or keep track of teleportation Paths are really quite boring and tedious and the clunky Interface is not helpful at all in this regard.   There are a few funny references to Army of Darkness and other Race specific comments to nature and actions, but unfortunately they are just barely chuckleworthy. Your Characters really bark a lot in Combat.   The Story, Sound and Dialogue is pretty decent, but the Graphics are really low-res and it doesn't really support any Resolution at all. The game looks exactly the same in 1280x800 as it does in 1920x1200. It really looks at least ten years older than it is, but due to a tremendous lacks of optimization in the Unity Engine, which is powering the Game, it's actually pretty taxing on your GPU for no reason at all. The game looks nice from a Distance with Shadows and different Light Effects, but it's really blurry up close.   I bought the game on Steam, but I also needed to install Ubisofts UPlay and create an Account in order to play the Game, but UPlay is really half-baked. It tracks my Achievements and seriously slow down loading on Area transistions, but it neither record nor unlock Actions and Rewards and thus I can't unlock any new 'free' Areas. I can't unlock any of the Game Content with Upoints.   The DLC The Falcon &amp; The Unicorn is really short. It's like an End Chapter, which isn't available until you've finished the main Game, and it's actually quite hard. It begins with a Blast of the most cumbersome tediousness of Puzzle solving as the worst parts of the game with a massive moving around. Once you get the hang of it it's quite simple, but incredible boring, because there is really no challenge at all. Until you get it right, until you understand the mechanics it's a massive waste of time.",

Back before the graphics were any good and 3D rendering wasn't even a reality for desktop games. The game play is a perfect balance of old and new. Turn based takes me back, and also enhances the strategic part of this type of gaming. There are certainly some difficult sections in this game, where you can encounter monsters that are outright impossible to kill at the level you are in the game, so be careful. Monsters do not re-spawn, so it is not the kind of game where you can 'farm' for gold and/or items. You have to be careful with your resources to make sure you don't miss any opportunities to upgrade when needed to progress. Overall, I would give this game a 9/10.",

There is a nostelgic feel for old school western RPGs and if you are a fan of this niche genre then you will get your monies worth for the game. However, there is a reason why this style of RPG went out of date and I believe this game falls incredably short of reviving it. The combat system was fairly basic although not in a bad way, the depth for leveling up however was somewhat lacking and the different abilites only a few seemed playable, which hearts the replayability of the game. The positivies I found out of the game was the atmosphere, it did feel like I was inside the Might and Magic world and the lore was present in the form of the collectables in the game. The main narrative however had its high and lows but for the most part I feel like it continued on from Heroes VI well enough. In the end I really, really wanted this game to be amazing as I loved the story of Heroes VI and am a fan of this style of RPG however the game fell flat and I was simply left wanting more. I am hopeing one day the studio retries to make another RPG M&amp;M game but puts in as much effort as they have done with there past games. Rating: 5.5/10",

However, I was pleasantly surprised when the final release came out that a large number of the issues I had with the game had been addressed. Overall, M&amp;MX does a good job of capturing the old school vibe of earlier entries in the system, while taking advantage of some of their later design improvements first seen in their Heroes series of games.   That said, the game misses the mark in several ways. First, the graphic performance is very disappointing. It looks like a game optimized for 5+ years ago. The creation and skill system does a poor job of helping new players understand pros and cons of the abilities and how they impact gameplay. The amount of running through previously cleared areas is frustrating. The limited voice acting is grating and repetitive.  Despite those disappointments, this does scratch the itch for a classic, party-based, first person roleplaying experience. The exploration, discovery, hidden bits, and character classes do feel like previous entries in the system. For a truly authentic experience, and to help off-set the disappointing graphics, I strongly recommend selecting the 'classic pixelated' display found in the gameplay settings menu.   Other pros - once you're familiar with the game, the classes are diverse and offer a lot of variety in how you want to build your party. Combat is tactical enough to be satisfying without slowing the game down too much. Boss fights are brutal but winnable with careful play. The cool epic items that level up with your character are awesome. It's casual enough to be approachable by a wide audience. It's a fairly good value for its pricepoint. It has a strong nostalgia element.   I think people familiar with other games in the series will be most likely to enjoy this version, but it shouldn't stop new players from giving it a shot!",

Game has a throwback feel and is certainly fun at times, but quickly turns to an overwhelming amount of trial and error in the face of constant death. I enjoy open world games with exploration and a variety of monsters. This game tries to appear open but is really extremely linear as any time you go the wrong way at all you die. I am sick of looking at that loading screen.   Other problems include: U play account needed, extremely sub par graphics, low and inconsistant framerates, long load times, repetitve obnoxious sounds, Journal doesnt include trainer locations, default party is garbage, lack of any fast travel, no retreat from combat, poor map system  These are all things that could be forgiven if the gameplay was great, but its not.

There are way too many dungeons with poison attack enemies and getting poisoned without potions means death because resting doesn't really heal you from it and you don't have cure spells in the beginning. Antidote potions were easy to come by in the first dungeon as the enemies occasionally dropped them, but in later dungeon you have ranged poison enemies (that also cause poison with melee) and no source of anything to cure it with. A bit frustrating.  edit: Apparently you can get cure poison spell with novice level earth magic, but point still stands that poison is really annoying and way too frequent effect in the beginning.

My advice is to play on Warrior mode, but read a class guide beforehand, as it is too easy to create a party and build that can’t progress in Act 2.   Legacy is a bit rough around the edges, but if you are a fan of Might &amp; Magic, or RPG’s in general, this one is well worth your time!",

While the game is completly tile based, it does make you think about every step you end up taking, as it uses a turn. If you have a buff, do you want to move this direction or this direction, either way it uses up a point in the spell's duration. The graphics are pretty, although it can be a little laggy even on high end machines it isn't anything to start ranting about. If you are a fan of the older type of RPG's like this, you can even set the game to 'retro mode' in the options and force the older feel pixels for the game. The game is filled with all sorts of journals giving insight to the world the game is set in. I personally sat down (breaks included of going to make a sandwich or something else more important at the moment) for a little over 3 hours to find the perfect type of class combination I wanted for my party. It is very important that you choose wisely. The game encourages you to explore the areas you are in and do not strictly require you to go from point A to point B. The way I see it is, take a shot at getting it. If you get the amout of hours in gameplay that you paid for it, then its worth the purchase.

You make a party of four characters who start undergeared and weak, then explore the world and complete quests to level up and obtain better gear and spells. It's turn-based, and the map is a grid (where you can only face in cardinal directions), so it has the feel of an old game with modern graphics.  If that appeals to you, I'd say you'll enjoy Might &amp; Magic X. If you aren't sure, then a cheaper (though older) place to start would be Might &amp; Magic 3 or World of Xeen (which combines M&amp;M 4 and 5). The playstyle is very similar. Legend of Grimrock isn't far off either, though that game has more emphasis on puzzles and survival.  The world is quite open (and unforgiving - save often, for you can wander into areas too tough for you without warning). The focus is on advancing your party and winning fights while you explore the world, so if you hate turn-based combat, stay far away from this one. On the other hand, if you like exploring dungeons and trying different party builds and skill choices to fight your way to victory, this is a solid game. It doesn't necessarily do anything new, but does a great job of paying homage to a type of game you don't see much anymore in the West.  Note that this game does use uPlay, Ubisoft's client, and keeps it running while the game runs. However, the dev has said that you only need to be online for the initial game launch, and after that you can run uPlay in offline mode without any problem.",

I'm not entirely sure of the development of this game but I suspect Ubisoft just threw these guys permission to use the license and very little in the way of funding. The game feels extremely low budget. Worse than some indie games. Even looking past superficials like the unpolished graphics and lack of voice acting (things one would assume to be better with a AAA publisher) the mechanics are overly shallow such that most people will probably burn out on the excessive content due to tedium.  Melee is very basic with only one talent tree and limited attacks. Range is pointless given the number of ambushes you face (and there's a penalty for shooting things at point blank/melee range). The magic schools don't feel sufficiently different and mostly consist of nukes plus a couple of superfluous buff spells. Yes, there are towns and quests and merchants and the occassional puzzle but all of it is very rudimentary. Itemization is terrible consisting of a few hand placed relics with the rest being randomized Diablo-style crap.  MMX Legacy should be more polished and deeper than Grimrock (and not merely a turn-based alternative). It isn't. Moreoever it is arguably worse in some aspects like level design, character progression, itemization, etc. You're better off playing the old Bard's Tale series as the graphics are only slightly worse but the gameplay is much deeper. But that was funded by Interplay, right? Well... this was ostensibly funded by Ubisoft. Apparently not. A shame. Had they given this the funding they put in other iteration of the M&amp;M series this would have been a fantastic game. In its current condition it is mediocre at best.",

If you are a RPG lover, stop by and look for a decent rpg, then you need to look for other better games.  I have played through the early access, and it was disappointing. I didn't make a comment because it was still beta phase. The full version has made tremendous improvments. For instance, the weapons won't break every second; you wouldn't fail to see your fingers at night due to poor lighting design. I see more barrels with more intereting content and better designed balance such as monster strength and potion pricing.  However, the core problems of the early access are not addressed.  First is no innovation at all. The game play and design is shockingly simplistic. You walk, see monsters, press 1144, then the monsters die. Class leveling is a straight one-way ticket. Monster fighting is the battle on who has more potions. This kind of game design maybe interesting 20 years ago. But to produce such a game at 21st century and charge people 25 dollars for it is simply not acceptable. There are some interesting puzzles, but not enough to make the game attractive.  Then here comes the cheapskate strategy of reduce, recycle and reuse. Ubisoft used this strategy on heroes VI, I still bear with it. However, what is this? The monster appearance, NPCs, music and every other thing you see basically comes from dark messiah and heroesVI. Being of the same world Ashan, I guess some repetition is fine. But this games has gone too far. The worst part is these two games are of totally different age and types. Forcing elements of these two games into one feels like a big modded rpg from some random players community like WOG. Not to mention the texture and graphic is horrible. Some people say it doesn't work with 32bit OS, but my win8 64bit seems to have the same problem as well. In one word: they shouldn't charge 25USD just for a recycled product.  In conclusion, I am not against turn-based strategy games or rpg. But this game is nowhere on par with any decent modern day rpg. It is good for nostalgia. But if you are a real old school MMM fan you won't be bothered to read this review anyway. So I won't recommend to any general rpg players.",

Or trying to find some quest location on the game map. It feels like an unnecessary method for increasing play time.  My game crashed every now and then. The graphics glitched and sometimes even the battle music got stuck in a loop, so I had to listen to it even though there were no monsters around. Apparently some of the quests have been buggy. I had to go and fetch a particular quest item twice, because the game wants you to do certain things in a certain order.  The combat system was a bit unbalanced. There's a set number of monsters in the game, so you can't just kill monsters to grind XP and to learn new tricks. First half of the game I kept getting instakilled and the second half I was always several levels ahead of the monsters I encountered. Even the boss fights posed no threat, which was pretty boring.

It's more like UPRAY the damn thing works. Now I know why their logo looks like a sphincter, because I got ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥. They changed my  ubi.com  account to a uplay because '♥♥♥♥ you' that's why. But, then there was a password breach. Now. I can't log into my other account. 'Forget Password' is a button that does nothing. ...NOTHING! When creating another account in-game it says Ubisoft's servers are down. Ubisoft servers seem to go down more often than a two dollar hooker. Yet, I was able to create an account on their webpage. Why does it work on the website but not in-game? Because '♥♥♥♥ you', that's why. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ YOU Ubisoft. I only bought this POS for nostalgia (and regretted it 20 minutes later). If you're an Ubisoft executive, you should go castrate yourself. You're too stupid to breed.  DISCLAIMER: The 40 minutes of trying to bypass the UPLAY DRM just to play the damn game somewhat tarnished my feelings towards the rest of the game.  THE STORY: Oh for ♥♥♥♥ sake. This is a perfect example of how NOT to do an intro. You get this amazing rambling piece of ♥♥♥♥, while this wonderfully rendered woman reads a book. Exciting? No. It's like Grandpa Simpson...tons of references, and naming of locations I have no clue about. Imagine the fantasy version of this:  'We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say.  Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...'  That's our intro. The 2D art in the book was nice. It would have been better if these 'Raiders' matched my character.  Once in the game, It looked like Unreal Tournament or Quake 3. I had the graphics maxed out. I am rolling with a Titan here. It has to be a bug. But this was my play experience.  I found it funny there's a retro option to make the graphics suck more.  VOICES: Oh great voices! Oh wait. They give you a line, and you have to read the rest. The character's mouths don't move.  It's like I got a game from the late 1990s. Well, steam offers old games... what is the release date? RELEASE DATE 2014?!?!  Oh ♥♥♥♥ you. Legend of Grimrock was made by an indie studio with almost no budget and looks so much better. This game wishes it was Legend of Grimrock II.  At this point, I gave up. This is an indie title made by a big publisher. Poor Developers, they probably would have better luck if they ditched Ubisoft and started a Kickstarter project to fund the game. Ubisoft makes you their ♥♥♥♥♥es and you have to see your work covered in a piece of ♥♥♥♥ like UPlay. I have no interest in playing anymore of your game.  OVERALL: If you REALLY want to play this...

Regardless, fans of the series will enjoy a bit tighter of a Might and Magic experience.. and those unfamiliar with the series will be in for some new challenges and possible frustration. Playing on Warrior difficulty, there were some definitely challenging moments, but I managed to make it through despite picking sub-optimal character classes.   At the end of the day, it was a good solid dungeon crawl with an old-school feel. Recommended for someone who wants a dungeon crawl with the occasional puzzle.",

Of course, the graphics is great, the soundtrack is great, the gameplay is not so bad - BUT.  Why it is so small in all aspects? Even M&amp;M6 was more widescale and it was made 15 years ago! Seriously, why hadn't developers reflected upon that? M&amp;M6 had respawning enemies, several locations per zone and in this 'legacy' remake everything is not present. Like, WTF? And, yeah, the 'yo dawg' style of DRM in DRM - having to play through UPlay from Steam - is just stupid, softly speaking. Well, maybe some youngsters from current generation can find this game fun, but I cannot.  If you really want to feel nostalgia and experience old school hack'n'slash RPG - try Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2. Those are indeed promising titles.",

Well it is clearly a M&amp;M game judging by the poor'ish graphics and the turn based combat style.  I don’t care about none critical mechanics like in M&amp;M 8 getting your crew from taverns or special buildings, thisa gave the game some extra flavor and was interesting to play around with… However so far have not discovered anything new’ish.  There is however 1 total game breaker for me with this game M&amp;M X… Being in a constant turn based environment, every step you make is as if you hop like a bunny from place to place… Also the whole world seems to be 1 big huge chess board in which you walk and if your travels brings you not aligned with a door (which will happen like always), but be prepared to make several 90 degree turns to get to that door instead of doing the logical thing of going diagonal...  From 6 up to 9 M&amp;M you could walk or jump to every place you wanted like a normal FPS (the walking part), then when enemies were in melee range the game went turn based. This is what I love, this is what I want in my M&amp;M games…  Because I love the series in general I will still try to finish it regardless of its flaw, but I will never recommend this game. Simply because I don’t like this game. ",

            "review_text": "As a fan of the later Might and Magic (basically 7 and 8) this game is an utter disappointment.  This game is built around die and retrying to a scary level. You basically go to any area possible, get killed by the first mob or barely survive, then have to find the next area where you might possibly be able to advance. Difficulty spikes evenly at moments, for example you get a few solitary mobs for a while and then a pack of 2 and an elite with them which makes the fight annoyingly hard early on. Boss fights are also unbalanced. You might be able to complete their dungeon without pain, and still have to keep away from them, go somewhere else leveling and getting better equipment, then come back for a hard fight. The mix of multiple mob levels in a single dungeon is also a pain as you are always saving before taking a step in another direction (level 10 in a area and level 15+ not far from it depending on another quest).  I don't like the map designs, with at times just annoying path blockers, put there for no apparent reason, and towns are too big (while it makes for a real town for a grid based game it makes it a labor to travel the streets). Overall design quality isn't really good and game is unoptimized. Running into the forest and jungle kills FPS to a stop.  Story wise you get a common story which is neither good nor bad per se. Classes are limited and some are apparently almost useless, like the defender which sacrifices damage for a shield but can't use his tanking skills on any boss and a number of mobs Bug wise I only had a inconvenience with sound, after 8 hours of game time the combat music wouldn't stop but would be piled upon the last one after each new fight. Reloading or changing map restores the usual sound until the next fight (which isn't hard as you always reload anyway).",

            "review_text": "I can say, will do a bit of a quick review. So won't get too much into detail, but will cover the basics. It is a overall quite neat game. Taking the classic dungeoncrawl approach and spicing it up a little. While the graphic are notably ripped from heroes 6, I don't mind at all. After all, why waste assets when they have them? And they work well within the world so.  That said, the game has some MASSIVE flaws, and some small annoyances. Can start with the small ones: For starters, there are too few lines of spoken dialog in this. Even with a diverse group, basically 70 % of all lines are identitcal between characters. Not that many, but heck, it's not far from it. They seriously cheaped out on that. The dialog that exist is pretty well done. But yeah, it incredibly fast gets repetitive the 482'th time. Sometimes you can hear the same line 12+ times per minute. Depending on the situation. Secondly it's that, while more of a 'read up on it, scrub' thing, your 'talent tree' is something you heavily need to invest in, and plan ahead. You're not allowed to just pick it as you go, it became clear to me a bit in that I would have needed to plan my build from the start. As some skills are just far too vital not to have. Like how you literally can't complete certain dungeons without having certain spells and/or immunities.  And while mostly a aestetic thing. It feels a bit dumb how you start as this 'kinda pro adventuring party' with basically 0 equipment or skills. I get that you have to build your way up, but it's kinda derp how you're these supposedly bad-♥♥♥ 'Raiders', and you have some rusty, duct taped gear and barely know how to slap someone xP Not to mention: The game ocassionally forgets your UI, and resests some buttons to the 'default' potion combination. Not a big annoyance, but can be a nuisance. Atop that, it seems some of the DLC content is bugged. I cashed in a reward for the deluxe edition package, but the item for it was never delivered, yet it claimed it had been cashed in.   Now, for the massive flaws of this game in no particular order: (I was debating a bit wheter or not I would recommend this game, but in the end, it is a nice game. Yes, it will frustrate you a lot. But it has enough enjoyable moments to mostly weigh it up) 1: The loading times are far too long. It's not to bad in the start. But later in the game, these become a massive bother. ESPECIALLY as the game refuse to load if you are tabbed out. So you can't enter a dungeon or the like, then tab out, check a few things and tab back in during the up to 30+ second long loadingscreens. This becomes ESPECIALLY annoying due to the next in this list, which will force you to repeatedly re-load over and over and over and over and over. It's just a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to pad on extra hours of gameplay.  2: The RNG creep. I could be that I had a bad party combo. But some enemies just get plain stupid with this. Most of the undead are a great example of this. With one lucky hit, and many enemies seem to have 20-40 % crit chance, they can, and will 1-shot any non-tank party member. Just like that. Poof. And there's nothing you can do about it aside from spam protective spells. Which, makes you unable to attack. While they normally hit for like, 41 damage, when they crit, it can be anywhere from 180-260 damage if they feel like it. And when a ex: magic hero at that level has around 100 hp, they're just toast. So at many places, you just have to save, enter combat, hope RNG doesn't screw you over, if so, load and rinse and repeat. You're not being challanged the least, your patience is just being tested.   3: Broken skills and events. Some abilities don't work on enemies, or are outright broken. Like how if you stun an enemy, they can still retaliate, block and all that. While you aren't allowed to do so if stunned as a character. And there's dozens of design flaws like that around. And some events break when you save at a particular palce or time. Like, one event in a crow temple, an entire encouter crashes and vanishes if you save after you talk to a spirit. Which mind you, is a place with the issue in 2 mentioned. So you have to save before you talk to them. Talk to them, enter fight and hope each turn you don't have the ~5-10 % chance of getting instantly killed and be force to load, while you try to take down 6 enemies at both sides of you with like, 1500 hp each. Each one of these capable to 1 shot your non-tanks. Currently at that fight as I am writing this, and have been for around 2 hours, 1 of which has just been pure loading time.   For a game so heavily reliant on QS and QL, this type of droll padding just isn't acceptable. I'd at most expet 5-10 second loading time, at most. Many parts of this game is pure trial and error via RNG. Atop that, you only get experience for enemies if a hero is alive, and without and negative condition on them. Like what? My mage didn't learn anything at all from figthing a dragon, just becuase she got backhanded by said dragon and stunned, and her magical boots managed to kill the dragon? She had to be fully aware and witness as the dragon died, or else the entire fight was just some dull pasttime she couldn't learn anything from?  4: No ability to flee. For a game that places it's level 20 monsters next to it's level 1 obligatory giant rats. This is such a huge design flaw I don't even know what to say... It's like removing/not including a dodge or block manouver in a fighting game... like, the actual murloc? This ties heavily in with the save/load issue. As, every time you find something new or a new area, you are forced to save to know if you even are allowed to be there, before you head on in. Your entire party got 1-shotted by a magically farting spider? Welp, you better load then, possinly after being forced through a game over screen, to then be made to wait a total of 1 minute before you are allowed back in. It's just not acceptable as said with the massive amounts of lazy padding this game has. It's like... it's a great game in here, why was so much bad descisions stuffed into it? Despite this being a late, patched version of the game. I really fear how terrible it must have been at launch. There's seriusly a good game in here. It's just brutally hampered by multiple poor choices and design errors.  I think this wraps up most of it... but yeah. I'd perhaps give a 6.5 out of ten? Nice game, but far too often just plain frustrating. Just knowing that 'Oh, I see my tactic and team was irrelevant here, I just wans't lucky enough with the dice rolls to progress... better spend a mintute reloading the... not saying RNG is always bad. But when it becomes a major part of the game itself... it's just frustarting. Adding numbers or making the AI cheat just to upp the difficulty is just poor design. Yes, I know it's sort of 'needed'sometimes, but it's very tacky regardless. There's just far too many areas where you're simply not allowed to do anything to affect the outcome of things. Or would have had to play the game prior to know which things to bring where.",

The difficulty level will be ramped up, there will be no hand holding, you will have to think not click past fights. No NPC with explanation points, its trial and error and dialog trees to get quests. Long time burns to go from place to place with unfair fights that you have to avoid for a while then come back to when you level up.   This is the core of the original games and its a fresh breeze of awesomeness. So many new games are click fests, afraid to make the game too difficult for people. Not here, its not Dark Souls but it is very much Might and Magic. It will be a bit too hard for the average ADD click kid but if you have a level head and are willing to learn and grow with a game this will be your ticket. It has flaws still but forgivable flaws. My guess is in just a few months this should be a well polished game that will no doubt make me happy for quite a while.",

Fairly widespread issue but no acknowledgement from the vendor on their forums.  In any case, the game is good -- the story is mindless and may as well be non-existant, unfortunately, but the gameplay is pretty much classic MM. The smaller party size makes things slightly more strategic as your margin of error has decreased notably, which also helps to contribute to an overall greater difficulty level than the previous.  I hope they fix the optimization problems, it's silly that a game that looks like this can load my GPU in ways that Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 don't, but even if they don't, if you liked the grid / turn based Might and Magic games, this is an easy $25 to spend.",

            "review_text": "A Welcome Return To Old School RPG Gaming  For the tl;dr crowd:  Pros: * Really truly does recapture the feeling of old school Might &amp; Magic games, particularly the World of Xeen games (which was what this was patterned after) * Tough but fair * Strategic combat  Cons: * Optimization issues * Requires UPlay (It's Ubisoft, no way around UPlay, unfortunately)  Now for the long winded review:  When I first heard about this game I was first of all shocked, as it had been so long since a core Might &amp; Magic game had been released (I bet there is a contingent of people that prior to the release of this game though Heroes of Might &amp; Magic was the core series, rather than the spinoff it is) that I just assumed the series was dead and buried. I was both excited and a bit scared. Excited because holy smokes a new core Might &amp; Magic game! Scared because it was being made by a developer I didn't really know and that had, to the best of my knowledge, no prior experience making an old school RPG like this. Would they be able to recapture the Might &amp; Magic feeling? Would they get the mechanics right? Would they try to modernize it too much?  After reading up on the team and following their blog for a bit, it became apparent that these people were a fan of the games and genuinely passionate about making an old school RPG. They also revealed that they were patterning this game after World of Xeen (M&amp;M 4 &amp; 5), going with turn-based and grid-based, rather than free movement and real-time, like M&amp;M 6-9. While I enjoyed M&amp;M 6-8 quite a bit, 9 not so much, I was also a huge fan of the World of Xeen games and was happy with this decision, so I decided to pull the trigger and get this.  I can now happily say that I chose wisely. This game has exceeded my expectations. While the game isn't exactly pushing graphical boundaries and there are some jarringly low res models and textures mixed in, the game is plenty pretty enough for my tastes and it has a certain charm to it. I suspect Ubisoft didn't exactly give Limbic a massive budget to work with, so I wasn't expecting The Witcher 2 levels of eye candy. Much more importantly, this is an honest to goodness old school Might &amp; Magic game. The setting and story follow the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games timeline rather than M&amp;M 9, but mechanically they really did a great job of recreating the World of Xeen gameplay.  There are 12 classes among 4 races to choose from (3 per race) filling the roles of fighters, casters, and various hybrids in between. The game doesn't hold your hand and you learn on the job, which may be a turn off for some gamers, but is very welcome in my book. Certain class combinations will work better than other, and it's certainly possible to build a party that's going to get stomped in the game, but there is room for a variety of different viable combination. Balanced parties (a mix of warrior and mage types) will naturally work the best, as they usually do in RPGs, but it's possible to go mage-heavy (though you will burn through a lot of mana potions) or warrior-heavy and still succeed.  The game is quite challenging, but not cheap. There are 2 difficulty settings: Adventurer and Warrior, corresponding to Normal and Hard respectively, though, compared to the average game of these days, they're more like Hard and Very Hard. This game will kick your behind and you will die. There is no sleepwalking through fights except for the most basic of weak enemies. If you try to sleepwalk on simply brute force your way (even with a warrior-heavy party) through battles you will get destroyed. You have to use your head to survive. The game constantly puts you into confrontations where you are surviving by your wits and the skin of your teeth, and that's on Adventurer difficulty. Warrior difficulty is straight up punishing, and I love it!  There is a good bit of strategy in using your various spells and abilities to protect yourself, buff your allies, debuff enemies, debilitate them, and deal damage. Plus the grid-based movement adds another layer of tactics, making for a chess-like game of maneuvering where you try to lure ranged enemies into melee without getting pelted by arrows and spells while advancing on them, or getting as many 'free' volleys of arrows on melee enemies before they close to melee, all while being mindful of the terrain to position yourself in a spot to prevent being flanked or surrounded. It's a well thought out system that forces you to use all the skills at your disposal. It can seem overwhelming when you're caught off guard and a group of enemies creeps up behind you while other enemies close in from the front and you're caught in a vice in a seemingly hopeless battle, frantically trying to keep your party members alive while trying to take out key enemies before they can demolish you. But when you survive a battle like that, it's that much more satisfying, so much better than mindlessly steamrolling through trash mobs like in so many RPGs.   In conclusion, Might &amp; Magic is a throwback to the RPGs of the 80s and the 90s, with much of the good and the bad that comes with that. It's a wonderful nostalgia ride and Limbic did a terrific job of delivering an authentic old school RPG experience. It's thoroughly challenging and quite satisfying. If you're looking for an old-school turn-based RPG romp, look no further.",

It runs on a grid so it's less fluid than Escape from Grimrock (another game that harkens back to the time of old school RPGS), but that gives it an even greater retro charm, hell it even has an option for fuzzy retro graphics. It pays greatest homage to Might and Magic 1-4, it still does give refrences to six and seven (seven being my absolute favorite of the series). It even gives the synopsis of the plots for each previous game in in-game lore books while maintaining the new lore and world.  Though character creation is limited to four races with three classes for each race, it's still not as bad as Might Magic XIII's character creation (IDK about you guys but that game had the worst race/class choices in the series). Combat can be a bit buggy at times, the latest patch seems to have fixed a lot of the release issues, so I can now give this game my full approval.",

The story isn't that great but the char development and combat are and the exploration isn't great but its still good. I'm a big fan of the games that came before in this series and, while this isn't as good as some of those, I felt it was well worth my money. The exploration is the main place this one falls short next to those because this one feels much less open than the predecessors but they were massively explorable like skyrim where this one is only somewhat explorable but its still quite open and doesn't hand hold you through the game so its ok. The combat is a great turn based affair that will make one use what they have trained or die becasue its not an easy game thankfully. The way it locks you into combat may be a bit jarring to old school M&amp;M players but I can't exactly call this a negative even though its the closest thing to a negative I can say about the combat. The game begins with you creating a party of 4 from 12 classes which are race specific. You get points toward a skill tree upon leveling and must visit trainers to learn different tiers of each skill and buy spells in a similar fashion. Loot is the typical green blue, etc affair one would expect but with many unique pieces in specific places to go with it. Puzzle areas or optional boss rooms tend to house these unique pieces and the puzzle elements of this game aren't as strong as the predecessors either but whatever. I'm happy this game exists and would love it if more followed.",

Besides, it is really quite annoyed that you can't move when one enemy is adjacent of you and some other enemies are shooting at you from the distance. There is also some technical problem involving some low FPS that I encounter during somewhere on the world map. Other annoyed little problems including no space to store your items &amp; equipment, obscure puzzle and that you can't scroll the map.  Although the game has some problem, it still has some good old-school fun including challenging combat, nice dungeons full of traps, monsters, treasures and puzzles and finally the planning and buidling of your party.

            "review_text": "I loved it and had a great time playing it, but you may not. So, let's discuss it's progency, for a moment.  The game owes it's existence to the joyful Legend of Grimrock, which did a great job updating the games of my youth. MMX is an even more direct throwback to the original Bard's Tale in 1985. The Bard's Tale took Wizardry and added outdoor areas. Sure, they weren't that different -- they were basically dungeons with sky blue tiles as opposed to underground grey and brown tiles, but the effect worked on me.   If you have some nostalgia for the early days of RPG gaming, this will likely hit a home run. It reminds me of playing games on my Apple II, even including watching the graphics render. What I really enjoyed most was developing my characters and watching them become increasingly powerful. I wanted them well prepared for the final battle, and there are many opportunities to improve their skills and their loot.  Pros: - RPG nostalgia - Good skills and character development options - Good magic system - The individual quests and dungeon were mostly fun - Combat is well done - To me, at least, the game is almost perfectly balanced (with the stock party). Only toward the end did I begin to feel overpowered. Most of the game, the battles were close and tense, but rarely did my entire party die. - Great opportunities for exploration -- there is always something new to find - No monster respawns!! Once you clear an area, it stays clear. I like that.  Cons: - Graphics look good, but take a long time to render. At one point, the landscape renders well before the castle sitting on the landscape renders. That's just weird. - Members have your party have comments about everything going on around them. I love that. Except that they repeat the same things over and over and over again. We get it... human cities are as dangerous as the jungle. Let's move on. When characters finish a major battle, they cheer an entirely disingenuous 'Yay!' It sounds exactly like a bunch of poorly paid actors sitting around their home microphones trying to appear enthusiastic. - With some exceptions, most of the battles use pretty much the same tactics. I had the same criticism of Dragon Age. So this game is not unique, in this regard.  I've invested about 55 hours into this game. And I had a lot of fun doing it. If you have a soft spot in your heart for the RPG dungeon-crawling heyday of the 80s, I think you'll really enjoy this. I sure did.  ",
