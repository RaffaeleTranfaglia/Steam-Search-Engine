            "review_text": "Fantastic fun, the priciest but most replayable VR title right now, being a multiplayer VR game.   Your first match in this game will definitely be very intense, it feels super cool and unlike any other VR game I've tried, because you're actually against another person. Seeing other people actually moving like a human makes it feel a lot more immersive and adds a lot of character to the game. There is a sort of social element to this with all of the hand gestures, and stuff like that. It can be really funny to lay down your weapons and mess around with the hand gestures and do stupid stuff, because everyone is so life-like. The social element is really a huge positive for this game.  This game does have a very short honeymoon phase as there isn't a big depth of content, but for my first couple matches it really felt like I was playing the coolest game ever. As you get used to it, it does start to feel quite same-y but the game is still fun and my favourite VR game right now.  I was skeptical from claims about price being too high and lack of content, and I will say that is kind of fair enough, not many weapons right now, stuff like that, but the core gameplay is amazing fun, and the developers are working with community feedback on steam and reddit to provide good updates, like the SMG that is about to be added. I look forward to seeing the game grow, and the singleplayer oregon-trail mode that is planned sounds pretty neat.   Living in Australia lag was fairly noticeable sometimes in matches, but nothing too bad. And while player counts for this game are low, there is always a match available to hop into and you only need 3+ people for it to be good fun. Although I have yet to try the team co-op mode due to only finding FFA matches.  As for performance, this game actually ran surprisingly great for me. Seeing the recommended 970 and 980 was worrying me, but it wasn't too bad even on my 7950 3gb, a card from 2012. If you hold alt while starting the game you can turn down the desktop window resolution and in-game, you can put the graphics down to 'debug' or lower than low. I found the game running surprisingly well with only an occasional fps drop. I also had interleaved reprojection off.    So in short, it runs pretty nicely, no trouble finding a match, social element and VOIP is great fun, very replayable, combat and taking cover is intense, and you can be excited for future updates to come and watch the game grow.   Definitely my favourite VR title, multiplayer puts it on a whole new level.   EDIT: I have since tried team/co-op mode, and it's really cool. It's good fun to interact with a ship crewmate, and shake hands and do silly stuff. Taking turns driving and duel wielding is pretty cool and there's a very social feel where it feels like your teammate is really with you.",

Edit, second day of playing:   Just got done with a 2 hour session. This game is better than I thought, not that I didn't think it was good but man am I addicated after today. The sessions I just had were out of this world. The 1 on 1 fights you get in with players are so real, you do anything in your power to stay alive and kill the other guy. I think I learned the basics of the mechanics and feel really comfortable with the game. Took a couple mins when I first treid it to get my VR legs but once you do it never becomes a problem again, no motion sickness for me.   Haven't been able to test too many social features out yet, joined some random lobbys and played both team and solo death match. I look forward to playing co op with a friend, playing with a random was fun but for I couldn't hear him. If there was one complaint I had it was I could barely hear anyone, both on my ship or in the lobby, maybe there is a setting for it but the game volume is pretty loud and drowns out the voices.   If you thought getting kills might have been satisfying in whatever game you play imagine ACTUALLY getting the kill yourself, so much more rewarding. But man am I glad I plunged and bought it, my favorite Vive game so far. Getting headshots with that pistol is oh so fun.",

The biggest offense is that most of the guns have built in spread that makes them so wildly inaccurate its absolutely pointless to attempt to aim. This is 'Spray and Pray: The Game'. No skill involved, only luck. Also, you cant rotate your hovercraft, it's always fixed to its original rotation and you can only fly it around whatever direction it was already facing. The loot and cover system is basically pointless, no one loots anything - they just fly around shooting eachother because there it simply doesnt make sense to be fooling about with junking when people are constantly coming to kill you. So throw that out and you just have people flying around having revolver fights (since the revolver is the only weapon you can actually aim). Lame. Refunded. Maybe I'll pick it up again one day after some patches come out.",

It's one of the pricier vr games but totally worth it. It's very polished and feels like a complete finished game. With the hovercrafts the devs found a clever way to create a first person shooter in vr without using sometimes immersion breaking tricks like teleportation. And shooters are where the Vive's motion controls really shine. Shooting guns just works like you expect. You can aim down the sights or just fire around your cover and reloading the revolver after blowing up an enemy feels so badass.",

The game walks you through how to do stuff very nice, has nice custom graphics, and fun multiplayer. I started with FFA and was delighted. I moved over and tried TDM(Team death match) and had even more fun there. It is fun trying to communicate to your team without using the mic and with hand symbols.   One thing that kinda ticks me off is the shooting. It doesn't go where you think it would. You can be aiming right at a guy and miss 30 shots.   Overall it is a fun experience and easy to overcome and ignore the flaws.",

I can never tell where my shots land. I'm sure more practice would help, but it is too frustrating when ever game has at least one, one-shot one-kill, pistol head hunter. In almost every game that I join, one or two people have all the kills.   Driving isn't fun either. There has to be a better way to move around and activate driving.   Each fight is exactly the same. Smash boat into someone else, duck, shoot, die. I also dislike that the ships don't have a rudder to turn. It seems lazy. Some of them you can't see out the back and have to drive them in reverse... how does that make sense?  I don't think it is worth the price anymore. I regret buying it. I would not pay $35 for a multiplayer only game with the amount of inexpensive VR games out today.  Recently someone created a new VR multiplayer shooter game. In ONE WEEK it passed Hover Junkers in the average number of players. It just isn't fun for the typical player. I never was able to figure out how to play co-op games.  I was also a preorder and never got my name on the wall like stated. I followed the directions from the website. Not that I really care.. just disappointing.",

Among all the current games for the vive there are a lot of promising ideas, interesting demos and satisfying concepts costing between free and usually up to 20 € a piece.   But almost none of them are as well polished as hover junkers, but what's worth even more - few have this level of competition or even a coop mode. Hover Junkers really shows how immersive playing with others can be. How fun competition eventually becomes once you deal with real persons instead of just a chatwindow full of insults and terrible language unfortunately common among most competitive games these days. Part of it might be the 1000 € paywall for proper hardware but I want to belive a good portion also comes with the immersion you get from playing with real peoples in vr. I'd never take a bullet for someone else in cs:source but in hj if I see another player struggling with their controls or the gameplay I almost instantly feel protective and usually jump in without a thought and never regret it.",

Many of you are thinking that I am just bad (which could be true) but when every lobby has one guy going 30 - 4 while second place is barely going 8 - 12 then the game loses it's value.

It runs mostly stable and has good inverse kinematics so other players move realistically.  The game makes excellent use of roomscale, granting over a dozen ships to choose from, each with a different shape, size, and defensive properties. Small room? Choose a small ship. Large room? You can fly around in a modified school bus! I haven't gotten uncomfortable from ship motion, either, even when someone else is piloting!  All you get in the way of a tutorial is a short information-overloading video and a singleplayer shooting range to test the guns and learn how to reload. Many players get into team deathmatch not knowing they need to loot a coffin to resurrect their shipmate, or not understanding the importance (or lack thereof) of looting junk in the first place.

Out of the handful of Vive games I've tried so far, this is only the second one that's been fun enough and immersive enough to make me completely forget I was playing a game. And it comes with the added bonus of giving you a pretty good workout too.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it could definitely use some more content (more weapons and more game modes), but I'm sure that will come in time. In the meantime, I'm a satisfied customer.",

Cons: The tutorial could be much better... like I didn't realize the shotgun is for destroying cover(sucks at killing people which makes no sense when you 3 feet away from them) This is a FULL VR game, worth the price.",

Between constant crashes, poor in game performance, lack of quality players for online, lack of weapons and equipment, this isn't a game that should have been released yet.  Elaboration(and edits) 1. Game disconnects(not crashes as posted above) from servers every few matches and I rarely manage to get through an entire match of BuzzBots without a disconnect. 2. Hovercrafts designed to go forward, back and side to side, there is no turning or up/down it gives a very poor feeling(not performance) to the game. 3. There is a very limited number of players in this game which gives very few options for playing against other players, with a substantial amount of the players seen using tricks like sticking guns through the objects they're hiding behind, this reduces the total number of quality players to a very small amount, making the PvP option at times unplayable. 4. Although there is a road map for the addition af new weapons and equipment, at this point there is only a few making most attempts at strategy laughable.  Wait until much later, when hopefully this is a better performing game. Steam only allows for up or down reviews, and I cannot reccomend the game though I do not think it to be outright bad. Purchase at your own risk.",

I knew I was going to get a VR headset and when I saw some of the content for the Vive, Hover Junkers piqued my interest. Owning a GearVR I knew that artificial Locomotion (character moving while you stand still) can be nauseating if done poorly. When I saw that you are on a Hover craft and that was what moved, I knew I had to have this game.  At this point I only have a couple hours in this game due to the amazing content available for the Vive, but I can say this is super fun. Actually crouching behind cover to avoid getting shot is something that I never thought would actually be a thing. The only thing I can say negative about it is the current lack of content. I know there will be more content coming from the devs so it's not really a negative. I look forward to playing more and actually getting good.",
