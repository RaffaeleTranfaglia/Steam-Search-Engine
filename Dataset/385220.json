I finished the game in just 20 minutes by defeating the last boss (I call it flying dark lord). Killing the last boss only get you to the credits. There is no story in this game.  You control a badass invicible little blue slime. In the 1st level, you can only stomp to kill but after that you got sword, summon, shuriken, and flying bubble. Pretty much you become the most powerful slime in the entire galaxy.  There is copyrighted characters in this game such as Patrick Starfish from Spongebob Squarepants, Elsa from Frozen and some Angry birds' bird.",
