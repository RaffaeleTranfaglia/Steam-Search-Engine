Only real flaw I can think of is the lack of Steam Workshop integration, but it's a very simple game to mod anyway.  10/10",

But it's not. It is a program on a computer, and frankly not a very good one either. The problem with so many of these 'racing sims' is that the people playing them and the people making them will not acknowledge the fact that these are games, built for entertainment value. The view of the world from inside a car is a whole hell of a lot different from one sitting in front of a computer screen. The same rules don't apply. For instance, no matter how good a setup you may have you will never actually be able to feel the car tires start to lose grip. This is a very, very important part of driving that you cannot replicate. But let's be honest here; 99.9% of the people who play games don't have a wheel and pedals and a racing chair - it's just too expensive. Most people will be playing these games with controlers, and will only have a few hours at a time to dedicate to playing. It takes years to learn how to be a real race car driver, and frankly if the people playing these games could be racing car drivers they wouldn't be playing a frankly appaling port of their job. This is a game, but because the makers of this game refuse to admit that it is a game, it's not very good. Unless you are a harcore racing game fanatic, you will hate this game. if you are a hardcore racing game fanatic you will be playing something much better, like Project Cars. This is a game with no real dempographic, and it really shows. Lot's of technical detail, very little enjoyment. I paid $2 for a bundle of seven racing games and I guess this is a classic example of caveat emptor. I got what I paid for.",

I like the older graphics and cars, is why I purchased it. But I will hence for uninstall this horrible game.
