            "review_text": "Deathmatch Classic was a mod for Half-Life created by Valve software alongside others like Team Fortress Classic and Day of Defeat. Unfortunately it was never as popular as some of the others and quietly faded back into obscurity.  DMC is essentially a remake of the multiplayer component of Quake 1 using Half-Life's particular GoldSrc engine. Including remade versions of Quake 1's various weapons, such as the nailgun, super shotgun and rocket launcher. It uses a lot of Half-life's assets like multiplayer models, textures and sprites. And at the same time attempts to mimic Quake's physics. Allowing players to also bunnyhop and strafejump. They also remade several of Quake 1's deathmatch maps and included them with the game.  Now all of this was great. Although Deathmatch Classic released at around the same time as Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament. As a result the community didn't really gravitate towards it as much as Valve would have liked, seeing it as a little outdated and more of a novelty.   Playing it today you can see some general upsides to Deathmatch Classic. It uses Steam's server browser and has mods for bots. So it is rather easy to setup a game of classic Quake deathmatch with someone online. But the playerbase is extinct, and as a result it's just another relic in Valve's catalogue",

The fast paced fighting and constant action makes the game fun and interesting. However, there are not many people on the servers to play with and if there are any there they are on at a certain time which is usually late at night but that small time I do get to play with people is a really enjoyable time and I certainly think the pros outweigh the cons in this game.",

Deathmatch Classic is the original QuakeWorld, but in the GoldSrc (Half-life 1, Counter strike 1.6) engine, most of the maps are great redesigns of Quake's deathmatch maps that still impress me despite its age (I have a thing for castles/churches with compressed jpegs for skyboxes), However not only is the gameplay slower due to its engine, but its playerbase is as dead as Ricochet's. Deathmatch Classic was clearly not meant to be a best-seller but a shoutout to id software and their breakthrough in PC gaming in terms of multiplayer thanks to QuakeWorld and Doom deathmatch.  If you want the Deathmatch Classic experience, save your five bucks, go download Quake Live, and play it until bethesda decides to demand subscription money for every time you push a button mid-game.",
