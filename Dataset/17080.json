            "review_text": "Tribes Ascend gets the Game Of The Year reward and a bunch of other good stuff!  Then Smite comes along...  Hi-Rez decides to work on Smite than Tribes Ascend   Why?  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   How dead did the game become?  Well, there were no forums, no updates, no customer support... (when you did contact customer support they referred to the game as smite)  The only thing you could do is download the game.   Why not work on Tribes Ascend instead?  Tribes Ascend got Game Of the Year. And what did Smite win? Money?   Has HiRez done something like this before?  Yes. An even older game (but made with the same engine) called Global Agenda is more abandonded than Tribes Ascend. That game is an MMORPG, like Smite (hint hint)   Then, after constant demands from the remnants of the Tribes Ascend community (mostly GOTY edition owners, but also those who liked the game a lot and whose game didn't stop working), HiRez comes out with the 'out of the blue' update!   First off, let's make the original Tribes games free!  Too bad no one liked them, but yay!   Next, let's change the liked class system with a system from the older games: light, medium, and heavy.  Noooo! why would you simplify the class system (which actually overcomplicated it. Now there are a bunch of restrictions, like you cant cloak with the sniper rifle.)   We did this by popular demand.  What popular demand? Those who migrated to Smite or something?   Oh, and all that money you spent on the GOTY edition and all of that gold/silver you used to buy weapons? We refunded it all back.  Great, real great... Now I need to find the weapons I bought before... And they removed GOTY edition? why?   We also removed a bunch of boring weapons and kept the OP ones  Why? My loadouts consisted mostly of that!!!   We also added something called the 'all weapons pack'  Oh, I see now... A variant of the P2W GOTY edition pack without the loadout, class, and perk unlock (which were removed or changed to make GOTY edition not much more than all weapons)   We also added 2 new maps from previous Tribes games  Yay, although the previous games weren't that good...   Thank you for playing Tribes Ascend, hope you enjoy the new Tribes, have a nice day, blablabla outro stuff  Really? Really?  NOW!  Tribes Ascend has reverted to the remnant player community it was after the shutdown. With only a few servers with actual players, Tribes Ascend has only gone down. Nice job, HiRez.",

            "review_text": "It's good again guys.  Quick Pro-Con Lost  PRO: -The movement. I mean god damn, does it put games like Titianfall and the latest cawadoody entry to shame. The entire game is played with an exo-suit that makes you feel like you've got an ACME rocket-powered skatboard welded to your feet at all times. With the hilly structure of nearly all of the maps, it's like the worlds most dangerous skate park - but with guns and Capture the Flag.  -The weapons. Don't expect too many traditional pew pews in Tribes. This game is fought primarily with high-velocity explosive frisbees. Spinfusors are the name of the game, and learning to use one is easy, but eyeballing the trajectory, distance, and speed of your enemy as they go screaming across the map and scoring a hit is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master. Weapon variety is enough to keep you happy, and each one has it's own little purpose.  -The classes. Old Tribes players will disticntly remember nine in total, but with recent updates it's been shaved down to three; light, medium, and heavy. Don't worry, this is probably my favorite new feature, as it allows more creativity in creating them. Classes are simple, light means go fast, heavy means big armor, and medium is a balance between the two. With the new additions, you can really carve out your niche in the match. Want to have some heavy offensive ordinance AND be able to deploy a turret now? You can. Want to carry a crossbow and a Jackal at the same time? No more class restriction on that. Chaingun AND Heavy spinfusor AND Fractal Grenade? Yep, that too. The sky's the limit.  -The graphics. Not on par with a triple-A 2016 release but still really pretty if you crank everything up to max, and can still be set low enough to play on a toaster. The gameplay is the focus here.  -It's free. What more could you want?  SO-SO -Cannot be played through Steam, so your favorite dank meme name is a no-go. -Serves can get a bit underpopulated, but that's not bad in my opinion becaue you see a few famailiar faces from time to time.   CON: -Learning curve is a bit frusturating. 20 hours in and I'm still getting my behind kicked. -May be dead as a doornail in a year or two. -I can't think of anythig else.",

I keep being set into games that have people that are 20 or something ranks ahead of me.  Good points:  -JETPACKS!  -Unique Ski mechanic that lets you fly through the map barely touching the ground.  -Great inertia/velocity physics  -Requires skill  -Recent update made things cheaper  -Interesting weapons  Bad points:  -Dwindling population  -Terrible, if any, matchmaking  -Requires skill  -Things are still pricy  -Lack of support from the devs (they've moved on).  Misc. points:  -There are almost no hitscan weapons, meaning you have to lead your shots and use your brain to calculate/anticipate/predict where your enemy will be by the time your shot reaches them.  -No ADS. It's either zoom or hipfire, much like Halo.  -If you don't ski and/or use your jetpack, and play this like CoD or Battlefield, you're gonna be dead quick.  -The maps are large, so you'll need to use your enhanced movement to get around quicker.  tl:dr: Much better than Smite, although the developer has abandoned the game.",

The weapons have enough variety to give everyone something to suit their playstyle, and each holds its own key to mastery. Though not as flexible as mumble or teamspeak, the in game quick-chat system works well to connect players together. The games classes are all unique and fun and give a great variety of ways to play. No class has ever been OP it has always been the weapons. From the thumper to the faze rifles to the MIRV, there has always been a weapon that HiRez has milked for cash; This is the primary source of frustration in the game. The game has strategy speed and skill requirements of any good shooter and though difficult to aproach can quickly become a favorite. I personally do not own the GOTY edition so I am not sure if it levels the playing feild or effects matches that much. Tribes Ascend: Even with its shortcomings and faults is an amazing game and I hope to see a sequel in the near future.",

The grind is still tough to unlock all the items (without spending $$$), but what you start off with is still fun to use and competitive in-game. You should spend your first few hours in the game trying to become an expert with your trusty spinfusor anyway.  New players, do the skiing tutorial if nothing else (it takes 5 minutes) just to get the basics of skiing down. It is an essential part of the game and is one of the main features that makes this game so fun and addictive.  Give it a shot if you've never played.

This shows the game has been well optimised for lower end computers and can be playable for many people who own either a high or low end PC or laptop.  I like the fast paced game movement style, really gets me tired of the normal walking speed on games like battlefield, COD and other first person shooters that are similer. I like the variety of classes and weapons and although you can pay to claim weapons at an early stage, I think that earning them gives you proudness over what you have achieved. I highly recommend this game to all that enjoy zipping around and blasting men in metal suits out of the sky above you and think that although this game has been around for a long time, it still claims a place in the best PC games out there.",

Upgrades do take time to earn (but you'll get there if you simply play the game). A good number of the upgrades, in fact, make the game harder to play (from my perspective anyhow). In that way the game is as balanced as it can be; it is an FPS after all, so you need more than just a meta-game proficiency to be any good. Reaction time and motion prediction are skills that do you well here, this ain't no point-and-click adventure (MOBA players stay away; I dont want your filth in or around anything that I love :D )  The visuals in this game are excellent as well.

AWESOME concepts, awesome style, lots of classes and weapon/equipment combos; not so good balancing. For free, I can't argue much, and I _could_ argue that this is pay-to-win, but this isn't even about winning. It's just tedious to keep digging out the guy launching fusion grenades into your curiously indefensible gen room. One would think that killing the generator would be a big thing that your team should love you for, but the borderline useless turrets and lack of incentive for teamwork make the act mundane.  The King of the Hill mode is better, but all it involves is sliding around the map in circles.   The sliding and jetpack idea is great, but it seems very underutilized.",

Out of every FPS experience I have had, Tribes: Ascend has been the only one that has put difficulty to the test in terms of Deathmatch and Domination.  Second, what I don't like much about Tribes: Ascend is the fact that microtransactions definitely outweigh the F2P set of guns and other secondary material. I, a F2P gamer by heart, am not financially or mentally ready to spend $40 to pay for a game that's like Halo but MMO and extremely difficult to play. And in knowing that, I don't put money into it and usually wait for my slow addiction to come back and make me play Deathmatch one. last. time. before eventually I slam on my keys and uninstall it.  However, I do recommend this game. It's originality with Gameplay paired up with its great but durable graphics, makes me smile to myself at the perfection put into Tribes: Ascend. The explosions, the bullets crossing through the air, the respawning animation, all makes me wonder whether this will come to console and allow me an easier go using the L1 key on PS3 to aim down sights.

Tribes: Ascend offers one of the most addictive and interesting styles of FPS in the history of FPS. It adds one element that many shooters neglect too make it watered down and easier to play. This is what they call 'skiing' or sliding in another sense, you can make yourself frictionless, and in the world of maps that have hills and slopes, combining this with your jetpack you can be sure to run into some pretty fast paced combat. The highlight of this ability comes too reality when you play CTF (capture the flag) where you have roles such as the flag capper or the flag chaser.  As a player of the old Tribes games, from memory I remember playing it browser based at one point but this was a long time ago and I can only slightly recall this. But I was extremely hooked and wouldn't stop playing it at all, it was just one of those games you get addicted too.  This game takes some time to get used to, so a suggestion is to practise in your own time by yourself on the bots and literally just do things over and over again until you get the hang of the dynamic play style such as things with your speed, gun types, projection and most importantly timing.  Sad to say though that it's hard to find a reasonable community to play with due to the lack of auidence this game now recieves.

For those new players out there, this is no P2W game, its an abandoned relic, this has nothing to do with Halo, because the gameplay is completely different and way better, you need precision in this game, kills that pay off with tanks and other things. This should have never been abandoned, really High-Rez, this is a good game, SMITE is really bad compared to this game. I don't know how you ever thought of doing this to this game, it had great future, and you kinda shut it down. Now, this game is abandoned, and has barely any community left. The last bits of community are still there High-Rez, waiting... and slowly dying.  10/10 for this game... 5/10 for its creators...",

Playing with friends will make it that much more fun. The cashhop model is a little more on the unfair side, giving people willing to pay cash for the different weapons instant access and forcing free to play players to grind for a stupidly long time to unlock everything. However, this isn't too much of a problem given the fact that the only weapon you should really be using on most classes is a spinfuser.

The general feel of the game reminds me alot of the old Blood Gulch Halo 1 multiplayer.   Another refreshing thing about this game was the absence of pay-to-win microtransactions and such. Every class and gun in the game can be unlocked just by gathering experience in-game (as well as with purchasable gold). It makes you want to support the devs, unlike a lot of other similar MP games.  Anyhow, if shooters are your thing, definitely try this one out.

The movement system in Tribes makes every battlefield into a playground, where good players can soar above the competition – both in terms of score and verticality. Tribes feels like a breath of fresh air for the shooter genre, and is quite possibly the best free-to-play game to date. ",

Doing this whilst trying to keep the opposing team who are also moving about like hyperactive monkey's, so your usual kill score is going to take a beating, it's a whole new level of shoot to kill. While it's not a typical FPS I think that's a good thing, it's a new play style to the field and it does it well. with a few minior problems. While it's much harder to make a kill it's a lot more satisfying when you do, just don't be a sitting duck.

If you have played tribes 2 or T:V, you might enjoy it for awhile, but in the end, it won't feel like tribes.",

Of all the F2P games out there, the system in place here feels the most abrasive. So we essentially have a fast paced and highly competitive shooter (at least, on paper) with a unique concept, but we need to 'unlock' classes and weapons? I haven't played any of the other Tribes games, but even so I felt like I was playing a game that is a mere shell of its potential - and seeing how the developer outright abandoned it for a soulless MOBA cashgrab, I don't see it ever changing. The worst part about this game is that there are some genuinely fun and well designed parts when you get past the layers of cash shops and leveling systems, much like a puppy trapped in a sewer. It's heartbreaking, and its why I can't even recommend giving it a small trial.",

First of all, the graphics feel like last gen graphics (Even on max settings) which isn't good seeing as how the game is only a year old, next you have bad texture pop in, lag and environmental glitches. All of which could have easily been fixed with patches and routine updates, but Hi-Rez have stopped updates for this game to focus on SMITE (Ironically, its suffering the same fate as Tribes: Ascend). But if you're willing to look past the bad graphics (Gameplay over Graphics) the game does work, skiing, vehicles, jetpacks etc. work like they are supposed to, however trying to get accustomed to using them well in a game is impossible, because the community of new players is dead, leaving only Tribes veterans, that will wipe the floor with you giving you virtually no chance to improve at your own pace. and to make matters worse, the training section is a joke, they have a few options, basic skiing, free roam, practice with bots (F.Y.I. the training with bots isn't a full match like you'd think, its just the bots running back and forth in set direction or not moving around at all) or watching youtube videos explaining the classes. To me that is just lazy. And even thought they have servers of novices only, nothing stops a level 32 veteran from connecting to the server and demolishing all the level 1-7 novices; once again stopping all progress to get better at your own pace.

Hi-Rez has since implemented a speedcap, patched multiple rock-bouncing spots and overall killed that thing that gave the game meaning. On top of making the game 'free-to-pay' with their Jewish cash shop, they turned on their community and forced them to grind as much as a League of Legends non-paying player to unlock a single weapon, then they go and stopped updating the game altogether.  Please don't be a follower in the False Prophet known as Hi-Rez and don't buy into their lies... with any of their games.",

TL;DR it was good, they changed it too much, now it sucks balls, and I hope whoever thought the changes were a good idea steps on a very sharp and pointy lego.",
