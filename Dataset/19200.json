            "review_text": "You're probably reading this because you liked the tank scenes in the movie Tron. Not coincidentally, Meridian4 made Tank Universal because THEY liked the tank scenes in Tron. And I bought it because  I  like the... well, you know. And it definitely has a certain Tron vibe, only instead of Jeff Bridges, the protagonist is a bored, incapacitated old man. Compelling!  Am I glad I bought it? Yes, because now I don't have to wonder if I was missing out on something great. So IS Tank Universal great? No. Is it worth your time as a die-hard Tron fan? Possibly. And if you've never seen Tron? Less, um... possibly.  Ask yourself: ' Do I enjoy Tron-inspired games where the primary mechanic is mentally calculating how to hit moving targets from a moving vehicle on sloped sufaces with a relatively slow-moving projectile that is affected by gravity (even though the existance of gravity in a digital world makes no sense)? ' If the answer is 'yes' and you have $5 to spare, buy Tank Universal.  But also ask yourself: ' Am I deeply annoyed by incoherent/irrelevant storylines, especially when I'm forced to endure them in lengthy, unskippable cinematics? ' ' Do my eyes roll back into my head during tedious, unnecessary travel sequences through static environments with no interaction? ' ' Do I have a hard time letting go of my nagging sensation that a game, for some unknown reason, isn't as good as it could have been? ' ' Did I hate Tron? ' If the answer is 'yes' to any of these, consider passing over Tank Universal. Maybe the tank moved a little too slugishly, or maybe the upgrading &amp; leveling system lacked the right incentives or rewards. I could never figure it out. The game always felt like off-brand Legos: that kind that fit together, though not quite right, and never with that secure, satisfying 'click' of precision. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun, but why didn't Grandma just buy EXACTLY what I WROTE on my *** **** LIST!?!?   Sorry, I'm thinking of my 9th birthday. What were we talking about again?",

            "review_text": "A great game about tank skirmishing in 80's-version-of-the-future-worlds. The player goes up against a giant eyeball overlord along with men from a resistance movement. Together they fight past vast amounts of enemy vehicles such as tanks, artillery, and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bombers. The story is more or less just there so people won't complain about lack of a story, and the read-only dialogue is laughably bad at times, but the game contains a lot of fun to be had and some really unexpected twists. Once you beat the campaign, you can test your strength in the 'skirmish' mode, where you have 20 minutes to kill as many enemies, of all types, as possible, and try not to die in the process.  However, there are a few downsides to this game:   no multiplayer whatsoever   capped at 30fps   you don't have a reliable way to deal with swarms of enemies   This game is one of a two-part series, and there is a Tank Universal 2 in the works. Hopefully we see some modernization in it, I would absolutely love to skirmish with real players.  Overall, I really like this game, and definately recommend it, but know that replayability is extremely limited and there is no multiplayer. 56/64 bits",

            "review_text": "If you like Tron themed games, this might be for you. I just got into the first skirmish and the first impression was the game's was quite okay. However, the game got this unnecessary story which you have to endure in the beginning. So you entered virtual world, got enslaved, then a resistance contacted you, etc, then you go into training skirmish mode.  The gameplay mechanic is kind of similar to MOBA type of game, where you have this allies fighting on your side (or creeps) and you need to progress towards enemie's homebase.  So, if you like Tron and MOBA, this might be for you. For me, let's just say it's not my cup of tea.",

Don't get shy on me, I thought so too. Nope.avi. While the intro is a bit slow, this game actually has a suprisingly good plot and atmosphere. The tank fighting is fun and ascends to being unique in particular areas, but I wouldn't say it's anything special (and for the game's price, why should it be?).  The game's visual actually work towards the game's advantage too, effectively selling virtual reality world you're placed in and sometimes tasked with exploring from the beginning.  It's not all just tank battle either. You'll be on foot sometimes as well.  I urge you to take the plunge on this game if you're into this genre. I'd go on describing the game, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.",

This game takes a few notes from Tron, and places you in command of a digital tank, in a digital universe inside the very computers we use everyday. I always wanted to drive one of those Tron tanks, and this game hits the nail perfectly on the head. Progress through the story and use strategy, and smarts, to complete the hacks, keep your base alive, and help combat the enemy. I find the game a little short, but it's a fantastic ride nonetheless, and I understand this is only the prologue...I can't wait! ",

Deffiently worth it if you get it for 60% off or more. its HELLISH Slow though. you prolly sepnd about half the game going from place to place and another 1/4 of it in Cut Scenes. There are only a few tank battles. (4-5 i think) and the 128 Glyph captures achievement is super annoying as it takes a lot of game time. there is no Humor (non that i found funny) and the cut scenes are really dragged out. the Skirmish is just 'Destroy as many tanks as you can in 10 mins) or something like that. Story is a good one (Though super slow :O ) and it really really needs Mutliplayer. (and the second one needs to come out!) it wasnt super Difficult and i was able to go through the game without dying more then once or twice. even then it was because i didnt know my ally tanks could run me over. (When out of your tank) i wish you could get out of the tank and maybe find Secret areas. and i also wish you used the Transport command more then once in the entire game.  i know i said this a few times but its really slow.
