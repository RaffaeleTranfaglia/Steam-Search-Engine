            "review_text": "Without Within 2 is a cute and funny game in the Visual Novel genre. It follows up on the short story experienced in the first Without Within and takes Vinty (the protagonist) on a journey to Melbourne.  The story has lots of small fun moments and great drawings. Something I really love about this game in particular is something that a lot of other VNs miss, animated backgrounds! Thank you InvertMouse for making animated backgrounds!  Also this game neatly features many small youtube clips of Melbourne town, all around 0.5 ~ 1 minute each.  All in all the story is great and a fun read. Took me a little longer than most people but I also watched all the small videos :D  Would recommend this game any day, but it is a little short for the price you might say. It took me around 2 hours to complete the game and I personally feel like it was worth the money (bought it on sale on the day of release, so it was only €4.) At the standard price of €5 this game is about €2.5 gameplay an hour. If you want more than that out of the game I would recommend buying it on sale.",
