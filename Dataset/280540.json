            "review_text": "In a nutshell, what you're basically looking at with Ghost Control is not so much a business simulation game but something more akin to an X-COM with a ghostbusters theme. Just like X-COM, you have to manage and upgrade your HQ, but the HQ management doesn't really require much careful decision making or strategy. It's more like just waiting until you have enough money to purchase a thing and then purchasing it. So there is base management, but it's not complex enough to really feel like a true business sim, and it's frankly not even as complex as the base management in X-COM.  You're going to be doing a lot of tactical battles in this game, and this is another area where the game is basically similar to X-COM but a lot more simplified. You have 2 action points per turn, you fire ranged weapons that have a certain % chance to hit or not based on the particular character's aim stat, and your objective is always to eliminate all ghosts. Where it is different from X-COM is that there are pretty much only two weapons at your disposal: beam guns and traps. However the guns can have different effects (e.g. pushing enemies back, pulling enemies toward you, stunning enemies, multiplying dmg dealt by allies' beams, etc). The traps can also have a range of different perks (e.g. some traps require a ghost to be on the same square, whereas others have an AoE trap effect. Some traps can only be dropped next to you while other traps can be slung a short distance toward the target. Some traps only capture ghosts, while some traps can still stun or dmg a ghost even if failing to capture it, etc).  One thing that is a notably creative feature of this game that makes it more interesting than X-COM or other similar tactical games is the ghost trapping gameplay. This is a truly original idea that in my opinion is the game's most interesting and defining feature. In a lot of these tactical games where you're controlling squads of dudes with guns, you're usually tasked with shooting all the enemies until they are dead or incapacitated. In Ghost Control, all of your enemies are ghosts, so you can't actually kill them. All you can do is shoot them to reduce their 'energy level', which can greatly reduce their mobility if low enough, but it also makes them susceptible to being trapped. Your ghost traps have a 'max energy level' requirement, which indicates the max energy level ghost it is able to trap. But lowering the ghost's energy level below this maximum makes the trap more likely to succeed. So what you are trying to do is shoot the ghosts to drop their energy level to 0, then position the ghost over a trap to permanently remove it from the field. But remember how beam weapons have certain effects, such as push/pull? This means you can throw a trap on the ground and hurt a ghost AS YOU ARE PULLING it toward you and onto a trap. Or an ally can throw down a trap and you can use a push-type beam to push the ghost onto an ally's trap. Or you can position a ghost on tap of a trap and hit it with a stun-type beam to prevent it from escaping the trap range and boost the odds of a successful trap. This is pushing/pulling ghosts onto traps to eliminate them is an excellent way of capturing the spirit of ghostbusters in a tactical game, and I commend the designers for thinking of it.  One kinda negative thing about the combat is that many of the maps are very cramped for space. You'll be fighting ghosts in a lot of houses and offices, and it really limits your tactical options when the hallways or paths around furniture only allow one ally to pass through at a time. Based on conversation with other players, though, it seems that some people enjoy the challenge of having their mobility greatly restricted in this way. Another positive is that it also restricts the mobility of many ghosts (save for a few ghosts that will teleport or phase through walls). So it could be that you'll find that to be a positive, but just know that residential/office levels put you in VERY tight spaces. The designers realized that the residential/office maps are very cramped, though, so as a counterbalance there are also park/tunnel missions that are more about battling in wide open spaces.  The negative of these tight spaces is not just how it affects gameplay/mobility, though. It also means that there is just a lot of.... STUFF... piled up on the screen. If you are using the default view on residential/office levels, it can be almost impossible to see your characters or where the possible walking paths are. There is some helpful tools in the game to cope with this. For example, walls and furniture become transparent when the cursor is within a certain range. You can also press shift to turn walls and furniture completely off. So there are ways of dealing with it, but some may still be slightly put off by the default view feeling so cluttered.  In terms of the flow of the game, it does feel like it starts to run out of steam after several hours. There are objectives to meet, base upgrades to buy, weapon upgrades to buy, and of course the ghosts will become more challenging. But the game sort of has the same problem as The Elder Scrolls, where at some point you realize that the game basically boils down to 1) kill everything in dungeon, 2) sell everything from dungeon, 3) use money made from selling everything in previous dungeon to buy better things that let you kill everything in an even bigger dungeon, 4) repeat times infinity.  If you love ghostbusters and you love x-com style games, and if you are fine with the old school look/feel, then it may be a game worth checking out.  My verdict using the criteria below is that the game ranks around a 4..   7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price. 6) A good game that is worth the full price. 5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.  4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.  3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it  heavily  discounted. 2) Only worth checking out if you are  dangerously curious . 1) Avoid at all costs.",

            "review_text": "I've been following this since it launched on kickstarter. I'm delighted it's finally on steam - I find it an excellent hybrid of xcom and ghostbusters with lots of nice tongue in cheek humour. Yes it could be more complex, and it has one or two bugs (although I've found nothing gamebreaking) - but these are just indie devs doing their best - it's not like this is a AAA title.  I'd highly recommend giving it a go - especially while it's still so cheap.",

            "review_text": "Enjoyable and fun, worth the money I paid in the sale. A Ghostbusters theme is really a great idea, the whole running a business whilst catching ghosts in a turn based tactial combat sim is something we don't seem to get much of, although Xcom comes close - it's still not ghosts.   Some ideas I would like to have experienced in this game are: - A new city, the game promises another city but as it stands London is the ONLY city. - The option to take more than 3 team members. Some ghosts are very difficult to defeat when one of them starts to panic. - Strategies that work together, like all team members firing at the same time to trap a ghost (much like in the Ghostbusters films).   I realize this is not Ghostbusters the game, it is Ghostcontrol Inc. but the inclusion of Ghostbusters themes are ineveitable. As such, I would recommend this game, but I am slightly dissapointed that it doesn't quite reach my expectations. I am very glad that I played this however.",

            "review_text": "I was a big fan of the old Ghostbusters game that came out in 1984, so this game certainly has nostaglia working for it. And I admit that it's pretty fun for a $15 title. But it's not perfect.  Pros:  - As mentioned by others, this is essentially a cross between X-Com and the 1984 Ghostbusters game. Your job is to use energy beams to weaken ghosts before snapping them up in traps, all the while trying to limit property damage and stop your employees from being drained of their sanity (the game's version of a health bar). The mechanics seem natural and understandable, and thanks to a wide range of equipment you do have several tactical options availble to you. You also get to upgrade equipment, though it's not a requirement. - Graphics are serviceable, and the retro-feel serves the setting well.  - A wide range of baddies assail you, and there's enough adequate progress and randomized maps to keep the game interesting... for a time, at least.  Cons: - Still a lot of bugs, though I didn't encounter anything game-breaking as of yet, or ones that hurt my enjoyment. - While maps are varied, they aren't very big, and they often have tight quarters.  - The game does start to get repetitive (though it takes some time to get to that point), so unless the developers add more content down the road, I suspect this game won't have the longevity of X-Com. - The one major complaint: the dialogue. The developers were trying to capture the same comic feel of the Ghostbusters franchise, but... they fail. Your team constantly quips about the situation, and the quips are pretty painful cliches. Thankfully you can turn them off if it becomes distracting.  Verdict: it has its problems, and it could use more polish and content. But hey, I had fun. You want some cheap spirit-blasting fun? This has it.",
