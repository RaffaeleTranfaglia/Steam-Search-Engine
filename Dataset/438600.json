            "review_text": "Crashes alot. Only one save slot to get another you have to buy it. No FFP but spending is very limited, For example Real Madrid only starts with 25 million dollars. Only way to get alot of money without selling any of your players is to win everything and save up or through in game purchase. Transfer market is boring. A few big moves (Pogba to Bayern or Neymar to PSG) every one and a while, and no club tries to buy any of your players unless you transfer list them. Once you sign a player their contract never runs out. It is hard to develope youth players. Rivals will directly buy and sell to each other. Multiplayer is a come back one a day affair. It is best to just join a league than to form your own.  Overall I had a decent time with the game. It boring after a while. I enjoyed multiplayer more than the single player. I also hate how they force you to update to Soccer Manager 2017.",
