            "review_text": "Pixelated roguelikes are a dime a dozen lately, but Pixel Heroes is really something special. It's charming, with biting humor and just the right amount of strategic depth. On top of the normal procedural RPG elements, there's a ton of different random events that you'll encounter to keep things interesting.   You can really tell that a lot of love was put into this game.  I'm definitely hoping we get some more campaigns at some point, but between the 30 playable characters and procedurally-generated weapons and encounters, there's more than enough here to keep you entertained for awhile.",

            "review_text": "This is an adventure you can go through with one hand. If you like charming, undemanding turn-based fantasy games where victory over the bad guys is determined by plans and careful decisions, 'Pixel Heroes: Byte &amp; Magic' is for you.  'Pixel Heroes: Byte &amp; Magic' is all about working with what you're given. All the way from the start, at team composition: you have to hire just three heroes from a diverse group, and you have no control over their traits or specialties. Don't be alarmed though, you can find a balance of variables like strength and healing abilities because all the stats and skills are clearly laid out for comparison purposes.  At the central town, citizens will send you on quests. Each destination is found on a linear path, with no worries about getting lost or missing something during the trip. Along the way there, the game directly offers events to you, and you decide whether you'll take a chance in exchange for experience and random items, or ignore it and focus on the task at hand.  I like to think majority of the game is played on the Inventory screen, where you can heal, change equipment, compare items, and throw away the excess. With limited backpack space, two-handed heroes, and growing needs, you address questions like: 'Should I keep this 100% Venom Fillet Knife, or hold on to the Anti-Confusion Ascot?' The answers are found in the locations, and you pick the details up along the way. 'Are enemies immune to poison?' 'Do they have magic insanity spells?' 'Why is this carrot talking to me?'  Evidently, 'Byte &amp; Magic' also succeeds because of its good sense of humor. Even in simple speech bubbles and flavor text, settings and characters are given enough personality that we give a dang about them: and this trait may be necessary in a game where your characters can get permanently killed, and the survivors have to get all the way back to town before you can revive anyone.  Of course, as Rogue-like games go, if all your characters get killed, it means having to start from the very beginning again. This was the aspect that turned me off from Rogue-likes in the past, but I was surprised how much I liked this game in spite of its format. This may be because of how simple its mechanics are under the surface. One user berated it for being too simple, 'like a mobile game,' however, as a person who loves the opportunity of light weight in mobile games, I find that an advantage. The simplicity makes it worth the effort when you sometimes have to start all over.",

            "review_text": "This game is stupid. Random number generators govern everything. It's a game all about tactics, chosing when who to attack with, trying to guess what's coming next, but the lack of tactical depth is ridiculous.  - Why can you not leave a dungeon once entering? - Why can you not reorder the position of your party? - Why can you not use health items in combat? - Why can the enemy attack three times in a row, but you are limited to once, and cannot use the same character twice in a row? - Why are characters and quests randomly generated, making it impossible to predict what you will face in an upcoming dungeon?  Some may defend this as an old school roguelike, but in old school rougelikes you have to play smart, and are rewarded for doing so. Failure means something- you learn from every mistake. In this game once you enter a dungeon, you just hope for the best, and hope the randomly generated characters you picked at the start can beat the boss (whose hit-points are hidden, for some reason?) after 6 or so randomly generated fights.   Winning doesn't feel like winning, it feels like blind luck. Don't waste your time with this game.",

It will just sit there sometimes  If you've done one or two quests, it seems like you've done them all. And getting new characters didn't make it any more interesting.  I wish there was more... meat... in the game. It's a no for now.  P.S. don't trust my game time, I accidentally left it on for.... 16 hours or so haha",

The graphics themselves, like many indie games today, are pixel, classic game inspired. However in my opinion I found that the visuals lean from being nostalgic to being too simplistic and boring for my tastes, with no updated sprites for different weapon and armor equips, the visuals never update themselves and it will look the same throughout the game.   The music it what I have the biggest problem with. Its sharp, chiptune style is nice for the first ten seconds of listening to it. But with no volume control, and loops of songs under a minute or two long, the harsh tones of the classic songs quickly drill into your ear until exhaustion.  Overall it a fun game, with problems certainly, but redeemable by a relatively good replay value through randomized quests and encounters, and multiple party makeups and loot options",

Maybe I didn't like how the first two tries, one of my party member dies early on, and it's hard to continue with just 2, especially if they aren't heavy hitters. There's no option to go back (or, if there was, I didn't find it), and there's no option to use the heal skill of one to heal the others except within a battle. Potions seems a little bit expensive, and as there's no option to go back, you can't restock it unless you finish the run.  It's probably enjoyable for others, but for me, it's a no.",

At 75% off this is a no-brainer. Buy.",
