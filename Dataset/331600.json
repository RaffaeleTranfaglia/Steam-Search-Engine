            "review_text": "Let's talk about my 4h experience. First of all I've never played an One Piece game before, so my review is going to be centered only on this game.  Let's start with the settings, I've a PC that can run almost every game in ultra (CPU: i7 4790; GPU: GTX 970; RAM: 8GB). So far the graphs in game look fine and the gameplay doesn't stutter or anything.   Secondly Controls. I play with my XBOX One controller, and had no problems setting it up cause everything was set up by default for the controller. But the down side of it is that the controls are written for general controllers, so the X button was the button no. 1 and the A button the no. 2 (I don't really recall the numbers), but in the end it was pretty easy to understand which button did what.  To finish let's talk about gameplay. The game is pretty straight to you, every thing is explained to you, the missions, what you're supposed to do, when and where. The combo moves are quite funny and easy to do. There are 3 game modes: - Legend Log, where you play the main story with the crew characters, when Zoro enters the crew you can use it instead of Luffy, and when Usopp does you can switch it too. - Free Log, where you can play the chapters from the main story but with whoever you feel like playing. For instance you can play Buggy in the Prologue to save Zoro. - Dream Log, this is where it gets funny. You choose a character, for instance I chose Robin, and you navigate the grand line from island to island. In each island you are given two random allies (in my first I had Law &amp; Chopper, in my 2nd I had Jabra and a Lapahn) and you have two Bosses to defeat in that island. In the end you can advance trough the islands and you get epic encounter (for example in my 3rd island I've to fight Ace).  From what I've played, I can say the game it's pretty good, awesome gameplay, great combos, but a little bit repetitive. Awesome game for the fans of the series (anime/manga) and even for those who never thought about watching it. If you have friends and they never felt like watching One Piece, this game is awesome to start them up.   8/10",

            "review_text": "So I orginally got this game so that I could play with my boyfriend, together, at the same time. These games are very similar to dynasty warriors games and with that, they are easier to use with a controller. I understand that this game said partial controller support, but only one controller works. I have a xbox 360 wireless adapter and two xbox 360 controllers. However, when we start up the game, only player one works on the controller while player two doesn't get to do anything with their controller.   The only way that I was able to figure out how this works and that one person is forced to play this game while on the computer with a mouse and keyboard which I think is stupid. Why in the world would you only let there be one controller in use... I wanted this game to be a co-op experience with my boyfriend, but this isn't happening.  Our current set up is that the pc is connected to our tv so we can play on the couch, but now he must play in front of the computer while I have to play on the couch which defeats the purpose of couch co-op. So either I am forced to buy another controller and re-map all of the controls on to a new piece of hardware or you guys can fix this issues and I can change this negative into a positve  TL:DR  Don't get this game if you want to play couch co-op with wireless 360 controllers, only one will work, the other play must play with a mouse and keyboard...",

            "review_text": "DISLIKES 1. Save button only saved the game, not customized control setup. Have to key in everytime to play. 2. Pointless camera view.  3. No online multiplayer. The provided 2P works if you have another person next to you.  4. Can't play some characters (yet they be on support / Kizuna). Can't choose the characters you want for support / Kizuna (wish it was possible in Dream or Nightmare Logs). 5. Long cutscenes that have slight difference from original manga / anime story. Can't skip some in-game scenes - if you have a long chain of Special Kizuna Attack, then wait for each characters to say it. 6. Repetitive grinding work on Dream and Nightmare Logs.   LIKES 1. Awesome attacks, each characters have different things to offer and so unique from one another. Some characters will stay with their personality - Using Luffy to attack Boa will make her evade him and goes somewhere else at times (but she still gets hit), Enel can't use lightning on Luffy (no hits except from his staff), Sanji is useless against women, Buggy runs with a Buggy mobile etc. 2. Missions, treasure events, side goals and in-game stories are great in Legend Log.  3. Plenty choices of combos that produces different types of attacks and unique Kizuna chain system.  4. Some support characters (i.e. Hannibal, Alvida, Monet, Lapahn) may look weak but they are good in gathering (!) - WAY better than strong / popular characters (i.e. Sanji, Law, Blackbeard, Chopper etc.).  5. Several choices of awesome characters that you can play with in Free, Dream or Nightmare Logs - those characters are the popular ones. Very few female characters to choose but ain't a big deal to me. 6. A unique yet enjoyable game - easy to get Beli money, levelling up characters on the first phase up to 50 was easy but balanced out with hard grinding on the second phase - the same goes for poster skills and coins.   Extra: Unexpectedly, my first level break is Moriah. In awe with Jinbe, After TS Usopp, After TS Tashigi and Marco's moves.   10/10 will grind with Ace my hommie and use Robin's giga footwork to stomp enemies.",

It seems that i still have more to unlock in Dreamlog mode.    I am a fan of the series, its fun, and the first One Piece on Steam.  People are suggesting not to buy it because of ithe graphic issues and hope that this will teach the developer/publisher a lesson, but the developer/publisher have another option and thats not releasing future games on PC.",

            "review_text": "One Piece Pirate warriors 3, for the PC Is a good game, the gameplay's fast-paced, and action packed and over the top. You would honestly have to be trying to get your KO count below 2000 in most maps, so if you like kicking a literal ton of ♥♥♥, you're already looking good.  There are a ton of characters to play as, and a few have different variations that change their movesets, in some ways minor, and some major.  It's even fairly different from the previous Pirate warrior games, in a few ways, the team up stuff the most prevalent. The Kizuna rush mechanic is a big one and one you'll be making use of constantly.   The legend log tries to retell the story of the Manga, and while I have not beat it, it does an alright job of doing so, but still omits some key side characters in their arcs. (Dressrosa is apparently really barebones too, but that's because of when the game was being made) Some of the cutscenes are repeated from Pirate warriors 1, but they were good there, and they're good here, but the new stuff that they didn't cover in it, do get really good cutscenes, so it's all good and consistent.   Dream log is where a lot of the meat of the content is and where you unlock a good chunk of the playable cast, with at least 50 battles to get through, to complete it all, and they have randomized allies and some random enemies to keep things a bit fresh. With random bounties, and tough battles ahead, you will spend a lot of time in this mode, even if you've beaten it completely.   There are a lot of unlockables and collectables to get you hooked into the game, too.  But there are some bad sides, if you don't like this 'Dynasty Warriors' type of game, then this may not change your mind, and it can get a bit repetitive at times, I will admit that. And the port isn't the greatest, but some graphical bugs are being looked at and will most likely get fixed in the near future.   In total, I would rate it a good 8.5 out of 10 and highly recommend it.",

Now first the only thing that really makes me mad in this port is the controls. The menu is in PC keys and the controller in game is horrible but luckily there was a guide that helped me get my controller to work like it should tho it stills feels a bit bad but I can play it like normal well besides having to use the PC keys at the menus.  Being a fan of one piece and the games I will still try to play this game on steam so would I recommend it? well if you're a fan of either the games or the anime then yeah try it out but only if it gets on sale. If you're not really into the games or the anime and just looking to buy it because it's an anime game then I recommend you do not get it.  With using a program to get the controller working like it would be I'll give this game a 7/10 for a decent port on steam still I do hope they give it an update since I really loved this game on console.",

When you need to do a 'light attack', it shows you the icon for light attack, not the 'real' button you have to push. It's an issue on the first mission if you don't check your control scheme before, then it's not anymore.  From what I saw there, it's a BASIC musou.

            "review_text": "I'm only giving a thumbs up to this game because I know the game is good, and I would definitely recommend it, which is what the thumbs up means. HOWEVER, I recommend getting it on another platform. While the port doesn't have any glaring issues at first glance, there's plenty of technical issues that start to pop up.  First, the visuals. While the inferior graphics don't bother me personally, they falsely advertised the game on the store page by posting screenshots with PS4-level graphics, and false advertisement is always a no-no. Also, knowing KT, they probably purposely made the PC version this way so that the PS4 version will look better, since that's their main moneymaker, which is pretty sad but true. The colors are dull and washed out, the rendering distance is quite poor since you can't see the buildings in the background, and the shadows, textures, and lighting are all PS3 quality. If you're fine with that, then go for it. Mods can improve the colors and sharpness, but the lighting and textures will be unaffected.  Then there's the controller issues. The game didn't recognize my controller right away, since apparently I had to switch it to Dinput mode to get it to work. Even then, not all of the buttons were remappable on the options menu. Even DW8XL had better controller options. I had to resort to using joytokey in order to get some of the buttons to emulate the console layout. Only official Xbox 360 controllers are supported in this game, as stated by Bandai. However, if you have a controller that can act as a 360 controller or can be recognized as one, then it should work. There's absolutely no mouse support in this game, and the keyboard controls are far from ideal, so you're basically forced to use a controller to enjoy the game fully.  Then there's the bugs that are present. Apparently there's a graphical options bug that makes the game stuck at the lowest settings, so you can't even change it. Bandai's looking into it right now. Then there are plenty of other bugs, such as black screens, crashes, microstuttering because it's 59fps, and in-game graphical bugs. One of the most noticeable is that some characters' models start flipping out whenever devil fruit powers are used, particularly Logias. Body parts go missing, clothes disappear, and some body parts don't transform when they're supposed to. There's also sometimes a random plane of light protruding out of the character's bodies, and it sometimes is so big that it obstructs the whole screen. Bandai, you need to fix this stuff before I consider re-purchasing the game.  Personally, I refunded the game because of all the in-game issues I encountered, and am waiting for a fix. Until then, I cannot recommend this game for the PC platform, but please don't think it's a bad game. It's a great entry to the Musou series, and it's even better for One Piece fans, and I totally suggest that all Musou/One Piece/hack'n'slash fans try it out. Just not on PC. Cheers",

Me and a friend decided to pre-purchase one copy of the game, gold edition obviously, to get the costumes and extra 'missions' as we divided the cost 40%/60% we bought it in his account, would be no problem as we share libraries, which as valve states in the family sharing page 'A guest will have access to the lender's DLC, but only if the guest doesn't also own the base game. '. we waited our due time, the day the game became available I started downloading it, saw both the prepurchase DLC and the story pack DLC and everything looked fine. I stayed at my friend's house so we could play local in his PC, we found out Steam changed the story pack dlc removing 5 costumes, and that they were obtainable by getting it for free on Namco Bandai's web page, got the code, we used it and got the third DLC marked on his account. When I got to my house I obviously wanted to play, to my surprise the previously mentioned DLC dissapeared, and in its place left only de Namco Bandai's DLC, with a lousy 5 costumes and no missions, which obviously made me mad at the Sharing system, as this is obviously a bug on Valves part, we tried coneccting to his account to re download the DLC but obviously on returning to my account they still could not get accesed, im just posting this to get some help quick, as Valve support to this day has not answered my one problem my friend had when he switched to his new rig...  TL;DR: 10/10 Would split game cost again for faulty Family Sharing on DLC",

For those who are yet not acquainted with the anime/manga it can work as a teaser of sorts, as the events from the original story are pretty well outlined, though you will get spoiled of course.  If you are unsure whether to get it or not, because you never played a dynasty warriors type game, don't worry. I had the same worries and that's the only reason I waited for sale. I now totally regret not getting it for the full price because it's just so worth it. It has become the longest single player game (apart from RPG games) that I played in my life. And I am still not done with it, so it may very well become my most played single player game of all time.  Great: +Crazy number of playable characters +Story mode and a super fun 'wacky' mode with randomly generated levels +Ridiculous number of collectibles, unlockables, progression +Juicy, fluid, satisfactory combat +Almost the whole story of One Piece (ends in Dressrosa, which has an original plot because I guess the manga did not conclude that arc when this game was released) +Easy and accessible to everyone, but has some incredibly hard challenging difficulties which are unlockable for those who want a challenge - you can't really complain that it's too easy with the 'super hard' difficulty for the story mode and the 'nightmare log' version of the dream log mode.  Minor niggles: -Your allies sometimes wander off somewhere and you have to rush to them to rescue them because them making it alive is sometimes required to succeed in a level.  -May be a bit grindy or too random with the 'coins' needed to upgrade characters. Some coins require beating 'strong enemies', there is like 20 of those, and it's completely random which one you will get. You may end up getting coins for 10 characters you were not that much interested in first.  Technical: -Some people argue that the graphics are outdated, I don't really see that as a problem personally and I don't think it takes from the enjoyment of the game. I guess it is factual though. I've seen a guide on improving the textures here on steam though. -Personally I had no problems with my xbox360 controller but some people have controller issues. Especially Xbox One controller seems to be broken right now, maybe there are fixes already, check the forums.  This game just rocks. It's a must buy for all One Piece gaming fans. I regret waiting so long to purchase it, but I am a very sensible customer and also a bit of a 'budget' gamer, and I don't like blindly purchasing stuff for full price.  Buy it. You won't regret it.",

At first I hated it due to the insanely terrible control schemes, like they are illogical and just plain bad (I also have this game on my vita cause who doesn't want One Piece on the go, and the controls for that version are great). This version has the camera mapped to the triggers and the right stick does nothing (with no way to remap either). After I found a good controller mapping (aside from the triggers and sticks you can fully remap the controller) and get more into the game I found that it was just as good as it's vita brother. I've also heard of many bugs with the game but I just beat it without any technical issues, so I guess that aspect will be hit or miss for different people. This is also the only version with no online play.  Now on to the good stuff. This game has a decent length campaign that goes from the beginning of Luffy's journey up through the events of Punk Hazard and covers most of the major battles and events in between. The game also has Dream Mode which allows you to pick any character you've unlocked and fight through numerous islands with different objectives. So between the story, free mode (play the story as any unlocked character), dream mode, and an assload of unlockables this game will keep you busy for quite a while. So if you're a One Piece fan or just love the Warriors games, I'd suggest trying this out...though if you have a vita, PS3, or PS4 I'd suggest grabbing it for one of those systems (PS4 obviously being the best choice).",

This 3rd sequels is basically a remake of the first sequel, in the format of the 2nd sequel. As well as, extending the storyline up to Dofi. The new modes seem alright, but the game does make me feel like re-playing the 2nd sequel overall (eg. same BGM, coin-sets collecting). I am NOT an OP fan (i enjoy Hunter X Hunter more :P), but I am a musou fan.   Pros: - Not much is changed. Control, in-game items, etc. which is easy to begin the game without reading/learning anything extra (I play with a PS3 controller) - Contains a up-to-date storyline.  - Its avaliable on PC, and to most westerners, in their mother-languages. - Hack-n-slash musou style retains.  - More playable characters. (but still more should be added) - smooth gameplay (eg. good camera angles, control settings, and story-flow) - the in-game CG movies are in real high quality. - the REPEATITIVE gameplay is rather low, as a musou game.   Cons: - Be prepared to set graphic settings to 'all high'. The manga-alike G-pen effect is inconsistent (like little dots ), when the character is static (issue tested in medium &amp; low graphic settings) - Its kinda annoying collecting all the coin-sets again (just like a replay of the 2nd sequel) - Expensive (like all japanese big titles, it is a expensive game) I would recommend a short wait for a price drop (like what they did to dragonball-xenoverse 40GBP-&gt; 20 GBP) I bought it cuz I just happened to have enough in my steam wallet..after selling a knife in CS:GO - A controller is a NEED. Keybord control is very poor. (as expected) - On my windows 10 laptop, all function keys are diabled in the game, (eg. volume control, screen brightness)   Overall, its a OK game, at a high price.

The dream mode is nice, many islands, many strange teams and fights, but that you cant select or support characters at start or see which are possible, are a bit sad. The nightmare mode is good to test your strategies. What i dont like is the high steps to reach level 51+ you need all coints to get higher, not each coin give you 10 levels more, some are strange like playing Lysop vs CP9 but you cant pick him in that level and the leveling brings only a very low extra help for level 100 nightmare mode. What i miss is Steam Cloud / Back Up Saving, you have only 1 Safe File and if its get lost you can start from new (me after 34 hours) and not even 5 Trading Cards. The intro is good, the animations are okay, the extras ? are fine, but the DLC are expensive, there would be a new characters or some more specials better new powerful abitlities/ characters or maps. This potenial wasnt used. The game is for hack and slay + One Piece fans fine (90%) or for hack and slay(75%), One Piece Fans (73%) this game could get fast boring, sure every character has many combos but mostly the strategy is just hit hit hit and sometimes you lose only 1 mission and 20 min are completly for nothing, no check points, no 2nd chance, nothing, thats frustrating, but for me this game could be much better so i give only 57 %. For achievement hunters i give 53 % they are easy but the last ones need much time and that for only 40 achievements, is a bit less, there could be much more step achievements (each 5 islands, each 5 character level 5) or many other possible things.

Since the get go, I've been playing this on hard. It feels like normal to me on hard, I haven't died yet. I did come really close to dying while playing a level 15 character on a level 20 map though.  The game plays like a basic dynasty warriors game; you have quick attacks and heavy attacks, that can be mixed to form combos and special moves. Characters are upgraded with coins, that you can get by completing map requirements and by defeating enemy characters. Depending on the map, failing an objective may be game over, or may result in a new objective. The currency you earn is used to unlock music/pictures/videos, which seemed a little lacking? The only other purpose I've found for currency is to use it to level up characters; using the currency you can level up any character, up to your highest level character, so if all you do is play luffy, then you can level up your others up to w/e level he is.  The characters all feel very unique, and each time I think, 'this is going to be my favorite,' I come across someone new. Usually when I play dynasty warriors the emphasis is on the weapon type or continually hacking and slashing. The button smashing is definitely still in this game, but it just feels like the skills/combos are longer and have more satisfaction to using them.   Other than a few characters having some odd shading here or there(some look burned or oily?), I enjoy the graphics.  So far I have only encountered one bug, which is the mini-map randomly zooming in or vanishing. The only way to bring it back is to open the menu and then close the menu, presto, the mini-map returns. While, not a bug, there is from time to time a tremendous frames drop, I know this is kind of expected though.",

With some bonus content. The story has been cut a bit so that it can fit into the chapters and whatnot in this game, but it doesn't really bother you as much if you can fill the in-betweens with your own knowledge. As such, being a fan of One Piece is highly recommended.  - This is a console port, and so having a controller is almost a must. I could never see myself playing this game comfortably using nothing but my keyboard and my mouse. But that's how it is for nearly every fighting game, so if you're considering getting this game, you should already own one.  -I've never played any games of this type, as in, Dynasty Warriors. So this was a completely new kind of game for me, which might've altered my view on it a bit.  All in all it's nothing to click your tongue at. If you're a fan of One Piece you should consider buying it. There are tons of characters in the game and a lot to do until you feel like you've actually finished it. And there's apparently room for a second player in the game as well but I've yet to try that, so I'll not comment on that either.  Most people also run into some problems when launching the game and when watching cutscenes, but there are solutions to these problems on online forums if you know where to look. And make sure to use the game backup function every now and then as there is no Cloud on this game. At least yet. Hopefully it's still in the works and soon in our use.",

However, I personally have no noticed either. I use a PS4 controller with DS4Windows, and it works just fine with the game, no issues with the camera. The graphics also don't bother me, looking at them side by side there is a noticeable difference, but the graphics as they are are still quite nice. The lack of controller input support in images/menu/tutorials etc. is an issue, but I managed to puzzle my way past it and I'm sure there's a guide somewhere. Also I'm loving the music, its so jazzy and fun. However, if you're like neither Warriors/Musou games or One Piece, this game probably isn't worth it. If you like both, its pretty damn good.",

I switched over to my keyboard but the controls don't feel natural even when scrolling through the main menu (as up and down in the main menu are up arrow and down arrow respectively). Select and back button are weird too (being enter and escape repectively). Moving the camera in-game is uncomfortable too because you can't use the mouse.  IF and ONLY IF you can get passed this annoying gameplay and lack of features, then you'll find a fun Dynasty Warriors inspired game with a good story. This game also stays true to the anime so that's a plus. The story takes you from the beginning to the current arc of the anime.",
