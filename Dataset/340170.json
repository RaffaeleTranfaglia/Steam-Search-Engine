The port isn't perfect and is poorly optimized in my opinion but that doesn't change the fact that the game itself has been quite fun so far. Considering the platform of origin, I think that the game looks pretty good. Some textures are bad, like they didn't get touched up. A lot of people are upset by 30 FPS and 1080p as the maximum resolution, (why you would want a psp port in 4k is beyond me, but whatever.) I can see where it could be disappointing, but I come from a time where technical specs were backseat to the game actually being fun to play.   I can't comment too much on the story yet, but from what i've played its been alright. The gameplay has been quite fun, and with a wide variety of characters you can approach combat in different ways. I'll likely update this review later after i've played some more but for now I want to get it out that that the game is enjoyable if you're not caught up in the massive graphic/spec circle jerk and actually like to play games.",

I played the first 2 hours and despite loving the initial cut scenes (setting the dark tone), wasn't truly hooked until the battle sytem and customization opened up a bit. Now I can't get enough.  The aesthetic is a lot like FF8 in the sense that it's a modern vibe that maintains the typical FF-anime feel. It's set in the same universe as FF13, which was never my favorite, but does a better job providing resources for you to catch up on the lore, should you want to.  You're essentially playing an action RPG with 14 playable characters (not incuding the eidolons that are super fun) that all use different weapons and balances of magic and skills to contribute to the fight. I can't imagine getting bored of the combat, as each of those 14 characters adds skills and spells (or even entire mechanics) to their repitoire every time they level, which is quite frequent. Combine all that with the fact that you're using 3 people at once, and we have a game where no two fights are the same. There are a number of design choices in the game that keep things fresh.  I'll update as I play a bit more, and fully expect this to be another Final Fantasy adventure that I log 50+ hours with.",

My review is going to be quite bias. So downvote me if you like I'm going to give my personal opinion and experience of this game.  I pre-ordered this game for the Dota 2 chocobo courier, wallpaper and moogle ward. I absolutely like the game, the plot, battle dynamics, gameplay, and of course exceptionally well done soundtrack. I've waited 4 years for this game to be released in North America (it wasn't even suppose to leave Japan originally but it gained so much interest that they did bring it over. So there's my gratitude there).  This has got to be the darkest story plot of any Final Fantasy game, to the point where I started to get a 'Persona 3' feel near the ending. This game does offer multiple endings (3 different endings if I'm not mistaken, plus a hidden trailer for the upcoming game Type-1?). Yes, the game is a bit pixelated but it was still a good port imo and you may be discouraged that it's not in 60fps but that's okay, it ran smoothly for me.  Pros/Cons  + You also have a variety of waifu's to choose from like: Deuce, Cater, Cinque, Sice, Seven, Queen, &amp; Rem  + Husbandos if you prefer: Ace, Trey, Eight, Nine, Jack, King, &amp; Machina + Plenty of replay value (i.e collecting all the Ultimate weapons for every character, multiple endings) + Including side quests and multiple cutscenes depending on which character you are using. + The combat system doesn't get too boring. +    Let's just say you fight a battle on a big bridge with a certain someone.   + Fast learning curve + Great Soundtrack + Simple (You won't get lost or stuck in this game).  - You have to level them up three at a time, which can be quite time consuming. - Single player whereas the PSP version offered Co-OP. It would be nice to game up with some friends. -    The love story between Machina and Rem was lacking    - They could've done more character develpment and plot building. - 30fps cap",

Don't get me wrong, I love this game and even finished the PSP version, this one brings too few things that we can call new, but the game itself is great. Why would I say it's in the middle of lame and awesome? Because this game works like this: Your squad is deployed in a good, great, amazing mission and you fight your way to victory. By the end of the mission you'll see cutscenes and storytelling. After that you are free to go to map and there is a time counting for you to grind yourself a better level for the next mission. Basically, mission day - grinding - mission day - grinding - mission day - grinding. You can even argue with me saying that 'hey, but there is side missions to solve in the meantime', well, those side missions, all of them, are 'kill 'a number of' monsters in a specific area'. That's it! All of them are like that. No real quests, nothing interesting for grinding in a game that's all about grinding. But the mission days are so great that I can't help myself but to go grind and get strong for the missions. Overall the game is worth and the ending might be the best in the series, is a great story, not easy to follow, but great.",

            "review_text": "Cons: - 30fps (if that bothers you) - voice acting and cut-scenes seem off - few to no skill based achievements, a good portion unlock just for playing   Pros: - Multiple playable characters makes combat fun - New Game + feature - Improvements over handheld versions graphics - handy acceleration feature to speed up travel and combat  This game is darker than some other Final Fantasy games but it works well here. The number of playable characters gives you many options when taking on a new mission or when having trouble S ranking old missions. Missions can be replayed as well if you want to test new formations or just grind. This is not a remake but instead a remaster of a handheld; this becomes very noticable during cutscenes where you expect the usual over the top graphic treatment Square is known for but instead get the same handheld styled cutscenes. A good portion of cutscenes simply seem for lack of a better word slow and it takes you out of the experience to some extent. There are some decent cutscenes as well so it evens out somewhat. Side quests are present and give you some content to fool around with and the different difficulties and new game plus feature will definitely give hardcore fans something to do even after completing the game once. A pretty good game even with its faults.",

Bad joystick support and no keyboard and mouse support, yet doesn't say a 360 controller is required on the store page. 4. 'HD' graphics are about as HD as Donkey Kong Jr on the Colecovision. You can play it on 1080, but the graphics look no different.  If you already bought this, I'd recommend getting a refund. If you pre-purchased it for the Dota2 items, get a refund and just wait until Sept. 2nd. You will be able to buy those items on the Steam Marketplace dirt cheap at that point.  As long as the masses continue to buy bad ports, companies like this will continue to put out bad ports. Vote with your money - Get a refund or don't buy at all.

By old i mean the ones with ATB (Attack time bar) where we could pause and decide what type of attack to hit the enemy without having to rush with a risk of getting hit by other enemies that you didnt see. I have been avoiding this game because of the mixed reviews, but somehow i got myself this game. Maybe because i was bored, BUT i didnt regret buying this.  Yes this might be the 'darkest' FF visuals that i have seen so far ( with the bloods etc) but this has its own charm too.  The battle is fun and challenging, the phantoma harvesting is kinda cool, also i kinda like the aura it gives off like FF VIII (SeeDs students, instructor, balamb garden, sorcery...) maybe a mix of FF X too, (this is personal opinion) the demonion and milites mask and clothes kinda reminds me of it.    Also, you have to becareful not to let any members die, because the game isnt forgiving enough to let you revive / phoenix down-them lol. They will only be availabe to fight again once you cleared the mission at hand. So plan wisely with the magic and equipments too, you wont be able to switch as you like during mission.... Unless you find a save zone.   The thing that i dont like is, yor active leader died when you summon an Eidolon ( Guardian Force) so you have to bring Rem with her Undying Wish to grant re-raise.  This might not be the best FF series but hey its fun. Im playing this using iMac, the game kinda lags if you didnt put on LOW RES.   Buy it if you have time.... And have no game to play on your list.",

Leveling up can be somewhat of a hassle when you're trying to keep everyone even (which is also annoying because only active participants gain XP while on missions).   Controls are good all things considered. The game was designed with the PSP in mind and you can tell that they didn't half-♥♥♥ the port over to bigger and better systems. Just something as simple as Confirm not being bound to a particular attack action. It's amazing and I appreciate it.  Visuals are mediocre overall. The Main characters look fine but secondary actors and some textures were obviously not given an HD makeover. It can be a bit distracting if not hilarious.  The UI is solid other than in a few places (I'd have liked to be able to swap between characters on the equip/ability screens). Squaresoft usually does well in this department so good on them.  Story and Themes are similar to FF Tactics. The War is presented as dark and gritty. The Setting is interesting and does some cool things with the four crystal mythology. I hope for more final fantasies being written in the same vein (it won't though).",

The battle gameplay is simply amazing where you can exchange your MC through 14 available characters, and plus it also have a very unique style of battle gameplay where the battle system is no longer turn-based, but more dashing-button-kind-like gameplay.   The gameplay of the game is kinda different from the normal FF franchise game, where in this game you will need to complete missions in order to proceed, and after every mission, you will return to the same place again.  And oh yeah, eventhough the story is related to the FF13 world, its totally a different story with a few similarities that you would notice of. In my opinion, its much easier to understand the nova crystallis world through FF zero than the FF13 franchise.  Overall, the storyline is something that you want to anticipate in this game, where in my opinion is the darkest FF game that i ever played.  The only bad thing about this game is the 30fps locked. Thats all. The rest is amazing.",

It has a lot of playable character with each of them having individual playstyles which i really like. It features a dynamic battle system which is not as stiff as old ones and is pretty similar to Crisis Core(come on guys, turn based battles are good for PSX but not in 2015...that would look so stupid) The story is a bit simple and filled with clichées but you have to consider that originally it was a PSP game, so don't expect too much there.  The port is not too bad either as you can simply adjust the screen size and turn the window into full mode.  The difficulty of the game can be set individually as well.

INCOMING WORDS FROM THE CLOSET  Some notes: - It is an embodiment of the Final Fantasy franchise even if it's not a numbered  - The setting of the story is set within the Fabula Nova Crystallis series (Same mythos as FF13 and the upcoming FF15). Thus, familiar terms from the series are used in this game. But if you're worried if it seems foreign, talking to NPCs can give you a hint of the terminologies ingame, it helps! - Some would be wondering by the gameplay, that it's not TBS as your norm Final Fantasy system but instead it's actually a quite fast paced ARPG battle system. - THIS GAME IS GEARED FOR NEW GAME+. Some of the story contents are locked only after you finish you first playthrough.   Brief review: + Quite dark story surrounding the world they live in, add that to an academy of students whose purpose are to be soldiers (for the main class you're playing as, they get it worse) + Fast paced battle system and vast amount of versatility in roster + Quite alot of achievements to be obtained (not from Steam but ingame) + Better camera and motion blur options than the PS4 version. + You get to play with Square Enix staff.  - Getting some of the achievement rewards can be boring or tiring (whether doing it naturally or grinding them) - While it has better camera, you do feel like your main boss is the camera sometimes. - That one character.  Performance Report:  - Port wise, it's an upper touchup than the PS4 HD port from the PSP. Not a large port upgrade as normal people would expect (such as uncapped fps/superior textures/proper graphic settings), but more towards bringing the game to another market to be available without using emulators. - I truly have no issue with the game, since I did not increase the quality of my AA (using 1080p monitor), so it didn't tax my system to make it dip in performance. - AA settings is actually an upscale, up to 4k. That alone would affect your overall performance.",

The Story: It's complex it's interesting, I only felt grindy when I needed to level for certain missions which were much harder then they looked, like the mission where your level 22 characters have to fight a level 45, while this mission I am sure was ment to be easier it seemed harder to me. But besides this point, the story is amazing, there is two endings One good and one bad, but still its pretty damn good.   Now, if I had to give a score to this game I would give it a 8/10, it's not a perfect game because of the keyboard issues, and there is some issues in the game where my characters would just randomly die, however this is quickly overlooked since you have 12 members(I could just have missed the Q's that said 'Hey you are gonna die') My computer is just under the min recommendations for this game and I still had a extremely solid and great looking graphics experience just makes you quickly forget about the 30 fps cap everyone QQ's about.",

Thanks to some fans, there has been a fan-translated ISO of it floating around for a while now. Earlier this year, the game was released in NA for PS4 with updated textures, resolution and improved framerate. Now, none of these are perfect due to it originally being a PSP game (Look at Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker HD), but it does look better than the PSP. Especially when you stretched a 480p game to 1080p in the ISO. Sadly, some less important areas and non-main characters or main NPCs have low textures still, giving it early PS2 graphic quality, but it's fine for it being a PSP port.   Gameplay wise, it feels a bit clunky at first, but once you get the hang of it it becomes very fast paced and enjoyable. Plus they finally added the second control stick to be camera moving away from the awkward camera controls on the PSP. The world may feel a bit small or cramped due to the mission based gameplay, but if you ever played MGS Peacewalker, it feels the same way as the missions for that. You bring 3 of the 13 classes to battle with each one representing a Job from Final Fantasy games (though with many liberties taken) each using a unique weapon. You upgrade their stats and what abilities they have in the hub world, the Military Academy.   Story wise the game is top notch. The opening cinematic to the game is pretty dark for a Final Fantasy game, but war isn't pretty. You get a combination of teen angst, Final Fantasy VI-ish story and a bit of XIV's Garleans vibe with this game. And turn on Japanese audio unless you want to hear Christina Vee throughout the whole game.   If you are a Final Fantasy Fan, I'd say this is a must have, especially if you don't want to buy a Bloodborne Machine (PS4) just for this game. If you enjoy PSP games like Peacewalker or Monster Hunter, this is a must have for you as well. If you are not too big on games in this style, this game isn't going to make you change your mind about them.   Overall Score: 8.5/10 It's a wonderful game, has some very minor kinks, and the graphics are PS2 graphics, but it's wonderful for a PSP port. I recommend using a controller for this game. ",

The HD graphics are definitely noticable in the student's character models, but otherwise the graphics look rather mundane. Not terrible though. Keep in mind that you will spend most of your time interacting and controlling these main characters so most of what you see is very crisp and detailed character models.

Characters reaffirm there sentences after saying them occasionally and some of the dialogue has grammar issues -Co-Op was removed and replaced with an annoying mechanic where you can choose to have two faceless npcs replace your party members to grind for points to buy multiplayer items.  Final rating: 9/10  Reccomended for newcomers and Old time final fantasy fans. Don't listen to the negative reviews",

The combat system seems fun so far. If you know how to configure and maintain a pc, you'll get absolutely no problems with this game.  NB : Gamepad is mandatory AND configurable (there are 3 layouts and some options).  Don't thrust Steam Enhanced reviews, there are built in graphics options but only 2 resolutons (1080p and 720p).

There's inconsistent texture quality throughout the game, I was expecting better from the screenshots. I also had to fix my graphics driver because the game uses my integrated graphics card by default.  More details:  1. The game is 30 fps locked, not a big issue for me. But I experienced frames at 10~20 fps and had to go to my graphics settings to make sure the game uses my NVIDIA card instead of Intel's integrated graphics.  2. Inconsistent quality of graphics/textures. Some parts of the game looks nice, while others still look like you're playing from the PSP. I was expecting more from an HD remaster on PC.  3. This port has only either 720p or 1080p resolution. My laptop has a 900p resolution so it doesn't look too appealing on full screen. I had to keep it on a window that occupies only 65% of my screen.  4. People seem to be having trouble playing it on a keyboard and mouse. Highly recommended to use a controller, preferably Xbox controller for Windows.  Unless you're playing on a 1080p screen and have a good controller, I don't fully recommend purchasing this game as it is right now. Maybe after they fix the resolution and textures or after I fully enjoy the game.",

Some issues --  1) I have not had issues with FPS dips that others have had, and I don't mind the general graphic quality of the game -- what drove me crazy was how inconsistent the game was visually. Some character models appear to have been updated for the 'HD' release, but others were not. Some textures look good, some look awful. Some effects appear to have been upgraded (there's some real-time rendered fire in the intro section that is brilliant), and some is god awful. The constant disparity in quality makes the lower-end sections / characters / textures / effects really stand out, in a bad way.  2) Too many circa 1999 PC gaming design issues. Having to exit the game to a launcher to change certain settings (or fix issues, like the on-screen prompts changing from controller input to keyboard for whatever reason) should not be a thing in 2015 game from a 'AAA' publisher.  3) The controls are just not good. Keyboard isn't even an option -- unless you like the idea of controlling the camera with the numpad. I find the controller support baffling -- you can already switch targets with the left and right triggers, but they made it so you can also switch targets by nudging the right stick. Why is this an issue? Early in the game, I was on a bridge with ranged targets attacking me from up high on buildings / ledges up and across gaps. I switched to a ranged character and tried to turn the camera to survey how many enemies there were. Unfortunately, the camera was zoomed in to the point I could hardly see anything. Every time I tried to move the camera, the game interpreted it as a target lock change. The result? The camera was just spinning circles around my character, and with the god-awful motion blur I couldn't see a damned thing.  4) The early combat was very button-mashy. I couldn't tolerate the game long enough to see if this changes.  5) The game is tonally strange. The game opens up with more blood and combat-honesty than I can recall having ever seen in an FF game -- and brings in your RAH RAH GOOOOOO HIGH SCHOOL SUPER POWER SQUAD heroes. The gravitas from the opening is quickly lost.  6) The voice acting was not terrible, but the voice SYNC was horrid. Spoken lines were frequently off from lip flaps by at least 0.5 seconds. Bat voice-to-animation syncing drives me crazy, don't know why. This may not be an issue for others, but it's bothersome for me.  I really, really wanted to like this game -- I had some hope after getting a chance to play the Episode Duscae demo for FF XV on PS4, and was readily impressed. I've been in the mood for a good JRPG, but this was definitely not it. Hopefully Tales of Zesteria will fill that void.",

From what I have played, yes, the controls are a little clunky, but every game I've played has been like that from the start. And yes, this game is better played with a controller.  Gameplay is different from any Final Fantasy I have played. Battles aren't menu-driven so much anymore, but are more action/reaction driven. And I have to get acquainted with a large number of playable characters and figure out how to play with them.  It's not bad for a ported game.

I kept entering the menu instead of whatever I was trying to do, for example.

Idk why this game currently at the time of this review has a mixed reaction on the User Reviews with a 50% rating. I have not come across any sort of technical problems, such as glitches(graphical or otherwise). There are some odd things however. You can't exit the game easily when you want to. The main menu has no exit game choice, that I do admit is odd, so I had to use my window key to get out of it. Alt-Tab will probably work as well. However the rest of the game is fantastic. They brought back an overworld to the FF series which imo was sorely missed. Graphically when you look closely the graphics aren't that impressive, you can tell the game came from the PSP, however rather than focusing on the details and instead looked at as a whole when it comes to its graphics, it's actually a beautiful game with beautiful design. I loved the combat in Crisis Core FF7 on the PSP as well as Kingdom Hearts, if anyone has played those, you'll be somewhat prepared for the combat. Obviously buttons will have changed and it is instead a party system, but otherwise the combat is very nice and satisfying. I use controller for this game and when using a controller you can only navigate menus using the D-pad and not the stick. It's unfortunate and annoying but I assume it is because it was originally a PSP game. The story is give or take, it can be interesting at times, and not during other times, but it's up to you. I have no problems with it. Overall I'd give this addition to the FF series an 8/10. If you are not an FF fan you obviously won't enjoy it.

I understand that it's a port and all, but they basically did nothing to port the controls to pc. It's like they just grabbed a psp, layed it on a keyboard and said 'hm, lets just map it based on the position of the psp buttons' For me, it is  only playable with a controller . With a controller it plays like any other game would on a controller, just fine. Also, the windows mouse cursor is annoyingly visible in game but you won't be using the mouse anyway so hiding it off screen is needed.   tldr: You need a controller to play this game, other than that it is amazing so far.

When I unlocked the 'what if' scenario at the end and it showed them as normal students I actually found myself liking them as opposed to the blank slates they are generally presented as throughout the game. At first I thought having each character from the get-go was a welcome change of pace for JRPGs but I quickly discovered that part of the character building in JRPGs comes from having them gradually join you in addition to having interactions with the rest of the characters. So although I enjoyed the gameplay, I cannot recommend this game from a story perspective. I find the best games balance the two out but it comes down to personal preference. Is gameplay more important to you or is it story?",

Terrain Texture is par But the characters are good (Tbh I'm impressed what they did with it since it was a psp release, the one before vita!).  There are an absurd amount of people complaining about texture quality. This game was realised on PS4 and Xbox one in March, its the same Texture. Before buying and complaining about it. Do some research before buying and keep in mind that this was originally a psp game. Youtube some gameplays to see if you are okay with the quality of the game.  Now to my final point. This game IS LOCKED at 30 fps, which I am okay with. At least it doesn't drop randomly. Smoothness &gt; Absurd amounts just because I can, and again I will state again this was a HD port of a psp game, which is understandable why there's a lock in the first place.   I recommend that if you are one of those people who care about framerates, follow a Steam Curator called The Framerate Police. they're there to tell you about framerates.   I'll edit this with final thoughts of the game once I've actually put in some time to play it. ",

Hearing the scream of your comrades right after the gristly sound of them being sliced open is perhaps new for a FF. It's actually pretty awesome, I can feel something. I'm much more empathetic to what's going on now that it feels a bit more real and gritty.  Combat is fun enough and you start off with 14 different 'squad' members to choose from. Controls fine with a gamepad but the camera with lock-on can go real crazy but it's stuff you can manage without a lot of hassle. The story is shaping up to be interesting enough, even if there are a few too many words and names that mean nothing to me resulting in a troubled understanding of who's attacking who and so on.  The graphics look fine the majority of the time, acceptable at least.

Then something struck me, seeing the past ports from Square Enix, I had this looming fear of Type-0 HD being a bad port again.  Come release day, I got onto the discussion board in Steam and found an enormous amount of complaints about the game, not at all unexpected. From things that I feel are trivial to things that had some good claims to it. One of the most common problem I saw, was that the game runs very very badly with keyboard controls. So I decided to get a new controller, which I did. I went back home and started playing.  Here's the few problems I encountered and general problems that other players complain about. 1. The .exe straight crashes the moment I press 'Start Game'. (Solved it by setting Steam to run in Administrator mode) 2. Some pretty obvious texture differences. (But this issue doesn't really bug me too much since I've played Xenoblade Chronicles with the HD Retexture earlier, which causes the early stages of the game to look really good, but everything reverts to the original texture quality because the mod was unfinished. Anyway, I didn't expect it to look super awesome, which apparently many people who bought it was expecting, for some reason.) 3. The game locks at 30fps. (Which is to say, reaaaally not a problem for me at all, as long as it runs at constant 30, which it does. I never really understood the necessity for 60fps. FYI, I can see the difference, just not something worth fussing about for me. If the game's good, I don't care.) 4. Keyboard controls and the inability to rebind keys. (That was the reason why I bought a new controller in the first place. I would however, agree that this issue is probably the most noteworthy to complain about considering it's supposedly a PC game.)  In my 3 hours + experience with the game, I can honestly say that I like it, for now. The combat takes some getting used to but I really like the combat. I kept experimenting with different characters to see which one I like more than the other, and honestly I still don't have 3 favorite characters yet. I have little to no problems except for the hiccup during the first start of the game and that to me, is good enough. I'm really looking forward to continuing the game tonight after my work, honestly. I WANT to be invested.",

Worst of all, there is no rebinding keys, just two control-schemes with minimal difference between them.  Now, onto the game itself -  Decent Action-RPG built off of FF7 Crisis Core, with a touch of Monster Hunter. 14 playable characters with different abilities that need to be used in their own ways. There's a world-map with places to explore, for the first time in an FF game since the PS1 FF games.  Prepare to die a lot, it's somewhat difficulty, especially since your party members have barely any health. Running is advised if enemies 5+ levels higher are encountered.

Pros:  -Interesting plot devices (when people die all memories of that person are lost) -Cool character design  -fun kingdom hearts-esque gameplay -A good conclusion  Cons: -Wayy too close camera angle makes things hard to see and some attacks hard to dodge -The characters feel like really unlikeable anime characters up till about the end only in the last few scenes did I feel any connection -the plots a mess I'm still not really sure what happened there was a war but after that it spun out of control leaving me confused and not in a good way -obnoxious side quests that don't give you enough information and can take an exhorbinant amount of time while being tedious  Nuetral:  -voice actors are give or take kindof like meh anime dubs -Graphics didnt bother me personally but theres is a jarring mix of certain characters being well textured while area's and npcs closer to the psp graphics -30 frames cap (again didnt bother me but some people are picky) -weird tactical strategy parts that   In the end I didn't feel dissapointed with this game as a purchase. I had some fun and some frustration due to controls and obnoxious characters, but in general it was a positive experience. not sure I'd reccomend it to anyone unless they're diehard final fantasy fans and go in expecting a meh port for a decently enjoyable game.

            "review_text": "Played through the game three times now, and I think I have experienced about every single big event. The game isn't completed in one playthrough. I had major problems running this game in the beginning, but it was all solved by turning the graphics down to minimum. Good game, but bad PC version. If you don't mind graphics and just want some good story and real time battling, I would recommend buying this. The story is what really 'put me in motion' (the biggest fans will get this pun*). The story is about a war, a very terrible war, where one country attacks one other and disabled their primary weapon - magic. Without magic, the attacked country can't defend, and is quickly overrun. The entire country falls, except for the capital, Akademeia, which barely holds out until a special unit of soldiers arrive: The Agito Cadet's Class Zero - You. The story is accompagnied with some epic music by Takaharu Ishimoto, and if you translate the Latin-sang lyrics you'll see the lyrics tie into the story of the game very good. The final boss theme 'Vermilion Fire' is by far my favorite boss track, counting all kind of video games. However, the game is not flawless. Other than the huge graphics issue I mentioned earlier, the game is just plainly impossible. On higher difficulties in late game you're put against enemies that kills you in one hit, no matter how strong or fast you might be. On easier difficulties the game should be no big deal, even though most enemies can kill you in five hits or so. In the game you're put into the shoes of fourteen playable cadets: Ace, Deuce, Trey, Cater, Cinque, Sice, Seven, Eight, Nine, Jack, Queen, King, Machina and Rem. All playable characters have unique attacks and abilities. Also, they all carry their own signature weapon, and even though you can change what weapon you use for each cadet, this will not change the weapon type nor the controls. The cadets carry: A deck of cards, a magic flute, bow and arrow, pistol, mace, scythe, whip, fists, spear, katana, longsword, dual revolvers, dual rapiers and dual blades. You'll have to pick a few favorites. Every character have their own personality and set of habits, for example Sice's pessimism and Jack's ignorance and optimism, Eight remaining calm at all times and King resolving quarrels. My personal favorite is Eight. Yeah, this is my first review, so I'm not good at this stuff. I think I'll just write 'Recommended for people who love story and fast paced gameplay.'  *Pun explanation: The game revolves around 'Agito'; which is Latin for 'I put in motion'.",

            "review_text": "I came into Type-0 HD very sceptical. It's not often you see a game make a platform jump as huge as from PSP to firstly current generation consoles and then PC. Reviews of the PS4 and XBO versions were mostly positive, but with some reservations about the control system and the level of motion blur - both things which had been addressed by the time the PC version came to release.  For what is essentially a lightly updated PSP game, Type-0 has moments where it looks just as good as, say, a modern indie game. The character models of Class Zero have recieved the most attention during the update, having been completely remade, and they really do look just as good as any of the character models from any other recent Final Fantasy games, such as the XIII series. Everyone else, and everything else for that matter, has recieved nothing more than light texture updates, and as such can look incredibly dated or out of place when next to one of the newer models.   The storytelling in this game could have been much better. The story itself is fine, suitably convoluted in keeping with the rest of the Fabula Nova Crystallis, however it feels as though 90% of it arrives in the last chapter of the game (of which there are 8). I think this could have been spread out a bit better, which would have made the middle chapters a bit more engaging.  Tetusya Nomura has done, as usual, a fantastic job with the design in Type-0. Each member of Class Zero is identifiably unique despite sharing the same basic uniform, and each has a different set of weapons ranging from anything from a flute or deck of cards (how you hurt people with these, I dont know) to a scythe. The world is dark and gritty, which perfectly matches the more serious nature of this game compared to others in the Final Fantasy series. To clarify that, Type-0 is the first Final Fantasy to feature gruesome, bloody deaths. It's just a shame the English voiceovers aren't as good as the visual design. They are terrible, probably among the worst I've heard. It's too bad, because the English dub is really the only major complaint I have with this game.  When it comes to the control system, everything is fine. It's not great, just... fine. The camera can go a bit crazy sometimes during combat due to the lock-on system, but other than that, the improvements implimented on the PC version have mostly resolved any issues brought up previously. One comment I would make about combat is that it could do with a better way of switching between targeted enemies, the current system just feels like pot luck. Considering the action-oriented combat system, the game dosn't suffer badly at all from being locked at 30FPS, despite what some vocal members of the community will say. This framerate lock is inherent of the game engine, so unfortunately a workaround for higher framerates is unlikely, if not impossible.  The music in Type-0 is one of it's best features. It has a great orchestral main theme which can get stuck in your head for hours, and most town/battle/dungeon pieces are similarly catchy and enjoyable. There were only one or two occaisions where I thought the music got a little bit dull and lifeless, where it could have been improved.  Overall, I would recommend Type-0 to any fan of the Final Fantasy series, as long as they are well aware before diving in that this is a PSP remake and should set their expectations as such. With that in mind, I'm sure they'll be as impressed as I have been and will agree that Square Enix have done an incredible job in branching a game in the Final Fantasy series in a different, and intriguing direction.",
