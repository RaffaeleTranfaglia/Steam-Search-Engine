            "review_text": "Im on the back foot... Enemy infantry made it past my front line, a situation that comprimises my whole team, I purchase and sent out a Half-Track with mounted .50 caliber heavy machine gun to clear them up.. however on the way an the debries from a building hit by artilery hits happens to hit and take out the gunner.. Time for a bit of fast micro.. Upon reaching the area the enemy was last spotted there is no sign of them, they have likely scattered into various cover (all units in a squad can be indivudually controlled in fine detail or directly controlled) .. I spot an enemy half track! The hole in my front line is bigger than I thought.  I decide to play rambo with my driver, I dismount, detatch the .50 cal gun from it with my driver and take some TNT from the back. I command my soldier to only return fire preventing him from opening fire and giving away his location, I tell him to get down on the ground and crawl to a nearby bush. I know my empty half track presents an irristable target for the enemy to steal... the bait and trap set, I switch my attention to re-enforcing my front lines, perhaps a sniper to spot and an AT-gun patch up the line, cant afford more infantry yet, I spread my lines a little thinner. I spot the red dots in my backline on my mini map, lucky I caught it! Switching back to Rambo in time to see the enemy attempt to jack my halftrack. I put him in direct contrtol more, and take my time aiming a perfect shot at the enemy half track approaching, some men already disembarking and running for my bait.. FIRE.. ♥♥♥♥ I mis-judged the distance! He's far enough away that my trusty .50 Cal cannot penetrate his armour, backup plan, I aim for his tracks as he turns to escape.. come on.. yes! I manage to break the track off the left side, disabling his movement. A man hops out to begin repairs... I put a .50 Cal in his skull.. he won't try that again. I mow down enemy infantry spotted until I've run out of bullets. I switch to my pistol, move into an impact crator recently created, there I hide hoping to find an oppertunity to use the TNT to maximise damage. Rambo has played his part... but all the while I have been equally creative with any of the hundred odd units on the field....",

            "review_text": "Men of War has always been 'the game' if you want a somewhat realistic WW2 RTS.  Its a tough game. You will lose many battles before you get the hang of it and even after a few years of playing you will find players who kick your ♥♥♥ in a heartbeat.  MoW is not just about how fast you can click, its about understanding the terrain, the units and their features. A cheap unit can cause absolut mayhem and an expensive unit might get destroyed before it reaches the frontline.  Luck is as important as it is in real-life and imho (if you can handle frustration) thats why this game is still fun after hundreds of hours of playing.   ",

            "review_text": "This is a strategy/tatical game. I have always been sceptic to it. Probably because I never gave it a real shot.  It can't be compared to Company of Heroes and shouldn't be.   The game has a very realisitic damage table which means that an infantary dies just after 1-3 hits.  Facing a tank can be a deadly outcome which can whipe a squad within seconds.  I strongly recommend that you start off by playing the easy campaign to learn the basic and still be able to enjoy the game.  + Realistic damage  + Slower, tatical warfare  + Real WW2 weapons and vehicles.  + Control units (WASD+Mouse) or run, walk, phrone, suppressing fire etc.   - The missions are quite fun but they don't give you many units to play around with. The Germans doesn't have air support (famous stuka?) or any of their famous arty guns.  - Missions are too similar. No big change in layout - AI are really buggy and stupid. You tell a vehicle to drive from A to B and it get stuck half way.  - The resupply system could have done automatic. I'm talking about letting a soilder go back and forth to resupply an artiliitery for e.g. This is something you need to do manually and having 2-3 arty's takes time to do. I don't mind that it takes time but you leave the whole battlefield open because you are busy to resupply guns.  - Multiplayer could have been so much better developed.   Overall I think this game lack of hungry developers. It seems lke they are happy about how the game runs or not runs.  IMO if they actually spent money and time to come up with a new fresh multiplayer, fix the AI's. a better hotkey system (QWERTY) this game can easily be a top strat game.  At current state 7/10 because it cost less then a dollar.",

The story isn't bad either, infact it is quite fun, The Weapons, Tanks and Names are Historicly Accurate, if and it's Strategic system are different than any games, Men of War brings a new Experience, And once the player is used to it, The game it self would be easier than before, For the WWII Tanks fans like me, Go and buy this game, I promise you the Tank system isn't dissapointing, and it's Realistic in penetrations, parts and everything. Get the game and you'l see the Lovely contetns and gameplays.  Have fun playing it~  ",

            "review_text": "Men of War: Assault Squad is a real-time strategy from Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company. Men of War: Assault Squad is considered a sequel to the previous game Men of War.  Men of War: Assault Squad retain the same element of gameplay from Men of War, which is micromanagement. But unlike the first Men of War, Men of War: Assault Squad offers a skirmish based mission rather than a story based campaign. This skirmish game is a capture the flag type game which you need to capture all the enemy flag position to win the game. New units and weapons has been added, and for the first time in Men of War series, Japanese faction has been fully added to the game with voice acting, vehicles and weapons of their own. The game also comes with an editor in which you can make your own skirmish based mission or make your new story based mission.  Graphics of Men of War: Assault Squad has been improved. Explosion effects, sounds, weapons tracer, even the vehicles and weapons model are all improved. As the game being patched, new weapons and new vehicles are being added to the game. The game still runs pretty smooth with all these upgraded graphics. And Men of War series is the only game where you can hear an American soldier saying 'for the Motherland'.  The multiplayer were a good part of the game, there are many game modes to choose from capture the flag, frontline attack and defense even the skirmish cooperative mode. But all of the multiplayer feature has been disabled since GameSpy has been shutdown.  Men of War: Assault Squad is yet to be the best of Men of War series. Many features and addition makes the game more rich with content to play with in the editor. I recommend this.  Rating 8/10",

Each soldier has an inventory and skill level with weapons, tanks need to be crewed by multiple soldiers, etc. Additionally, each unit can be 'direct controlled', in an almost arcade like fashion. Success involves the use of real world tactics such as effective use of terrain, cover, suppressive fire, line of sight, correct deployment of troops, and basics of understanding the ballistic effectiveness of armor and anti-armor units in various scenarios. The game really shines in co-op and supports as many as eight players cooperating against a devastatingly effective AI. If you ever pick it up, look me up for a game!",

The game has amazing vehical and infantry combat, awesome graphics and a massive varity of units, vehicals, and weapons. The game is pretty realstic and has a lot of depth to it. Yeah, the voice acting is a little 'meh' but it doesn't take away from the amazing experiance the game offers. You can double or even triple your amount of fun with mods for example, the Fields of Honor, Star Gate, World War 1, and Cold War mods. If you like real time strategy or real time tatics games this is good choice. If your like World War 2 strategy games this is a good choice. If you are bored of all your current strategy games and are looking for a new one, this is a good game to try out.   *EDIT* MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: Recently Men of War Assault Squad 1's multiplayer has been shut down due to Gamespy closeing. Instead of switiching providers like other games did (for example Arma 2) the owner of the Men of War franchise decided to only switch Men of War Assault Squad 2's multiplayer provider. Thus, forceing fans to buy Men of War Assault Squad 2, which is a horrible game. So the only way to play multiplayer on Men of War Assault Squad 1 now is to use Gameranger. It is still a great game but without knowing how to use gameranger and haveing some friends, it looses what makes it so unique. And, since Men of War Assault Squad 2 is litteraly, a piece of crap cranked to keep up with Company of Heroes, Men of War's rival. All in all, MOWAS 1 is a solid good game but has no multiplayer.",

Also, there is tons of mods available for this game that add plenty of new units and options. Another great touch is this game includes a built in editor that allows you to build custom maps and battles. All in all, MOW is a hidden gem among RTS games and is a great for those interested in WW2.  If you are a fan of RTS games, you can't go wrong with Men of War Assault Squad!",

I recommend you play it with a friend or somebody who can guide you through the initial stage. You wil get sweared upon for being a 'noob', you will get kicked, thrashed and sometimes utterly crushed. The only way to overcome this is by learning the game and outplaying your opponents.  Most of the community is rather unfriendly towards newcomers, therefore you should stick together with a friend. Even though and older release, you can get a game going fairly easily.

            "review_text": "Great game, but definitely not for competitive players. By that I mean if you're like me and you hate losing, you should look elsewhere for your wargaming. The AI is apparently managed by The Amazing Kreskin because they know exactly where you are at all times and exactly which units you have. If you make a move, they react immediately and without hesitation. This usually ends with a total failure in 90% of your missions. You will be restarting over and over for hours on end. Oh did I mention this is on Normal difficulty? I'm not sure why they would even include the Hard or Heroic difficulties because I can't imagine it being remotely fun. As far as I know, on Heroic the enemy would have pocket nuclear bombs, laser guided missiles and stealth bombers. During WWII.   There are certain missions where you will literally gasp at how completely you get beaten by the AI. There is no time to dig in because the longer you wait, the more tanks they bring out. I have never seen the AI run out of tanks either. On the campaign mission 'Overlord' for example I had 33 enemy tanks and tank destroyers on the map. Yes, 33 of them - I counted because I didn't think it possible. Granted they didn't get 33 out at once, but they had that many in reserve and until the very end of the mission they kept rolling them out two at a time, every few minutes. You will have enough Reinforcement Points for at most 10 tanks/tank destroyers, and that is only if you last long enough.   The real kicker is when you complete around 80% of your mission objectives the AI will throw everything they have at you, and each soldier is a military genius. Seriously, any AI grunt unit in this game would make Erwin Rommel look like a mental midget. Not to mention It takes just one single grunt to run up to your capture point and the game is over, mission failed. There is no 'turnaround time' or anything. You either have the capture point or you don't. There is a 'flag raising' animation when you capture or lose a point, but it's just for show and is not a timer - If the flag begins to move, it's over for either you or the enemy (99% of the time it's you).",

            "review_text": "Clunky, budgeted, and sometimes brutally unfair thanks to luck alone, Men of War: Assault Squad is still a rock-solid title with its own unique attributes that set it apart from Company of Heroes and other WW2 RTS titles.  What Men of War does best is its keen focus on mimicking the reality of war. There is no such thing as a bottomless magazine, an unlimited fuel tank, or a tank with more rounds than potential targets. There is no be-all, end-all weapon to any situation and every engagement demands its own proportionate response. Wasting troops, ammunition, or even just the fuel in a vehicle can cripple that unit in engagements to come or complicate matters beyond reason.  Did you use up all the high-explosive shells in a tank and now have to face off against dug-in infantry? Good luck trying to snipe them with armor-piercing rounds. Did you fire off all your mortars in a team and now have to destroy an anti-tank gun or lose one of your expensive armored vehicles? Have fun waiting for a new mortar team or supply truck while your tank takes fire it can't respond to.  Range, lethality, and mobility all play crucial roles; tanks can fire far and wide across the map and receive attacks from field guns at even further distances. Vehicles can and will be destroyed in a single shot from a position far across the map or left crippled and useless by a strike to their treads, turret, or main gun. Critical anti-tank infantry or machine gunners can be shot out from under you by snipers, artillery, or even just an unlucky ricochet off of a tank's armor, all happening in the blink of an eye.  Even as brutal as Men of War can be, there are often moments of forgiveness to take advantage of. Vehicles left unuseable are usually left abandoned in a state that can be salvaged. Though time-expensive, all infantry can repair a badly crippled, seemingly useless heavy tank back into fighting condition and crew it. A single rifleman with luck and determination can be used to repair and steal a damaged enemy tank right out from under their noses and bring it back to base to be fully crewed and put back to work. Most infantry fall injured rather than killed outright and swift management of a combat medic can bring decimated squads back into the fight with minimal losses. Valuable weapons can be scavenged, stolen, and re-supplied in the heat of battle by any unit, allowing a dismounted tank crew to become a formidable close quarters assault team when the right tools are left to take.  A solid foundation of realism and hard-hitting micromanagement make Men of War a game worth playing, but it can often be questionable in its aesthetics department. Sometimes bizarre, universally short unit responses, average or above-average quality music with little dynamic manipulation, and a sound system that leaves much to be desired, even as much as the sounds themselves are of good quality, all contribute to an uneven audio experience. Animations that can range from goofy to floaty to eye-catchingly strange hold down its otherwise surprisingly good model quality.  Overall, from my short experience in the game, Men of War is a series I wish I had gotten into sooner. Its short list of failings hardly dent what is, in the end, a game well worth its price tag. As a warning to all who consider purchasing it, I would like to note that, with GameSpy down, multiplayer may be difficult to get into or even impossible for those with problematic connections; services like GameRanger are required to do more than singleplayer, as my own experience tells me.",

Every time one of my howitzer rounds lands on a large group of infantry I feel a rush of satisfaction. If you are a fan of large scale rts games, especially realistic ones, and if you like micro management this is a game for you. I personally have an obsession with WW2 and have always wanted a game where I could command large groups of soldiers and tanks on the battlefield. And I have finally found it. I recommend this to any stratedgy lover with every fiber of my being.   Just a little tip to anyone newer to the game, if you are having trouble figuring out how to play this game effectively, I recommend either reading up on the different unit stats, or just looking up some basic military stratedgies because this game is very reliant on historical accuracy of the different weapons and vehicles used in WW2. Every unit in this game has specific uses so if you don't understand how to use each of them proplerly you aren't going to last long whether it be against the AI in skirmish mode or real players in MP. Speaking of multiplayer, be sure to download gameranger or a similar client available, as GameSpy(the original multiplayer server host) is no longer in use.  I hope this was helpful :D",

'nuf said -Better AI than most modern AAA titles -Very well balanced -Long campaign, due to some battles taking a few hours to do, as the AI, though not UBERHAXRNOVA, WILL punish you for leaving a gap in defences, and will counter your units very nicely. -Good learning curve -Outstanding graphics for a game of it's time, much better than other RTS titles released later  -Very good economy system -Rarely overwhelming, the Minimap helps alot too, as it let's you plan ahead in the battle, and stay up-to-date on enemy Movements -Destructible cover, buildings, etc... -Murphy's Laws occur on anything and everything mechanical. Seriously. -Vehicles can be repaired after taking damage, but don't expect to have a quick repair, at least not after any kind of serious damage. -Vehicles can run out of fuel, adding a huge tactical element (Dang it Germany, Y U NO USE JAPANESE CARS!? ) -Well populated map with lots of nooks and crannies to explore and setup mortars and other Defences -Awesomely huge fighting when it turns into an infantry-based battle, with ALOT going on. -Real sense of accomplishment when you complete a long, intense, battle against all odds -Runs on Windows 8/8.1 without any issues -Great ingame music -Very well optimized, even for lower-end, aging machines  Cons: -A battle on harder difficulties can last 4-5 hours towards the end of the game, so this can go either way -Can get campy-ish towards the end of a mission, due to the AT guns and the trenches,etc..",

Units are also individuel, they can be selected by themselves and controlled directly like playing a 3rd person shooter if desirable. that goes for vehicles as well. Planes are almost non exsistent in what I have played. Can't speak for Multiplayer, which was I believe it's main focus on release.  I've heard a lot of negative from this franchise, except this one. I do like booting this up every now and again to replay the skirmish scenarios. I could never get Multiplayer working properly sadly, it always says my CD key is in use.",

Right up front, this game establishes itself as a hybrid RTS/Third Person Shooter allowing players to take control of individual units - tons of fun.  This game utterly fails in that it forces players to micromanage their units constantly. Individual Soldiers will often get weapons shot out of their hand, and will not automatically pick up a new weapon. Players must constantly manage resources as well (fuel, ammunition). Vehicles have insanely unrealistic fuel consumption rates which forces players to scavenge fuel from 'dead' vehicles.   I think I understand where MoW was trying to go, but I feel that the micromanagement piece just takes too much away from the fact that this is a combat strategy game. Combat should be the focus not exorbant micromanagement of all of my units.",

If you enjoy a game that has an AI that makes any sense and difficultlies that are not punningshing to your ability to overcome obsticules than this game is not for you.  Examples:  1. As a seasoned RTS gamer I figured that stating on Normal Difficulty I would have a bit of a challenge and be able to learn the ins and outs of the game, I found that most of my time was spent creating new units to replace the old ones that had been destroyed by enemy forces. Now this isn't uncommon but when this happens after every advance i made into enemy terretory it creates for a very slow game play.  2. After managing to gain a foot hold on enemy ground, I was counter by an anti infantry vehicle, the WWII version of a BTR. This unit absolutly wrecked my units, so I sent in a tank to deal with it while my infantry cowered behind cover. Once I got the tank in a made quick work of it, but then meir seconds later a enemy rock hits my tank and destroys it. This is common on how the games AI seems to work, after I spend my very limited resorces to deal with an obsticle the enemy seems to just get luck and destroy my now big advantage.  3. So after all this I decieded to turn the difficulty down and try again on these leves, all this did was increase the time it took for the enemy to react to my decision. Resorces, starting units, unit intellegence, and difficulty was still the same.  A good AI would be adaptive, responding to what I do and most inportantly not god like. I shouldn't be punished everytime I advance and overcome obsticules, especially when I have limited resorces to use.  All in all I found this game to be unfun because of these points.",
