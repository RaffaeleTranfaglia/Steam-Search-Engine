            "review_text": "Before reading please note,  THIS REVIEW IS OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME . Now that that's out of the way...  Okay, here's the deal. I love Spore. Like, a LOT. So, when it went on sale a while back, I decided to re-buy it (I owned the disc version, but lost the code, so I basically didn't own it). DLC was only like, $5, and I played Galactic Adventures (I loved it, but that's a review for ANOTHER day). Honestly, it was hardly worth the $5.  So if you don't know, the Creepy &amp; Cute pack adds some new creature parts and patterns, but that's it. The arms and legs are literally all bug parts, so nothing I want to use there, some cool new other bits, though. For patterns, some feel 'Creepy' like one pattern that looks kind of like muscles, and not so much cute (though it does add a feather pattern, sort of, which is awesome because I love building birds in this game). It doesn't really add too many parts, and quite a few of them feel like they should be part of the game already.  The other problem is that it only adds CREATURE parts. No new clothes, no building, no new anything. Also, the new animations are only in the test drive mode. They're cool to watch, but would be even cooler to see in game. Oh, and another thing that bothers me (But isn't a deal breaker by any means) is the fact that because of how the expansions worked pre-steam, Steam tracks my hours while playing Creepy &amp; Cute, but not the actual game, which means I have to play without my extra parts if I want steam trading cards.  Overall, don't waste $20 on this expansion. If you have $20 burning a hole in your wallet, and you already own Spore, try out Galactic Adventures. It's pretty awesome, if I do say so myself (owned the Expansion for Disc, so yeah. I plan on getting it on a sale or something).  TL;DR: Doesn't really add a whole lot. Not worth $20, though might be worth it if it's on sale.  Don't forget,  THIS IS REVIEW OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME.  I love Spore, man!   EDIT: Changed emphasis from 'only' to 'creatures' from 'only adds CREATURE parts.'  ",

I love what Spore did, they made a game that is perfect for me.  For you Russian Spore players:  Этот пакет делает игру по крайней мере на 20% лучше, он Justs добавляет 60 существ частей и 48 Краски, но это сделать огромное влияние на игру, что означает еще больше существ, чтобы сделать, и хорошая вещь об этих DLC является то, что они суммируется с другими DLC походит на Galactic Adventures с милой и Жуткие части упаковки. Я люблю то, что сделал Спора, они сделали игру, которая идеально подходит для меня.",

I did not like Galactic Adventures because of the way it was pasted over the original and did not seem to be the same game. This is the best version as it allows many more creative variation for those who crave that and at the same time does not affect the original feel of the game, and its immerion, in fact this improves it.",

For example, when you try to share anything with a CaC part attatched to it, it will  not  work, but its really just a random chance weather your going to get it to work or not.  Really the only purpose for this DLC is for looking at other peoples creations with this...  So remember that, it only worked for me 1/3 of the time",

Not having this problem with my other games. The other isssue is that I can't seem to register the game. Otherwise, this game and the cute and creepy pack are addictive, and I'd love to see a Spore made with more high-end graphics. Four-n-half stars out-of-five, and the only reason for the half-point off is because of the crashing issue.",

I wish that the expansion had added outfit/building/vehicle options for the last 3 stages.",
