Just keeps on going no need to charge after just one pallet will even go up ramps without a push. If your work place has a crappy fork and you want to try out a better one then this is the game for you. Even Craigo would love to try a fork like this and might even smile about it. If your too old to get a fork job and have a licence like old Brucey boy play this and get the ilusion that you got a real job just without pay.",
