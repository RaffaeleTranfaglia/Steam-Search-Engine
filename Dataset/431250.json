            "review_text": "This game was one of my favorite indie games on the PS3. I must have sunk tens or even hundreds of hours into it. A silly little indie game that is just totally addictive. To be honest I find it difficult to be objective on a game that captured my attention for as long and is as beloved as this title is. When Zillion Whales approached me to see whether or not I was interested in featuring their game on Steamified I was taken aback and had to ask if it was the very same game or whether they had come along and made a completely new game and given it that name. I don’t expect to see such old casual indie games ported to PC but here it is and here I am digging it and getting the feels.  The best way to sum up the game is that it is one game that is especially easy to learn how to play but good luck mastering it. If you enjoy the game it is one that will capture your attention through to completion in the single player campaign. It makes the game highly accessible to almost every gamer, is much deeper strategically than what it may appear at first and has tremendous replayability. It’s a great game and I believe that the original has been improved upon for its PC release – from what I have played.  As an aside, I haven’t played the Steam multiplayer but it is one mode that I am most looking forward to. If anyone wants to play a few rounds please let me know and we’ll get to it.

            "review_text": "This one is of those titles it's hard for me to know where to begin. I've played through the game several times over the years and it really is one of my all time favorite games. Originally I had it on PS3 and it was by far my favorite title there. Why do I enjoy this game so much?  It's a real simple game about using troops efficiently by either defending structures or attacking unguarded ones. The best weapon at your disposal is the element of surprise and a lot of patience. If you rush into a building odds are that the enemy will guard it with ease. Sadly the pvp seems to be pretty much dead at this point but for the price you still get a terrific campain with diverse missions and when you're done with that there is a reasonable amount of skirmish maps.  On this account I have beaten the campain on hard once and all the skirmish maps and I'm in for a good 10 hours. It took me way longer to beat it when I was new to the game though so you can count on being entertained for quite some time after that.   The visuals are amazing, the gameplay is fun and fastpaced and the soundtrack gets stuck in my head in a good way. This title represents why I love games.",
