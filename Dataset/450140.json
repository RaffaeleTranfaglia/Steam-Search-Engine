            "review_text": "I have been a lover of strategy games since I was very young man in the mid 90's and have played all the greats and a lot of the lesser known. I don't know what inspired me to grab Seven Kingdoms off the store shelf in 1998 but I still consider this game one of the best I've ever played and feel sorry for all the other strategy gamers who have probably never heard of it. Imagine the depth of empire building Civilization offers mixed with the fun battles of RTS titles like Age of Empires. out of all the strategy games I have played there hasn't been another game that made me feel more like I was actually ruling a country like this game does and that has been the reason I have played it regularly for so many years. Hell it's so good I bought it off steam even though I've always owned a physical and digital copy. You can win at this game in so many different ways depending on what you devote your focus to espionage, economy, diplomacy, pure muscle, technology just to name a few. Feel lucky you stumbled across this game on steam because this game isn't main stream but damn sure deserves to be.  Seven Kingdoms can be tremendously fun to play with friends and one of the most successful ways to do that with such an aged game is through game ranger but there are other methods out there. You may have to do some googling to get the multi-player going but is very much worth the effort if you happened to know someone else who knows how to play it or is willing to learn.  It really holds up to the test of time because there still hasn't been another game just like it made yet sadly. The only negative thing I can say about the game is that there is so much depth it has quite the learning curve but couldn't be more worth it so don't give up on it. Hell I still feel like I'm learning things about this game after so many years of playing it. Luckily my physical copy came with a manual to help me along when I was just started playing and I recommend keeping your PDF copy handy.  just a side note if the game starts up all rainbow colored open up your screen resolution window and leave it open in the background and reboot the game. it should cure the issue (I'm using windows 7). My buddy who is running windows 10 didn't need to do this on his machine.",
