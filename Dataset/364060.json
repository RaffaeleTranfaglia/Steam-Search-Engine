About game itself it can be fun for a moment if you have equal chances - more pad no keyboard for one player. Graphic is ok but nothing special and there is a very little content, in 15-20min you will see most of it, there are some unlocks, new layouts, skins and concept but unfortunately doesn't add much to the game",
