            "review_text": "A quick review:  I'm enjoying this so far.   The controll with a game pad (X360 pad) is pretty good. Nice assortment of powerups. The explosions are big and bombastic. Most importantly the game is pretty fun.  Leaderboards aren't working yet, but I'm told that should be fixed in a upcoming update in the near future.  Even without it, its a fun game and well worth your ten dollars especially considering its cheaper then a number of worse shoot-em-ups that are more expensive).",

            "review_text": "This game is simply flat out fun. The gameplay is spot on and the difficulty increases as you progress, which makes me want to press on. I like the old school feel, with the gorgeous, sophisticated graphics. The music is good, and love when it rocks out for the boss at the end of a level. If you want a shooter that has challenging gameplay, awesome graphics, and great music then get this game!",

            "review_text": "Overall recommended but overpriced - this needs to be $5 tops, i think now it's more than that? Seriously, you can get very similar games on your smartphone for free. The Xbox controller works fine in game, but not for menus, there's some nice voice acting from one bored-sounding, but pleasant dude (your commander, apparently), and mechanically there's nothing wrong with Bladestar. Just quite low production values and the gameplay is typical vertical scrolling shoot em up. Like another reviewer said this is purely an 'if you're in the mood for genre X' type of title.   5/10",
