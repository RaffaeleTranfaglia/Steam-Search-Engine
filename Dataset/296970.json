            "review_text": "Update: 600 hours in, I stand by this review. There's been quite a few improvements to RE:IS since I wrote this, I really recommend both this game and its DLC. ------------------- When I first heard of Renowned Explorers : International Society (henceforce known as RE:IS) my initial reaction was along the lines of 'what on earth is this?'. I purchased it on a whim, and having now played it for nearly 100 hours and all treasures collected, it has definitely turned out to be one of my wisest purchases (and heck, i'm actually writing a proper review for once, my first one on steam.)  RE:IS is a roguelike in an Indiana Jones style - you and your crew will be having adventures all around the globe, from searching castles in the Scottish highlands to the tombs of ancient pharoahs in Egypt in the hopes of finding treasures (and with over 100 treasures to find, there is plenty to see.) You'll run into a variety of characters such as bagpipe playing clansmen, pirates suffering under a voodoo curse and a group of monkeys worshipping a giant fruit.  The game keeps a fairly lighthearted and humourous theme throughout, which is aided by its bright and colourful art style. Don't let this fool you however - there is a surprising amount of depth to be found in the games combat and exploration systems. Battles have three different approaches: you can befriend your enemy, offering them things such as compliments and peace treatires. Or you can take a straight up physical approach - hacking and slashing your way through hordes of your opponents. If you prefer a more devious approach, you can play mind games with your opponents, hurling insults towards them in such number that they run away from the battlefield sobbing.  Overall, RE:IS takes a refreshing approach to the turn-based rogue-like genre. The developers are very active within the community and listen to feedback and suggestions from players. The game is frequently updated with new content, and more has been promised down the line. I highly recommend purchasing this game.",

Could do with some more randomization or better yet more content. An extra handful of expeditions would be a welcome addition.  Pros: -Upbeat, lighthearted tone. -Reminiscent of several fun cooperative board games I've played. -Good campaign length. Not too long nor too short. -Good variety between characters. -Nice balance of intuitiveness for ease of play and complexity for challenge.  Cons: -Loses replayibility in the long term.",

This is one of the best game you'll find out there : many ways to play, rogue-like/rpg elements, Indiana Jones atmosphere and many archeology/ crypto-archeology themes. So many things to do and to discover ! Not two playthroughts are the same, and the events are really fun. The combats are GREAT and possess a very unique gameplay (attacks can altere the mood of your crew/opponents, and damages can be as much physical than psychological, as you can play from a 'friendly' crew which will be friends with vampires to cruel one killing sheeps).  If you love that kind of game, you will love it. There is many difficulties and the game is really challenging. There is a free DLC coming this month. The admins are nice and listening to the players...  What do you want more ? :o",

Part boardgame, part party management RPG, part tactical strategy, part (optional) roguelike, and all of these elements (which mesh extremely well) wrapped in a charming and effective artstyle with clever writing. Your combat and adventure approaches will be dictated by your party makeup, which is chosen prior to the start of the game from a variety of options. Depending on the skills of each, your approach will differ each game, making for a highly replayable game. Want to seduce every enemy that comes your way instead of shooting/ clubbing them? There are options for that. This game also has a large and diverse set of achievements, which I personally like.  I also recommend the expansion, but if you want to test the base game first you can always add it for an additional playthrough (which you will want to have several of just to see the additional content.) This one is worth taking a risk on, even at full price.",

            "review_text": "ATTENTION: This review has been written for the game together with its expansion - More To Explore.  Renowned Explorers is proof that looks can be deceiving. At first glance, this is a cute but simple tactics game about launching expeditions, hunting for treasure and exploring the world. This was my initial impression. However, as soon as I hit the start button, I began to notice, that the game has way more depth than I thought. Decisions in Renowned Explorers require quite a lot of thinking through or you might end up losing horribly. Think Darkest Dungeons levels of complexity. The basic premise of the game is that you pick up three characters out of a pool of 20, with one being team captain. Each character has a set of skills, perks, hidden traits and captain bonuses. Your goal is to become the world's most Renowned Explorers (d'oh!). You do that by launching expeditions (5 per game), which give you artifacts, status, gold, research and - most importatnly - renown, of which more than 2500 is needed to win the game. After each expedition, the player has a chance to spend the resources aquired to improve the party. Do it wisely - spending resources haphazardly almost always ends in utter failure. And you will fail. At the start of the game, you get 2 points of Resolve. Lose them all and it is game over.  The Good: + Adorable graphics. Each character is distinct and easily recognisable. Animations for every character do a lot to show off that character's personality. + Interesting combat system based on attitudes. There are three: aggressive, friendly and devious, and they work similarly to rock - paper - scissors (aggressive beats friendly beats devious beats aggressive). Switching between attitudes at just the right moment is key to survival and may net you different rewards depending on which of the attitudes is dominant. + Sense of humor. The whole game is tongue in cheek. Many dialogues are genuinely funny, over the top or absurd. Enemies are amusing - from sheep, through posh Brits to easily scared vampires. Plus, some of the things the player can do are simply hilarious. At one point I was able to body slam a T-Rex. A bloody T-Rex. + Lots of depth and replayability. Due to the complexity of the various systems and stark differences in playstyles, the game can be played many times over without the risk of getting bored. + Surprises at every corner. I have finished this game more than 10 times and I still discover new events, character interactions and hilarious encounter results. + Difficulty level variety. The game has 4 difficulty levels and two modes - one of which involves permadeath. So, if you are not a fan of dying and losing all of your progress, you can go with adventure mode, with save games.  The Mediocre: ~ The number of possible expedition locations is limited. Even with all the DLC, there are only 13 of them. Seems like a lot, but after a few games you will learn them all by heart. Still, the differences between expeditions are huge, and each of them has a couple of hidden surprises, so i can't complain much. ~ The tutorials could use some work. I feel that the tokens expecially aren't explained all that well. Keep in mind though that this is really a game you learn more as you play than from reading any tutorial. ~ Even though characters are distinct, their attack skills aren't. Many characters have the same combat skills, though with different animations.  The Bad: - Lots of graphical glitches. They are not gamebraking in any way, yet annoying still.",

            "review_text": "Renowned Explorers: International Society (RE:IS) is a nice mix of FTL-style exploration and classic hex-field turn-based strategy (such as Heroes of Might and Magic). The game really shines as a complex system of resources and synergies; it's a lot of fun to try out different ways of generating the ultimate ressource in the game - renown. Another element standing out is the combat mood system. Based on your actions and your opponents' actions, the encounters have a different mood, which gives your units certain buffs and debuffs. This really encourages you to use all abilities of your explorers, rather than just using the 'strongest' or 'juicest' (which you can also do and is a challenge of its own). I think in this sense, RE:IS is a great developmental step from REUS, the studio's previous game. REUS had bautiful synergistic mechanics, but the game played more like a simulation. In RE:IS, the devs managed to forge the synergies into a great interdependent game system that is very enjoyable and rewarding - especially if you're into building systems/resource engines.  In general, I think that the game is also a bit too short (many others have mentioned that as well). You're done after a handful of explorations; to compare it with a card game: it feels a bit like playing Race for the Galaxy -- you're taking some turns building a great resource engine, but there's not much time to actually see it run. This being said: The replay value is great, but I think some additional campaigns, or some sort of ongoing exploration with limited lives ('resolve') could be a great addition. (The good news is that the devs are still working on some additional content and modes.)   As much as I do like the mechanics and the complex resource system, I do think that the representations of different cultures and individuals are reinforcing problematic stereotypes. I do believe that 'exploration' type games do have a tendency to reinforce hegemonic world-views; in the case of RE:IS, I believe that the 'explorer' setting is indeed strongly reinforcing a eurocentric idea of exploration, and in fact, of cultural exploitation (and more than that: it refers to a style of colonialist exploration that actually did happen, and it romanticizes it).   Many encounters involve helpless or fumbling natives that need the help of the explorers. In my opinion this does have an undertone of cultural inequality, and contains an imlicit message that suggests a cultural inferiority in the cultures we explore in the game. It is also important to note that all of the places we explore are depicted as technologically, and culturally less advanced.  On one side, the game gives me the choice to resolve encounters agressively or via persuasion. But even if I use persuasion, or 'friendly' tactics, I am still taking something away from the culture (e.g. artifacts). In fact, there is no way to progress in the game without taking artifacts away from their originating culture. For example, I talk myself into a monastery and convince the nuns to give me one of their relics. Cultural exchange is great - but in RE:IS, a classic colonialist (one-sided, and hegemonic) way of exploration is a constitutional part of the game setting, and game play.    In conclusion: The irony in RE:IS is that the game mechanics are so bautifully synergistic - but the setting is colonialist. Overall I think that this is a game worth playing, set in a game setting worth problematizing and talking about.   ",

            "review_text": "A truly great game, totally looking forward to the announced expansion.  It might seem innocent and light-hearted if you judge by screenshots, but in fact it is pretty deep and clever and not particularly forgiving (at least for me at the Classic-Adventure difficulty; actually, so far only twice have I survived five expeditions), but even then it delivers incredibly positive message, and 'losing' in fact never feels unfair.  The game basically has three layers, all of them are very well designed and crafted.  The strategic one is your headquarters in roughly XIX century London, were your spend earned resources and prepare to your next expedition. To be honest, I like this part the least, but its fine and pretty complex as well. In fact, on the first few runs, it might appear overwhelming.  Then, there are expeditions themselves, full of random encounters and adventures and witty dialogues. They're amazing, and so far I can't say that I have become bored even from visiting the same areas. The layout of the expedition changes each time you play, and the special locations present there vary from one run to another, and of course, the outcome of events is often different for different teams and runs.  The third layer is tactical battles. Well, you don't get too much of them to become tired, there is always a final encounter at the end of the expedition, and typically two to four aside of it, depending on whether you are looking for fight. At first, the battle mechanics might appear complex and TERRIFYING, but as you grasp the basics (it takes a few encounters) and become more CONFIDENT, it becomes quite EXCITING. I guess any tactical battle system that operates with terms like 'attitude', 'mood' and 'emotions' is definitely worth giving it a try. Oh, and I like the form of field grid too.  Some people might say that the battle mechanics is not really a big deal and devious and friendly abilities can be replaced with say ice and nature magic, the notion that I don't exactly agree with. Even if technically that might be true, the path you choose to resolve encounters is reflected back onto the adventure level, and affects how your quest continues, which I find pretty cool.  As for drawbacks, the only thing I might think about is the number of available expeditions and well, their tight concentration in just few geographical areas. The game is great, but if it just had even more content it would be even greater.",

            "review_text": "Renowned Explorers: International Society is my favourite game I played this year. It's charming, it's exciting, it's unique and it's addictive. Here's why:  You start your game by picking a group of three explorers from a colorful and diverse cast of characters. Some of them are archetypes that you might have seen before, but they truly come to life in the fun and colorful designs, distinct and amusing animations and unique traits which influence your adventures with them.  Once you've selected your team, you'll be thrown right into the game. You're in a previously unexplored location, and your team is going to get famous exploring it. Each map features a main goal you'll need to get to within a set amount of turns. You'll be using up your supplies and need to plan your route carefully - if you run out, it's not an immediate game over, but your explorers will be weakened significantly, making it much harder for them to succeed in the final challenge awaiting you. On the road there, you'll have plenty of encounters, which can either play out as a turn-based combat or a Choose Your Own Adventure-like story, forcing you to make choices based on your team's individual strengths.  The turn-based combat will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has played any other game featuring it. However, where RE:IS manages to put a completely unique spin on it is in the stories it tells through the combat. See, instead of differentiating between your characters' attacks through using swords or guns or magic, here all your attacks and abilites are neatly slotted into three categories: Friendly, Devious or Aggressive. This means that when you encounter some enemies, instead of beating them into submission, you can also get them excited about how cool your group of explorers is! Or you can seduce them (even if your enemies are a group of llamas). Or you can insult them and tell them that they stink like rotten fish. No matter which option you choose, the game still plays out like a typical combat situation. The enemies lose 'spirit' rather than health, but in terms of gameplay mechanics it's exactly the same. Thankfully, Abbey Games managed to still make the system interesting and distinct by letting the Friendly, Devious, Aggressive element work out like Rock, Paper, Scissors. How many actions of one type you take influences the overall mood the two parties of the encounter have. Different moods are weaker and stronger to others, and give you buffs or expose you to specific attacks. It'll be a while until you actually pick up on the intricacies of the system and learn when exactly in a turn to use a specific kind of ability, which strategy works best against a specific enemy or how to compose a team to suit a specific playstyle you might want to go for (there's certainly a very strong RPG element to the game, especially in how you compose your team, and the interactions and backstories you imagine for the characters having been put together in specific combinations).  The story encounters meanwhile, give you little well-written flavor texts about your explorers discovering an ancient crypt or a well-hidden forest grove. They can be a funny showcase for your team's personality to shine, as well as intriguing mysteries you'll be excited to uncover. You're often given choices on what to do, but the focus here isn't morality, it's your character's individual strengths and abilities. An Archeologist character may be able to decipher some glyphs, whereas an Athlete may be able to quickly make a run for it and escape traps in case the aforementioned Archeologist didn't manage to decipher those glyphs quite right after all. You're always given a percentage for how high your character's chance of success in a challenge will be (based on their skill level), which helps you make an informed choice. Then, you'll see that chance of success or failure play out on the Adventure Wheel. Which is awesome. It's so awesome. Much like in a game show, you're watching and waiting for a wheel to land on the spot that ensures your characters success. And sometimes, it ends up being so, so close. It really is a genius addition to the game and makes the story encounters that much more exciting, as you wait with bated breath, hoping your character won't fail and possibly risk the success your entire expedition.  After you've made it to the end of an expedition, you'll be taken to a world map. Here, you can track your overall progress on the quest to become the most Renowned Explorer (which is your endgame goal, as well as a highscore you climb) and select which expedition to take upon next, but also spend the resources you've gained on your previous trips. At the University, you can research papers, which give you various buffs and traits, such as having more supplies available. You can also gather up an Entourage that will teach your explorers various skills or give them certain rewards for exploring specific areas or completing encounters in a specific way. Finally, you can buy items that your characters can equip and gain various stats or skills from.  It sounds like a lot. And it is, but the game never felt overwhelming to me. It eases you in and you slowly get to discover how all the pieces of the game fall together, learning more and more with each playthrough. Yeah, in case you missed it on the store page, the game features permadeath and the maps you explore are randomly generated in typical roguelite fashion. But you totally can play the game without permadeath, if you prefer that. I found that it adds to the game. It encourages you to try out new team combinations, and having characters of different skill sets means you get different options to choose from in encounters, leading to new stories and discoveries. Also, with each expedition you take a character on, you work towards unlocking them as a team captain, giving you unique advantages. Yeah, if you get far into the game and your expedition fails, it's disappointing. But having that threat there also makes the expeditions all that more exciting. Plus, despite its many layers, the game plays very quick and fast, once you've gotten used to it. It's a great game to hop into and just play for a few minutes, taking only a couple of turns (although you'll want to keep playing for longer). I played the game on my Surface while riding the bus! That's how easy it is to jump in and out and how addictive and engrossing it is.  Definitely pick up the DLC though. Eventually you will get to a point where you'll have already seen a bunch of the encounters, and so having two new expedition locations as well as new event types to spice up your adventures really adds a lot to the game (and I'm super excited for whatever DLC the developers will put out next). Even if yeah, the game moves fast enough that going through things you've seen before does not feel tedious (unlike, say, moving between the opening missions in Sunless Sea).  To sum it all up, Renowned Explorers: International Society is fantastic. It's incredibly charming, thanks to some lovely artwork and funny writing, but also the unique setting and ideas. It's quick to learn and hard to master, and incredibly addictive and enjoyable to play. My playtime in the game kept going up and up, and it always left me with a smile, because it's simply one of the most engaging and joyful games I've played. I love it, and I can only highly recommend it to anyone interested in the setting or gameplay.   One final anecdote: One of the characters you can play in the game is a child magician. Another character is an old teacher. If you pick the child magician as your team's leader and put that teacher on the team, you'll discover that oh hey, she now has -1 Spirit because, 'Ugh, I can't believe I'm being led by a child. I'm a teacher, not a babysitter.' It made me laugh out loud when I first saw it, and it's the perfect example of the game's humor and charm to me.",

            "review_text": "SUMMARY: This is a pretty good casual game if that's what you want and if you don't pay full price. (Luckily I got it on sale, but even at half off retail I think I paid too much and am disappointed.)  This game has a lot going for it, but it's terribly important to know certain things about it before spending money on it. With that in mind, I'm putting the CONS list first.  CONS:  ... Staggeringly short. I tend to take my time, but in less than 10 hours I've started four playthroughs and beaten the game twice on the standard difficulty (classic difficulty, no saves, permadeath). You get to go on 5 expeditions, most of which are limited by supplies to about 10-12 moves. (I'm generalizing; there are ways to make individual expeditions last SLIGHTLY longer.) The first of the five is chosen for you, and is also shorter than the rest (about 7 moves).   ... Repetitive. There are very few expedition options. They prompt you what sort of things you can expect to face and find, and it frequently happens that there are no good options for a party's strengths or an expedition's needs. Also, while each one is partially randomized, the draw pool is small and I got the same 'random' scenarios multiple times. The network of possible moves changes, the rewards change, but the bulk of each expedition stays the same each playthrough.  ... Limited. You pick three explorers from the provided 20. There's a degree of diversity between them, but most of it is in hidden features that may or may not even matter. (My wrestler was devout, which mattered in exactly one conversation option.) My friendly gold obsessed party with the Scout captain was functionally identical to my aggressive research obsessed party with the Scientist captain. There are obvious gaps, like characters who are glass cannons and fit in a certain sort of party, but without sturdy characters to defend them who also fit in that sort of party. Each character has a couple of options in encounters, but it's pretty common for disimilar characters to have exactly the same attacks, so everyone plays pretty close to the same. Each character can also be upgraded slightly (you get one of two options at each level, and I commonly finished with character at level 4), but a lot of the options are minor and there's no way to level up in the field. There's a research tree with six small branches, but you can only choose from two of them at first, so most of the 'options' won't have time to affect much, assuming you devote enough time to Research to unlock any of them at all. There's equipment to buy, and its very important, but there aren't real choices about it, so gold is mostly the illusion of a mechanic. There are followers to hire, but they do minor things that you may not even notice unless you invest a lot in them, at which point they only provide their marginal effect on your last expedition. In short, so much of the game felt like discovering that a lake is really a puddle. It's broad and looks refreshing, but it's too shallow to do much in.  ...Vague. A lot of information could be useful, but isn't available anywhere. Monster attacks are the most typical example of this. Fights involve a lot of splashy (and whimsical) pictures that mean nearly nothing, combined with wildly unpredictable attack strength and a bevy of ignorably irrelevant status effects. Perks are similar. It isn't uncommon that you'll get to choose new perks, not knowing if or how those perks will help you. My favorite is choosing between two perks of the same type, each with a stylish but vapid name. How are they different? They probably aren't.  PROS:  ... Interesting concept implemented well. I really liked the entire exploration idea, and the game is built on it from top to bottom. Everything works together to point back to that central conceit: stepping out on adventures into the mysterious unknown.  ... Interesting mechanics. The game has some really unique combat mechanics--(attack types, approach types, moods, feelings)--which are challenging but rewarding to manage. The best of these is the encounter outcomes, trying to resolve an encounter in a friendly, devious, or aggressive manner to achieve different rewards.  ... Solid platform. I haven't encountered a single bug.  ... Whimsical atmosphere. Everything from the art design to the quests is pretty lighthearted.  ",

With that being said, however, there is a lot to bother the would-be explorer.   For starters, don't be fooled by the cartoony, zany exterior, this game plays hard, even for a rogue-like. I don't mind permadeath, per se, as long as it feels fair. On normal to classic difficulty in adventure mode this game will whip your ♥♥♥. I found that playing on normal in discovery mode (more forgiving) was much more fun over all. The gamemakers love to tout that you have to master the mechanics, but honestly the game isn't really that deep over all. Attacks only fall in three categories and there are only a handful of emotions. The deepness of the game is questionable, the cheapness of it at times is not.   Now, after getting that big huge dump on the game out of the way, what is good about it? Is it worth buying? I say it is worth buying, but only at a discount of 50% or more. There is fun to be had in this one, especially in exploring the different lands. Still exploration only runs so deep, you can see all the areas in a 2-3 hours, probably even less time if you're real good. For most, discovery will stop there. A couple of things that may keep folks coming back is the plethora of different characters and all the treasures to find. The game is only really randomized to a certain extent, so for many I would guess that a playthrough or two is going to be where folks check out.   Warts and all, I have a lot of respect for this scrappy game company. I would love to see how they might improve on a next iteration of this game, because like I said I really enjoyed the theme.",

            "review_text": "Review for this, I won't be afraid to use the word 'Masterpiece', is long overdue. It is an amazingly competent and enjoyable game, on many levels. In this day and age this is very refreshing. And yes, I didn't repeat myself here. It is a game both extremely enjoyable overall, yet also beautifully designed both for the casual players and for the die hard fans of such games. Truly, this is one of the hidden gems and one of the top games that came in 2015.  But enough baseless praising. This game is essentially rogue-lite done right. There is no outgame progression, aside from opening new possible 'captains' for your team of three. Which means you have as good of a chance of finishing it on your first try, as in any other attempt, if we disregard your accumulating personal experience with the game's mechanics. Captain roles can be opened in any order player desires and all characters can be used from the start as simple companions. While it may be argued that some of the locked captains are very strong, starting choices are good enough, desired captain can be unlocked in as much as one playthrough and mostly captains provide strong yet diverse bonuses to your party. Those bonuses, together with the choice of other two members and your playstyle form noticeable diversity in possible ways of playing.  There is some imbalance between usability of skills, but even that is kept in check with the ability of the player to choose his own adventures after the random starting one. You get a perfect basic description of each adventure, stating what playstyle and skills are perfered for its completion. And if something is going horribly wrong - you can always choose simpler expeditions after the second one, if you feel that your luck isn't as shining as you expected it to be. I can't emphasize enough how ingenious the gamedesign is in this diamond of a game, which tries to contain possible randomness and imbalance on every step, ultimately giving player every tool he needs to finish the game, bar exceptionally bad luck.  The gameplay revolves around series of expeditions both with Turn Based 'overworld map' and Turn Based combat. Your endgame mission is to become, as the title suggests, the most Renowned Explorer in your club. And yet in another ingenious move, the 'club' isn't some sort of faceless entity, leaderboard with only you as an existing figure. You do meet other explorers ocasionally, and may interact with them. You have different resources to both make use of and take note of. Three basic resources (Status, Research and Gold) both provide points for the end game and are spent between expeditions on enhancing your resource gathering, recieving different upgrades from a Scientific tree or buying equipment for your team. There are also Supplies and Resolve. First is usually spent while moving during expedition on the overworld map. Should you run out of supplies, you start incurring drastic debuffs, though you still can try to get few last items before facing the boss of this particular expedition. Resolve is lost if you fail certain events, take unnecessary risks or lose all HP on one of the teammates during combat. Should you squander all of your Resolve - you lose this game.  The game is using simple but well thought out system of 'Friendly-Devious-Aggressive' playstyle, with most characters being addept at combination of the two out of three. WIth this comes the only real gripe I can possibly muster with this game - the Attack/Defence stats for Friendly/Devious are the same, yet for Aggressive are different. Basically that means, that in many cases you are attacked by Speeches and are attacking by Speeches, shadowing the necessity of Aggressive builds. Developers try, admirably I must say, to provide decent balance between those, but ultimately I must admit - it is nigh impossible to tackle this issue properly. Still, this system works extremely well most of the time, providing noticeable differences in playstiles even with the same party members used differently.  Overworld map of expedition is abundant with events and challenges, of which the turn based combat is anything but prevalent (except for expeditions specifically designed for aggressive parties). In many cases, combat can be circumvented. In other cases, you often can gain an advantage before important battles if you have certain non-combat skills at your disposal. But that is not to say that combat isn't important. Boss of each expedition will still be in your way, and each battle won provides a hefty combat bonus to one of the party members until the end of the expedition. Still, you can gain big advantages before quite a few boss battles using the non-combat skills, usually in different ways. And the game usually allows you to see the chances of success for each possible choice before making the ultimate decision. It might not be too far stretched to say that the Overworld experience on its own is worth the money this game asks.  But there is also a turn based combat. One would assume that it would be a mere add-on, poorly executed and without any time invested in it. Far from it, turn based combat makes full use of 'Friendly-Devious-Aggressive' trio, making it a simple yet very important core mechanic. The battlefield is reigned by 'mood'. Mood being a combination of most used attitude of your party and that of the enemies. Depending on the combination, it provides different bonuses. For example, being Devious against Aggressive opponent provides you with +Dodge chance, while double Aggressive leads to a bonus Devious damage for whoever uses it. As you can tell from it, certain combinations are beneficial, and the mirrored ones are detrimental to your party. Not only that, but using Attitude attacks (majority of the attacks are those) can quickly shift the Mood towards different combination, especially when finishing off an opponent. That leads to an interesting tense combat, especially if you're getting the best reward from finishing the battle with the Attitude that would put the battle in a detrimental to you Mood. Many bosses shift their behaviour, if not all of their attacks, based on the Attitude you may use. And do not fear, most enemies contain a simple yet sufficient explanation of their strong points, weaknesses and possible big changes should you use particular Attitude attacks against them.  What else is there to praise? Art style is somewhat simplistic, yet vivid and pleasing. Animations are hilarious at times, which greatly helps with slight repetitiveness of the gameplay. Music and sound effects are much the same - simplistic at times, yet immerse you greately into the overall experience. The game oozes of love and passion that was put into it by the developers.  Not only that, but noticeable update to gameplay came out a while ago, completely free of charge. In this update they made some very drastic changes to certain aspects, like Research tree, Mood bonuses, various debuffs and characters. And you know what? The game became all the better. Developer that are both brave enough to change a lot, yet competent enough to make it ultimately worthwhile? On top of that, humble enough to provide it free of charge, when many others would make it a DLC (and do note, it would be worth money in my book)? I am baffled. People who made this game deserve all the praise and spotlight they can get, and even more on top of that.  ===================================================================  Verdict: I can give only one recommendation here. Watch the video of the game. If you enjoy what you see - the game is exactly that, if not much more. It is worth every penny in its price. Damn, its worth even more than that for the sheer competence the developer displayed. I am extremely saddened, that it somewhat went under the radar. It deserves much more attention than what it has.",

I have owned it for a little over 24 hours at the time of writing this review and I've got about 12 or so hours logged already, and I fully anticipate to log many more.  Lots of possible party combinations in tandem with the uniqueness of every character and the roguelike exploration elements make for something that I just can't get tired of playing. I like to experiment and try out various combinations and and see how they turn out with different playstyles.   The combat is refreshingly unique - it isn't too far removed from the type of turn based combat you'd normally see in these kinds of videogames, but it does a lot to distinguish itself from the normal with the use of moods and approach tactics and you can get rewarded for following certain tactics and moods for battles. You can write various research papers, which act as this game's tech tree, and further these rewards.  There's also over 100 different treasures to find in the game's state at the time I write this review, and it sounds like they will be adding more in due time.  I would like to see more expeditions, though, because the current con I have for this game is that, being a roguelike, I come across the same events too often. While there are plenty of events in each expedition, all of which are unique, this game would greatly benefit from having a wider variety of expeditions to choose from due to its nature. There are enough expeditions in the current game to keep me satisfied for a good while, though.  This game is tragically overlooked and I would rate it as a must buy.

The game is charming and I love the art style, but what surprised me was the depth of the systems and mechanics. I really shouldn't be surprised...Reus was an incredibly deep game, so it's easy to see Abbey Games has chops.  My only real complaint so far is the same one I had about Reus...the mechanics can be a bit overwhelming and there isn't quite enough tutorial material to help you learn. That being said, once you put in a bit of time and figure everything out it's a ton of fun.

I don't like the random addition of new enemies especially right on top of you, I'd like to see an option to fail in the expedition and move on and I think there needs to be more expeditions to choose from...BUT, the sheer potential, humor and exploration parts are too good to pass up.   Two additional suggestions. (1) A permanent list accessible from the main menu saving the final stats from each game including who your crew members were. If it already exists I didn't see it. (2) an undo move option during encounters.   My original review is below the line.  ---------THE LINE--------  This is the hardest 'Not Recommended' review I've ever written. Most of this game is fun and a real hoot but it's ruined by the final encounters durring each expedition and the limited number of expeditions.  The final encounters are just too random and they violate a pet peeve of mine. They randomly introduce additional enemies during the fight. This means that maneuver strategies don't work since new enemies can be dropped in right on top of you. The other problem is sometimes you'll find that your current crew just doesn't do well against the final encounter and there's no way to simply give up on the current expedition and move on to the next one.  Even if you don't get to the top of the leader board seeing how well you can do with different crews would be fun.  Another problem is while the individual expeditions are generated each time there doesn't seem to be very many of them and that makes the gameplay, or at least the final encounters, become very repetitive very quickly. There just aren't that many expeditions to choose from so you're pretty much repeating the same ones game after game.  Get rid of the random addition of new enemies or add the option to just run back to London with what you've earned so far and move on to the next expedition even if it means not getting to the top of the explorer board and add more expeditions to choose from and this game could be a classic. Right now it's just too little and too depedent upon being lucky in the final encounters.",

            "review_text": "Overview: A stellar game with elements of party management, resource management and tactical combat. The game consists of short, challenging play-throughs that build familiarity with the game levels and concepts. As you improve, the game provides re-playability through selection of different combinations of party members and/or attempts to refine your strategy for high score. Not only is the game already fun, but the developers are very active in the steam community to fix bugs and implement suggestions for improvement.  Read on for a description of the game play elements.  Party Selection: The first challenge is picking a captain and two crew members from a selection of 12 characters with a variety of strengths and weaknesses. The characters are divided into 4 classes, each with 2 of 9 traits, a variety of attacks, and semi-hidden personality traits with hints in the character description. The game provides plenty of advice for selecting your team, including description of a character’s strengths and weaknesses, recommended party members, and symbols for a party’s relative strength in each of the three offensive areas – allowing you to quickly select a balanced or specialized party. There is plenty to appeal to min-maxers, challenge runs, or leisure players that just want to select a quick party and go exploring.  Expeditions: After choosing a party you are cast into your 1st of 5 expeditions, in which you explore a location for resources (gold, campaign and research) and renown (victory points). The map shows the location of the final boss and a couple of nearby locations. Each location gives a hint of the challenges and rewards you may find. Some spaces give rewards automatically, some required the roll on a an adventure wheel, where your chance of success is determined by your party’s class, traits and stats. Some challenges provide an opportunity to avoid the roll for a lesser reward, others impose penalties for failure, including a loss of resolve (game over at 0). Your goal is to choose the route that will provide the most reward on the way to the final boss. You can take as long a path as you like, but if you run out of supplies, your team starts suffering stat penalties.  Encounters: Encounters are brief tactical combats that occur during expeditions. During combat, your characters can use aggressive attacks (physical), devious speech (insults) or friendly speech (compliments) to reduce your opponents’ spirit (hit points). Speech abilities also have 4 debuffs and 2 buffs (friendly speech) that can be applied to a target. Friendly abilities can be used on your own party to heal or remove debuffs. The debuffs/buffs only apply when a character has a positive or negative state of mind, which can be manipulated through use of devious or friendly speech. Also, using aggressive, devious, or friendly abilities will affect the mood of which is how the enemy perceives your actions. The enemy also has its own mood showing their preferred method of attack. The game applies bonuses in a RPS format based on your and your opponents’ mood, where aggressive &gt; friendly &gt; devious &gt; aggressive. If your mood matches your opponent, you receive a bonus to abilities in the superior mood. If your mood is superior to your opponent, you receive a defensive bonus. If your mood is inferior, you receive a defensive penalty. If your characters die in combat, you lose one resolve. Characters can also be revived in lieu of attacking your opponents.   Preparation: After each successful expedition, you are given the chance to spend your resources to improve your characters. Research can be spent to improve your ability to earn rewards, or to make combat easier. Campaign is used to upgrade your shops or hire an entourage, which can improve the value of future reward tokens or increase the number of reward tokens you receive for certain events. Gold is spent on items. Each character can hold one offensive item, one defensive item and one trinket that provides unique bonuses. Will you buy quality armor for a single character, or spread the wealth for small improvements for all of your characters? Finding treasure during expeditions also earns insight, which can be spent during preparation to earn more research, campaign, or gold tokens – you decide.  Ending the Game: You win the game if you successfully complete 5 expeditions AND finish with more renown than your arch rival. You lose if your party is wiped out during combat, loses all of its resolve during expedition or combat, or if you complete 5 expeditions but don’t earn enough renown to be the top explorer.  If you like strategy and tactics, this game is for you. ",

The sound design is great, love the atmospheric sound in the stages and the goofy sounds that the characters make. Seems to have quite a lot of replayability to it with the team customization and with the unlocking of other characters as captains.   Though, I do have a slight issues with this game.  While the visuals are good, they, in combat, look a bit too blurry and have barely any detail. I also think the sprite animations need a few more frames during the attacks to make it a bit smoother, and maybe add a reaction to the characters/enemies being damaged when attacked. I also noticed that there was no sound to the mummies attack. Tiny issues, but they do make a difference.  Besides those slight problems, I ran into a few glitches. One where my character attacked the enemy, went the other way (away from the enemy, not towards it) and attacked. Then there was some random lines of codes popping up on my screen after I had made a purchase in one of the stores.  ",

This review will have some things to say about the design of the game, but I do really enjoy playing it as a whole.  The game could use some polish. I've found that there are some graphical goofs (not quite glitches) that impeded the flow of the game. Things like character portraits weirdly off-center or obstructing other portraits (I'm looking at you Agatha and your poofy hair!), and mechanics that aren't necessarily intuitive like the unique traits some characters have affecting certain encounter choices.  Some of the locations/encounters tread a little close to stereotyping, but nothing terribly offensive; I think the story could benefit greatly from incorporating more homages to real-world historical artifacts as possible treasures.  In the end, I enjoy Renowned Explorers very much. It has good replayability, though I'm not sure how many playthroughs before I get burnt out, as some have said there is a degree of repetition in each playthrough. I am glad to have supported your development!",

However it has one gaping flaw:  The hex based tactical engine simply doesn't work with the other systems.  You control three units. Maps are relatively open. Many attacks are ranged and characters of any side don't block line of sight. It is therefor impossible to reliably protect someone from getting hit. You lose the game by losing all your resolve points, and you lose one resolve every time someone is incapacitated in the tactical map. Thus bringing anyone who can't survive reasonably on the tactical map is a recipe for failure.  Apart from the occasional area that heals anyone on it at the start of their turn, terrain is either passable, impassable and blocks LOS, or impassable and doesn't.  All of this combined means that save the rare AOE ability, positioning barely matters. So why have it?   A Radical Fix",

I don't know, I thought it was silly. Let's go plunder a native tribe by telling them jokes... :|  The bonuses are fun. You get LOTS of shiny throughout the game. It doesn't pay off unless you complete a whole level, though, and the boss fights were the deal breakers for me. I think in the last fight I did there were 4x as many enemies as my I had in my party. Challenging fights are fun... but I hadn't even really completed a full level (past the tutorial), so it seems like it just ramped up too fast. And while the game is technically a 'tactics' game, in that it has a grid and you walk around, there seemed to be less tactical decisions focused on positioning, movement, cover, etc... and more so just their 'mood' system.",

Each single game is comparitively short, easily possible (with a bit of practice) to finish within an hour or two; but mastering the game will take far longer = a fact easily seen in the steam forums with a full range of players, from full-time experts to casual one-off gamers - which also hosts the most friendly and helpful forums and users I've ever seen.  This is also where the (now Community-run) Weekly Challenges take place, giving all players a chance to try new techniques or play with characters they haven't tried before - as well as seek advice anytime they have difficulty. I would recommend taking a look at the forums as well if considering this game; as you will quickly see why I feel it is a point worth mentioning.  I'd also like to add that the developers are extremely devoted to the game, regular updates coming frequently, both introducing new content and resolving issues players have raised. Indeed, the 50th weekly challenge occured just recently, which the developers ran as a communal challenge, where additional content would be created for each point threshold the community met as a team.  Summary: Whether you want a quick, enjoyable romp through the Egyptian desert or if you prefer a deep, tactical and long-term planning challenge, or even just a chat with others who enjoy Renowned Explorers, this game can suit you either way - just set the difficulty as you prefer and enjoy! (Be warned, the 'Impossible' difficulty is not one I would recommend until you are well-versed in both the game's strategic and tactical layers!)

Stand Out Feature: A rock/paper/scissors combat mechanic which causes moves (both yours and your opponents) to set a 'tone' for the encounter, which in turn will setup future moves to become more or less powerful. In conjunction with being able to design your party fairly freely (either maximized to exploit one of these tones, balanced to handle whatever the enemy throws at you, or anywhere in between those two extremes), this encourages experimentation during combat and creates scenarios in which careful considerations must be made. In addition to tones, both players and opponents might be put into certain moods by moves used upon them (Excited, Furious, Sadness, etc) which function as a conditional status effect that makes certain moves more or less powerful, adding more calcuations into the decision making process during the player's turn.  Pros: Endearing art style. Multiple challenge tiers to provide a tailored difficulty. A large enough cast of characters (all with their own individual skillsets and level paths) and scenarios to choose from to foster replayability.   Cons: Animations become repetitive quickly. Many non-combat encounters resolved by a % die roll that's not always clearly defined stat wise and will heavily influence your success or failure regarding the overarching goal.

Late into the night, I find myself wondering WHY OH WHY I have been compulsively playing Civilization for hours, when there's hardly a lick of story to care about as you progress and battles are formulaic.  Not so Renowned Explorers! I picked up the game primarily for its adventure-explorer narrative; as a person who named their pet rabbit after the leader of the 'Kon-Tiki' expedition, how could I not? The premise is remarkably well done: it's full of tongue-in-cheek humor and bizarre excursions to exotic locales, vying for the renown of the global exploration community.   What really shines about this game for me is the blend of mechanics. First and foremost, the fact that you can choose three different styles of combat for most of your encounters (Friendly, Devious, Aggressive) provides a fun and engaging challenge. Part of the reason I love RPGs is because they offer alternative options to combat such as talking your way out of trouble. Renowned Explorers pulls these approaches into its combat scenarios by providing characters with separate stats for physical combat and 'speech' combat. Balancing the different strengths of your crew in each encounter makes it more nuanced than just having the biggest guns in the game.   In addition to more varied combat options, crew set-ups make this game extremely replayable. You pick three people as your expedition crew, and the characters' different skill sets make each combo play very differently.   Finally, this is an adventure game afterall, so strategy elements, while present, don't take up all your time. You can buy gear, perform research, recruit assistants, and give lectures to earn strategic resources. The options available here are enough to impact your expeditions, but they truly are secondary to them.  I do have two minor complaints. First, each game 'ends' before you complete all of your available expeditions. I expect that was done to allow people to complete more playthroughs with different crews and strategies, but it makes the game seem too short and a little incomplete. Yes, you can play the rest of the expeditions on the map after you 'win,' but you'll be past the point where you can unlock new strategic resources, and a lot of the battles get pretty easy.   My second - and again, minor - complaint, is that the character's speech combat animations don't make much sense and add little to gameplay. If I remember correctly, Ivan's 'Terrify' action always produces a speech bubble of a teddy bear. I guess maybe the idea of a character that burly with a little teddy bear is a bit unsettling, but without actual dialogue, it all gets a bit nonsensical.   The annimations for physical combat are much more cohesive. Anna's special attack is particularly cool, and there are 20 other characters with special abilities and differing stats to try out.",
