            "review_text": "A really simple game to get working. You can have up to eight players (on phone, pc, tablet - all at the same time). You just need one copy of the game and access to internet. A real hit for parties and lazy evenings in. Cheap at the price i'd say. :-)   One tip if you can: Hook up your main pc to a television with an hdmi cable (or some such). Get the narrator and the questions up on the big screen and everyone else can sit round on their devices to play. We even had one of them answering questions from upstairs whilst they were looking for something.  Also, prepare yourself for learning a lot of random useless information.",
