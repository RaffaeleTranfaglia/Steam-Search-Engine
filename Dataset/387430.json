            "review_text": "+Very Depth management game +Skill for your leader improve with each game + Map start small and get bigger +Low Cost  +/- Early game Repetitive once you know how to earn money  tips : go feodal and full monoculturalism for money for the first turn after assigned tech and get those taxes up and if you manage policies well you will end with state economy with multiculturalism (monoculturalism when high level with lot of districts ) and lower your taxe. to simplify this : you start at the medieval age with low tech and got problems and you must end at utopia communism (ultimate capitalist) without corruption if possible i will do the same too in democracy 3 :D  - Hard to learn if you are a noob in macro economics you need then the manual - They should add like eu4 some hovering text  to get some previsions for the next turn and add some automation with some buildings cause to find the best profitable district to upgrade first take some time. +/- Simple battle tactics 7/10 Minor defaults but else seems good for management game like capitalism 2 (now capitalism lab)  P.S : It's not a 4X due to no explore and the one to exterminate is rebels which is your other side of the coin. And this is a heavy micromanagement game so dont expect to stay less than 1min per turn.  And the time i took to finish the 3 big missions (main campaign) is 44h so if you run only one faction due to all other are the same except starting tech and social class. So max time you will finish this game at 100% is 264h average. (v1.02)",
