            "review_text": "Ok, let me make one thing clear. I know this game is targeted mainly at guys for  obvious  reasons, and those  reasons  at times do seem to have a major plot part to play, especially concerning one of the main characters. But even though the girls in this VN have such large assets, I don't feel it is done in bad taste. Even the artwork seems original and not some anime style clone. The VN story itself is short and light hearted, and was pretty fun to read. I did actually like the story and think it had a pretty decent plot that might've made a good Anime OVA like those from the late 90's with only 3~6 episodes. That being said, I wished the story could've been longer with more choices. If you're interested in purchasing, and the physical appearance of the girls isn't a turn off for you, pick it up on sale like I did, when it's around $4.99, or so. I think that's a better price point for a VN of this length with it's limited choices. Don't let my play time fool you. I read slow due to poor eyesight, and take lots of breaks while reading. My actual play time, going through both endings, might've really taken 3.5 ~ 4 hours.",

            "review_text": "Okay, The game play is standard Visual Novel. Couple of choices. Mostly cosmetic changes to the story. Nothing too exciting in that way. The story was actually a whole lot of fun. I enjoyed it immensely. I'd recommend it just for that. Be aware, Huge breasts abound. It's not required in any way for the story, but that barely matters. The artist likes huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I'm not complaining. I like them as much as the next man. I appreciate the story, the art is good, the gameplay is just standard VN, my only issue is the episodic feel. I hate this whole Episodic story thing... I wish I could just buy a game and finish a game... I hate that I buy a game, Thinking I'm getting a full story, and then nope... Story just dies. Buy the next one!  I will though. It was good. I will indeed buy the next one.",
