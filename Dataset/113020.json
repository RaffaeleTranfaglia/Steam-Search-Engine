The first two acts have a large amount of levels where the last two supplement acts only have a handful, however they are difficult. The game encourages team work as the later levels become incredibly difficult and requires lots of practice and runs. This is a perfect team game but also plays very differently solo and is still lots of fun hiding from enemies and trying to figure out the best paths to take or how best to utilize your character's ability in the level. The game is lots of fun and becomes hectic and fast paced when you trip an alarm and you're trying to run away from the enemies!",

            "review_text": "A splendid game to play with friends, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is a top-down game puzzle-ish co-op game with a simplistic but very pleasing art style. Now, when I say this game is a 'puzzle-ish co-op game', I say that because it's not quite a puzzle game, as it has elements of action to it, but completing each mission can be seen as a 'puzzle' of sorts. I'd say it's a stealth game, but it's not entirely that, either: while stealth can make things easier, blitzing through a room and drawing all eyes to you can work occasionally also. The goal of each level is to steal all trophies before exiting via the escape route, with an added side objective of collecting as many coins as you can to get a higher score. The main obstacles in the game are the guards, who, upon seeing you, chase you down and beat you senseless until you either escape their pursuit or die. When the latter happens, you can get revived by your buds, but doing so leaves you vulnerable for a decent amount of time, so caution is necessary. By default, you have no means of combat, leaving avoidance of threats as the best option. However, there are items that allow you to better deal with threats, like smoke bombs, sleeping darts, guns, and explosives (possibly others I may have missed), of which you can have one equipped at a time, and all of which are replenished by collecting the previously mentioned coins throughout the level. In addition to guards, there are other obstacles, though most of them just draw the attention of the guards so they can go about their merciless beatings of your team. To offer a wider array of methods to deal with the various things between you and your loot, the game has a character system in which each character has a special ability unique to them; there is a very nice diversity of character choice, with each character possibly opening up alternative routes to the objectives. For instance, the Hacker can hack into terminals and disable nearby electronics, such as cameras and laser sensors, the Cleaner can knock guards unconscious when behind them, and the Mole can break through (some) walls. The game is certainly a lot less interesting and enjoyable when playing alone, as it's meant to be a co-op game first and foremost. It has a story mode, and I have no strong feelings regarding the story either way, but the levels are very well-done, generally. The game has a built-in level editor and thus aptly is tied to the Steam Workshop, so when you're finished with the campaign, there are plenty of community levels to peruse as well, a fair amount of which are bound to be substantial and enjoyable.  In short, fantastic little co-op game that's fun, interesting, and worthwhile. I had a blast playing it, and it's probably one of my favorite little indie games (and by 'indie', I mean the real definition of indie—that is, self-published and independent of any larger company; sorry, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of that term is killing me) of all time, simply based on how much of a good time I had with it.",

I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.  So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.  This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try.  ",

            "review_text": "A lot of people seem to be of the opinion that Monaco is only fun when played in Co-Op, and while it's true that the game is at its best in those kinds of frantic multiplayer games, I honestly think the single player version shines just as much-- it just feels like a totally different game. Whereas co-op in Monaco is all about laying out plans and watching them go horribly wrong --and the frantic, off-the-cuff attempts to coordinate efforts to salvage the heist-- in single player, its a slower, more calculated and tactical game, where your lone-wolf status makes heists incredibly tense. The heightened difficulty of launching these heists solo is undercut by the fact that you have multiple lives-- you can play as every member of the team in solo, which allows for players to die in an often advantageous way by allowing one's self to switch characters-- but it still brings a unique challenge to each of the masterfully designed levels. Throw in a killer piano soundtrack that lands somewhere between ragtime and vaudeville, an enjoyably executed (if slight) story that uses unreliable narration for clever effect, and a robust map-maker tool with countless community maps (to say nothing of the recently added 'zombie' mode, a word that normally makes me cringe due to the cultural oversaturation of zombies, but nonetheless makes for an enjoyable variation on the standard gameplay), and you have the most fun multiplayer game of the year.  At the time I'm writing this, Monaco is $2.99 on a flash sale. I got it for 7.50, and I would've paid full price for it if I realized it would be this fun.",

Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard. So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.",

If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer.

Every level is pretty much unique and you can approach at it in many different ways, according to the members of your party. Obviously the stealthier the better. At the end of every level your score is based upon the time you spent finishing the level (that is catching the main objectives) to which will be added a penalty that will be as big as he coins you missed during the level.  Artistically speaking, we're dealing with a jewel: your screen will be invaded by any sort of color and the retro style is something simply beatiful.  Base gameplay is already various, but it's additionally enhanced by the presence of the zombie mode which is very difficult, even though I haven't played very much. In addition to what I've already written, there are many interesting community levels which can help you learn the basics of the classes and many tricks.  In the end: I absolutely recommend this game because it's simply one of the best and deep coop experiences you can find.  10/10",

It really ought to let you swap out characters during the level if you're playing by yourself. As it is, you only get to use a new guy if your current one dies. I've yet to actually suicide in order to do this, but close. There are definitely spots where it gets tough in the later levels, and sneaking by solo is all but impossible.

The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn",

Litterally when I was just on the few couple levels I was just confused and screaming since I didn't know what I was doing xD Monaco is addicting, really fun and just wow... xD  It really got me into the game where you get in the game and it was just going madman! Straight into to game, heaps of drama while stealing + escaping just got really catchy!  Doing different gamemodes and such got pretty fun too I mean who wouldn't like this game? (Except for some people)   But Still!  Single Player is very challenging but being able to connect with 2-4 players on levels make it easier and also fustrating in a good way.  I rate 9/10 because I mean yes it's awesome but there isn't much of variety of levels except for the workshop, but who knows how good the workshop ones are.   If you are reading this and are about to buy the game or anything. I REALLY SUGGEST YOU DO!!!   *Amazing :D*",

Even if you don't play much indie games like me, you should have some fun.   Recommended controller input: Keyboard/Mouse, Xbox stylye controller  Pros +Great art style +Great soundtrack +Extremely well balanced classes +Good stealth mechanics +Good UI +Easy to pick up and play +Good controls +Funny dialogue +Good level design +Great co-op +Extremely easy to provide developer input  Cons +Repetitive +Not much fun without friends  Runability Can run on a toaster, trust me, burrito played it xD  Verdict While this game is very fun, it does not last long. I do suspect my in-game time for this won't get much higher anytime soon, but I have to say this game is great. One of the great things about indie games is how it is usually way easier to voice your opinions to developers. In fact, with monaco, I know of some developers' steam accounts, so I can ask them questions or give feedback. It makes me feel like I am helping them achieve something, and it makes me feel good. 9/10",

It definitey has something great going here.  But, there is one thing I find a little annoying and odd. When I started playing, I was expecting there to be some sort of brief on each mission; map layout, special persons, particular weapons/traits, just something to predetermine some strategy. This is a heist game after all.   To be fair though it's not that big of a deal, but it would save me time in having to put up with a rather really slow and overly cautious play through, or, a hectic and rushed one, just so I can get some strategy down.  8/10",

Playing alone is not recommended, additionaly, there are only a few lobbies to join in(or at least in my region) compared to when it had a ''free day''. It became boring to me after a day because of the lack of lobbies.  Each session has its thrills and a whole lot of vibrant colours, even in screenshots. If you don't find it cheerful, your vision is my concern. As for the audio, I can't really say much; I was too busy collecting coins for my shotgun. As for the missions, I am glad they are assorted. They're not all prison breaks or heists, but I haven't finished the game so I can't really say more than that. I have played it long enough(I think) to say it though.  The game doesn't have an atmosphere as it does not need any(though it would be more impressive if there was) because it is a fast-paced multiplayer, however, every random lobby has a random story; all three of you are in the stairs to the next leve-- wait, three? THREE?   Well, you just found out one of your teammates got shot and now you have to get to him before advancing. One of you decides to do it, only to die in the process too(noob lol), you go ahead and get rushed by three guards, and the last one? Cowering in the ladder. After a minute of trying to convince the last guy, he eventually gets out of his spot and saves all three of you.  But now your score is extremely low, which sucks.

Its a good game for people who like the retro indie 'sneak-em games' as I call them... anyway...  The main thing that stands this game out from the others is the fluid-like line-of-sight, the very ANGLE you stand in a corner can determine whether a guard can see you or not. By the way, about the guards.... what exactly are they attacking you with? I see a flashlight in one hand and what looks like a spanner or a lego hand in/as the other...",

If you have the fortune to get in a lobby with two or three other people, then a riot will ensue, unless you've honed your skills, you will be constantly killed, and constanty be killing the other players. Matches can last a long time and be utterly epic when you win.

The game takes a while to get interesting, but if you skip the early levels, the mechanics can be confusing to new players. 3.

I liked the layout of the menus and their bright intense color on black, contrasting the giant pixels to the max. However, the gameplay in my opinion is extremely repetitive, and the game kind of 'forces' you to stealth the joint. In this I mean how you may have a shotgun, you can go in and blow someone to their pixely skeleton, however note that you can only use it once, before having to collect 10 stupid coins to load another use into your weapon/tool. And by the time I collected 10 coins, I had about 20 stupid Watchmen following me, tripping lasers as I ran, and doctors shooting me with tranquilizer crossbows, which led to me being beaten to death with the deadly forks the Watchmen hold. Sure, you can try to hide in a bush/vent/tree, but by the time I went in one, they followed me to the bush and happened to poke the bush with their forks, leading me to my instant death. The music, in my opinion, is awful, just sounding like an extremely sped up piano ballad, or better yet a 2-year-old banging their hands and arms on every key possible.  The graphics are squares. I think everything is a square. Your body is a big square, with a smaller square (the head, which stupidly bobbles left and right any time you move your mouse), and two little squares (the arms) on the side of the big square. Despite this I do like the lighting effects and post-processing. The animations are like pixel ragdolls.. It's strange. There are different characters to choose from, all with different abilities. I thought that it was cool, being able to have a specialty and all. You start off with 4 at the beginning, and get more as you progress through the campaign. Also, I just want to throw out there that if you want to go up a staircase, ladder, etc., you have to 'prepare' it first, and once it's 'prepared', you need to wait for ALL players to go there in order to go up. Hated waiting.  Overall? 4/10.. Others may like this game, but I sure as hell don't. I'll give them points for originality, but that's it. It's not my kind of game.   ",

However, as time goes on, after completing missions here and there, I have realized that most of enjoyment I get out of this game are depending on how well-made the missions are. How fun and challenging they are. Some missions, I can run around attracting all the guards and still complete the missions, I realize that isn't fun at all. So I really suggest to restrict yourself to being a harmless ninja and try to loot everything and escape. Everything else really fall just short.",

EDIT: Someone in some forum explained to me how to switch to single player mode, and I’ve been able to actually play this game. The developers somehow thought that hiding the option and making multiplayer the default was a good idea. You need to have a gamepad and press START to switch to single player.  Anyway, I haven’t enjoyed the game much. Sorry for the lack of details, it’s been a while since I played it. The game didn’t have big flaws that I can remember, except that it wasn’t fun for me.",

In reality this game is 30 seconds of walking around and trying to plan, and suddenly it's all chaos, running around finding hiding places, you loose track of your friends, if anyone chats or speaks over mic it's just 'what is happening' 'where are you' 'where do we go'. Quickly you just find yourself playing your own game, reviving friends, doing something that will hopefully help team to reach the goal... There isnt really much timing with your friends.  The game runs too fast to make strategic decisions. And maybe it was intended to be just casual or for youngsters on speed but if you are someone looking for some coop that requires using brains, I can't recommend it. Its very casual and maybe our expectations were too high for strategic team play.  Maybe we are just too bad in this game. I never quite fully grasped the enjoyment factor for this game. But it might be a good game for you, it´s not for old farts for sure.  Sometimes the teamplay does work, where you proceed together with your friends, but it doesn´t really stand much pressure and turns into solo too easy, where getting the pack together takes a lot of effort.",
