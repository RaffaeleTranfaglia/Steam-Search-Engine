Among the few drawbacks I would note the need for old version of PhysX (cards GeForce 2nd serie for example) and overextendness of some missions.",

The plot opens with a series of terrorist attacks against Saudi oil wells (in reality, saudi oil ensures the wealth of S.A. and there are links between the oil tycoons and terrorist groups, so they're cutting themselves off from their money supply) which are funded by the Taliban. The Americans intervene, stationing troops in Saudi Arabia, while a popular revolt (including the Saudi Generals) tries to take over. The King (arrogant, ignorant, dodgy accent) and his advisors (simpering, flattering, also dodgy accent) flee while the American forces rush in to save the day.",
