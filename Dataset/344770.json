            "review_text": "I don't write reviews often. However in some cases where something exceptional is made i will. Something that i can either put my time to for extremely long periods, enjoy it to a maximum extent where nothing gives me hesitation or where my very outlook on certain things change entirely. This visual novel bought out both 2 and 3 of these 3 reasons.  The art/style: The visuals are absolutly stunning, amazing barely covers it. I presonally love it and feel that it adds a lot to the visual novel with the different backgrounds, charater designs, and effects. The intro and credits are the only two 'movie' cg throughout the game but are well done for how short they are both explaining the latest events from fault milestone 1 and the aftermath of whats happened in this visual novel. The CG itself is beautiful and again really shows off the skill and talent at Alive in Dissonance. This game is visually stunning in every detail  The story: (No spoilers) The story took me about 4-5 hours to complete. This is fairly short but don't go into it expecting to read little. In the time given the story explodes with absolute moments of intensity, moments of calm (including in the menu screen) moments of disbelief and one moment of genuine anger towards a charcter. It was filled wit a lot of emotions. Also desipte its size this visual novel can be both for casual readers and those are looking for something that truly surfices their reading needs. I will say this as well. The way the story moves forward is smooth. There are no points i felt it was rushed or needed to be sped up. Unlike the fault milestone 1 i felt i could have read this visual novel the whole way through in one sitting with no problems at all (not to say fault milestone 1 was bad because it isn't).   The characters: There are 3 main characters, multiple sub characters and the main bad group of enemies. The 3 main characters develop an ever bigger sense of self showing their personalities even more so then they already had been. Providing a new outlook on them especially with Rune and Selphine. Sadly with Ritona although we don't see much change in personality or even development in her overall character. We do get a new side of her compared to Fault Milestone 1 that is caused mainly by the events of Fault Milestone 1 as well as an event that occurs within Fault Milestone 2.  The new characters you meet as well as old characters from Fault Milestone 1 were somehow all unique and none felt they were wasted or pointless at all. One thing that was interesting is the fact that even characters who had little to no input into the story still had actual character models made for them. Hell a few characters you never even found out their name. I'm espeically interested in what will happen with Flora, Misha and Riggs.  Next the group of 'enemies' now due to my no spoiler review this will be harder to explain. We see barely anything about them again in 2 however we do get a little bit of interest from the leader. Learning her power and even her breaking the 4th wall very slightly. It gave a whole insight into what Ritona and Selphine are up against when returning home to Rughzenhide.   Replayability: Although i find it hard to replay most visual novels without having a very large gap inbetween play times. I can very easily see myself replaying this. It left me wanting, no craving for Fault Milestone 2 : below. I really cannot wait to see how the story progresses.  Music: The soundtrack and effects made are truly incredible. They push forth what the scene is trying to make you feel. Anger, Sadness, Intensity. The general mood in visual novels hinges by a pivot and the music really sets the mood into what the writers clearly wanted the mood to feel like for the reader. The soundtrack is great but doens't have anything in my mind that stood out such as The fruit of grisaia's Home (for Amane) or Holograph (for Sakaki) in Their respective routes.  Overall: I really really enjoyed this visual novel. No ifs or buts about it. It was a massive improvement on what was already a good 1st game. Although we are left with a lot of unanwsered questions I got a brilliant amount of satisfaction from the game. I would highly recommend trying it.   However for the love of god play through the 1st fault milestone. If you do not you may be very confused as to what is going on.  Final score 10/10 At the least a must try. After reading through this visual novel i'd be happy paying for it at full price despite how short it may seem.",

This is a direct sequel to the first game so playing it before starting the sequel is absolutely necessary to fully experience the masterpiece that Alice in Dissonance has given birth to.  This game is one of the rare sequels that manages to surpass its predecessor. The visuals are captivating and the soundtrack is absolutely stunning.   Fault milestone 2 side: above 's strongest point is without a doubt, its  incredible story . Filled with joy, grief, anger, suspense, and depth, there is never a dull moment. The connection that you feel with all the characters and their experiences is what truly makes  Fault milestone  worth playing.  As with its prequel, the game's only downside is that there is no voice acting, however, even this can lead to a more fulfilling experience. By lacking the elements that voice acting provides you with, it forces you to fulfill this void with your own interpretations of the characters; further deepening the connections you establish with them  If you're debating whether to buy this game or not, the answer is to get it immediately. You will not regret spending a single penny on this series.    Story: 10/10 Visuals: 9.5/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Characters: 9/10 Overall: 9.5/10 ",

            "review_text": "Woohoo! More cute anime girls involved in crazy violence!  Fault 2 is a direct sequel to Fault 1, so you shouldn't even touch this game until you have played the first one. While there is a recap video... no. Just play the first one entirely before getting into this. It's worth it.  So is this, actually. Whereas Fault 1 introduced you to Selphine and Ritona before becoming the Rune show, Fault 2's storyline has other characters playing notable roles while still being chiefly about the thee main characters. Selphine in particular has alot to do in this part of the story, and you get to see a side of her that is the polar opposite of the huggly princess we met in Fault 1. Different to such a degree that it might frighten the player just as much as the other characters to see how much she changes. Naturally all of this is explained in the story itself, but I am not going to dig into that here because spoilers.  The story itself is still short, but if anything the quality has only increased this time. This is helped by the quality soundtrack, a far larger number of pretty CG images, and a few moments of good animation you don't usually see in VN's. Still no voice acting sadly, but that's just something you have to live with. Also, just as in the first game, Fault 2 makes some commentary on things in our world that should change. Specifically, this game digs into class divides, racism, organized crime, and even takes time to give us an internet metaphor to say that internet trolls are boring people who need to find better hobbies. XD  The game isn't perfect though. The ending is even more abrupt this time and leaves several plots dangling until the next chapter picks them up again. You go back to Rughzenhaide to meet some new characters and then... poof! Not that I minded too much because I was way more interested in what psycho Selphine was doing, but still I wonder where exactly that subplot was going. The major stuff with Ritona is left unresolved, which is kind of one of the major plot elements of the game's second half. When the game suddenly ended without this being resolved, I felt a bit cheated. Lastly, we still don't know what the hell is driving Melano, Sian, Koko, and Mharie towards all the violence we saw them perform in the opening of the first game. They want to kill Selphine? Ok we got that... but why? I know this is pretty much the core of the plot, but some progress here would have been nice. Overall I felt like this game ended too suddenly and is worse off because of it.  This is a really good VN and a worthy sequel that just... ended way too suddenly. Even moreso than Fault 1 did. I was thoroughly enjoying this until the credits started rolling. Considering it was nearly a year since the first game came out, I'd expect a similar wait for Fault 3 is to be expected. Taking that into consideration, ALICE IN DISSONANCE really dropped the ball by having my last impression of this game not be how awesome it was for it's duration, but that it had a ♥♥♥♥ ending.  I really hate when a game I really like has such a glaring flaw that I almost want to give it a negative review. But... I still enjoyed the game and am looking forward to seeing what happens next. A game I would throw under the bus would leave me apathetic rather than intrigued, so... this gets a 'yes' from me despite the fact that I am giving ALICE IN DISSONANCE the kind of scary death glares that Selphine was giving throughout this game. Please don't ever do that again, or I just might be forced to rage at Fault 3 when that eventually comes out.  Beware! For I have a scary side too! O_O  EDIT: Apparently this is just the first half of Fault 2, with the second half coming later. I still think the ending was abrupt and that splitting the game was probably a bad idea... but I may have to edit this review once the second half shows up... whenever that may be.",

For a kinetic novel, Fault Milestone Two has pushed boundaries with its camera work, parallax depth and execution - very new and memorable. There's a lot of political and philosophical exploration along with a developing fantasy setting. Aside from the initial info-dump of exposition in the beginnings of the first novel, the story has been doing great world-building and subplots ever since, continued nicely in Milestone Two. The music does not have any standout themes, but they are cinematic in nature and very suitable for the scenes in which they are used, improved over the prequel. Perhaps the only downsides are the cliffhangers at the end of each novel (although it was very jarring in milestone one, this one wasn't so bad) and the length, but as someone who has read a lot of these, the price is justified for the production that goes into this particular series.  Highly recommended for visual novel enthusiasts who care about good narrative, or newcomers who want to see what this medium is capable of.",

This is ment to be a review for Fault milestone two, the second Part of the Fault-series by Alice in Dissonance 'Btw: My opinion in general is based on milestone one + milestone two'   First things first:  I highly recomend reading 'Fault milestone one' first!, as the story of the second milestone continues where the first ends.   Like on my previous review on Fault milestone one, i may remind of the great story development, magnificent art-style and of course the perfectly fitting music.   To be honest, i don't know where to start... I just finished the VN a few moments ago... Let me tell you one thing, this novel gets emotional. I'm still kind of stunned by the events the protagonist had to face...  It leaves me with the desire to keep on reading...  [If only they already had the third part done and released, I'd be reading it now Q_Q].   What are Flora, Misha and Riggs gonna do? What happend to Ritona...? Is that 'doctor' to be trusted...?   Those 'Spoiler'-questions are running through my head right now :P...  I've read many Visuel Novels, but only a few gave me such an emotinal feeling, which I am not able to describe. At this point i want to thank everyone who participated in creating this VN for giving us such a marvelous display of synergy between storytelling, music, and artwork...  If I compare milestone two, to milestone one, I remain awestruck, seeing how much they have improved. I found this amount of improvement unprecedented, at least i can't think of another case right now.  I just hope milestone three or, if i got it correctly 'milestone two: below' [as the second one seems to have been splitted into two parts] will be out soon, for I'd be finally able to continue reading ... \\(^.^)/  I'd like to say this IS one of my favourite Visuel Novels out there!

I've seen enough VNs to know that this is a tier above the rest. I can't promise a perfect interface, but the story imho is much more than worth it, though I don't think the interface has any overt flaws right now anyway.  On the other hand, if you have no idea what a visual novel is, then think of it like a cross between a book and a video. Clicking through the pages to see it at your own pace. This is very much not a game in the traditional sense, but if you enjoy a good story, I'd highly suggest buying or trying the demo for fault milestone one.

            "review_text": "A marked improvement over (the already very good!) fault Milestone One in every single way!  The visuals in particular stand head and shoulders over just about any VN I've read. The CG and character art is at least as good as the first but there is now roughly twice as many CG images as Milestone One despite this installment being slightly shorter than the first (more on that further down).   But, even more than that, the clever '3D Camera' system that has been added extracts so much more from each image by the clever way it pans and zooms around the images during dialogue and action-y sequences (rather a lot of those this time!). Coupled with the typical changes in expression of the characters and other subtle changes it created a great sense of movement and pace without actual animation. You'll understand what I mean when you see it in action!  The story and dialogue itself as excellent and they have definitely addressed one of the key criticisms of Milestone One with it's unnecesery.. wordiness in a small number of scenes. Things feel a lot more punchy and to the point this time; the plot itself is generally a lot more fast paced in this installment so it suits it well.   This time Selphine and Rune take center stage and Ritona sits out much of the story for plot reasons. I feel there's some great development in Rune's character as she becomes more sure of herself culminating in one seriously epic scene that I won't spoil here. :) And you'll certainly see a very different, ah, 'side' of Selphine throughout the story too...  However, Rhegan has to be my favourite character of this part. It's easy to dismiss her as just a *censored* when she first appears, but I guarentee she will grow on you as you come to understand her throughout the story; I came to respect her a great deal if not necessrily 'like' her. Her ruthlessness is certainly no facade but she has damned good reasons for being as such; that and her sharp cunning serves the girls well.   As negatives.. well the character art of the side characters is of markedly lower quality than that of the main characters. Understandable, sure, but when the quality of everything else is so excellent in contrast you can't help but notice.   Also this is only the first half of Milestone Two due to a decision to split it into two releases. As such there are rather a number of plot threads that are raised but left unresolved. Though the central plot 'side:above' centers around is concluded and it doesn't exactly end on a cliffhanger like Milestone One did it's a little frustrating knowing I'll be waiting rather a while to see certain events resolved.   Alice in Dissonance is onto something very, *very*, special with the fault series and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves so they can keep it going for a long time to come!",

For more than half of game Ritona is out of focus and focus on Selphine and Rune's sheltered naivety and their interaction how to deal with 'real world' instead.   9/10 Enjoyed it, it's worth every penny to buy it on launch.

They are both fantasy/sci-fi kinetic visual novels made by Project Written.   milestone two side:above  is definitely a step above  fault milestone one  in more ways than one, but also seems to fall flat in some areas.   WARNING: Spoilers may be present     Visuals  Is it as most, if not all visual novels, not a demanding game. So when I booted up the game for the first time, I noticed there were close to no display settings. Something that should be absolutely vital for this type of game. There were no resolution options, which was the worst offender in my book. True, there weren't such an option in milestone one either, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be there.   Please fix this for  milestone two side:below , Project Written   Anyways, as I played the game, I was continuously in awe of the art. It was bright and vibrant when it needed to be, and also dark and menacing when it didn't. All of this mixed in with Project Written's new 3D camera technology makes the world of fault seem much more alive than ever.   Audio  99% of the music for  side:above  was made by Project Written's in-house composer, who managed to make all the music fit the situations in which it was applied. Only once did I feel the music go on for too long, and that wasn't as much a melody as it was ambience. Now, where the audio truly shines, is when it combines fitting music and sound effects. There are moments where something really intense happens, and not only does the music increase in intensity, but the applied sound effects are equally tense. It is overall a great improvement over milestone one.   Story  The game starts off with introducing new players to the story by providing a short 'previously on fault' clip that vaguely explains what happened in milestone one. This is all fine and dandy. Can't blame Project Written for wanting to still earn money on their previous installment. Anyways, this is where the game falters a bit. It starts out strong with a 'kill-or-be-killed situation' between what I assume is the main antagonist and our party of homesick travellers. Unfortunately, this is as good as it gets throughout the whole game. An incredibly well placed   intentional game crash   really nails the point of helplessness our protagonists are experiencing at that moment. Don't get me wrong, the story is great. It's just unfortunate that these kinds of 'tricks' aren't used again throughout the rest of the game. The pace is very calm for most of the game, and only picks up the pace near the end.  I must warn fans: The demo is way too long compared to the full release, so if you played that first, then it might seem too short. I personally felt like it was too short after having played through the demo before-hand.    Conclusion  The game looks great, sounds great and manages to pull you in from the get-go. With the great synergy of the fantastic visuals, amazing audio and a great story, the game managed to make me experience a wide range of emotions, but never did much with it. There were times when I was sad, but never enough to shed tears. The story isn't bad, it just feels like there could have been so much more.  It is without a doubt one of the best visual novels out there. You won't regret it if you're into fantasy/sci-fi. And for fans of the previous installment, it'll be a treat for you either way. Just don't be shocked if you find it a bit short after having played the demo (It is ridiculously long after all).   Even with it's faults, I'm still gonna recommend it to fans of the series. I can't say the same for new players though. Play  milestone one  before you play this.  In the end, I for one, am still looking forward to both  Silence the Pedant  and  side:below .",

The story is more tightly written, showing the creators had learnt much from the first outing, and is relentlessly addictive.  Unlike the first outing, fault milestone two side:above actually compelled me to finish the whole visual novel in 2 sittings. The story manages to explore the consequences of unregulated capitalism, imperialism, and moral choices through simple dialogue. And without me having to make a single choice throughout the visual novel.  Whatever the next story will be, I am hooked into the fault milestone universe, and am eagerly awaiting the sequel!",

The cinematic movements of the images really affect the situation and emotions in the story. more and more CGs are added with the graphic style which personally i really loved. showing those emotions, characteristic, and action with such strength and elegance. Musics are great, adding up with the story and it increased the immersion to the story. Lastly, the amazing new character with their own special characteristic that mixed with the story really nicely. Sadly, i thought that milestone two side:above is way too short. but i'm really looking forward for the next episode. Amzingly done. (8/10)",

This is an amazing story, what else is their to say. The characters are great, the world is interesting, the story is just all around wonderful. If you played the first one and liked it, why haven't you got this already? The cliffhanger and amazingness of the first one should have already more than enough reason to continue this masterpiece of a story.",

Where milestone one ended, milestone two starts, with the same very good story with charming and well developed characters.  If you are a Visual Novel lover then don't let this gem be missing from your collection.  It's just a bit short, but worth it anyway :)",

If you haven't touched the first one you'd hardly get any of the story so definitely check that out first. Without going into much detail, the story progresses as if it is a sequel in the way that it starts off slower and methodical like the first part did, but as the game get's on it's hard to stop playing it. Then when it hits the 'hard to stop' phase the climax hits and you're left with another cliffhanger, but to be honest I really don't care cause this is the first visual novel series I could see myself getting into.  As part 1 did, it brought of interesting concepts of society and the human mind into consideration when put together. There's many ways to look at the plot making the game replayable possibly in the future. Now all I have to do is... ..... ....... wait for the next part.",

Characters are fun, story is heartwarming, and everything else that made the first game nice...except Ritona doesn't get as much screentime in this one (I think she will probably be a bigger focus whenever they release side:below). and the moment that gives you the 'Are you listening now' achievement uses a trope that I absolutely love (also it was completely horrifying in the most wonderful of ways).",

To me, the key of the story is how the Princess grows and through that process guide people around her to grow. The 'side story' of how she incites the poor and common folk to rebel, to me, was the key for the whole game.   PS: Did not like the deux ex machina crap at the start of the game though.",
