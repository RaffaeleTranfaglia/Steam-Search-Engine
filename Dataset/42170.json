There are places where you cant click to walk just because its the boundries but you should be able to click there and have your character move to the closest spot to that location, but that ma just be me. Theres not a whole lot of customization. i dont really have anything to much more about it but. its decent for the price it may just take a little longer to get you'st to it.

Also, it being made by FatShark means it has it's fair share of glitches, but it's suprisingly nothing too gamebreaking. I reccommend this to you if you enjoy loot-fest RPGs.

This is an Action-RPG that is similiar to Dungeon Siege in that you control more than one party member at a time. You control three party members at once.  Character death in this game is natural and permenant. Death is to be expected and characters are quick to level up. The only thing you will lose when a character dies is the loot on the character.  Your character has 15 implant slots and 5 booster slots per skill, with two skills per character. Implants increase character stats and boosters either upgrade or add to what a skill does.  There is a lot of depth hidden in this game that is not apparent unless a player thinks about it. It can be played casually but only the most hardcore of players will have the best experience.

My perk was never fulfilled, and they barely had any support. There were multiple different tiers of backing, including one for 10,000$. This company is among the most dishonest in the business. The game had a ton of potential, and it was just abandoned, like they do with literally every other game they release.

            "review_text": "I feel bad for Krater  You don't have to be good at RPG's or even played Krater as a whole game to notice that it has some great missed potentials. It makes me just sad to see it there on my desktop catchng dust after the first four plays. But... I am not gonna let you stay in the dark with the reason why though; point1 - the freedom you get from it In Krater, you have the freedom to pick from 4 different classes, build a team out of them how ever it pleases you, change the loadout of your characters and get to explore a variating postapocalyptic version of what seemed to be Sweden. now to be honest:some classes are just obviously overpowered compared to others (slayer to regulator) you have eight and i am not joking here, EIGHT different skills to chose from in the entire game. Each class has two and the teams you build can have three characters maximum.  Now to the loadout. Every character has two slots in the inventory. One for a weapons and one for a gadget. each weapong can only be used by one class and they normaly differ from one another like some flowerpots. And finally the map: instant traveling to a point on the map is not only a thing required to get from one end of the game to another, it's also slow as hell because you get to see a little blinky ping representing your team going wherever you told it to on the map in a speed that makes you wonder if in postapocaliptic sweden legos spawn from the ground or shoes were entirely eradicated or both. Also the levels are either so small that you can call them 'tight' or are equaly tight tunnel systems who seamingly end up in postapocalyptic Russia.   Point 2 - Atmosphere It is obvious that alot of love went into the graphical developement of Krater but there are still some things just get annoying over time; NPC's mainly looking like each other, a notexisting plot and the music. Whith 'a nonexisting plot' I just want to underline that the game starts with all your characters being kicked of a town which they seem to have drunkenly terrorised and joining some kind of mercenary force which operates all over Krater. BAM raiders, freediggers, wildlife, reference to a country which cannot totaly be a reference to Germany  ....WHAT?!  why is everyone having bears and mooses in ther cellars? Why am I fighting people who dig holes into their own property? Oh wait... I am not fighting them? And why do i still not know any main villain? AND WHY HAS EVERYONE BECOME PYRO?! (ok the last one was unnecessary) Last point was also listing the music... Well, this is what disappointed me the most about the game; there are 18 tracks in this game which are used as themes for the different places, but why do 17 of them sound almost the same?! I literaly tried to memorize them as different songs with all their particularities but still: 17 of them sound like one giant synthetic smooth jazz remix and one is a rock song, but you have practicaly no chance whatsoever to tell the most from each other! I wish they had put in some more different sounds into this game. the atmosphere is just depressing if every place sounds the same! And I mean the bad kind of depressing. Also the music is nothing special. Not only is the music not changing, but it's not even good.  Although it's a failure in my eyes and a waste of money I just can't stop myself from feeling pity for it. Thanks for reading everyone.",

It's got party selection and active combat. It's got some crafting and inventory management.  What it lacks, ultimately, is soul.
