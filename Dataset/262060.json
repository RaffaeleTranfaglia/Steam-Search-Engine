            "review_text": "With all the negative reviews lamenting the changes made since the game was originally put on Early Access, I feel like I need to throw some positivity into the mix, because this game is amazing.  I've been playing on and off since it was first put on Steam, and am aware of the various changes which have been made throught each iteration of the game. To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.  The changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision—your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle.   Back before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.  TL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.  As for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits. There is some aspect of grind, and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming, but I enjoyed myself the whole time.  If you're on the fence with the one, the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy. It's not for everyone, and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if you're not into that sort of thing. Still, I recommend this game to everyone I know, and it gets a big thumbs up here.",

            "review_text": "This game rewards the chicken-hearted. Stubbornly trying to finish a dungeon that's gone badly from the start leads to a deathmarch.  This game rewards the detail-minded. Did you remember to unequip your trinkets? Did you re-equip them? Did you check to see if that monster is going to easily resist that attack? Dude, did you even make a provisions checklist?  This game rewards the heartless. Sometimes the best thing to do with a syphilic, boozed-up 'hero' with a bad case of nerves is to fire her. Sometimes deciding to let her die of a heart attack gets you a shiny.  This game rewards the persistent. Not giving up after a humiliating party wipe is more of a key to success than flashes of tactical brilliance. Completing the game in less than 99 weeks (each week is a dungeon run that takes up to half an hour) is considered fast and gets you an achievement.  This game rewards the flexible. Sometimes you don't have a lot of choices. Your healers are all too diseased and crazy this week. Your tank went AWOL, and your barbarian needs to have a pesky trait removed. Can you scrape together a viable party? Or maybe your tactics went well only up to a point. Will you come up with new ones or will you pack it in, mumbling bitterly about the unfairness of it all?  It's not for everybody.",

            "review_text": "Outdated review. Havent played it before its release. So, please, take this review with a grain of salt.  It really pains me to say but i cant recommend this game now. Not because it is hard or unfair sometimes (now many more times after the last update). I actually only lost 5 characters that i cared about in this game in my whole time playing it while the rest were just poor souls i sent to their doom in lower levels to pass the time. So you can see im not one of 'i lost 50 characters, this game is bad'. The problem is is that with the last update they just murdered the sense of progression and the freedom you had to try different strategies, not to mention that there is little reward.    I cant feel playing this game right now because i dont want to catch new heroes, get lucky with some quirks, lock them and see them become useless because almost all enemies now are able to apply debuff. When in a single turn those precious quirks i locked in some characters make them as useless as a character with no positive quirk, i stopped caring for them. Why would i care for a vestal with higher hp, dodge and speed if she can lose it all in a single turn? Why would i care for a lepper that have extra res in some status since the enemies that apply them buff them? What is the point of making a character unique? There is none, period. The devs just thought it was a good idea to m ake enemies able to debuff with their attacks (note, they didnt get any single new attack. Their attacks can si mply apply debuff and that is it now.) while giving nothing new to players to counter these tactics.   'Oh, there are trinkets that make your character debuff res higher'. Well, that's exactly when they start murdering the freedom. I dont want to go all 4 characters with one of the two slots availables for accesories to carry the same trinket while having only one room available for a trinket i would like. What is the point of getting new trinkets, try nem combinations of trinkets? None. That's that. I dont like being unable to create badass characters just the way i could. FYI, i went with a character with trinkets that gave him around 40 dodge in a level 0 run. That is a great number of dodge if you dont know the game. And the character is very fragile. No high hp, no way to buff his survival. Nothing. GHuess what, engage in a combat, 2 round later, his dodge was greatly decreased. And that was with the caracter with highest dodge from my party, you can imagine how 'open' the other 3 were. Im not gonna to mention that 2 of these guys got more debuff as well.   It sound terrible, right? But, hey, cant you buff your characters? Yes, you can. But here is the thing, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BUFF SKILL YOU CANT MATCH THE ENEMY'S DEBUFF. Simply as that. I think the aoe debuff i suffered is -10 for stack. and that for low level characters (you cant bring high level characters to lower level dungeons). The highest buff for aoe dodge i can remember is 9. Exactly, 9, from a high level character. And a low level enemy can already outmatch him if im not wrong with the values. Nevertheless, even if the debuffs werent so severe, i dont like the idea of wasting one turn to buff a debuff. Simply because in a wasted turn is just the opportunity for an enemy to wreck you. And in this rng based rpg(dont listen to people that says that this game is very skill dependent. Even with top characters and trinkets, you could face some really bad situations) that can be very, very dangerous.   But, hey, that is not over yet. Ohh, you may start thinking 'What, this is worse than it already is?'... And the answer is: yes. Here's the thing, now the devs implemented alongside with this atrocious debuff horde that you should be penalized if you are wasting time in combat. That includes buffing and healing your party. Exactly, it includes it. And it can be even worse than that. I was penalized because i applied a debuff to one guy, used heal in my party and let the two last guys attack the last enemy but it still survived. Oh, i was penalized because the guy survived. No, he didnt attack me or something. I got a stress attack (stress are almost a second health bar in this game. If you let it go too high... You might face serious, serious problems. In some extreme cases, your character dies). I gave up at that point. I was already winning the battle but it just felt i was being penalized even by playing right. What is the point of trying new strategies when the game focus now only on killing your enemies or else you're wasting turns? I dont feel like it anymore, dont want to try new strategies, specially considering ill know that in some fights ill have to 'waste time' taking care of my group because i dont want to let them die.   I have to write more about the trinkets as well, for newcomers, since they are one of the main rewards of the quests. A great number of them, include the most rare ones, 'ancestral trinkets', are useless or unworthy. Really, the majority of top tier rarity trinkets are useless and easily overshadowed by other 'not so rare' trinkets. The same rule aplies to the 'Very rare' trinkets, which is one tier below. This happens because all of them have some drawbacks (- speed, -dodge) that make them less worth to use. And with the new patch, more of them became even more useless, which ends with the game being less rewarding. And, with all the bs the devs put now, there is really no reason for you to go to a boring quest suffer stress just to get an useless trinket.   The another reason that made this game even less rewarding is that the gold you get with quests became more useless. You use them to prepare your party for quests and upgrade skills and equipments (you can only get new armor and weapon this way). And you could spend any ammount of gold to prepare your group. Now, the devs got a brilliant idea: let's make the itens you buy limited. Yay. It's not like you already have a very small inventory if you want to be 100% prepared for everything and you want the rewards... Well, you can use gold to buy trinkets as well, but the majority of them are useless. So... No reason anymore to have tons of gold. And even less reason to play this game.    Well, that is why i gave up with this patch. Not willing to try finding better trinkets, that are so few. The majority of them you may not use EVER. And that list may have just got bigger since now you'll have to focus on debuff res. Dont feel like trying to make builds for some places. Hero that gets more attacks, hero that endures more damage because i know they will get debuffed some way in most of the times which will render the advantages useless and the time i waste creating one completly unrewarded. And the freedom i had to try new party compositions, new strategies, finding sinergy with skills is vanished, since i have to focus more than anything at obliterating my enemies before they obliterate me. cant go with a party that is 'slow but safe'. Have to go with higher risk. But, like i said many times, no reward for me.   I really enjoyed this game, i really did. even in times i felt it was unfair, i could overlook these moments and still have fun and be glad i overcame them. Now, since the best the devs have done to 'rise the challenge' is simply make it even more luck based than ever, i gave up. They crossed the line of hard but rewarding to luck and unrewarding. And i cant feel any longer the will to play it, praying that my group gets luck, that in one round i dont get debuff to oblivion and be left with useless characters for the rest of the fight. That isnt skill reliable. Whoever think it is is completly mistaken. Gonna miss the art, music, dialogue and lore from this game. But, unless the devs do something about this, i guess ill watch the rest of the game on youtube. Far more enjoyable for me and less stressful",

            "review_text": "I want to start by saying I had already played this game in the past, before there were even secondary bosses or a Cove area, and I did so for very, very long. it was an intensely fun and rewarding experience, and it absolutely made me think it would be money well spent to acquire it for myself when it was finished. Hell, I'd have payed twice its price tag, to get a completed game which was that enjoyable.  I received it as a gift from a friend recently and was positively overjoyed, I could not wait to come back and see all that was added in this past half year. I created a new save file, started playing... and despaired. But I decided to keep playing, and to not stop playing until I had seen all the changes and could properly grasp what the game presently had to offer.  So it is now, after over 30 hours of gameplay time, that I want to write this review and say that I do NOT, in any way or form, recommend this game as it currently is. It is no longer the game I played back then. It has changed into something that is barely recognizable; it -is- technically the same game, but it most definitely does not feel the same. And it comes nowhere near what it once was in terms of enjoyment.  I've read many bits and pieces of (sometimes conflicting) information as to why this happened, namely:  -A highly-vocal group of 'fans' steering this game into its sad current state -Developers which have a very particular vision for this game, and scour strategy guides and topics for things to nerf in order to take away any and all slight advantages a player could afford  So before I get into any details, I want to make this clear: I am not familiar to any such forum drama, I do not know who holds the blame, and I have no idea whatsoever as to why the game changed into what it is today. The one thing I know for certain is: it did change. Badly.  This game is now unquestionably an anti-fun game. By 'anti-fun' I don't mean overly hard, I don't mean overly grindy, I don't mean overly complex. I mean it is a game that seems carefully tailored to remove all sense of fun from playing it. Practically all enjoyment is gone, all progression feels meaningless for the most part, all achievements help you in basically no way whatsoever.  Chief among the worst offenders are two mechanics: corpses and heart attacks. And yes, I know you can turn corpses off, but then we are not playing the game 'the way it's meant to be played', we are not experiencing all it has to offer. And so, to elaborate:   Heart attacks - having a hero reach the 100 stress threshold was already a terrible thing to happen before, in a GOOD way. It was a challenge to be overcome, it was an entertaining encumbrance. That lone hero would bring the entire party down the path of stress soon enough, and you'd usually end up with a group of raving lunatics cutting themselves, refusing heals, shuffling about, acting on their own... and a lone hero who passed the Virtue check going strong and carrying the expedition. It was a predicament, it was not a situation you wanted to be in at all, but it was FUN.  This is not the case anymore. Stress accumulation is now roughly 2-3x higher than it once was, everything stresses out our heroes greatly and continuously. And it doesn't stop at 100 with a potentially compromising situation which would force you to seriously consider withdrawal, while still having a chance to go forth in case other conditions were favorable. No, now it NEVER stops, and it is guaranteed to erase hours of game time and tens of thousands of gold that you spent treating, training, and equipping the heroes that WILL inevitably die from it at some point. You used to be able to bring a mildly-stressed hero on an expedition; doing so now is signing a death sentence for that hero and possibly the others as well, and a virtual guarantee that the expedition will fail  I will not even touch with a 10-foot pole how unrealistic it is for everyone to be getting heart attacks left and right, and will simply leave it at: This is not fun. This is not acceptable, even. It is not enjoyable to have to constantly be worried because stress, something you can't effectively heal from, is an ever-present threat of almost instant death, which, thanks to this game's unforgiving RNG and mechanics, is VERY usually the same as instant death. Heart attacks could maybe, -maybe- be acceptable if they happened at 300 stress. And this is still a VERY big maybe. But as it is, it is undeniably an anti-fun mechanic that serves only to aggravate players for things we are unable to control.  -------------------  Corpses - This is by far the worst offender of the two, and that's without even touching how stupidly unrealistic it is for a lone, butchered body to be effectively keeping an enemy out of our reach. This mechanic kills the utility of certain classes, artificially inflates the usefulness of certain skills which, for the most part, are otherwise generally useless, and perhaps most importantly it can cause catastrophic situations for essentially no logical reason. Enemies are -never- inconvenienced by corpses unless we use a move skill on them, and even then, most enemies will quickly return to their preferred position since every other skill of theirs causes them to move in their preferred direction. It is simply and legitimately a mechanic meant to drain the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the game, causing us to need more turns to take out a priority target that's out of reach, thus taking more damage and stress for, again, -no reason whatsoever-.  But I want you to fully appreciate the actual stupidity of this mechanic. Corpses appear when the enemy is killed with regular damage that isn't a critical hit, which is like 90% of all killing blows, give or take. If the enemy is killed by a critical hit, bleed damage, or blight damage, there won't be a corpse. BUT:  -If the enemy is bleeding/blighted, and is killed with a regular attack, there will still be a corpse!... that is bleeding/blighted. For some eldritch reason, if the enemy doesn't have those last 2 HP taken by bleed or blight damage, it suddenly turns into a corpse that CAN take a load more bleed and blight damage. Absolutely fantastic.  -If the enemy is killed by a critical hit that does 2 damage, there won't be a corpse. If the enemy is killed by a regular attack that does 30 damage, there will be a full HP corpse. Being labelled a critical hit apparently means more than what makes critical hits important, which is their damage.  Both of the above points happen for a very simple reason: artificial difficulty. Forcing you to not attack an enemy and kill him instantly this turn, and instead have him bleed out over 2 turns so that you won't be wasting a turn dealing with its corpse. Taking the ability to avoid corpses away from your hands and into the RNG's by making it so the blow has to be a critical hit, and not just a powerful hit. Because attacking bleeding/blighted enemies, or hitting near-death enemies with powerful skills, so that they wouldn't leave corpses behind? Those would be things the player could control, and we wouldn't want that, now would we?  In order to make corpses borderline bearable, at -least- the following changes would be needed:  -Any enemy that dies while bleeding/blighted would leave no corpse -Any damage beyond what is needed to kill the enemy would be subtracted from the corpse's HP. For example, if you deal a 5 damage blow to an enemy with 2 HP, the corpse would lose 3 HP right as it spawned  And again, this is so corpses would be more bearable. It is no substitute for the fact that, much like heart attacks, they shouldn't exist at -all-.  This is a game I loved and I'm actually really sad that this is the state it is currently in. But I cannot, at all, recommend this game. Regardless, I will update this review once the game is completed  UPDATE: Game is completed, nothing really changed.",

            "review_text": "A mutant pig vomited on my character and gave them tapeworm. This made them eat more than their share of food and caused my party to starve at a camp. This caused one of them to become so stressed they abused someone else until they had a heart attack.  I had to send the rest back to town and buy them alcohol, women and let one flagellate themself so they felt better. I get a bill the next day from the brothel saying the Occultist can't come back because of his deviant fetishes. I sent him home; no chill, no dungeons.  11/10 ruin your life.   EDIT / ACTUAL REVIEW:  I have spent some time reading other reviews of Darkest Dungeon and here's some real talk addressing the most common complaints:  1) 'RNG PLEASE!!!'  - Yes this game contains RNG, why not learn to play around that?   Sometimes your Leper will be crit from 100-0 by a fat man in chainmail. Your move Crusader. Man, if only King Arthur, 1st of His Name, Biggest of Jockstraps, Defender of the Realm and Slayer of Harems had thought to bring a band-aid to get Ol' Compost the Leper off of death's door then he might have lived. Oh wait he totally has that skill. You just didn't equip it because biggest sword is best sword. Big RNG crits sink happy little adventurer's ships, so run a very low level heal skill on 3/4 characters and a stun on 1 to keep people alive when terrible things happen. The Leper lives, and you don't have to go home and tell his, ah, remaining foot that the rest won't be coming home. You do get better at the game, you are rewarded by learning from your mistakes. I've run 20-30 level 5 long dungeons in a row without losing a character. To those who say 'TOO MUCH RNG, NOT EVEN A GAME': proper prior planning prevents ♥♥♥♥ (urine) poor performance.  2) 'TRINKETS ARE TRASH, NO REWARD!!!'  - Trinkets have upsides and downsides, why not combine two trinkets? *brainexplosion*  e.g. +30% heals, +20% stress. 'THIS IS TERRIBLE I'LL DIE OF STRESS' says big bubba. Oh wait what's this? A trinket that says -20% stress? What if we added those two together and now suddenly we have a dirty dirty healer at the back of the team that'll poke your organs back in to roughly where they should be. Legendary trinkets are legendary, proper use of them and being able to manage the drawbacks make them very powerful. There's no free hand outs, use strategy and planning to win dungeons.  3) 'THE GAME IS TOO MUCH OF A GRIND!!!'  - If you're taking forever to finish the game, then you're losing too many people. The game is easily finishable within 60 hours. True end game dungeoning can take a long time, because of certain factors which come into effect. However at the end game there are catch-up mechanics to speed up levelling and get you where you need to be fast. Procedurally generated rogue-like games such as this, you are essentially doing one dungeon after another. The only time it becomes monotonous is when you can play the game safely every time, and by then you should be finishing the end game bosses, which have their own surprises.  I wholly recommend this game to people who are fine with: 1) Difficult gameplay, where consequences are real. 2) Brothels 3) Tentacles",

Unfortunately, as a completionist, I wanted to see the game finished- and thats when I found myself bogged down in an grind of repetitive encounters and contrived hurdles that function only to lengthen, not enhance, the core campaign.

I never opened the settings menu to enable or disable game mechanics, because I think this game should be experimented in an artistic and sensorial way, not in a rational one (criticizing mechanics and so on).  This game is about the fragile human psyche and the illusion of faith and earthly pleasures used as a placebo in a desperate attempt to avoid its fracture. Strategy is nothing when Fate itself is against you, and this is represented by a lot of game statistics being expressed by percentages. Human skill is useless against timeless horrors: one can only hope to succeed out of a burst of good luck. This game is capable of keeping constantly high my level of anxiety during missions (with even victory resulting in a somewhat negative situation... followed by all the mental and physical consequences the heroes must face) and my level of discouragement while managing the hamlet (with all the heroes getting sick, mad, asking not to be sent again down there...)  Maybe I like this game because it 'sees' life as I do: I'm quite pessimist, thus I think that chances are always against me, hope is just a childish feeling to me (but I'm not completely hopeless), I'm stubborn and tend to recover from setbacks out of pride. But I'm prone to frustration too, so I greatly dislike unfair games, like Darkest Dungeon can be quite often...  I could not get frustrated by it till now though, like I could easily get by a bad serie of 'aseptic' dice rolls for example: in fact in Darkest Dungeon things go terribly wrong in such a dramatic end elegant way that all I can think about is only the epicness of my defeat, with the music that becomes more and more pressing and anxiogenic as the hope of victory fades away...  I admit it: Sometimes I ragequit, sometimes I facepalmed, some other times I watched the screen in disappoint and disbelief... as if I really was In that dungeon with those poor souls called 'heroes' by some townsfolk, and surrendered like them to some nasty mental derangement for just a second...  This game awakened in me again the fear of bosses, because they're overpowered and there is permadeath. Characters are designed to be anti-heroes, and this concept reaches its apotheosis when a pious paladin succumbs to his inner selfishness and show himself as the frail human he actually is. And what should that paladin think when a distrusted abomination reacts to his stress with virtue and valor instead (a rare event indeed)?  As you have seen, I have not covered any technical aspect in this review because I think that If you look for the gameplay, mechanics or strategy aspects in this game... well this is not the game for you.

Your enemies are wretched creatures, mad, undead or the disgusting outcomes of the most horrible experiments since that one time when Metallica decided to make an album with Lou Reed.Your 'heroes' are a band of outcasts, fight for their own causes, have wierd manias and personalities, go mad and endanger all that you have been working for.

And then there is also your Plague doctor, who refuses to leave the local church and the Graverobber who has become addicted to more substances than Lindsey Lohan.

Claims that the game is completely unbalanced are overstated, as once you get a hang of the mechancis, you'll be able to overcome about seventy-five to ninty percent of the game's challenges whether you happen to be particularly good at the game or not.   And then, you'll spawn a dimensional shambler, randomly, not by interacting with the curio,walking down the hall in a short level one dungeon with a party that couldn't hope to deal with such a creature at full health, not to mention while exploring the very last hallway on low health after 'completing' the dungeon. You won't be allowed to run away or withdraw and your stressed out heroes will do stupid things that will get the whole party killed. You'll watch helplessly as your party dies. It will have nothing to do with your knowledge of the game or your personal ability, it'll just be random bad luck and either you'll suck it up 'git gud' by senselessly griding out another party of adventurers or you'll go play games that are actually challenging because of the decisions you make rather than completely random rolls on the encounter table. Beating this game isn't so much a question of skill as it is persistence.   It is a testament to how otherwise fun this game is that I'll probably come back in a week or two and pointlessly bang my head against the pseudorandom challenge that is Darkest Dungeon again.",

Progression is slow and unsatisfying, loot is rarely wanted. Treatment subsystems are essentially meaningless due to expense.  To get the things you need to upgrade the hamlet and the few good trinkets that exist, you need to go through higher level dungeons. To go through higher level dungeons, you need higher-level characters. To get higher level characters, you have to put them through the degredation of leveling up, which gives them all sorts of detriments that you can't get rid of because you don't have the money for treatment because you don't have the characters to beat the appropriate dungeons.   So you just hope for an Antiquarian and grind out apprentice dungeons.  Which is for the better, honestly: the apprentice dungeons are where the game is the most fun. Difficulty spikes on veteran dungeons are nothing short of grotesque and will appeal only to a certain subset of players.  It isn't anything like Dark Souls, and more's the pity.  e: Game is recommended with the Lighter Dungeon mod, which alleviates much of the grind and makes it easier to take care of your crew.",

So i decided to do a review myself, cause this game deserves better.  many of which cry about the game being too hard, RNG based and grindy   Challenging and hard  It is a really challenging game, where RNG (luck) is a big part of it, it has alot of high risk small rewards, which makes this game far more challenging then any game that i have played. And you must use alot of time and affort to even come close to getting far.   Repetetive to a certain point  It is also a bit repetetive which alot of players tend to cry about, but that is what you get when the game is all based on random generated events and maps, which i personaly love alot more than short story based game, you can replay the game without it being the same, so replay value is high. And it will take a long time for you to finnish this game. This including myself not even close to finnishing it.   High risk low reward and Grinding  It takes a long time to level up your characters, and when they are full level and fully upgraded, all it takes it 3 deadly blows from an oponent, and the character is dead forever. I find this aspect of the game real challenging and fun. Becouse for once in my life, it is a game which is truly challenging and punished bad mistakes.  As an extra, you need to spend your money in the right way, upgrading and fixing units are quite expencive, which makes money management quite important and hard, considering how little gold you tend to get. The game has alot of grinding, and if you do big risks and you loose it's level and items, you are back to start with a new hero (which cost alot of gold upgrading with better gear). This is a factor which im also a fan of. You get punished for stupid risks and rewarded for doing the right calls.    Should/shouldn't you get this game?    If you like easy games where you can play on easy difficulty, and where you just wounder around with tons of gold. Without a care or challenge and obstacles. DONT get this game.  If you like a game that takes a long time to complete, a game where you will get punished alot for risks you take and being unlucky can ♥♥♥♥ you hard in the butt. Then get this game. But i warn you, if you are planing of finnishing the game, you gonne have a bad time. The further you get, the more imposible it seems to finnish ",

I'm not 'hardcore' and whilst I certainly don't think I'm a 'casual' I'm sure many would say I am.   I dislike hard games overall. Games that are difficult just for the sake of it. I like games that punish me for my mistakes, where there is a constant back and forth. Games shouldn't essentially complete themselves and nor should they make completing them a chore. Darkest Dungeon manages this perfectly. There are punishing mechanics that will constantly knock you down if you make a mistake. I see reviews from people who have encountered this not recommending this game and it physically angers me. Put in some time to learn the game, to learn how it works and you can deal with those mechanics. Nothing is unfair in Darkest Dungeon. Everything is in your control.  People who turn others away from this game because of the difficulty I say this to you: Not everyone is you. Most people will put in the effort to actually play a game and figure out an actual solution to the problem they're faced with. If you want a turn based combat game then yes, this will let you down purely because it is so much more, and it is wrong to refuse to accept what you are offered.   Darkest Dungeon would be an awful game if it was less than it is but all the parts come together to make one well oiled machine that will make a worthy player come back for more time and time again.

            "review_text": "The game is a very flawed but yet beautifull jewel. With that i mean: even though it has an enormous flaw i will still continue to play it and certain people will absolutely love it but i can sadly not recommend the game to people as it is the most rage inducing game i have ever played.  1. Intro The game revolves around one sentance 'make the best of bad situations' and you really get that feeling. Almost every decision will have an upside and a downside thus you have to weight the options. As i said, the entire game revolves around this.   2. The Problem The game is portraied to be very hard, which it is. Good right? -Yes and no, not really to be honest The game relies solely on RNG to make it harder. Almost every decision you make is subject to a dice roll. Even when you did everything you could to stack the odds in your favor you can still lose the roll, this happens far too much to make it feel rewarding when you made a good play.  Eventually you learn that the game wants you to think of your heroes as 'disposable'. Once you learn this you have taken a HUGE step towards becoming better. Awesome. -Yes!  After I progressed through the game I started see a pattern. I was simply recruiting heroes to slam them against a wall hoping it would break. Didn't break? -Recruit new ones and slam them against the wall once more. You start looking for certain types of heroes with certain traits. Which is also 100% subject to RNG. You can get your entire dream party in once day or you can wait 20 years for the right hero with the right traits to pop up.  You can do your best to stack the odds in your favor which helps tremendously but even then it is still based on dice rolls.   Some more examples of RNG: Exploration The game features a 'Torch' mechanic which is fairly straightforward: The brighter the torch the easier yet lower rewards, the dimmer the torch the harder yet greater rewards. It also ties in with the 'Surprise' mechanic: Depending on your torch's light level you can surprise or get surprised. To put it short, the surprised party is in a severe disadvantage. Or so it seems, this is where the combat comes in.  While exploring there are various interactibles scattered throughout the level. You can choose to investigate resulting in your currently selected character to approach the curio and interact with it. This give a positive result or a negative result, both can be a semi-permanent result. This is COMPLETE 100% RNG.   Combat The party consists of 4 heroes. You can assign each of them to a certain location, this is vital if you wish to succeed as all skills require a certain position within the party to be used.  If your party is surprised all your heroes are scattered and the enemy gets to attack you for free. Of course, they get 2-3 free rounds as you are usually still re-positioning your party because otherwise you can barely fight back. Meanwhile the enemy is hitting away at your party. If you are taking care of your torch you will have a lower chance of getting surprised but it is still possible.    CONCLUSION The game starts out awesome and ramps up the awesomeness very quickly. After a short while the fatal flaw becomes visable and you start realising that no matter how much effort you put in, things can still go morbidly wrong.  -Yes, i know this is the entire purpose of the game. The problem is that the way they executed and designed it makes the entire game more and more rage inducing.  Tip: If you really like the game, play it in short bursts.",

Doesn't matter how much time and gold you've invested. Doesn't matter who you have in your party. They will all die. Painfully.  You'll lose everything… and yet you can't help but love it.  Welcome to  Darkest Dungeon , a brutal and unforgiving turn-based Lovecraftian dungeon-crawler from the team at Red Hook. The rogue-like design makes for near infinite replay value. But your biggest enemy here, however, is RNG and, similar to the  XCOM  franchise, you'll watch your favourite heroes fall and suffer party wipes again and  again.   Having picked this up a few days after the launch of Early Access last year and knowing very little of it, the level of detail, depth and polish that the small developer team has put into this was instantly engrossing. It wouldn't be that much of a stretch to say that this is one of the most unique games to emerge in recent years, especially from Kickstarter, and  DD  has earned a passionate cult following to show for it, even with a modding community to boot. As one who has never really enjoyed turn-based or strategy games in general, (with exception to  XCOM  and some cRPGs), I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this, and still do, in fact. Must have sunk hours and hours into it within the first week; it's addictive and can't help but pull you back in for another shot at taking down that seemingly invincible boss.    Darkest Dungeon  is, undoubtedly, a great game, with an excellent gothic atmosphere that adds to the bleakness of your heroes' plight. The narration, especially in combat, can be repetitive at times, yet immensely satisfying when you land a game-changing critical hit as your party desperately clings to life. Classes are great and each come with unique and interesting abilities and styles, complementing the gritty and dark design nicely. The micro-management and balancing of resources also adds further to the almost survival-like aspects of general gameplay, so success depends on watching your gold deposits closely and the strength of the torch as you delve deeper still into the heart of darkness..  The most fascinating addition, however, is the stress mechanic which implements psychological, (as well as physical), diseases and maladies to reflect the extremely punishing nature of the game world. These can be alleviated and cured through lore-friendly outlets in your Hamlet, (which acts as the main player hub), such as the Tavern, Abbey and Sanatorium. All these buildings and more can be upgraded, as well as your party's armour and gear in a typical RPG fashion, once again complementing the depth and just how time-consuming this can be.   As you can no doubt imagine, the emphasis on such risk/reward stats in nearly all aspects of gameplay leaves you to the mercy of the random number generation (RNG) and it is this dependency on pure luck rather than skill or tactics that is the game's biggest fault.  While it certainly isn't punishing to the point of being broken or unfair, how much you're willing to endure at the whim of chance is ultimately whether or not I can recommend this game to you personally.  Darkest Dungeon  is certainly worth a purchase at full price but is equally crippled for some by the punishing nature of the RNG mechanics.   I am thus torn between both an up and down vote for a recommendation.   If you've played a (traditional) cRPG before or the likes of XCOM, then you should be right at home for an immensely satisfying, albeit hard-core, experience. But for the average, 'new age' gamer then it once again comes down to how much you're willing to risk in  Darkest Dungeon  to enjoy the gameplay reward. Is it worth it? You must find out for yourself.   Proceed with caution; both treasure and death, friend and foe, await at every turn.",

I bought my copy of this game waaaaay back when, at the same time as I got Hand of Fate. Tried to play it a couple of times, had a really hard time getting into it. Big part of the reason was how early the game still was back then.   Flash foreword to now. I couldn't sleep the night before last so I decided to start playing something on my laptop, thought of this awesome game that I never touch/could seem to get into. 24 hours later, I'm super into it, finally seem to have a good sense of how to play the damn thing. It's really simple once you get a hang on things and not nearly as painful as it used to be. If anything I think the game developers reduced the difficultly just slightly enough to make the game approachable.   For those who don't know what the game actually is. You play the son of a man driven to insanity of Eldrich (read Love Craft/ Cuthulu) heights, as he plundered the deep dark arts and catacombs of his own estate. After which he eventually took his own life. Which he leaves as your duty to now finish what he started!   Oh goody for you!   So how does one go about doing this you ask? Well, he built this Manor on top of a hill behind a city named Hamlet. Here, over various levels, which are handled as hubs that increase in difficulty as the game progresses. You take four of your hired help to crawl through dungeons, fighting terrible beasts of the uncommon variety, pillaging artifacts that help you unlock more abilities for your heroes (and heels) and buildings in town use them as upgrade currency.   It's a fun little game. I can see why some people think it's 'too much' but really, take my word for it, be patient, do what the game tells you to do and you will get the hang of it and boy is it rewarding to get good at this one! Dark Souls still your beating heart, my dear fellow.   Graphically I find the game to be gorgeous. It’s not like you need a powerful computer to run it but man it looks so stylish in action, sort of in a, how cool Sin City was the first time you ever saw that film’s style, sort of way.  Also, totally worth the 20 dollars through and through, you will not be simply breezing through this one. You’ll get your money worth.   I recommend this game to people who like Binding of Isaac, on a couple of levels… I see a lot of negative reviews at like 90 hours in and let me tell you something. In my book, a game that gets you to spend 89 + hours on it before calling it quits must have been doing something right. Right?    I have a copy of StarDew Valley that I put around 65 hours in easy. I randomly stopped playing it one night and haven't felt the need to go back since. Why, you ask? Because, I saw most of what their is to offer, but for a game that only cost me five less then this one, that's a lot of game time. And let me just say this again, part of what makes this game so tense is the fact that unlike Demon/Dark Souls where you might loose an hour here and there, in this game you might lose a character you love forever. I get it. I totally get it. Love hurts. But sometimes it's good to learn how to also let go and let live. I love this game and if you can get over loosing a few (more like a football team by the end, I'd imagine) you'll like it.",

RNG dictates far too much the outcome rather than skill or strategy and it kills any enjoyment for me. I don't want victory handed to me or anything but at least make it feel like it was my fault instead of just bad luck. I understand this game isn't supposed to be played very casually and you're also expected to lose and that's fine. I'm okay with losing if it's my fault and I deserved it but everytime the game starts bending me over it just feels like all my efforts make no real difference.  I think there is so much to this game to admire and I'm somewhat conflicted about giving it a thumbs down but if it was simply made to reward skill more than luck it'd be better. I'd suggest making a masochist mode for those who like the stress mechanic as it is whilst people like me can enjoy themselves. You can even call it casual mode or something if it makes the dedicated fans happy, I have nothing to prove to anyone and I feel like I'm missing out on a world and spent money on a game I can't even get through without crossing my fingers and wasting hours doing the same dungeons many times over.",

            "review_text": "This game is infuriating. In other games with similar management you get a bit of leway and aren't riding by the seat of your pants 24/7. The odds are always stacked against you and if there's even a small chance something bad will happen, it will. What will usually followi s that one event will probaly kill your entire party. You can spend hours playing this game, and wih one toss of the dice your entire party wipes and you have to start from scratch, since there's no way to recover reasonably anywhere other than early game. This is because it autosaves your pogress, so it's possible to completely fail the game and have to start from the begining. It's not a difficulty setting, it's how the game is supposed to be played.   For example, my veteran team managed to kill a fairly hard boss, while on the trek to a neighboring room my party chain died of heart attafcks. My first attempt at a boss in my first save game ended with a party wipe too in which i had to start the game from scratch, an 'easy boss' did enough damage to kill my entire party in one hit despite the boss being marked for my level, although I was NOT ALLOWED to take my strongest party memeber along because he was somehow not challenged. There's a lot wrong with this game, another BIG problem with it being the RNG.   The rng is absolutely batshit insane and not worth your time to fight against. Buying trinkets and upgrading your party would help things along, but ultimately isn't worth your time, nor is it viable. The reason being, it takes an obscene amount of items to lupgrade your crafters. Any trinkets that might've helped you eek out some progress will run you your entire stockpile of money. About the only manageable thing is , ironically, stress relief......when that jackass caretaker isn't taking up the only spot you need. You're in a constant state of being stuck because you can't upgrade your team because you lack materials, but you can't get the materials because they're locked in a dungeon that you can't beat because you're weak. The rng also contributes to ANOTHER unfair and blatantly stupid mechanic, party hunger. You can be treking througha dungeon, and have fed all your team mates, but you'll get a prompt that'll tell you your team is hungry. But since you've just fed them, you sometimes won't be able to feed them all again, which will result in your ENTIRE PARTY taking 20% damage from hunger despite having eaten just moments before. Taking this much health and stress damage usually leads to one or more of your party having a heart attack.   Aside from all those issues, the narrator and music is repetitive. While the music and dialogue is great, there's barely more than one track you ever hear, and after killing a few hoardes of enemies you've heaard nearly every line the voice actor has to say aside from story realted stuff. It's as grating as the game itself.  If you're looking for a decent turn based look elsewhere. This game needed some more polish, and a lot more testing befoer it got released. As is it's just an aggravating mess of a game that could've been a winner. Maybe they'll fix it with the second game, but this one'll make you wanna taear your hair out.",

The problem with the RNG is that the only effects are negative. Progression is soooo slow with this crap. So if you are a masochist, buy this game. You'll have loads of self punishment with it.   Many people; including myself, enjoy building and keeping characters and using just those. This game however, uses characters as disposable tools that you just throw away every few dungeons. I'm not a fan of that mechanic.   The game lacks any useful options to tailor the game towards your desired game-play as well. No difficulty or 'please remove X from the RNG list' options.   Another major problem is the UI doesn't give the user everything that they need to know. Even people on the forums will give you the wrong information because they don't even know. Example: have a skill that works on religious characters? Great! Which ones are religious? Game wont tell you. People on the forums will tell you that 'God fearing' quirk will make them religious because that makes sense... NOPE! Not at all true.   The Devs have all but abandoned adding or changing the content of the game and are only releasing patches to fix basic bugs.  ",

It is not the elements of extreme difficulty and surprise mixed in with the factor that the game is incredibly unforgiving if you make a mistake. I actually love that concept. This game has so much depth and so much to discover that not even 100 hours of gameplay should be considered enough to actually feel like you know the game. Every time you feel like you're starting to learn a pattern and you're managing to breeze past dungeons, that pattern changes and you feel like you're back at square one again. You feel like you've only just scratched the surface and only played a small amount of what the game has to offer.  My criticisms are that the game just feels repetitive and it's not engaging. The gameplay quickly becomes stale and it doesn't have any exciting factor that wants me to keep playng. I suppose the critical strike factor is nice and all in addition to being able to draft your dream teams and test builds which are more optimal than others so you can succeed, but there is nothing there that encourages me to play more. Everything just feels... wrong?   I don't know how to describe it but I just honestly did not enjoy the game. I think if you're a fan of games like this then go ahead and buy it, but it caters to a very niche audience so be sure to watch a bit of developed gameplay or a play through of it (don't start watching it from the beginning, that would be boring). Then you should make your decision.  ",

The simple, yet aesthetic gothic-style graphics work well as a visage over brilliant mechanics and complex characters. The animations, while subtle, contribute greatly to the overall flow of the game, as do the comic book-esque attacks and movements.  The characters' individual lines were clearly written by someone with great experience in the English language, and the narrator's voice exemplifies the feel of the game while playing. There clearly was a lot of thought put into character lore, from their backgrounds to their outlooks on the situation from room to room.  Rougelikes are inherently difficult, and the addition of rising stress paralleled with falling health makes Darkest Dungeon's gameplay a serious challenge. And while there is certainly a degree of luck prevalent throughout, there are thousands of ways to conquer each region through the tweaking of characters and their skills. This point is particularly potent through relics (especially those that are class-restricted), camping, and even wise disease use.   Want a powerful Rank 1 hitter? Let him get rabies, and then stand the hell back.  This game demands a tactician. Those who can't succeed in this title just... well, aren't tacticians. Without proper party assembly and skill synergy, this already-daunting title because almost insurmountable.

It's a roguelike dungeon crawler that gives you limited resources which you need to make the best of. Choice is limited and skill customization is very rudimentary. The more important thing is managing your stats, quirks and positioning.  Darkest Dungeon isn't something that will praise and reward you for progress. Instead, it will remind you that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer - either through narration that has really been nailed spot-on; or through throwing a curvebal at you right when you thought you've earned yourself a break. One slip-up or one unlucky roll, and the star of your squad will be pushing up daisies. Your victories will be taken from you if you are not careful.  Darkest Dungeon isn't something you can min-max an A team for and blow the content away. It will hit you with mechanics that will make you rotate your teams and building a sufficiently large and healthy roster is required if you want to have a chance.  Darkest Dungeon isn't fair. It withholds information, and it doesn't telegraph its intentions to you. Sometimes, you'll get lucky. Sometimes the cards will be stacked against you. There are toggles you can use to remove some of the more frustrating elements from the game, but that takes away from the experience.  Darkest Dungeon isn't about you or your path to glory. You don't get to save the world. You don't get a happy ending with a cigar in one hand, and a lovely tavern lass in your lap. You get thrown into a desperate situation and the world doesn't care about you or about what you want to achieve. What you have to decide is whether to ragequit or to make your stand for as long as you can.  The one choice that Darkest Dungeon does give you is this: When the frustration of the game is building up, are you going to fall into affliction and let the stress take you down, or call on virtue and push on in face of overwhelming odds? Your heroes do not get to make this choice. You do.  If what's been said above doesn't appeal to you, then Darkest Dungeon isn't for you. But I do know that it  is  for me.",

Same applies for any other capability of your heroes. Even with maximum pampering, you just manage from breakdown to breakdown. And it's not that your heroes or your home offers something to lighten the mood. Mob attacks seem to connect way more easily than yours, no matter the lighting. Your heroes are in horror. Mobs never have something like this.  Increasing resistances to hero capabilities while enemies successfully land their skills time after time.  If your local dungeon master was this rubbishly cheating, you'd change your RPG round.  In case of this game, don't buy it except you like bland grinding against the odds. For what though?

Your healer classes will never be able to keep up with the damage of the enemies, no matter how many rounds you sacrafice to healing unless you get lucky with the RNG and get crits.

Depending on RNG to win for you isn't a good feeling or even entertainment for most people. Pushing your luck is guaranteed to result in a bad ending.  On to the trinkets and rewards. Yes, I do agree that some of the items you can get in the game are useless, but only some. Most every item has a good effect paired along with a bad effect, some way too negative, or even a trinket that has no negative effects. It sorta reminds of Team Fortress 2 items, And speaking of which, you need trinkets that fit your playstyle and character. Doing this will boost the positive side of the character and minimize the negative side. Equipping a random item you think is good, could do more harm to you than having no trinket. It's all about balance, and some trinkets can completely reduce the bad side effects of your other trinket.  As for the talk about stress damage, it is a bit harsh. It's harder to heal than physical damage and can be a pain if someone goes crazy because of it. (Or becomes a OP from that chance of virtue)  Pros: +Unique (stress management) +Customization, from characters, to skills, to items +A bit suspenseful (interactive objects, unexplored places) +Cool Mechanics (torch light, obstacles, character quirks) +Voice acting, sets a very ominous tone +Character development. +Kinda addicting despite RNG  Cons: -Need to learn how to overcome challenges quickly (gold, stress, upgrades, etc.) -Has more RNG than most games -Stress damage a little high or atleast the affliction cap -Story is not too appealing, could use some work -Not for players that get frustrated easily -Somewhat Forced playstyle, some parties/character combinations would get utterly destroyed  All in all, its a good game, and if you're like me and don't care about money, you could buy this game if it interests you. Don't chicken out because of some RNG, unless you're one of those people",

As many mentioned, this game drips with beautiful dark Lovecraftian atmosphere. The gameplay is alot of fun, but might get repetitive. However, in time, you will change the way you play. At first you most likely grow attached to your starting crew. But the further you go, the more this view will get stomped in the ground.  You see, heroes die. Even your strong, upgraded powerhouses. If you get the hang of the game, you will realise this game is more about proper management then it is about picking favourites and winning the game with it. By the way, winning this game takes a LONG LONG time. In that regard you might compare this with a game (I know it sounds silly) like Stardew Valley. You build slowely but surely, and get a bit futher step by step.  If you play this game for long stretches of time, it might get repetitive and boring, but this a game that is best played a few hours at a time. So the next time you come back you have some new ideas and things you want to try out.  It's a great game, but it is a game that changes you over time.

It adds both its own take on Lovecraftian lore and takes dungeon crawling in a fresh direction with a combat and stress system. I could ramble on about how great the elements of this game are, but I'm writing this review not so much to review the game as to address the complaints about the game's RNG.  First off it should be said that, yes, a lot of the mechanics rest upon an RNG. However the strategic element of the game is not rigidly controlling the flow of battle but rather doing everything you can to mitigate that risk - y'know, like how real strategy is. Planning your supply, your party and its formation, your route through the dungeon, your finances - if you plan sufficiently the RNG is little threat, something that was fairly obvious 5 hours in and something I'd grown proficient in 50 horus in. I worry players griping about the RNG are coddled by other dungeon crawler and strategy games.  I'm usually the first person to gripe about RNG in games, but the unpreventable possibility that something could go wrong is not a flaw in this game - it's entirely necessary for the game to strike fear in the heart of the player. This is working from Lovecraftian horror after all. Why feel scared if you can comepletely control the outcomes? At the same time Red Hook has done a stellar job constructing the strategic elements of this game to allow skilled players to not eliminate that risk, but survive it.",

            "review_text": "This is a challenging game, about loss, hopelessness, and the inevitability of death. If you're looking for something about as bleak as Dark Souls, or a team-based dungeon crawling rpg, then this is what you're looking for.  Notable features: -Deadly Combat: Characters die, and die quickly. Even a top-tier hero probably has 50-60 hit points, with some enemies getting 90+ damage critical hits. -Tactical Positioning: Where characters are in your team roster determines which skills they can use and which enemies they can target. Pay attention to character special abilities when preparing an expedition. -Turn Timer Combat: Each combatant has a Speed, used to determine when to act in the order. Higher speeds go first more often, though the RNG can make even slow characters go first once in a while. -Inevitable Madness: Stress and insanity are incredibly, insidiously dangerous. When heroes get stressed, they get afflicted and stop being tactical. When they get too stressed they can have a heart attack and die. Stress is a killer, and carries over between expeditions. -Darkness Matters: Lighting and darkness have actual game mechanics that make the use of light into a risk-reward choice. High light gives hero buffs and high dark gives monster buffs, but high dark gives better loot and more frequent hero critical hits. -Downsides to Everything: One of the common loot rewards is a category of items called Trinkets. Trinkets have mystical properties that give a benefit, but almost always have an equal or greater drawback as well. And everything in the game follows this same model. Leveled up heroes will refuse to go to dungeons that are weaker than them, even if their gear and skills are inadequate to the dungeons they pursue. Many beneficial hero skills also have a drawback (personal debuffs, chance of allies bleeding, increase stress for allies, etc.). Loot items take up inventory space that you need for food or other supplies. -Genuine Triumph: Because you have to work for it, your victories are satisfying. Even the bleak and nearly pointless ending cinematic cannot detract from the satisfaction of having actually defeated the Darkest Dungeon.  Overall: Lots of fun, lots of frustration, and a very satisfying sense of triumph upon completion. Recommended for patient people not affraid of Lovecraftian horror stories.",

It has the very basic premise of the player taking control of a group of heroes and exploring the corrupted locations (read: dungeons) around the hamlet in which he is based. Success leads to the hamlet being improved, the heores becoming more powerful, and the story slowly unfolding.  It is a very hard ironman roguelike, so be prepared for the losses and setbacks. Whilst it is technically impossible to lose, you can be set back by a large amount in one game. There are a lot of threads in the forums about the brutal difficulty level and you just have to accept that things are just out of your control on occaision. That occaision could lead to you losing your favourite hero before you realise, and it is an ironman game, so dead is dead.  This game is one of the most successful in setting the right atmosphere. The stylish Cthulhu mythos, brilliant hand drawn artwork and pitch perfect narration all contribute, imparting the right feeling of despair and struggle. It all enhances the game to elevate it from a good game into a great game.  Positive:   The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. The narration deserves awards.   The game is addictive, well designed, and a joy to play.   The simple design hides a depth that later leads to deeper tactics and hero synergies.   Good learning curve. Forgiving at the start, but punishing if you do not bring your A-game to the later levels.   The achievements are good fun to attempt to gather, and increase the longevity of the game.  Negative:   The RNG can be brutal, in a stacked game. You have to fight hard and enjoy the little victories.   The gameplay can feel repetitive, and the grind, whilst enjoyable, can still be a grind. In recent patches the developers have been working with the community to balance this, and it is pretty much there.   A few of the hidden achievements reward spectacular failure, and may even require specific hunting, so really could be considered anti-achievements...  Notes:  Be warned. This game has a very volatile and vicious community that is split right down the middle. This is due to a disagreement in the community about how the game progressed through development. Just recommending this game has earnt me the enmity of thousands of players.",

This was especially true when in the Early Access, but after the release, the game seems much more fair. With proper part mangement, strategy, and some luck, you can get through each stage. The risk of losing a hero(s) is what makes the game, to most, uninviting. But honestly, that risk is what makes the game so rewarding: Without that, the game would be much less exciting.    Pros:        TONS of classes.  Each class feels like it has its own role in a specific party (except for plague doctor :\\. Cant seem to find a place for him/her quite yet)      Variation of abilites.   There are 6 different skills that a class has. You can chose up to 4 at a time. Each new recruit comes with only 4, the other 2 you have to unlock (which isnt hard to do). You can swap these skills anytime when you are at the town.  Pro/Con      Constant saves.   Can either be a pro or con, depending on how you view it. Basicly, the game constanly saves the game so you can't go back. Once your hero dies, he is dead. I honestly think this makes the game more immersive and adds to the risk to the game. You can get around this, but not as easily as other games.  Cons:      Constant crashes when loading into a new area   Annoying, but not really a big deal since the game constaly saves, meaning all you lose is the time that it takes you to get back into the game.

They're a mix of people complaining that the game changed too much, or not enough, and that has no bearing on how good the game is as it exists right now.  tldr; it is DAMN GOOD right now.  I played it in Early Access, but I was waiting for the full release to really dive in because I knew anything less was not 100% representative of what the final product would play like. A lot of other Early Access players seem to be struggling with that concept.  So, what makes it good, DAMN GOOD, FANTASTIC even? The answer is simple:  You are rewarded for paying attention to detail. In my first serious attempt at playing this game I made it to my 28th dungeon run without a single person dying, and only 10 out of a possible 112 ever suffered mental breaks during dungeons. A lot of those mental breaks, and my single death, could have been avoided if I were a better player with a little more experience and a little less willingness to try to kill a super special (optional) boss monster the first time I ran into one.  Why did my teams survive so frequently? I paid attention to what classes were good at and formed teams that complimented each others strengths and weaknesses. I made sure they all had the correct skills assigned, and upgraded to their highest possible ranks before entering dungeons. I did the same with their Blacksmith upgrades and always gave them the best Trinkets I could, since the game has a handy 'unequip all trinkets' button that makes giving each expedition your strongest Trinkets a trivial task. I did visit the wiki to figure out which Curios were in each area, and what 'key' items were used to get the best results from interactions, but this is something anyone can figure out and memorize just by playing the game. No, more than any amount of wiki information, making good decisions based on paying close attention to detail is what saved *almost* all of my people (RIP that Jester).  Anyways the videos will show you what kind of game it is, which is a turn based RPG that deals with the stress of being an adventurer. It handles the topic of mental health far better thant any video game about killing mutant pigs I've ever seen, as well. Your heroes don't have a 'sanity' meter and they never 'go insane'. They have a Stress meter and they become Fearful, Abusive, Irrational, etc... but also possibly HEROIC.  The theme is eldtrich horror, which is all about Lovecraftian tentacle monsters, ultimately. The game doesn't give up all the goods up front, though, and you'll run into a number of nastier / more unnerving baddies the further you get.  The art is beautiful, and its direction is consistent throughout the game. The UI is very easy to work with. The sounds and especially the music and the Narrator's voice acting are top notch and do a lot to immerse you.  11/10",

The art style, music and creepy narrator all add to a gripping and enjoyable experience  - Lots of depth between the different character classes, enemy types, itemization and dungeons  - Extremely satisfying to finally crush everything in the game when you're experienced enough to know how   Cons:   - Way too much grind. People say the game takes 80 hours to finish and that's about right. At 20 hours you'll have mastered the basics, 40 seen almost everything there is to see, 60 you'll have mastered the game in it's entirety and you'll spend the last 20 getting enough characters to run the final dungeon several times. This could have easily been cut in half with some simple changes to how you gain gold and experience and the game would have benefited from it  - Too much reliance on RNG for me. When you run into situations where you start a battle, all enemies take thier turn first, focus on your weakest guy, crit him for all his life and he dies before you get a turn it's kind of an issue.  - Minor issues with certain mechanics like some a town building taking trinkets from you when others dont, making it much less useful. Some confusion between the both fixed number and percentage based stat system, sometimes it one, sometimes it's the other but either way isn't straightforward with the way they actually work.   Rating: 4.5/5   I'm giving Darkest Dungeon a near perfect rating because for a game from a small indie company this has been one of the better games I've played in a long time. Both the setting and learning curve give off a very Dark Souls or Bloodbourne vibe and that's very hard to achieve. First the game will build you up with some victories, then it'll punish you and kill your hard earned characters, then you'll learn what you did wrong and when you finally get that 'aha' moment of gameplay it's the best feeling in the world, very similar to how you play Dark Souls the first time. By the end of the game I was plowing through every enemy with any party combination and it was a great feeling to see how far I'd come from being scared to enter each room of an easy beginner dungeon.  There's several things to learn in the game and almost all of it comes from trial and error. First there's a second type of health bar for each character called stress. Take too much stress damage and they start to go insane, ignoring your orders or giving up their turn completely. Take much more stress on top of that and they have a heart attack with a change to straight up die. Managing the balance between hp and stress is the first challenge. Then there's the different classes and their skills, how those classes interact with each other, itemization and how those work to boost your abilities, the dungeons themselves with the layouts and encounters they provide, enemy types and how they work together and then strategy on what you need to prioritize in order to not die horribly.  DD isn't without it's issues however and the grind is probably one of the biggest for me. I could hardly believe people when they said the game takes around 80 hours to learn and complete. How can a game with not a lot of content take that long? Well several things hold you back and grinding for gold and experience is one. Every time you lose a high level character on a long run because you were inexperienced, greedy, stupid or RNG decided to screw you it can take 5-10 hours to level up and grind the gold for 1-4 new characters to get back to max level...   Without the beautiful artwork, great music and creepy narrator I probably wouldn't have been able to see the game through to the end but those aspects pull the game up significantly. I'm a huge fan of the art direction and and the animations are always a joy to watch even after so many hours of playing. Overall Darkest Dungeon is an experience I think many people will be turned off from at first but is absolutely worth toughing out to the end. Much like Dark Souls (I know the comparison keeps coming up) it's a game that you need to dive head first into and endure the frustration to really begin to enjoy. Without a lot of word of mouth and 'trust me trust me you'll learn it' from friends I fear many people won't give this game a chance but I'll be that person now. Trust me, get your ♥♥♥ in the dungeon and don't come out until every malformed, slobbering, chittering monster is annihilated!",

            "review_text": "Darkest Dungeons is a unique game, it's so unlike anything I've ever played before that I'm not sure that there is one genre I could describe it as. As I'm lacking a genre, I'm going to make one up. Darkest Dungeon is a strategic Lovecraftian themed resource management game with elements of dungeon crawling. It's quite a mouthful, I know, but it's the most accurate title I can create. Popularly this game is referred to as a roguelike dungeoncrawler, but I've played many roguelike dungeoncrawlers and would not describe Darkest Dungeon like that at all.  You play as a relative of the now deceased owner of an estate. It is your mission to cleanse the estate of the many horrors that lurk there and in the surrounding countryside. This is accomplished through expeditions that reward you with resources that can be used to restore the hamlet to its former glory. As you upgrade the hamlet and defeat bosses further details of the game's story slowly unravel.  For each mission you choose a team of four heroes to send off. Which heroes you choose, which skills they have, and what position you place them in are all important for combat. In addition to the heroes you take, you must also decide what supplies you want to bring. It reminds me of Oregon trail in way, except it's far more terrifying. What's really interesting about Darkest Dungeon is the stress mechanic. As you traverse through dungeons the stress level of a hero will slowly increase. There are also enemy attacks that inflict stress. Once stress reaches 100/200 a hero will either gain an affliction or become virtuous. A hero that becomes afflicted has effectively lost their mind and will be a detriment to the party and a virtuous hero overcomes their stress and becomes a positive actor. At 200 points of stress a hero will have a heart attack. Stress can be reduced by camping, from certain skills, and through activities in the hamlet.  Stress is something that I don't recall ever seeing addressed in a videogame before. It makes a lot of sense really. You frequently see games starring a hero that spends their days slaughtering hundreds if not thousands of people/monsters/robots/whatever. At the end of the day it seems likely that they'd have quite the case of PTSD. The stress mechanic also factors into the resource management aspect of the game. Heroes in Darkest Dungeon are somewhat disposable, but it is still in your best interest to keep them alive. This means that at any given time it is likely you will have a number of your characters assigned to a stress recovery activity and locked out use for expeditions. The end result is that you will want a roster filled with possible teams rather than one dedicated group.  Maintaining a roster with multiple teams is more involved than one might expect. Dungeons have max level restrictions, and you can only enter a dungeon with a full party of four. If you don't have enough characters within the level range for a mission you will not be able to attempt it at all. In an effort to make sure everyone is at the right level at the right time, I found myself doing hundreds of expeditions. The real issue here and main flaw with Darkest Dungeon is that once you've done two or three missions in each area, you've seen almost everything the game has to offer. I found it to be extremely repetitive. The tedium of doing the same missions over and over is compounded by some late game events (nothing specific to avoid spoilers) that ultimately increase the amount of repetition.  Darkest Dungeon looks and sounds excellent. The characters, enemies, and town all look very impressive. I don't know what the name of the art style is but it reminds me of a pop-up books. I'm not sure where they found the announcer, but he really makes the game. His booming disembodied voice shouts memorable quotes as you battle your way through dungeons. I had some of his phrases stuck in my head weeks after I finished playing the game.  Darkest Dungeon was difficult for me to review on Steam. The restriction of recommend “yes/no” is too simplistic. If there were a “maybe” option, it's what I would choose to give this game. In my mind the graphical style and sound are so strong and so memorable that the game gains major points in these categories. The idea of stress affecting adventurers in a game is creative and something I haven't seen elsewhere. It's implemented in a very clever way that is very logical if you've had any real life experience with stress. I loved how heroes resort to vices in an attempt to relieve stress. Unfortunately the gameplay falls a little flat. I found it to be somewhat easy, simplistic, and tedious. This is a game that I would cautiously recommend, and only if it is on sale. For those looking for a dungeon crawler, be aware that this is more of a resource management type of game.   Click here to see my other reviews. ",

            "review_text": "  It's not difficult to find reviews praising Darkest Dungeon's gameplay and aesthetics. Suffice to say I agree, it's a fantastic title. But I will leave the main project of promoting the game to them! For this review, then, I'll focus on some of the major criticisms out there. I was aware of them going in; to what extent did they pan out?   There's too much RNG.  It's true that a playthrough of DD involves a staggeringly large number of dice rolls. And very occasionally, you will get an outcome that's painful and unfair. (RIP, my poor Vestal who went from full health to 0 from a critical hit by a spider, then died from Blight when her turn came up.) But the randomness is crucial to the game's strategy, and the game has safeguards in place to prevent outlier random results from spoiling play too often. The much-maligned Deathblow and Virtue mechanics are more like second chances than they are sources of freak randomness themselves. DD is all about risk management. How far do you push, what handicaps do you take for a greater payoff, and when do you cut your losses and bail? For that calculus to remain engaging, the game needs its random factor. Each 'surprise' result against your party, each brutal critical hit, forces you to adapt, shaking up your routine. And the systems involved are quite transparent. If you're suffering a lot of critical hits, you have ways to debuff enemies' crit chances. If you're frustrated by healing skills rolling low, you can mitigate with party composition, equipment, and skill choices that make the output more consistent. Getting better at the game helps you smooth out the RNG factor, taking the game on your own terms.   There's too much grind.  In the ~75 hours I spent to finish the main game, there were no more than a few hours where I felt I was doing repetitive, joyless busy work. The tense nature of each delve, enforced by mechanics like the prohibition on taking overleveled characters into easy missions, keeps even familiar environments from being uninteresting. And almost every run results in a satisfying sense of forward progress: a town structure upgraded, a boss unlocked, a useful rare trinket acquired, a hero leveled up. There were a few places where the game did drag, mostly when I'd made an error of judgment leading to a setback, like a lost hero, that I then needed to recover from. In that sense, the grind problem also admits of a 'git gud' defense: if you're playing well, planning ahead, you will encounter a minimum of grind. The option to grind then provides a safety valve for a mediocre player to recover from mistakes. Ideal design? Maybe not. But at least for me, the game was rarely dull.   The endgame is unbalanced / unfair.  This one, however, I do agree with. Most of the game, the balance is superb for an exploratory, trial-and-error play style. You try your hand at a dungeon or a boss, and if your party composition has a weak point or you fail to figure out a boss's shtick, you flee, ponder what went wrong, and come back to win next time. The titular final dungeon, however, punishes you terribly for the same strategies you've perfected all game. It presents tactical curveballs found nowhere else, then kills a random character from your party when you back out. The only way I found to get through these levels and retain my enjoyment was to spoil myself rotten reading walkthroughs. So while it's a mere four dungeons out of however many dozens of runs you'll play during a campaign, it is a difficulty spike designed, it seems, to provoke a ragequit. If you're vulnerable to that sort of thing, you can still enjoy the game--but read guides, and cheat if you have to, to get through that final stretch!

As the title will suggest, you will be going to dungeons and they will be dark, However, what you may hear about this game from other players is that it is insanely difficult and the mechanics are incredibly brutal. While that may be a matter of opinion, this game juggles turn based RPG mechanics with the pure luck based gameplay of games like D&amp;D and Magic the Gathering. This in turn, provides a completely unique and absolutely terrifying thriller. The game isnt much to look at, but its intricate design and randomized attribute system will have even the best tacticians and strategists puzzled. By far, the most interesting and intriguing aspect of Darkest Dungeon, is the 'Stress' multiplier which can be very unforgiving and completely random. In my playthrough so far, I had a tank character get gravely injured causing the medic/mage to go into 'Distress' and panic screaming 'This is hopeless!'. This action also effected my secondary tank character with 'Selfishness' causing them to scream 'Let me finish them off!'. These two afflictions carried throughout the rest of the dungeon, causing me to become more and more stressed, as my characters literally lose their minds. This mechanic also had me jumping out of my seat in joy. As one of my main tank characters opened up a cursed book that caused stress, but instead of adding to the multiplier negatively, he became 'Heroic' which buffed my entire team and almost completely removed his stress level. Again adding to the randomness of an otherwise hopeless event. Every dungeon you complete is like emerging from drowning in the depths of death. Oh, and its a rougelike. So when a hero dies, they stay dead. To mitigate this punishing system, the game lets you prepare before embarking, lets your heroes rest to remove their stress and gives you ample opportunity to heal dying characters before they get the permanent dirt nap. Just make sure to bring lots of food or else starvation will kill off your heroes before they even find a blightful skeleton to fight. Oh and do watch your step..........",

Now, as far as the full release game, it is damn near perfect.  The turn-based combat is extremely engaging. The dungeons are hard, but not unfairly so. The mechanics are fair, but deadly.  This is my game of the year for 2016 so far, and it would have to take something monumentous to toppel it.  Buy it for the narrator (Wayne June) alone.",

If I see that tag on a game I figure 'well this is either a guaranteed rage fest for me or simply something I should avoid.'  Yet this game, somehow, feels different.  I love, love, LOVE seeing a turn-based RPG with such dark and creepy elements. The character classes are interesting and the skills are fascinating, and make you feel genuinely accomplished when you figure out how to make them work to your benefit.  I have never beat a level 3 dungeon, I PROBABLY never will, yet every so often I can pick this game back up, start fresh and genuinely enjoy myself for hours at a time just doing the shuffle of ditching characters with terrible negative quirks, grinding resources to upgrade my abbey/tavern/etc. and just outright celebrating when the RNG smiles upon me and I obliterate a group of enemies without any severe challenge.  This game is PUNISHING, and if you play it like a typical RPG you will hate it. But if you can sit there and approach it like the NPC calling in heroes to complete his quest with a level of detachment and single-minded purpose you will find it a fun break from the standard RPG fare you find out there.",

Of course it can be a bit infuriating at times but I take that as a sign of how good it is. If you didn't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when one of your high level characters died from some stupid attack, that means your not invested and don't really care. I know some people will complain about the randomness factor being too high but it honestly isn't, it's a game that makes you think through implications and take chances, if you died it's your own fault for not being cautious enough.   I'm not even a person who enjoys rouge-like, tough as nails games, they just arn't my thing and I prefer a fun story that I can up the difficulty on at will so this game actually took me by surprise. It wasn't something I ever thought would be my cup of tea but it delivered with fun visuals, quests and characters. I will honestly say that I reccomend that people try it out because it might be a pleasent surprise, but it isn't for everyone.

After 130 hours and kicking this games ♥♥♥♥ in its entirety I think it's safe to say I know what I'm talking about.  Graphics - dark, hand drawn and beautiful. I absolutely love the heroes and bosses. They were exceptionally done..  Music - will play on in my head for a very long time. Very ambient and well composed.  Gameplay - not as hard as everyone claims. Definitely difficult but once you find a hero composition that works for you.. stick to it and steamroll the game.  A few helpful tips.  1. Look up boss strategies to save you from alot of heart ache.  2. Hire and fire heros often.. if a hero continues to play badly or gets stacked up with more negative traits then he is worth or that you can afford to heal... fire him and replace him with a fresh face.. try different hero parties   3. For extra gold play without using torches. Meaning rum the dungeons in the dark.. enemies are slightly tougher but yield greater rewards.  4. Dodge trinkets...  5. Lock down key positive traits at the sanitarium such as traits that give you + speed or eldritch hater  6. Everything you come across in the dungeons has a corresponding item. Such as locked chests yield more loot when you use a key so buy a couple keys and shovels before each dungeon. Not all corresponding items are so obvious I recommend looking up a 'curio' guide. It's super easy to understand and will yield you a significant amount more LOOT  7. Heros in order of usefulness.. this is strictly my preference. If it's not yours.. tough.  Vesteal   man at arms  plague doctor  Crusader and hellion tie  Graverobber  hound master  Highwayman   bounty hunter  Leper  Occultist   abomination   Antiquarian   please understand that every hero is awesome and has its place... except maybe the antiquarian...   well that's about it..

I did not see any other bugs though and fortunately the game autosaves often enough so i never felt i lost progress.

This has brought the game to a level I can enjoy again.  PROS: 1 ) Atmosphere. The darkest dungeon is infact a dark dungeon that is darkly dark, and you will feel the darkness encroaching on you!  2 ) Music/Voice. Still as good as ever.  3 ) Graphics. Relatively simple but they get the job done with style  4 ) Difficulty. It is much more tweakable now so can cater to more tastes.  CONS:  1 ) RNG is still crazy as ever, but with the difficulty tweaks, they're less likely to make you want to pull your hair out.  2 ) Low level grind. The game still suffers from low level grind as your recruits become too good for dungeons you need to go to.

I dont know if all the % in the game work on the pseudo random distribution, because if they do, you can kinda predict whats gonna happen next (will you land an attack, will you crit, will you dodge, will you get a negative buff or a positive buff). Now, it might sound like an excuse when you blame the game that some monester crited your soft hero 3 times in a row, but it really is an excuse. 2)(This can be a pros for some and cons for others) When you play the game and you create a testing profile just to kinda figure out how it works and to see whats going on, and to kinda see what mistakes not to make, you will be surprised how often you will catch yourself thinking 'oh, this game cant get any harder, right?'.

There's a speed stat, but it'll seem like the enemy's speed is always greater than yours, poor UI makes you have no actual idea.  It comes down to just randomness done poorly. A 'short' mission shouldn't be able to be randomly longer than a medium. The classic, do this mission, easy, do a mission of the same rating, facerolled, type of RNG problems.   I'd also say the skills need to be balanced better, and maybe they are, after you upgrade yours.

It's unique, it allows for a lot of strategy and decisions of every kind really have weight in DD. The art style fits the tone, the tone suits the gameplay, and the gameplay is taxing and demands your attention--you won't last an hour approaching it flippantly.  Randomly generated dungeon layouts and encounters keep you on your toes and make you ask yourself whether you're willing to chance the next room and possible death or retreat to live another day. It's a stressful game, in the way that playing Dark Souls without a guide or wiki is stressful. In the same way, the difficulty makes success, however fleeting, rewarding and exhilarating.  Darkest Dungeon is a really promising title, but the real killer is that you're assaulted at every turn by aggravating percentages and enemy abilities and attacks that always make you feel like you're a step behind. Not only this, but you can never get a step ahead or even keep pace, because skill improvements and equipment upgrades cost substantial amounts of coin--coin that you'll need to be able to provision your party every time you enter a dungeon.  The first character you get is a burden because no matter how many times you start a new game, he'll always have sticky fingers and pilfer loot for himself for the first three-ish dungeons you enter when you're already desperate for startup cash.  Beyond this initial hindrance, you'll find the percentage-chance nature of your abilities to be incredibly frustrating when you find your party missing attack after attack despite good odds and good strategy. A single round of whiffed actions can leave your party in shambles as your foes relentlessly assault you with impunity.  For me personally, progress has been so little and so late that the game goes beyond its intention. The game does a great job of punishing foolishness and lack of foresight, but even when you've checked all your boxes and covered your bases, you'll get backhanded anyways.  Pretty good game that could be great with some rebalancing or mechanic changes.",

Unless special circumstances take place, high level characters will refuse to enter lower level dungeons with low level characters, and so even lower level dungeons will continue to be threats.   There is a good variety of team compositions with the 15 different character types. Characters have different styles depending on where they stand in the 4-person formation. Forced movement abilities from your own characters and the enemies keep combat encounters varied. Bosses are unique from one another and cannot be beaten by the same strategy. Some team compositions will simply never work versus a particular boss.   Things can go badly instantly or can slowly creep up on you. Throughout the dungeon you can manage your risk by torchlight, brighter light, less risk, but also less reward. Mismanaging Stress can bring a halt to your dungeon attempt.   Critical hits not only sinks into your characters' health pools, but they also demoralize (increases stress) the team. The reverse is true too -- if your character hits a critical, they reduce stress for themselves and perhaps some of the team. You may have a healthy team, but if one teammember snaps, they can bring down the entire dungeon run (quest). Having to manage Health and Stress makes dungeoning unique to this game. Thankfully you keep what you've found, trinkets, heirlooms, and gold, from unsuccessful dungeon runs. However, your characters will not earn experience from failed dungeon runs and they still bring back their Stress, quirks, and diseases.   Out of dungeons you manage your small town, which serve as upgrade shops, recruiting station, and stress, quirk, and disease management. Your characters will develop both negative and positive quirks throughout the dungeoning as well as diseases. Characters with high stress are liabilities and will need to be managed in one of the stress-reducing buildings, Abbey or Tavern.   ---  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes dunegon-looting games or team-based strategy games and is looking for a new experience. It's important to know that you will lose characters permanently and will fail quests. If being denied success at times is not something you like in a game, then you probably won't like the flow of Darkest Dungeon. You'll be placing your established characters in harm's way.",

            "review_text": "This game is hard, there is no question about it. Parts of me consider it Darksouls the strategy game. But thats what makes it enjoyable! Its a strategy game that gives a fair challenge while keeping you locked to your decisions!  Now i will admit this game is not perfeckt. For example: Some of the bosses require you to build your party in a certain way to be able to kill it, with no hint for it whatsoever beforehand. This made me lose some of my best characters early on and i got a bit frustrated. However i came up with the idea of how to handle it later on.  But while i dont like that (and some other parts) thats part of what makes the game so good! Its so satesfying to figure out how to best handle the bosses (and other enemys too) and have them go from a frustrating roadblock to a cakewalk! This can however make the game boring for some as you will be facing the same things over and over, and if you lose your best squad it can sometimes be tidius to grind a new one to the same level, especially if you dont keep alot of characters ready as reserve.  When it comes to positives, i could go on and on, so here are a few: -The classes in the game are fun to use and experiment with. -The enemys are varied and interesting, each requiering a different way to deal with. -The artstyle (in mmy opinion) is great! -That freaking Soundtrack!! -There is an end goal (i have yet to reach it)  Overall, i reccomend this game. Its not for everyone, that is for sure. And more important than anything you must be able to accept heavy losses. Like i said earlyer, i consider this the Strategy game of Darksouls, only instead of you dying, its your party.  Oh and one more thing: If you want the full experience of this game, try to not look up anything at the wiki.  This is a game best played blind.",

Darkest Dungeon is a game that will make you wonder if you really need to bring that extra shovel. Darkest Dungeon is a game that will make you wonder if you really need to feed your heroes. Darkest Dungeon is a game that will make you wonder if it is worth rehabilitating one of your insane heroes or if you should just give them the boot.  Darkest Dungeon is a rougelike RPG that places emphasis on preperation and choices. Do I need to bring that shovel? I could bring an extra key instead to get more loot. Do I need to buy that bandage? I could save some money by not. Should I throw away my antivenom to get 600 more gold?  The main feature of Darkest Dungeon is Stress. Your 'heroes' (more like merceneries) are not like the heroes of most RPGs. They are human, with emotions, compulsions, desires, and negative attributes. All heroes have a stress stat, that upon reaching 100, will test your hero's resolve. More often than not, they will gain an affliction, such as Masochism, Hopelessness, Abusiveness, etc. However, on a rare occasion, they will gain a virtue, such as Bravery, Focused, and Powerful. This is a make-or-break moment, as the rest of your quest the heroes will have that affliction or virtue. It is up to you to decide when you need to give up the quest to avoid the permanent death of one of your companions.  Boasting 14 different hero classes, you will make a team of various classes, all with a certain role. You have your traditional healer, rouge, warrior, and archer, but you also have classes that combine various aspects of the main 4, while also bringing their own uses to the table. It is up to you to take the abilities of all of your heroes into account when you build your team.  There are 5 different zones in the game, each with a different theme, enemy composition, and item arrangement. The maps are always randomly generated, with fights around every corner. You must bring the neccesary items to each zone in order to fight off disease, injury, poison, and stress.",

Game is dark, and the mechanics are very unique and application of items in the dungeons such as torch light. essential. takes time to get your levels up just makeing it that much more bad ♥♥♥. This game isnt for everybody, but i enjoy it immensely  Edit- *******TIME, PATIENCE, AND SOMETIMES SMALL DAILY DOSES******* are required to play this game and to properly equip your roster and upgrade your town.  I saw this on another reviewer's post and....well its perfect---   'In the end, the player is the one who must achieve the greatest resolve against the heart-pounding stresses of escaping failure and misfortune: either to fall into the lifeless purgatory of monotony, or to be chisled into a mentally-calloused champion - for whom he owes his only enjoyment to the eventual achievement of conquering the struggles and afflictions that are catered to its dark descent.'     Haveing played this game in depth now, at 117 hours, I would like to fine tune whatt little review I left. First, This game has gotten easier with release it seems to me. Second the variety has only expanded- I have happened across a new class the abomination. New enemies such as the doomsayer (stresses your team out) More depth, it might just be me, but i feel more immersed into, and more easily addicted to the game when I play. I have acquired a Darkest Dungeon itch. Options to make gameplay easier for the weak of heart or the stressed (as a player who will never touch the dial, on this game anyways). Minor changes to some mechanics  I have also picked through alot of the recent reviews. Almost all of them are negative. I feel the need to reiterate, This game takes time. I see alot of these reviews anywhere from 2 to 36 hours played. by 36 hours I was still filling my barracks with a bunch of level 2 heroes fully upgraded...idk why these people are dropping 30 hours into a tagged difficult game and expecting it to be easy at later levels. granted perhaps im still tlaking too soon, 117 hours played and enjoyed highest level character is 4 currently, got a nice handful of them fully upgraded, no diseases or quirks and they perform just fine with 75-100% lighting. Expect enemies to sometimes take turns in a row, no more than 2, yes this game can be bogus, retreat before you get someone killed. Misfortune does happen as I state later in this post about my crusader class hero Reynauld,, got plenty of back ups to follow up. The bosses are challenging, i enjoyed myself figuring them out. It was not hard to figure out the boss fights, it just took a retreat or two, and heving to hit the dungeon again at some point once or twice after I figured it out without losing an hero. Seriously. All through early access and even up until now, this game feels like it has gotten easier, as i set into mid to late game.  You should primarily rush quantity over quality, max your stage coach and your roster. work your favorites up from there, I still have 1 or 2 level 0's.  As I posted originally, This game was intended to be difficult, and it is hella fun and really makes you think about team composition, along with combat and camp ability comp. When to take those camp breaks, iems, wallet. This game is very tactics and planning heavy. The stress system and the very fact that the enemy minions are not the only thing you are fighting all through this game just makes it so unique. You WILL get upset. Just lost my original Reynauld just a handful of days ago...best hero.....And that is the note this game leaves you on. Worth the buy in my book. Enjoy!",

Recruit endless supply of heroes from mud and rain, reshape them to be propper heroes and legends. Quirks 'perks' are randomly accuired in the game through events that give that little extra edge or personality to your characters.  Graphics are basic and simple - great art style - great music - spectacular voice over, narrator really did and excelent voice acting.  Combat is simple, yet quite deep. Every character gets a move per round, faster heroes/monsters go sooner in combat. Your heroes have 8 skills to choose from, but only 4 can be used at a time, and the skill selection can be changed between the battles. Every hero has something interesting to offer, and you can make some insane team combinations with the characters + right skills and items. You can have 2 items at a time per hero, they can be simple buffs or even speciffic skill and gameplay defining artifacts.   Most skills require your hero to be in speciffic place in the formation, lets say last guy or second last. It makes sence since a guy with a sword cant hit anyone if theres 3 characters in front of him, he physically cant reach. Same goes for monsters, their skeleton for example cant hit your last two guys with his club. But for example characters with a spear can reach for the first 3 characters, or shooters can hit anyone but the first guy (most likely cause friendly blocking in the mist of battle). Some skills can shuffle your characters bringing confusion, so you must have a backup plan to either use the combat move to change the location of the character within the formation, or a skill that will change the formation. This in mind, enemies often leave corpses, which in turn gives another interesting strategic twist. As you defeat a massive enemy or multiple regulars, their bodies begin to pile up and block the passage towards next enemies. As you defeat an enemy, you still have to close in the distance the reach the others while they continiously shoot at you or otherwise.  Alot of interesting elements that make the combat deeper unfortunately triggered the ♥♥♥♥ out of alot of people for some instant 100 stress that made them hopeless. Very unfortunate but so are the weakminded. Adapt and improve. I was a fool not to buy this game a long time ago due to negatives reviews as people complain about its 'difficulty'. After watching some reviews and 200+ hours in I can say its a challenging game but not like those fools said.  Quite a deep and interesting story too, not going to spoil, but I'll say one thing - note the item that gives you + 50% xp and start to question.",

BUT what i can do, is tell you my opinion about it in it's release state!  To start of with, i did not have high expectations about this game, i actually didn't know very much about it at all. i simply saw a guy on  www.twitch.tv  play it for 10 minutes, and decided i'd try it out.  Now a little background on me; i'm not a hardcore gamer by any means, but i do enjoy a nice story driven game like Assassin's Creed, Fallout, The Witcher and so on, and with the odd game here and there outside of the rpg genre (Civilization 5 being the most beloved game outside of rpgs). So i don't normally buy indie games, nor do i care much for them as they're normally lacking in some way, or just down right sucks (Early Access in general).  Darkest Dungeon however, blew my mind. the artwork, the soundtrack, the gameplay. everything seemingly joins together and makes a perfect game!  Whenever you play, you feel immersed, you care for your heroes and you struggle with every decision. i find myself retreating more often than not, to spare one or more of my heroes from death, instead paying for whatever treatment they need. this in turn have caused money trouble for me, slowing down the rest of my heroes not affected. You get so much into this game, for better or worse, that you start squirming in your seat whenever a hero is on the brink of death, or get insanely angry at a seconds notice if your hero misses a hit that would've ended a fight, instead causing you to have to spend thousands of your hard earned gold on treatment.  The whole game revolves around being punishing. you heroes will die, whether you like it or not. you will struggle with money. you will have negative stats on your heroes because of negative quirks. you will get destroyed by the rng in the game. but the most important part is that all of this is fun!  If you're looking for a challenging turn based game, that focuses on screwing you over, yet feeling fun this is definitely a game to try!  9/10",

But I still love this game to death, and intend on beating it against all obstacles. The game is not weighted against the player, the player makes it weighted against the player. I've learned this the hard way. Anyone who says otherwise is most likely bitter that the game beat them. I'll tell you all one thing;  do not underestimate this game.  If you lose a maxed out character or two in a fight, suck it up, change your approach if it was a boss, and prepare better. The game isn't difficult if you plan well. And if you are someone who thinks that this game's RNG is unfair, that's why it's called a  Random Number Generator . Assuming you've prepared well, know your plan, and generally are good at the game, you just got the ♥♥♥♥ end of the stick. Everyone does at one point. Losing at the game doesn't make the game or its mechanics bad.  A dark, remorseless game about choices, regret, loss, and death, all in the pursuit of glory and wealth.  I'm going to say this right now, this game is extremely difficult and  WILL  screw you over eventually, be it through the loss of your favourite character, to having to leave behind an entire mission just to guarantee your party's survival. But no matter what situation is thrust upon you, you are ALWAYS on the same ground as the enemy, considering the fact that the biggest factor in this game isn't skill or strategy (although those do help a lot), but pure, unaltered,  LUCK . Critical hits are the biggest deciding factor in every fight and one singular attack can easily sway the tides from or to you.  Party members are extremely varied, and the loss of one can be devastating, but they are recieved constantly and at no cost to you, making them easily expendible and replacible, if necessary.    IT WILL BE.     So in short; if you can deal with the stress and despair of loss, small and forgettable, or large and heart breaking, get this game. You will eventually regret it, but you`ll enjoy the ride there.   And as a bonus for reading this, I'll give you a small tip if you choose to play this game;     Overconfidence is a slow, and insidious killer.   ",

Death matters in this game, which makes every little battle a stressful experience. Did I mention stress? Did you know that all of your mighty men and women not only have a health bar, but also a stress meter? If your health bar depletes you die. If your stress meter fills up twice, you risk having a heart attack (you die). Managing mental states is a blast, and can make for some quite humorous situations.   The art style adds to the games depressing atmosphere, everything is drawn with deep shadows and a dark color pallate, which is something that I feel brings the entire experience together when you add in the equally depressing soundtrack.

So why is it I find myself returning, hour after hour, to delve yet again into the dungeons?  Perhaps the pseudorandom generation of dungeons makes it different enough each time? Maybe the sufficiently tactical combat, with many different strategies available through class and ability choices, makes each experience different enough - and fun enough.  Or maybe it's the wonderful backdrop of Lovecraftian horror I love so much, or the artfully stylistic music and graphics, or the absolutely exquisite narration provided by a very good voice actor.  The game is sometimes very frustrating, as the RNG can be very punishing at times... but even as another of my highest level champions dies a pointless death, I find myself thinking it's simply another excuse to return to play more Darkest Dungeon.",

My main problem with this game is that there are limited choices in the dungeon. I enter regulary dungeons representing a straight line. I know that there are monsters ahead and i´m most likely not able to kill them but i don´t have any options to avoid them. So I have to give up or go in for a suicid attack. Of course you shouldn´t be able to avoid every single fight but what is the point of creating a randomized dungeon when there is only one freakign way you can go. Still i like the game and i had fun.

BL hits HW for 11, FU this both for 2 and debuff. HW hits BL for 5, FU this HW 1 CR 3, CR hits BL for 8. BL hits HW for 12 (dead HW) and CR dodges... ended up winning fight with just CR. I get to town and can only hire 2 new characters, except you need 4 to do the next mission. Delete and start over.  I get this is supposed to be a hard game. It is exactly why I got it. I love a challenge. This however is not a challenge. The Random number generater (RNG) is complete and total bs. Nothing like being in a fight and they are dodging everything even after lowering their dodge chances and up'ing my hit chances. They dodge, and crit for 18 while I get to heal for a whole 4 in best case scenerio. Then to top it off when you finally finish a dungeon you get the lucky fortune of getting a crap bonus at the end of the trip. That in itself blows as you have to spend money to clear it out or risk players deciding, f that, I don't want your crappy 2 point heal, i would rather die.  I will admit I play most games on the default settings one time through. But after that I am on a mission to complete on the hardest settings. I love a challenging game but the RNG in this game is totally geared towards randomly killing off your players for no reason. I will read descriptions find combos, check forums on other players builds. Whatever it takes to succeed, but nope RNG designed to kill you for no reason that you can protect yourself from… b.s.  Also serioiusly, no Gamepad support. You move forward, rarely backwards. Character selection (4) enemy selection (4), spell selection (4), Item interaction and some town stuff.

I'm hoping to see the base game expand for more flavors of monsters, trinkets, characters and insanity in the future. All in all a great game worth every cent, five stars from me!",

It is fun, it is challenging, there's always something new to discover or do....but lets get this straight. It's...tough heh. I've rage-quitted more in this game than probably all my games combined. Yet, I keep coming back, determined, angry...all the good stuff. 44.7hrs in the last two weeks, I think that's pretty telling.  Both the Torch and Stress mechanics are new (for me) and they add a completely new level to this Rpg, meanwhile, the other usual RPG elements are stripped down somewhat but only to avoid clutter and complication. You won't have to spend time comparing one pair of pants to another, afraid of losing dexterity over power or something along those lines. The more time comsuming elements have be stream-lined and it's glorious.  This is a game that with each rage-quit, you'll come back having learned a bit more and get a bit further in your next play-through.  This RPG newbie highly recommends this game.",

Not only is the Stress system a unique and original touch, the game is ruthless in its wonderfully Lovecraftian presentation, getting you attached to your characters just to force you to watch them be slowly driven insane before they're slaughtered before your eyes. Heroes will lose their will to fight, abuse their party members (thereby nudging them down the path of insanity as well), duck and run at a critical moment in a fight, steal loot from the group, or in the worst cases, simply have a heart attack and keel over dead in the darkness.  In your hamlet between adventures you can treat your afflicted characters by sending them to meditate, or to pray to their god, blow off steam by indulging their decadent tastes at the brothel, or drink themselves into a stupor. But even then, the imperfect characters may occasionally blunder, losing some of your valuables in their rambunctious recreation, or find themselves in trouble with the local authorities.  Don't expect an easy run from this game, either, and I caution you, if you're prone to swearing in frustrated anger at video games that rake you time and time again over the coals like I am, don't play it with your kids nearby. Even with careful resource management, meticulous planning, and well thought-out battle tactics, things will still go south at the worst possible moment, costing you one or more of your favorite heroes in a stroke of ill fortune. This is not a game for the faint of heart, or those expecting to be endowed with godlike 'Chosen One' status.  This is a game about the dark aspects of humanity and its fragile, tenuous grasp on stability and sanity. And it's simply brilliant.",

Saw it was released today and went to read the release notes, and was disappointed to see that almost nothing new was added apart from an end-game event and some balance changes.  As for the criticisms regarding difficulty (and vitriol against said criticism), I think the important thing is to distinguish the line between 'challenging' and 'unenjoyable'. Especially with the new stress/heart attack mechanic. You COULD say that it's an intended feature to keep rotating in fresh rounds of recruits because you can now expect full wipes regularly, but then all you're doing is reducing challenge to grinding and tedium.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to preface this review by saying that I've been playing since the game was in early access so i've seen it go through numerous tweaks and change. That said I CANNOT recommend the final product.  Darkest dungeon is a turn based rpg permanent with rogue-lite elemets where you can recruit characters to go through dungeons and death is permanent.   You have to manage health and sanity. If a character becomes too insane that causes other characters to lose their sanity. After too much insanity, the characters suffers a heart attack and ides.  Characters acquire quirks (buffs/debuffs) at the end of dungeons, interacting with items in the dungeon or even relieving stress in town. All quirks stay with the characters through the game, negative quirks can be removed by spending money, while positive quirks can be locked in, which also costs money.  Now that's I've got out of the way, I can tell you with certainty that this game loses it's appeal very fast and becomes miserable to the point of being anti-fun and here's why:  You have no control over the classes you get to recruit, it's completely left to RNG. Sure, there upgrades availble to increase the chance of having leveled up characters show up and how many total recruits are availble.   Example: Six recruits are availble, two of them may be level 3 while the rest may be level 0, or half may be level 1, or they could all be level 0.  This is tolerable in the early to mid game where team composition isn't as important and just having characters to play with is important because you're bound to lose some as you play and learn the mechanics of each dungeon.  However, this becomes insufferable in the late game where the bosses and dungeons in general require very specific team compositions in order to be beaten.  So, do you need one healer? There's two classes that do that well and one is far better than the other at doing so. It may be weeks (in game) before you one shows up to be recruited and that's translates to hours of grinding and trying to build another viable team, which becomes repititve very, very quickly.  The game isn't difficult in terms of mechanics. The difficulty comes from having to grind for hours to put together a competent team that's gets destroyed due to rng destroyed and having to start all over.  In conclusion, great aesthetics and sound design can't make up for a fundamently flawed game.",

This game can be quite a challenge, it embraces the 'losing is fun' motto, you learn how to play and can progress further and further, it's as much about your decisions as it is team composition and skills.  After 11ish hours of play, restarting a few times, reading reviews and guides I can say the game defiantly stacked against the player, you WILL have to 'Make the best of a bad situation', which is not really a bad thing- it does appeal to some, you will have moments where your party will fail or thrive at the whim of RNG and no amount of preparation from placement/items/skill can mitigate that. (Again not a bad thing).  The game is let down in a few areas that totally break immersion or seem just plain unfair/wrong.  The following bugs/oversights have tipped the balance far too many times and I feel I cannot recommend this game until they are all fixed, it really feels like laziness or poorly thought out mechanics during gameplay which takes all the fun out of it (losing can be fun, but not from bugs/poor dev decisions)  1) Party requires 4 food randomly to eat, even if you have 3, too bad take full penalty 2) Party sometimes requires food only 2 rooms after just eating- or even after a camping feast(seriously devs did you even code in checks for this?) 3) Traps listed at 100% have failed- my record 6 times in a row at 110%... list the value properly please. 4) You can run out low level dungeons to crawl through, at this point you MUST restart your entire game (I feel this is intended but poorly implemented at best, if it was intended it is incredibly sloppy and lazy- add more feedback to the user to show this) 5) Crashes often- typically at the end of a level after camping when receiving the final reward (lucky it saves progress quite well)  Just to be clear- the games difficulty has nothing to do with my non-recommendation of the game.",

I don't know if the developers are good people or bad people or if other reviewers for that matter are either. I have not taken part in any community discussions and have no interest in doing so. From just reading reviews my own opinion is that their is a great deal of hatred and bias that resulted in negative rants masked as reviews. I do not doubt that the people writing them hate the game but I believe it is not possible for them to be objective because they either hate members of the community who have opposing views or hate the developers for whatever reason. That does not mean that they are completely incapable of finding some legitimate faults in this game but it does mean they may blow them far out of portion to serve their bias. I can think of no game I have ever played that is perfect. This explanation is made in hope that readers will be able to better put in perspective varied reviews of this game.    So if you would like to enjoy this game I would recommend that you avoid like the plague any forums discussing it for the following reasons. First hints just from reviews here suggest they are hostile environments. Secondly because I believe the fun in this game is from discovering the characters and strategies as you play. You could possibly go to some forum and find the perfect strategy now I will note here that I don't know if that strategy exists but have seen it claimed in reviews with less play time then I have.   I can tell you that every Fantasy, Turn-Based, Strategy type game I have played and can think of has eventually turned into a grind and usually after many hours of fun learning the best strategies to use, there are always some strategies that fail and others that work, what point would there be in making new games if every game used the same system.    I can also tell you that after 17 hours I am still leveling heroes and upgrading manor buildings. I am still experimenting with the many character classes and their varied abilities and I am still learning in what priority I should remove the varied negative character traits, sicknesses or stresses with my limited gold. Maybe after another 17 hours I will have all that sorted out maybe at that point it will start to feel like a grind. Things considered I can say I feel I have already gotten my dollar value out of it.     To finalize I would say I do recommend this game and that the best way is to play it like you would a point and click adventure game. Don't read the entire clue book before you play. Play the game and if your stumped get help for the issue that stumps you then close the clue book until you need it again.",

I've seen a lot of people mention they save scummed because of this game's difficulty. If you're the type of person to save scum, this probably isn't the game for you.   The whole point of this game is predicated on RNG. It's about making the best of bad situations. Even if you do everything right, things will go wrong. Some people consider this arbitrary, and it is. What's not arbitrary is your decision making in those moments. The game will put you into those situations to force you to decide whether you want to risk complete failure or cut your losses. Yes, it feels arbitrarily punishing at times. Yes, it gets frustrating. That's the point.   DD is a game about what you do in the face of that frustration and adversity. It's about how you mitigate transactional risk and how you invest severely limited resources. If that sounds like a chore to you, look elsewhere. If it sounds like fun to put yourself through the wringer and see if you still come out on top, look no further.",

By its very nature it does warn you that characters will die, and when it does it can be quite a frustrating experience but thats what makes evey quest that bit more tense.   Now Im a lot of hours into it and I cant stress enough how great it is. Its a game that makes you feel alive and accomplished when you complete a quest well. The worst that can happen is something nasty early on but you can always retreat at any time, but that has a huge impact on your characters wounds and money collected.   Is it perfect?

The Aesthetic is top notch, it envelopes you into this grim-dark medieval fantasy world with an art style which at first appears simplistic but is actually very deep (and meaningful) which along with the excellent narrator helps build this world as an unforgiving nightmare in which you struggle at every step to escape.  And that seems to be a big complain with a lot of people: RNG based Difficulty.  There are plenty of things you can do to mitigate the RNG like equiping different skills, taking out different combinations of party members, equiping different items etc. (TLDR: GIT GUD)  There's always going to be an element of RNG which will work against you, but if it didn't it wouldn't make such an interesting game.  The best thing about this game is the emotions it causes you to feel:  -Immense joy, as your Hellion crits the last enemy when the rest of the party is knocking on Death's Door.  -Insatiable Anger, as your Hellion dies after failing to disarm a trap 1 square outside the room, causing the rest of the party to die from simultaneous heart attacks.  -Instant Regret, as you start a new game after rage-quitting and delete your 60 week save.

And I'd argue that in most cases, as long as it doesn't happen too often, the recovery process can be fun too. But the issue with Darkest Dungeon in that respect is that if you lose a hero in the late game, it will take HOURS to recover. And that's HOURS of mundane gold farming and levelling. If you have the patience for that kind of thing, great, go for it. And hell, you could be like me and just stop playing when this starts happening.

I have fallen in love with this roguelike dark fantasy strategic permadeath turn-based dungeon crawling atmoshperic horror creative and aestheic masterpiece of a game.   The sheer amount of mechanics to this game is pretty staggering, there are so many aspects to gameplay you have to remeber and think about that it can hit you like a sack of bricks if you make one wrong move. I thought i understood the game after the tutorial and the first dungeon, just hit the badguys and it would be pretty easy. The second mission however, was a very different story, within moments i would find my party being brought shockingly low and close to the death, while the monsters and creatures stood tall and ready to deliver a death blow. My entire party got wiped after only a few rooms.  And they were dead. Part of what I like about having Permadeath is how much of a shock to the system it is, how much you are jolted. I find it brings a reaction out of me more than most games can do. And it happened OFTEN. It wasnt until my 6th or so dungeon that I figured out I actually had to retreat and run away from the dungeon. I HAD to fail becasue victory wasnt even possible. Bloody. Good. Stuff.   :: T H E A E S T H E T I C S ::  The visual style of this game is perfectly done the dark fantasy graphics, the animations the horror. It fits the setting of dark claustrophobic terror. You really can understand the stress mechanic of your party members getting too stressed and going over the edge into madness. Just picture when your party is in a fight where they are losing, multiple memebrs are on deaths door and every horrific abominitian is about to cleave them in two and the torch is sputtering out plunging the drungeon into inky darkness. While your sight is diminished your hearing picks up the screams, moans and wails of the dungeon so much louder and clearer. The whole thing in action really is magnificient and leads to some very intense and heart pounding moments.  9/10  It can be a bit grindy, that is my only gripe with it so far, it took about 5 hours of dungeon crawling to really start to make progress but I did mess up a lot of times and im sure that 5 hours is not the standard time to get the ball rolling. But im 13 hours in and I know i havent even scratched the surface of how much content i have left to enjoy.

So, imagine you want to buy this game because you've been seeing it a bunch on Twitch and such, but before you purchase it, you want to see if the game is any good. So naturally, for a quick peek, you look into the Steam reviews.  And there are waves and waves of downvotes.  This is mostly because of one thing in the game, one element, one mechanic in the game that is too hard for those people to overcome apparently.  And that is RNG.  Admittedly, it is pretty annoying at times. Enemies dodging a bunch or your guys missing, like, everything.  But, there are so many ways to overcome misses and dodges, and to have the RNG on your side.  First of all, debuffs.  Debuffs in this game do all sorts of things, have the enemy take more damage, or less resistances to certain damage types. But it can also reduce their dodge- and accuracy stat. Which means you'll be hitting more and they'll be missing more. Use this.  Secondly, buffs.  Buffs are just the opposite of debuffs. Give your guys a higher resistance to a bunch of damage types, or higher damage. And just like with debuffs, you can make them hit more. Mainly accuracy increase, which just makes them miss less, and hit more.  Nevertheless, RNGesus will always have a role and will always make you miss something. But that's fine. That's the game. It will never be on your side.  And then there is also the 'undodgeable' (I'll get back on this) damage type. Or actually two.  Bleed and Blight.  Very simply, bleed does damage over time in bleeding damage, and blight does the same in poisonous damage. Your enemies cannot cure/dodge this once it has struck. And everytime they take a move, the damage will be applied first. So when an enemy is about to make a move, he can die before he even gets to do anything.  However, they can dodge the intital attack that causes said damage type. Be wary of that.  And then there's stuns, too.  Stuns make it so that the enemy that you've hit with a stun cannot make his next turn. This. Is. Enormously. Good.  Whenever you stun an enemy, he can't take his next turn. Which either means you can take free swings at the guy, or that you won't have to worry about him for a turn.  Now of course, there are resistances in the game, including bleed, blight and stun resist.  How do you work your way around this? Increasing the base stat of your abilites!  And yes, I know that the skellymen cannot bleed, and the fishpeople are highly resistant to bleed. Same goes for the filthy skrubs in the Weald when it comes to Blight. But the game encourages you to make use of alternatives. And there are rarely any enemies that have resistances on all types. Mainly tanky guys have this. You can still debuff 'em, though.  TL;DR: Its a great game, and dont be fooled by the negative reviews. See for yourself if you like it. Its not a game for everyone, though.  And remember...great is the weapon that cuts on its own.

I have spent 8 hours in this game it is was some of the most enjoyable, frustrating, and challenging times I have had with video games. The amount of challenge that came from this game that started as just a Kickstarter is astounding. The challenge and the detail in this game is the most notable, and everything else is just perfect. The game is a solid 9/10 but the only thing keeping it from a 10/10 is the amount of bugs and glitches in the game. There are many bugs, but none I have ecountered are game-breaking' only game-distorting. By that I mean that the experience is slightly less enjoyable.

            "review_text": "**edited after 140 hours of play**  DARKEST DUNGEON is not for everyone. Let's just get that out of the way right now. If you're the type of person/player who absolutely must have at least one tangible, achievable goal to diligently work towards, then you'll probably have trouble liking this game.   You have to reframe your perspective and maybe shift a paradigm or two before you can truly appreciate it. I've had to readjust my expectations several times while playing, and will surely have to do so again.   I spent probably the first 50 hours going back and forth from 'I think I'm getting good at this' to 'this game obviously has a personal vendetta against me.' It really does feel like everything's stacked against you, and that strategy is worthless in the face of randomness.   But it's really not. Yes, there is the randomness, but after I kept playing and learning about the game, I started to see that a lot of what once *seemed* like randomness was just me not understanding the game's mechanics and strategy. There will always be random circumstances outside of your control, but you learn strategies to mitigate the chaos and deal with its effects.   I would probably, by this point, call myself good at the game. I can kill Champion bosses without losing a single hero. I have a fully upgraded town, good cash flow, and some Legendary heroes who don't have even one negative quirk. I truly enjoy playing, even when I have to abandon a quest or when a favorite hero dies or when the heaviest-hitting enemy crits 5 times in a row.   I'm really, really glad I stuck with it and didn't give up in frustration like I wanted to many times early on. It's just a really fun, engaging game, and it's become my go-to game for after-work de-stressing.  My advice would be to approach this game with an open mind and a willingness to experiment, fail, and learn. Do some research on strategy and team-building - look at the guides and discussion boards here, for instance. And always, ALWAYS make sure you have a hero who can prevent nighttime ambushes.  ** original review **  When I was deciding whether or not to buy the game, the negative reviews were actually what most convinced me to try it. People kept saying that it was unfair...it was random...it was hopeless and meaningless...the odds seemed stacked against the player. I thought, 'So, this game is basically human existence, then.' And of course I had to have it.  I've played this game for almost 100 hours now. I have one hamlet that's on week 92. Through much trial and error, I've grown to better understand the tactics and strategy, and it's very rewarding to learn how to build strong teams. And I'm always learning something new. I'm always having to adapt, because most of the time I'm getting the rug pulled out from under me. This game is brutal, chaotic, frustrating, and confusing, and it requires a whole lot of failure and sacrifice.   I love it because that's what I wanted. DARKEST DUNGEON really is the video game version of human existence. And that's why people who need achievable goals with tangible results will probably not like it. It's not that kind of game.   In 'The Myth of Sisyphus,' Albert Camus says of Sisyphus's plight that the gods 'had thought, with some reason, that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.' And that's pretty much exactly what DARKEST DUNGEON is - futile and hopeless labor. Camus goes on to explain that, by creating his own meaning, Sisyphus can find happiness in his punishment, despite its futility. Likewise, this game offers up a complex, challenging, and aesthetically beautiful experience within its harsh and brutal world. Surviving, adapting, and learning are accomplishments far more rewarding than beating bosses and finding trinkets.  If you're still reading at this point, and if you found my philosophical drivel interesting, then DARKEST DUNGEON is probably right up your alley.",

Losing 3 'Heros' doesn't do anything to the larger picture but put you ahead if one survivor comes back with the loot. Consider it a bonus if more than one come back. (A bonus that has emotional baggage)  The art style used in this game is terror inducing, and is great. Imagine Paper Mario, in Hell, with monsters from your childhood nightmares. Well.

            "review_text": "Darkest Dungeon is a very appealing game. Everything from its haunting musical compositions right down to its heavy, Gothic art style. Every bit of this game's aesthetics and ambiance is a joy to take in.  In Darkest Dungeon you take on the role of an heir to a decrepit old Estate that was left to you by your Ancestor, a tortured old soul who, we learn from the prologue, took his own life after exploring ancient, Lovecraftian ruins beneath the Estate's foundation and being driven mad by the experience. In the game we are literally taking on the sins of our fathers, being tasked with hiring heroes and driving them beneath our Ancestral home to purge it of evil.  The gamely is simple, you take a group of four heroes and send them into a dungeon to find treasures and dispatch monsters, all the while attempting to keep them healthy and sane -- sanity, which is as important as health in this game -- being one of the games mechanics that change your heroes over time. If you encounter any monsters within the halls you explore, you'll enter a combat mode, which is turn based. Each hero and monster will get a chance to act, choosing either to buff another party member, heal or attack, with each hero and monster possessing many different traits and abilities. In particularly long quests, you'll have to set up camp, which provides another method of preparing your party for the onslaught of enemies;, manage your inventory and make important decisions on what you need more of -- torches for light? Or ancestral treasures like portraits, which you can use to level up buildings in the hub town.  After each incursion into any of the dungeons, your heroes will develop quirks, fears and diseases. A large portion of the game takes place in a hub town called Hamlet; this is where you'll hire heroes, sell trinkets, explore lore and level up your heroes. There are different buildings each serving different functions, an example being the Asylum, where you would place your heroes to cure illnesses, remove negative quirks or lock in positive ones you want to keep.  A feature this game sort of touts itself on is the difficulty, and Darkest Dungeon is a very difficult game indeed. Players will fair well in the earlier battles, but there's a slight difficulty spike somewhere near the middle of the game, when you have your heroes and their gear leveled up. I didn't find this to detour my enjoyment of the game, it just presents a little extra challenge in trying to maintain pace from the earlier fights.  All in all, I really enjoy Darkest Dungeon, and would gladly recommend it to anyone who enjoys games like Dark Souls or X-com.",

            "review_text": "  I have changed my mind about this game. And it was not a small change.  At first, I HATED this game, simply because it was too much relying on luck. After a few hours, which led me to know and understand the game better, I decided that although luck still has a great impact on the game, it still depends a lot on you trying and actually taking the best decisions.  This game has great graphics and actually fun mechanics, although a bit frustrating sometimes. You will surely suffer from stress-based debuffs and penalties, and ofter get back at the Hamlet with a crippled team. However, when you master the game, it becomes actually satisfying to see how far you can go.  There are many different tactics you can choose from (personally, my typical party consists in having a Vestal/Doctor, an Highwayman, an Hellion/Man at Arms,and a Leper or Crusader) and you can adapt most characters (if not all of them) to your personal style. As I said before, choosing the right time to perform a specific attack, to discard or use an item, or to cure someone instead of attacking (and vice versa) has a major impact on your experience, as you might or might not be able to clear your path.  This game often punishes greedy plaers who fight for too long to get a little more gold at the end of the day, but when you learn to choose the right option things will change drastically.  Right now, the only thing I can really keep complaining about are Resolve tests, which on my side seem to be always failing. I'd say there's at least 80% chance to get out of the test with a negative status.",

            "review_text": "Darkest Dungeon is a chance-heavy, atmospheric, dark, turn-based dungeon crawler where you really have to make the most out of an incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation that gets worse as you play.   I have a few complaints about the game, but I'm giving it a positive score based on a few things it does really well: - Really cool atmosphere, this game drips with it. Like Lovecraftian horrors and hopeless situations? This is for you. Each character has things to say in the dungeon and in the base (i forget if it's the hamlet or the abby or whatever) - Interesting and visceral turn-based combat. Each thing that happens feels great. Tons of things to manage: buffs, debuffs, bleeds, stun, and unit position. Corpses are even a concern in battle - Base management. You'll be using the treasures you find in the dungeons to improve each part of the HQ, but most of your money will go to stress management and other things to help you survive - Character classes. Each week sees new adventurers with unique abilities and playstyles. I really like the variety of abilities and their effects. The occultist is an interesting character that can heal you really well, but has abilities that debuff the enemy and lower your torch value. The grave robber is constantly shuffling position.  Complaints I understand that this game is all about making the most out of a bad situation, but it really goes out of its way to ♥♥♥♥ you.   The stress mechanic is neat, but stress comes too easily. Your party is stressed when in combat, when they hit a trap, when they read a book, when they stub their toe on a rock, when someone says something mean, and just by walking.   When they are stressed above 100, they get a mental affliction and will often not respond to commands and sometimes will act on their own. They will also not allow a character to give them a buff sometimes. What the hell. This gets way too out of hand. I was just in a dungeon when a surprise encounter completely destroyed an otherwise good run. Everyone was full health, but my occultist couldn't heal for some reason because his stress was above 100. My cleric died because she decided not to accept a heal from the crusader and attacked an enemy without my input and bled to death. The Occultist got the mental affliction hopeless and wouldn't shut up about everything and gave everyone stress damage every turn. By the end of the battle only the arbelist or whomever was left and I had to leave because she has no abilities that allow her to target an enemy in the front position.   There are also some things about combat that aren't too clear or I don't like:  - No indication of turn order or speed. Unless i'm just being really unobservant, there's no way to tell when your dudes or the enemy are going to act.  - Why can some melee abilities target guys in the back row and some can't? This seems unevenly weighed toward the enemy, but I could be wrong.  - Some abilities can hit multiple enemies, but there's no UI tool which displays this effect, you just kind of have to guess who is getting hit.  Maladies come a little too easily. I rarely end a complete run without every adventurer getting 1 or 2 mental or physical disabilities. This is on top of what I suffer in the dungeon. The game just piles it on and expects you to manage this with the high cost of stress management in the town. Everything that can repair these things cost 1k or more. Some characters even receive new negative traits while 'relaxing'.   You have to upgrade the blacksmith before you can even do anything there...  Someone else mentioned this in another review, but you don't keep any of the provisions you have when you end a dungeon run. It'd be nice if there was storage for the stuff you don't use or the game let you use them on your next run. Considering how much ♥♥♥♥ you go through and how much it costs, that'd be a minor relief in an otherwise relentless game.   Overall This is a good game with some things that prevent it from being great. Don't let those things turn you off, if you have been thinking about playing this, then give it a shot. The combat is fun, the atmosphere is superb, and the rewards are good if you can survive the tsunami of crap that comes your way.",

It's a great game, especially for a fan of Lovecraft. The over-the-top grinding and materialism, however, are not welcoming elements of this game. The game succeeds in many respects, the unrelenting permanent death system for example. I'm ok with the randomness of the fighting system, I can deal with the total non-sense op of some bosses, I can even put up with the ridiculous pressure damage done by the common monsters: I appreciate them as part of this extremely artistically and psychologically satisfying game. These are, in fact, the part of the game that shine most brightly, for they make this game unique and really close to lovecraftian realism: accidents do happen, especially misfortunes and the unexpected perils, hiding behind daily miscellanious stuff.   But two things stands out as intolerable: 1. the money-grinding budget system. It's simply not understandable why I need an incredible amount of money to sustain and nurture the entire camp of heros. 2. The repetitiveness of the bosses are clearly either a lack of efforts or handicapped imagination. To beat the same bosses over and over with different stats is just boring.   I would still recommend this game, but don't buy it with full price. Although, with all these cons, it remains one of my favorite games, right next to XCOM series.",

No real surprises, repetitve gameplay, lack of multiplayer etc. It's only worth it if you're a compulsive gambler who's content the prize is absolutely nothing and the odds are heavily in favor of the house.

My first run ever for instance resulted in 3 party members developing paranoia, skipping 4 entire turns in a row, the same monster critting 3x in a row during a single fight, and 3 out of 4 party member deaths by the 4th room. If I wasn't warned about the horrible balance and randomness of this game in advance I would uninstall and get a refund asap. The lack of multiplayer is another strike against it, because I feel it would be perfect if an opposing human player could controll the monster NPCs during encounters like a genuine Dungeon Master.  On the up side at the price of $19.99 I feel that's worth it for the hand drawn art and superp narration to an otherwise frustrating, generic dungeon crawler that players only sink high amounts of time into due to the cruel and unfair RNG system forcing them to start over again and again. If there was a neutral way to recommend this game I would, but Steam requires only positive or negative so this game's getting a NEGATIVE review due to the poor first impression it left.  Even after sinking more hours into Darkest Dungeon, I'm not impressed with how poor the RNG algorythms and they detract from the rest of the game's enjoyment to the point there will be absolutely no reasons to replay this title once a player slogs through it the first time. This game is one of those stamps onto the man-card that millennials are going nuts for, yet the irony is it's one big inside joke to watch fanboys squeel with joy over a game that takes absolutely no skill at all and simply plays out like a choose your own mis-adventure graphic novel.",

The game is a real grind, and the outcome of every mission feels very dependent on the RNG. It has come to a point where every mission comes down to flipping a coin but stretched longer.  The battle system isn't that fun (once again, every thing comes down to the RNG), your dream team could nearly wipe on the first battle because every one of your hit miss while the enemies keep laying critical on you. On the other hand, you could be sending a party of schmuks and clear the same mission easily if the number side with you. In the end you start wondering if you're responsible for anything, and you get the feeling that this could be one of those free to play mobile phone.

Level 5 dungeons are way way way way WAY too hard!!!!   2. No save option.   3. Endless grind...  I really don't understand why there is no save option. Why does this game drag out its content by forcing you to play essentially 'ironman mode'. One cheap critical and there goes a month of hard work down the drain...

The apprentice lvl's are quite easy unless you the game decides to punish you with bad luck.   But In the darkest dungeon the 'bad luck' seems quite planned. With planned I mean: 3-4 heals in a row that heals 0 or 1 and if youre healing with Occultisk lets add some bleed to the mix. How about missing 4-5 strikes when youre  allready doing bad even though chance-to-hit is 90% and more? Lets add to that. Lets make escape fail the first 5-6 attempts.  At first i liked the challange and the randomness but it quicly becomes an annoyance.   The only way to get ahead is to create team with traits and relics designed to beat a single area. Again, that sounds kinda cool and is what made me buy the game. But unfortuneably you need to grind hours and hours to make such a team.  Then this happens:   ...near wiped (or wiped) with A-team with maxed equipment and no negtive traits due to the extreme cases of 'bad luck'...  I love a challange, but this is not challangeing its just plain annoying.  Gaming can be fun and difficult, just play Dark souls/Baldurs gate 1+2 and tons of other games. When you loose you can only blame yourself and you know what you did wrong. Not that a little luck never hurts. But this game just makes you shake your head and play something else.  The art and ideas in the game are fun and I love the voice acting.

I am not by *any* stretch of the imagination an expert at this game, and I say the game is outright easy until you fight your first boss. If you wipe in the first dungeon then you've definitely done something terribly wrong.  I uninstalled this game half a year ago, because I wanted to 'save myself' and start a fresh file after full release. I quit just before the community started bawling about heart attacks, corpses, and whatever else they did to prevent obviously cheesy strategies like heal-stalling.   Now I'm back, and it's the same awesome game that I left it as. The announcer is worthy of being the next DOTA voice pack. the look and feel show an amazing amount of love and talent. I haven't tinkered enough to say anything about the balance, but I will say that the system is much more than just the 'Homicidal Gamemaster Simulator' that you've heard about; it has real strategy and depth to it. It's a twist on the age-old formula of dungeon crawling resource management: healing is generally weak (but still important), resting around a campfire is extremely limited, and it is all but impossible to reduce Stress faster than it can accumulate. If things don't go smoothly, you will have to make a decision: give up, or tempt fate by risking that one last push?  I actually hate this style of gameplay, but Darkest Dungeon sucks me in by just being... you know... really, really cool. The overdramatic announcer, the beautiful art, the sense of danger and risk, it just feels GOOD.  Yes, you can have a total disaster caused by the RNG kicking you in the balls. Yes, there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t un-fun ways for the game to take stuff away from you. No, the game will never beat you down so hard that you are unable to continue playing. Cutting losses to avoid total disaster is part of the game, and should the worst occur, the system is designed to let you rebuild after taking painful losses.  If you are here, then you surely have heard the stories about dramatic victories and heartbreaking failures in this dark, unforgiving pit--by now, you already know deep in your heart whether or not you are ready to enter... the Darkest Dungeon.",

            "review_text": "As a whole playing Darkest Dungeon has been an incredibly fun and addicting experience. At times it's frustrating, but beating a frustrating level is all the more rewarding. There's several things that set Darkest Dungeon apart from the other games of it's genre. The stress mechanic being the most noteworthy. Darkest Dungeon is unforgiving and brutal, but because of it's unforgiving and brutal nature it's one of the most rewarding games I've ever played.    Negatives:     The stress mechanic is to powerful -   Darkest Dungeon is meant to be difficult, however the stress mechanic is often annoying instead of difficult. It's an extremly interesting concept, but the execution is somewhat poor. The fact that once one party member gets afflicted is nice, but it happens far to frequently and if the afflicted party member isn't stressing the other party members out he's passing his turn or even damaging himself depending on his affliction. Sometimes the afflicted charater will refused to be healed no matter what his health is at. I've had a hero die because he was at deaths door and refused to be healed. Overall I think the stress mechanic needs a nerf.     Stress relief is to expensive -   I love the fact that you need multiple teams to rotate in and out so because one team needs to be relieved of stress through different methods in the town, however spending pretty much all of your money that you made from an adventure on relieving the stress of the team sent on the adventure feels diminishing to the accomplishments of the adventure.     Map design -    The RNG factor of the map design is annoying. For example: If you get a dungeon where you need to complete 100% of the room battles and there's three different ways to go than you'll need to go to the end of each segment to make sure there's no room battle at the end and than backtrack all the way back to go to another segment. If you get a map that requires a lot of backtracking and don't bring enough food than you're likely going to take damage because you're team needs to eat but you don't have the supplies. If you get a map that has little to no backtracking and you bought a lot of food than it goes to waste. The time you have to spend on backtracking is the most frustrating part of it. All together it's not that big of a deal, but I would like to see less backtracking.     Investigating quirks -   There's serveral quirks that make heros prone to investigate certain objects such as curios, fountains, treasure etc. I don't see the point of this. It makes no differance to me who searches what. All it does is pester me when I have to wait a few seconds for a heros chat bubble to appear and disappear before he searches the object. I just don't see a point in these quirks.    Positives:     Darkest Dungeon is one of the most addicting games I've ever played. You can start up the game and dump hours into it without even knowing.       Darkest Dungeon is an incredibly unique experience. It has to many unique feature to count and I'm only finding more every time I play.      The brutality of Darkest Dungeon brings a whole new level of satisfaction from getting beating a dungeon, getting a new piece of gear, unlocking a new feature for a building in your town, etc.     Darkest Dungeon has it's flaws, but the good far outweighs the bad. Not everyone will agree with what I've said and that's okay. We all have our opinions and this is mine.      ",

            "review_text": "EDIT for review of release build of the game -   Game has received a nice once-over for general polish, and has also gotten a balance overhaul. It still suffers from a few old issues (deeds grind), but the experience is generally improved. If you didn't like the game before, you aren't likely to now either, but this remains a fully-featured, beautiful, satisfyingly difficult game with a lot of content and impeccable atmosphere. The endgame content turns the usual game on its head somewhat, and the ending felt epic and worthwhile. This game is still a steal at the release price of $20.  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  Original review appears below:  I've been playing Darkest Dungeon since it was first released into early access, as I was one of the Kickstarter backers. I played it for probably 20 hours or so at that point, got a fair ways in, then stopped, not wanting to play too far before things got close to full release. Many patches and content additions later, and I was alarmed to see some Steam reviews lamenting that the game had become imbalanced and impossible, etc. I jumped back in to see for myself, starting a fresh play rather than picking up where I left off, so I could be sure how things had progressed.  A very considerable amount of time later, and I can say with absolute certainty that those people are, frankly, wrong. And when I say 'wrong', I don't mean that their opinions aren't valid, as Darkest Dungeon is very much an unforgiving game which demands players learn its systems intimately in order to succeed. This is absolutely not a game for everyone. What I mean is that the game is not artificially or even substantially more difficult than it was before. New systems have been added, and thus there is a fair bit more to learn, and a new area has been added which certainly carries with it a higher difficulty than those that came before it, but those things make for a deeper game experience, not an artificially difficult one. The experience remains fluid, organic, and incredibly well-balanced for the most part. I have not had any particular trouble steadily advancing into further tiers of the game in my 2nd play, though I have had to learn a few new tricks to get there.  There are, of course, still some rough edges here and there. It can be a real drag grinding for deeds in order to unlock certain town upgrades, for instance, and some classes may not yet quite have achieved the perfect balance compared to others. The thing people seem to fail to remember here is that the game remains in early access. It is not yet tweaked for final balancing. It is not yet content complete. There is more work yet to be done, and these things are very likely to continue improving even after final release, as Red Hook is very much dedicated to improving and adding to their game. That said, the game is remarkably stable and balanced. If you take your time to observe and learn how to play well, you will be rewarded. If you don't, you may not get too far.  It can be a tough call whether to recommend this game to someone, or to tell right off if it's something you may like. I highly recommend watching some stuff on YouTube or catching Pythagotron, CallofCthulhu, or any other Twitch streamer currently playing the game. A little gameplay should show you pretty quickly whether this is the sort of thing for you.  Rather than leave a detailed explanation of game mechanics, which I'm sure have been well covered by others already, I'll simply say this: at twenty bucks, this game is an absolute steal. It's not even content complete yet and people have already wrung hundreds of hours out of it. The core gameplay loop is fairly simple, but the procedural nature of the maps means things are always a little different, and you'll find yourself in a wide variety of circumstances depending on the course things take. This game offers FANTASTIC bang for your buck, and is challenging, deep, and satisfying not just in gameplay, but in story and visual design as well. The devs are also adding even more stuff, such as another character class, prior to the full release, which will then see the final, titular Darkest Dungeon for us to explore. With plans for more to come, the future of this game is very, very bright, and it's definitely something worth considering getting in on.  Just remember that all these rewards do come at a cost. The game won't let you in so easily, and it can be a somewhat punishing learning process. There's a lot to take in, and while most of the basics are well documented, internalizing those lessons will sometimes require you to learn the hard way, and many of the game's nuances will require you to sit up and pay attention, or even think outside the box in order to discover the various ways in which you can manage your heroes and use the existing game systems to your advantage. There is definitely more to this game than just combat. You won't have to be an economist, but there are definitely both fiscal and logistical concerns to think through when you're outside the dungeons. You're a team manager as much as you are a dungeon-delver, and your ability to think ahead will often serve you in ways outside the tactical combat.  But no matter how you slice it, this game is well worth your time. If you're a fan of difficult games that reward player knowledge and skill (Dark Souls and its kin being the go-to examples, these days), give Darkest Dungeon a try. It's one of the most balanced and complete games of its type already, with only further growth to come, and there are very few other games like it on the market.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR: Darkest Dungeon is about making the best of a bad situation, meaning that if you can't handle bad RNG once in a while, you will probably hate this game. Also the art and sound design are amazing.   The opening screen says that Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best of a bad situation, and the developers have stuck to that philosophy throughout the development of this game. Unlike Dark Souls or XCOM, games where bad situations only arise due to the player's mistakes, Darkest Dungeon's reasoning for dumping a bucket full of blood and ♥♥♥ on you can be boiled down to '♥♥♥♥ you, RNG.' The damage that bad RNG brings can be mitigated with careful planning, but the risk is always there, the chance that an Occult Witch might crit on a stress attack three times in a row.   This is what frustrates a lot of people writing reviews for this game, I think. They think that there should be a 'perfect strategy,' that if the player is just good enough, they can mitigate all risk entirely. That simply isn't true. Darkest Dungeon is about creating those desperate, terrifying situations that arise when your vestal becomes afflicted in the first room and refuses to heal your hellion who just got critted on by Cultist Gladiator. It is, truly, about forcing the player to make the best of a bad situation. Do I push forward to end of this quest and gain the bonus gold, despite the fact that my Crusader just died to a heart attack? Or do we pull back, mitigating both losses and rewards? That's what makes Darkest Dungeon great.   And yes obviously the art is fantasic and the sound design is legendary. All the classes play in radically different ways, allowing for many different strategies and playstyles. The combat mechanics are very solid, and that's coming from someone who normally hates turn-based combat that isn't on a grid. BUT. If you are the kind of person who can't handle dealing with gameplay elements that are outside of your control, then this game is probably not for you.",

            "review_text": "IGNORE ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS on here about fairness and grinding. Those people obviously come from a generation of 20 hour video games with plots that come from saturday morning cartoons. This game is SUPPOSED to be hard. It's SUPPOSED to be grindy! Because nothing is either these days and some of us want a REAL game like the way my gandpappy used to make back in the old days before the bomb fell.  This game is conisderably more addictive than tobacco, and is probably causing irreversible damage to my body. So far, it has eaten my face. My face, brah. Then it lured me into a van with promises of candy, only when I got in the van, it smashed the candy into jagged little bits and, you guessed it, rubbed them painfully into my missing face. Then it laughed at me. Then it tossed me out of the van at 66 mph (1827 kmph for you Euros). Boy golly, that hurt like the dickens!  But I'm not the kind of idiot that gives up bad things easily. Instead of going to the cops or a priest, I had a PI look up the license plate and tracked the van down to a bad neighborhood in Jamaica Plain. I jumped out from around the back of the van and shouted 'Hey, you jack-a-napes, you dropped something on the road back there!' and I flung my amputated left arm at them (the right arm for you Euros out there).  In typical Darkest Dungeon fashion, the game then hit me on the pointy top of my cranium with an aluminum (alumagninioum for you Brits) baseball (cricket) bat. I blacked out.  I woke up and I was past the intro movie and got to start the tutorial. That's when I realized 2 things. This game was evil and I was in love with a video game and wanted to marry it )despite how bad for my health it was).  In all seriousness, if you aren't a total wuss about your characters dying, and don't mind grinding this is probably the best turn based 2 dimensionsl RPG I have played since.... jeez, since the 1990s when games had souls.  Be like me. Let it eat your face and crush sweet glasslike candy into the soft exposed tissue beneath. Let it kick you out of the Funtastic Van and hit you with a bat. Be. Like. Me.  Thanks you and may you burn in... where ever it is you believe the bad people go. You go burn there. Bye",

Sometimes you feel like all you can do is restart but that is one of the many things that make darkest dungeon beautiful is that rise to glory and then the falls that can or hopefully won't occur.  The art style of the game is wonderful and truly makes me feel like the characters are mine and that i want to keep them alive as much as possible.  while not being much of a gamer who looks for faults in games I'm sure there are a few issues in the game that I am unaware of or just accept them as what makes the game tougher.  This game has a easy learning curve at first but can get very difficult very quickly and should not be underestimated in just how much you need to prepare for each adventure. Overall this game is beautifully made and truly makes you want to play more and beat it.",
