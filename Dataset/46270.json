            "review_text": "English voice acting may not have been their strong suit, in any of the games in the series. That said, I can definitely recomend Star Wolves (1). It's a bit limiting in it's budgetary balance, and like many old school RPGs between battle maps, towns are little more than an interface screen. The good aspects come from in game choices leading to different forking game paths. Having more than 1 ways to solve a puzzle etc.  Fighters can be reconfigured or replaced at the space ports between missions, if the item you want is there for sale. It might be old, but it is a fun game. Especially for what they are asking.",

It's quite hard at higher difficulty. Missions fit nicely with story and are not similar to each other. Overall a very good and addictive game! :)",

            "review_text": "If you can get past the aged graphics and bad (very, very bad) voice acting, this game can be really fun. Playing through on normal is challenging, but not impossible. The limited resources make you choose between equipment and skills, and time the use of your abilities - which are limited in the number of times they can be used each mission.  While the game play isn't entirely story-driven, there is a story here, and it's interesting to be in the role of a supporting character/group rather than the movers and shakers. There are also moral choices you have to make during the course of the game. I don't think these have meaningful consequences other than the amount of money you have, but it does give an element of actual role-playing.  However, there are a few issues with this game. First, it does tend to crash. Second, there is a bug that causes laser fire to remain rendered and prevents most hits to ships on either side of a conflict. This bug, while annoying, is easily corrected by restarting the game. Another problem is that ships will sometimes get stuck on objects and are unable to get loose. This is largely due to the fact that the ships have to move in a straight line to the target object or location rather than coming about. Also, the ships will run straight into anything that is in their path rather than swerving to avoid a collision - sometimes causing damage to the ship in question.  While this game has some issues and drawbacks, it was really fun to play through, and I did very much enjoy the music to the game.",

Missions are varied somewhat, but when you engage other units, it can be difficult to see who's attacking whom, and issuing commands is not easy and susceptible to a bizarre glitch where Windows 7 and 8 suffer from involuntary pacifism: the units just will not fire when commanded to. Difficulty spikes, messy interface, dorky character designs and other lack of attention to detail are more of the game's problems.",

I wish when i bought this steam had had a sane system for refunds, but at the time it it couldn't be done.",
