However, this game is probably one of the hardest and most complex games I have ever played. You can start off executing simple maneuvers against your friends and having a bit of a laugh but, as you get better at the game, it becomes more interesting and unpredictable, leading to an amazingly personalised competetive experience.  And if you don't like competetive stuff, there are plenty of crazy mods you can try out with your friends.",

            "review_text": "  Let me get right to the point and say I love this game. When I first started out about a year ago I felt like a toddler learning to walk, and I admit, it was a bit frustrating. Then I turned to Youtube. I learned a few basic aikido and judo (two different mods/game modes in the game) opening moves and from there my results sky-rocketted. I was flooring noobs left and right until I got to the intermediate level where (most) every player had a rudimentary understanding of how to move in the game then it was fairly evenly matched and I quickly got over myself. Here's some things that are just excellent about the game: -- IT'S FREE. TRY IT. -- The graphics are so simplistic it could run on a computer from the 90's, but at the same time it doesn't look bad, and when you use shaders it looks quite nice. (My opinion, of course) -- The game is utterly unique, you'll never play anything like it. -- The game can be quite dramatic and/or comical when you watch people who actually know how to play do what they do. Think of it like the WWE, just not scripted. -- You have nearly complete conrol of your character, which could be a bit overwhelming, but once you understand the functions of the joints you will come to enjoy it as well. -- The community is very tightly-knit. You seldom come across a player you just can't get along with. -- Being good in this game is not matter of higher level, better quipment or any of that junk. Being good in this game comes down to one factor. Skill. -- There are tons of events to take part in.  Now, to be fair, here are some things that kind of suck about the game. -- Store items are a bit expensive, and it's a bit difficult to earn money. That being said you don't have to pay real money for most of the store items, and they're really just accessories. -- The community is small compared to other games. This is the consequence of the tightly-knit community I mentioned earlier. -- I said earlier how skill is the deciding factor of this game, but it can also be considered a bad thing as you have to fumble around a bit to get the hang of the game, which can be frustrating if you're the impatient type like myself. -- Very little will change about this game, I expect. This can be a good thing, as some games change 'too much' and become ruined, but I expect this game won't change enough, as it has been roughly the same for about 10 years.",

Toribash is a turn based fighting game where you have full control over your joints and movement and when i say full control i mean every joint you see you can move. This means that you will be able to do anything you want and have a ton of fun. What makes me sad about this game is that new players tend to give up after watching montages and instantly wanting to do those moves. Sadly that isnt the case and for me it took me almost 150 hours to get the full hang of this game and now im just improving and improving. New players if you're reading this review please dont give up on the game after 50+hours i started to realise how much better i was getting and if i kept playing how good i could be. Now something i really love about toribash is the community. We are such a small community and sure you will get the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wont help you but most od the time everyone is really friendly and open. In the short amount of time Ive had this game i have made tons of new friends and even started a clan with them. Too end it off i would like to give you my ign (in game name) in toribash which is PepesSon so if you ever want advice just add me on steam or pm (personal message) me on toribash. THANK YOU TORIBASH 10/10",

Anyway, you control each joint on the character's body to make them punch, kick, grab, jump or flip. Total control and flexibility. It takes time to actually know how to do it, but once you know how to, it's worth the time spent. Oh, and the game's free!  Now for the cons. What I really don't like are the players who spam the same bloody technique over and over and over and over again. Even after some other guy had bonked him and his 'fighting form'. It gets really annoying and the fight will starts to feel rather bland. The learning curve in this game is really high. It's easier to practice by getting your ♥♥♥ kicked, and study your adversaries' moves. If it's too frustrating and you don't get any fun out of it, just uninstall the damn thing. lol",

For the shoulder added to the Lower / Raising. Hand : click hand turn from fist to open hand to shake.

It has taken ragdoll physics gaming to a different level by making it turnbased and allowing almost infinite controll over the ragdoll (20 limbs which can each be extended, contracted, relaxed or held still individually) each turn. Saying it is the best fighting game I have ever played would also be pointles because it is one of the only fighting games I have ever played but this is not important...  It is a hard game to get the hang of and may take a lot of time if you want to get good, but if you do not want to expend so much effort then you can have just as much fun playing the weird and wacky gamemodes on multiplayer. The selection of gamemodes spans from skiing, to icehockey and even skatebording if you think you are good enough. The variety of fighting gamemodes is just as widespread and it should not just be treated as a funny and novel simulator as many indie games (I don't really like that term) which employ new and original mechanics are. I can tell you that if you put in the hours of dedication to this game it will be worth it and you are able to achieve fame in the community if you are good enough (not that I have any sort of fame).   I have written too much and I can't expect any of you to read this far but if you have I thank you and would strongly urgh you to try this game and dive into the community and the forums where you can find other player's replays as well as downloading new player-made gamemodes if you ever get bored of the preinstalled collection which come as part of the game.  and again, thank you for reading.",

Its basicly turn based. a round has an amount of frames (which differs from mod to mod) which are executed in steps. both players click theri joints and hit ready to see both fighters do the moves and stop again to change for the next framestep.  after each game u see the fight as a whole (and ofc u can save and even edit (!) the replays) so its a very visual game, 30% for me is watching awsome replays  the only problem about the game is, that it is so hard to begin with! in the start i cudnt do anything. no hit, no kick, basicly i was just falling down. but if u get a little understanding of it its a really cool and unique game.  and you should know that you will probably never be able to move like in the trailers :) thats so super hard..",

It has as much depth as any moba but an extremely high learning curve, but man, once you learn how to control the Tori you will feel extremely satisfied with yourself, you can pull off some incredible ♥♥♥♥.  It has a decent sized playerbase, you wont have problems finding matches, but I almost feel like it should have way, way more players, what with its moba like complexity and addictiveness.",

This game is also funny when you do two of the same moves on the two people, yes, you can control both people by just clicking on them. 11/10 decaptitated bodies -IGN review. (This was not really an IGN review, I put that there just for fun) Anyways I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to break some bodies. Although the gaming in the trailer is for people who are pros at this game. This game would take some time when you want to make your own moves, but this game supplies you with one full-tutorial move called the body breaker which makes your character break the other person into 3 flying peices.   Anyways, the summary of the whole game is a hardcore b!tch punching game.  11/10 headless flying pigs. Try to get that out of your head.",

You basically have control over joints on your 'Tori' and move, dances and fights controlling them. They are NOT EASY to control, but don't count that as a negative side to the game, as results are sometimes Too cool or Too hilarious. You can HOLD, RELAX, EXTEND and BEND your joints to create movement, dances and fighting moves, and there are plenty of mods to increment gameplay.

The customization is one of the strongest things of the game: it's nearly total. You can buy textures of many sizes for your body, you can buy hairs for your character (the tori), there are objects like hats, scarfs, portable cassette, a red submarine on your head (yes, it exists). There are flames that you can add to your tori. All of this is completely customizable, as you want, everything.  Administrators of the game organize events which you can join, like big tourneys in aikido or some strange mod. There is a great community, that you can access throught the forum; here you can talk, ask, join clans, organize clan wars, sell and buy items. The administrators are open to suggestions and a lot of ideas for the game come from the community.  My vote? 10/10 It cant be different.

            "review_text": "Summary: A game that is as rewarding as it is difficult. The learning curve is about as sky-high as is possible for a game, since the tutorial is not nearly strong enough to teach beginners the most basic principles of joints, momentum control, etc. If you stick with it and get good enough to play competently, it is a very fun and competitively fair game with a very moderate community (some nice people, some ragers, mostly quiet).  At first, you will be terrible at this game, and you'll have no idea what's going on. Chances are, you'll feel like this for a long, long time. But eventually you'll just start to get better and better at understanding the mechanics and how your joints work together. I highly recommend just doing a free-play (solo with a non-moving bot) and moving one joint at a time, to see how it affects your Tori. Understanding movement is ultimately just piecing these single movements together in increasingly complex ways (pretty impossible to learn quickly, it just comes with experience).   After you figure out how to move, then you can start learning the intermediate techniques like building and manipulating momentum or reading into your opponent's moves. There are a surprising number of Youtube tutorials for all skill levels of Toribash players, so look into those if you really want to get better.  Competitively, this game is very well balanced. No amount of play time or money spent will make one fighter intrinsically stronger than the other. It all come down to each player's individual skill. Unless the more skilled fighter makes a mistake, they will usually win. However, once you get decent enough to understand different openers and offensive/reactive play styles, you may be able to set yourself up to counter a more skilled opponent's move (especially if they usually open with the exact same move).  If you really stick with this game and put the time in to get better, you'll find a competitively deep experience with almost limitless combat options and an incredibly high skill cap. If you just want to play casually, you'll find a whole lot of flailing and a few cheap laughs. Either way, it's free, so why not give it a shot?",

I for one have never heared of any other game like this and im really liking it so far. The first day i got this i immediatly called one of my buddies up and asked him to join me, we played for around 8 hours on end.  Please ignore all of the reviews that say 'This game is buggy.', 'This game is to difficult.', ect. Because I for one have not found a single bug within the game and yes its a hard game but that only makes the game that much better because it gives you something to work at.  What makes this game awesome? Well besides just the general feel of the game Toribash throws a TON of mods at you to play around with. Another thing i love about Toribash is the difficulty, i for one am always trying to get better at the game. Besides that the game requires very little to run and has a really fast download speed. I also enjoy the character customization. Mainly due to the market, something that costs 500 TC someone could be selling for 250 TC.  What i feel isnt so good. The one thing i've noticed is people from higher ranks making new accounts. Now people do this to be able to get TC easier then transfer it over to their main account which really annoys me. Another thing is that once you get around Orange belt there arnt really any servers. And the few that they have are always pact with people. So if your one of those people who constantly try to get better and through time have just leveled up, by the time you get to Orange you are going to wait 20 minutes to lose over and over and over agian.  Now all around this game is quite amazing, dispite what i feel isnt to good about the game.  9/10",

Great bunch of people, great tutorials, etc. This is one of those games that has a ridiculously high skill cap and has a ♥♥♥♥tarded difficulty spike, but if you invest the time to learn the game you'll get as addicted as I did. At first all I ever did was just press C to go into lock-joint mode and then swung my arms around willy-nilly but a year after starting I was doing glorious decapitations with the best of them.

Now I've gotten back into Toribash after a 3-year hiatus and although I play MOBAs most of the time I still find time to reexplore the game I loved so much when I was 14.

If you watch a black-belt fight they will be doing moves you probably don't even understand the purpose of.  + Replays look incredibly awesome (and also stupid at the same time).  +More than 50 different 'mods', each with unique strategy. I personally dislike some of the more common ones, because it's too common to win after the first turn, but that's fine because mods like Tilt_Fix (where you joust on a horse) and Lenshu (where you need to be on the ground for a second straight to lose) play completely differently from them!  +The 1v1 nature of the game makes it very fun with friends. And even if your friend has never played the game before, you can 'go easy on him' and still have lots of fun by trying crazy moves that you don't think you can pull off right.  +Simultaneous turns mean that the game happens pretty quickly, even though it is technically turn-based.   -Controls are difficult. I would prefer to have each joint bound to a different key.  -No 'Quick Match' feature, so you often get stuck waiting for the other people on the server to finish...  -First 5-10 hours are TERRIBLE. I rage-quit multiple times. But honestly, it's not as bad as learning LoL or DotA.   'But it's too hard' - IGN 4/10 (no srsly that actually happened)",
