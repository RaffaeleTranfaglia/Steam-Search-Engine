            "review_text": "I played through it once before buying it on my own Account.  I didn't expect much but was very positively surprised and felt like i owed it to the Developer to buy it for myself as well.   It's a bit rough around the edges especially with some enemy attacks that could use a start up frame to make reacting to their actions a bit easier but the combat works well enough and is fun to master.  The World is gorgeous (if you can appreciate the art style) intriguing and most of all fun to explore.  The cryptic and mind bending story is enjoyable enough but like the combat there are some bumps in the dialogue here and there.  All in all a great experience with forgivable flaws.",
