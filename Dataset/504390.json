            "review_text": "This game is exactly what i expected when i bought it:  It is a relatively short (first playthrough took around two hours), visually appealing interactive novel with interesting side and main characters.  Towards the end of the game the choices you made will have influence both the main character and the storyline in a mayor way which should lead to a fair amount of replayability.  If you like visual novels with mild occult themes (degree varies with your choices) you will most likely enjoy this one.",

            "review_text": "Enjoyable interactive novel. Your choices influence how your story develops keeping you curious how it goes on.  It has a nice style and it's impressing how much efford they put into the rough but effective graphics. Unfortunately the writing is a little rough, too. While the story is top-notch, the main character shows little personality (except when she's being silly in situations where the player has no control.)  Taking my time, enjoying the art style and story, it took me around 3.5 hours to play through it once. So if you enjoy this type of game it's highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "1st Playthrough :  This Visual Novel left me so many options that I was left lost into this beautifully made story. The choices Along The Edge gives us are just like a personality test , meaning the more you make decisions the more you feel like 'you' are Daphne and all I can say is that , it's an amazing feeling.   Ive just finished my very first playthrough and I really want to know what the other choices will do and affect the story. Let's just say that this time ill believe more into Witchcraft , will I sacrifice people by doing so ? I can't wait to find out :3  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  2nd playthrough  My second time being into daphne's body. Went more onto the witch side of her. Turns out I was f***ing evil XD loved the visuals of this 'arc' I had to do quite difficult decisions compared to my first playthrough when everything was matured. This time since I went more easy-going it felt as if I had no control over the situation. This 'Ark' had alot harder decisions than my 'usual self' I like to say that. The game really does make you feel like you are daphne , you plundge into the game and the rest kind of just 'happens'. Love this game!  After multiple Playthroughs  after unlocking a lot of the ending possible I was soon tired of this game , not because its not good trust me this game really is unique your first playthrough will really feel amazing. But after that , it starts getting repetitive alot , its like playing a Eroge game and be stuck with this only girl , but there is multiple routes to get to her but all the routes are the same thing. In Along the Edge I really liked how my first experience with the game was , second time wasn't so bad. after that I found myself spaming the space bar to get to choices because I had already read all of that like 3 times already. Every choices should make the story completly different. like at the begining of the game ( spoilers alert js) you are given the choice to be matured or get upset after this lady that doesn't like you. if you are nice to her she will hate you , if your bad with her she stills hate you. then you go to a party and a drunk boy comes a kisses you. the lady is there and tells you to back off. you try to be nice with her she throws you wine , you get upset she still throws you wine. and it's like that until chapter 4. but the game only has 5 chapters XD , the only thing that changes is the way your character think. the choices won't change the story but they'll change who you are and how you see things , and for that I think this game deserves a praise. I just think that the game could have done so much better like eroge games and have routes which lasts for like 40 hours.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  5 playtrough - 7/10 reason : too short and repetitive after multiple playthroughs.",
