I dunno, I feel it just needs more, the dev charged the rigth price tho.  Just needs more, get to it dev, it can be more, just keep trying, and find free sounds and audio so you dont get sued for copyrightable materials (audio)",

Control scheme is...not the best, game is barely explained, and even on the easiest difficulty I couldn't walk a foot out of the bunkers without being spotted almost straight away.  Shows some promise of an interesting little stealth game, but...not executed well.",
