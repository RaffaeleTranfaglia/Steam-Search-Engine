            "review_text": "This is gonna sound all kinds of strange, but I'm recommending the game. Is the game good? Not at all! Is it fun? Yes. Yes it is.  Brief history lesson: Heuristic Park released version 1.0 of Dungeon Lords in 2005. It received patches in the classic sense - update files that you download, execute, point toward your install folder and let it to the work. These patches, however, didn't do much as far as I'm aware.  My history with it was that I got the Collector's Edition, a special rerelease which fixed several bugs and had a new character class and a tonne of new content! I found it when I was rather young at a dollar store. I didn't know why an RPG of such scale was in a dollar store, but lo and behold! I get back home, pop it into my Windows XP computer and give it a launch. The game was buggy, with spells like Freezing Touch and Burning Hands not working, and all sorts of great stuff.  I originally wrote off the acrobatics system as faulty, however it didn't tell me that you needed certain ranks in the Acrobatics skill to use certain dodge rolls and flips. This was pretty nice, albeit unexplained. Perhaps the Freezing Touch and Burning Hands problem was a matter of the skill system too? I don't know.  The matter at hand here is that the game was rereleased in 2012 in the form you see now. It was entirely reworked: An engine overhaul, new systems, fancy effects, a point-and-click mode, etc.  The original version of the game always had co-op, through LAN or internet play. Now, we have Steam for eight-player co-op.  I'm going to highlight some of the main differences between the versions here:  The spell system: In the original, you could usually find spells out in the wilderness as loot, and depending on your starting class you may have started with one or two. As far as I know you may have been able to put ranks in any type of magic skill and use it, but I may be wrong. In this Steam Edition, you get one spell per level, and each class seems to have a certain type of magic they use, that they learn each level.  The skill system: In the original, there were many types of skills, and you could rank up in any one you pleased using a skill point. In this version of the game, your skills gain experience in a similar way to how you level up in The Elder Scrolls or Final Fantasy II: You use something, it gains experience. You gain skill points every level, but if you use one on a skill, it just gives it an experience boost, and will not guarantee a level up. I'm personally not much a fan of this.  The graphics: The game now has fancy bloom and fog, and WORKING particle effects! The UI is a little less polished than it originally was, but I still find it enjoyable.  The multiplayer: Hoo boy, is this game a hoot to play online. The bugs or simple obscurity of practically EVERYTHING in this game makes this game a laugh to play with others. The Collector's Edition is absolutely riddled with bugs or quirks, while the netcode works well. Saves are confusing, but the bugs and problems make the game hilarious! I have yet to test the game in this Steam Edition, but various skills now apply to your allies as well as yourself. It creates a new dynamic that wasn't present in the original.  The verdict: Not mentioned above: The physics of this version aren't as... Tight, so to say, as the original/Collector's Edition, and the old spell system was quite nice. This version's difficulty seems much easier than the original's, and in the first dungeon alone I leveled up five times more than I usually did in the original! This isn't so much a problem, but it's interesting to say the least.  If you want a solid RPG and don't mind the price tag, get this version! If you want a laugh and a more solid system (WHEN it works) then play the original or the Collector's Edition. Either way, it's an RPG on the PC with cooperative multiplayer. A+ From me!",

I was so hyped to play, screaming DUNJIB LORDS at the top of my lungs. A faint voice from downstairs yelling 'ᵈᵘᶰʲᶦᶰ ᶫᵒʳᵈˢ' after I.   If you want the best game ever to grace steam, buy this. I know for a FACT you will love it. Trust me guy.   ",

            "review_text": "A complex and ambitious game, but clunky, with many usability problems and ultimately unfulfilling.  - There are many skills. Some of them increase automatically with use, some of them do not. It is not always clear what skill levels do and what is worth upgrading. - There is random loot but 95% of the items you find are useless junk - Combined with the fact that you cannot sort inventory, this leads very quickly to chaos - Some enemies are placed manually in the maps, but there are also mobs that respawn randomly behind you. The respawn rate is quick and this makes dungeon crawling annoying. - Some items can be used, some doors opened, but the game doesn't say which - Combat is realtime, based on skills with cooldowns, and it's very clunky - Story and writing are, from what I saw in the few hours I played, quite bad  Overall: Not recommended.",

Me and my brother also never had an issue with multiplayer. With the steam edition the game has trouble starting up the inventories and menus in game have all benn changed and they are harder to use. I wanted to get this game for multiplayer but after a few seconds the person I was playing with would have their character freaze. The game wouldn't let them exit out, and it wouldn't let me exit either. This game was always fun to play, but the steam edition is barely playable in multiplayer.",
