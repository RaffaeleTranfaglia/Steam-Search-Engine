            "review_text": "'Heileen 3: New Horizons' is final chapter in Heileen saga of visual novels by Winter Wolves. In short, it's telling the story of a young girl accompanying her rich uncle (who is pursuing the business in the New World) and eventually getting involved with pirates. It features all you can expect from a visual novel and it features elements of dating and raising sim. The game is running on Ren'Py engine and is not voiced (considering the number of characters, I actually see it as a sensible choice from the developer).  The story itself is quite good and engaging, with the laid back approach - but not entirely avoiding the mature themes (infidelity, prostitution, incest) under the cute anime-style visuals. For the most part, it feels like a family Caribbean trip, but the real life problems are still there and surfacting from time to time. And this style fits well the narrative, as the main female protagonist is a rich, spoiled child of a wealthy merchant, who is just learning about life. After the previous experienes, in 'Heileen 3' our heroine's goal is to discover her own path in life (learning skills to unlock the 14 profession endings) and to find true love (8 romance endings).  The most original part of the game is the mechanic of virtues and sins, which are represented by (beautifully designed) cards. While the mystery and magic surrounding the cards are not present here to the same extent as in 'Heileen 2' (where the cards were the main focus), their implementation is smoother, and the choice-consequence system is clear and logical.  Romances are well written, and pursuing some of the characters (my favorite being Juliet) is fun. To set the record straight from the beginning: there is no real nudity there, and the sexual references are mild. Following different paths, you start to see the same events from a perspective of a different character, and it's nice to discover, that a guy/girl that you saw as a complete jerk, actually had some reasons to behave the way he/she did. Unclocking all 22 endings however, turns the game into inevitable clickfest. This is especially the case with the 'profession' endings: stats building is a painful grind, while the epilogues are not as rewarding as the final romance scenes. This is the biggest, and in my opinion, the only real flaw of the game. The good news is, the option of skipping the previously read scenes works as it should.  This is, by the large margin, the biggest and most refined entry in the series, and it's a sheer pleasure to see how the developer improved the experience with each entry, making the finale a satisfying and solid conclusion to the story started in 'Sail Away' and continued in 'The Hands Of Fate'.To get the most of the game, it is highly recommended to play through the whole series, to get familiar with the characters and preceeding events. In my opinion, skipping the first two games (even if theoretically possible) would lessen your experience considerably. You have to keep in mind, though, that first two games (especially the first one) are shorter and limited in comparison, but they are still worth it for the complete experience.  To conclude this review, 'Heileen 3: New Horizons' is a charming, uplifting, well-writen visual novel with a beautiful art. If you are into visual novels, I highly recommend getting the whole series on sale (and checking the other games from Winter Wolves; there are free demo versions available).  Pros: + well-written story with (mostly) charming characters + 8 romances (4 male, 4 female) + game lenght (your mileage can vary, but 10 hours is a safe assumption when trying multiple endings) + very good visuals and audio   Cons: - stats building can become tedious",

Gameplay involves clicking various skill boxes over and over for hours at a time and choosing one of two dialogue choices once in a while.",
