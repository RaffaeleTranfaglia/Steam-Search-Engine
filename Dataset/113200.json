            "review_text": " In short, is the game good?  Yes, yes and triple yes.   Is it worth my time and money?  Yes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.   Is this game for anyone?  Considering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.   Linear, open-world or something else?  Something else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, 'champion' versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.   Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?  You run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).   Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?  The game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.   Audio design and soundtrack?  Excellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.   Plot, story?  Quite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.   How does the game run?  I have played and 'finished' (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the 'Auto' settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more 'crowded' rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to 'Low' eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.   Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?  Yes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.   Anything you didn't like?  Yes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a 'recomendation', in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.   Final score?  I give The Binding of Isaac (+The Wrath of The Lamb) a Mom's Knife out of 5.",

While the artstyle is very cartoony it still has some disturbing imagery and grotesque designs. That being said, this childlike portayal of such menacing sights offers a very interesting visual presentation for the game.  The proof, however, lies in the playing. This begs the question of how well The Binding of Isaac's gameplay holds up. For being such a simple idea initially to shoot baddies while avoiding being shot yourself a surprising amount of complexity is added with its varied item combinations. One game session you may find yourself becoming a flying demon spitting unforgiving lasers from hell, while in the next you may be stuck peeing on enemies as your only form of self defence. The game also does an okay job of ramping up the difficulty as the player progresses.  In conclusion, give this game a spin if you can spare the money and you can handle its graphical style. You may also want to consider picking up the expansion Wrath of the Lamb, it makes it even better.",

The performance is about as stable and reliable as a one-legged mountain goat, and the game is rife with bugs. The only graphical settings are the nondescript 'Low, Medium, High', and the game is locked to a certain resolution. There is no controller support, and your progress gets wiped if you clear Flash memory. If you want to play Isaac, just wait for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake that not only gets rid of Flash but also expands on the game.",

Though dying sucks, you'll still likely feel a sense of achievement as you go deeper into the story and unlock more content. I highly recommend having the wiki open while playing, as there are a ton of items with different and obscure effects. I'd also like to suggest playing the base game for a bit before activating the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. It's a fun and compelling game that's just hard enough to make you want to give it another shot, over and over again. Once you've completed some achievements, you can even change youre starting character. The soundtrack is astounding and the enemies are creative. 10/10 Because 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' is coming out soon, it's probably wise to wait and see if that's any good before buying this. It's supposed to have a lot of new features. The fact that Rebirth exists doesn't make this game any less good but if you can only buy one, you should know you're getting the best.",

            "review_text": "The Binding of Isaac Game Review  The binding of Isaac is a indie rogue-like platformer game about a child called Isaac and his crazy religious mother. It is a game filled with secrets and unlockable characters and items with 2 DLC packs. After playing The Binding of Isaac for a few hours I realised there was a reason so many people described the game as “Unforgiving” and “disturbing”, It’s because its filled with satanic references, blood and gore. Not only that but The Binding of Isaac is incredibly difficult, only after my first 10 tries was I able to kill mom once. My favourite thing about The Binding of Isaac would have to be the game breaking aspect. By game breaking I mean there are some incompatible items in the game which cause you to have infinite health or can help you to get every item in the game. There is actually a massive part of the community that has dedicated itself to finding game breaking glitches that can make them extremely overpowered; some of these people have broken the game to the extent that a single attack on any boss will kill them instantly.  Controls and Gameplay  The controls to The Binding of Isaac are basic. WASD to move and your arrow keys to direct your attack. You move around the basement from room to room, each room containing something different. There are normal rooms which contain enemies, gold rooms which contain power up items that will impact your speed, damage, health and can sometimes impact you negatively.  You first meet Isaac and his mother in the loading screen for the game which describes their lives as being happy until she hears a voice from above. The voice of god tells her to kill Isaac and Isaac, hearing this, flees into the houses basement to get away from his homicidal mother which is when the games main menu loads. The game is about Isaac making his way through the basement to eventually reach and kill the boss, Mom. As you make your way through the basement you will encounter multiple different types of enemies (foetuses, pinworms, embryos, flaming headless monsters and lots of bugs) which will all try to kill you.  Graphics and Sound  The graphics for The Binding of Isaac were made to have a retro feel to them. They have options for the in game detail which affects the rooms you enter. High detail means there will be cobwebs and blood on the walls while low detail will give you none of that. The detail setting also affects the pixels in game so setting it to low will give you a very fuzzy effect while high makes it look HD in comparison.  The music in The Binding of Isaac is very varied. The music changes depending on the floor and room you are on/in. The music keeps you focused while playing and can help you to know what type of room or floor you are on. The sounds in The Binding of Isaac are very eerie to say the least. The squishing noises when you kill monsters and the screaming from bosses I found to be very unsettling when I was playing and actually impacted on my performance when I was playing.   Replayability and Multiplayer  The Binding of Isaac is literally the most replayable game I have ever played; this is because of how unforgiving the game and how interesting the storyline is. With over 341 items and 178 secrets in the game you must replay constantly to finish the game with everything unlocked.  There has never been a official multiplayer feature for The Binding of Isaac however the great community surrounding it has created a few multiplayer mods for people to use. This let you play 2 players with you and another person on the same keyboard and you can both move around and shoot and fight enemies. Although the multiplayer mod is good, I think it ruins the game as there is no balancing aspect to the mod meaning there is now2 players but the same amount of bosses and enemies.  To Conclude  I found The Binding of Isaac to be a ridiculously good indie game. The complexity of the story line and the references to religion surprised me and definitely made me enjoy the game a lot more. At only £4.00 this game is definitely one I would pick up off the steam store, especially as it is now one of my most played games and it’s one of the cheapest I own, this game practically pays for itself in minutes. The games DLC is also worth getting as it doubles the amount of content that is already inside this jam packed game, it adds characters, items, floors, monsters and more difficult bosses. So to give this game a rating I would have to give it a: • Easy to learn controls ✓ • Gameplay ✓ • Graphics ✓ • Sound/Music ✓ • Replayable ✓ • Multiplayer X RATED 5/6",

If you are curious what you are getting into it, it's something strangely familiar and incredibly well made. It is basically a top down shooter reminescent of old Zelda games (my favorite kind) with roguelike elements and some twisted humor.  *On a side note: buy the DLC, I don't need to add why, its everything you love topped with more of what you love.  Roguelikes have been making a resurgence lately as part of the revisionist mantra of 'real gamers like hardcore challenges'. Which is all well and good, sure I like to be challenged in certain ways, but I definitely like to relax too. More importantly it's not just any challenge that gamers should clamor for, it's the good kind, the fair kind. Team Meat has this down perfectly. When ever you die in one of their games it's not a question of a flaw in the game's design, an enemy that is overpower, or an impossible obstacle, the only the wrong is you. The game has a simple set of mechanics and some secrets in gameplay that you can and should figure out on your own. When you lose in this game you should feel that welcome brand of shame that says 'I should've known better'. This game isn't trying to fool, you know what you are playing and you know what you should've done.  The real draw from a game that is continously killing you, besides the superb gamplay, is the sense of progress and reward. There is a plethora of secrets to be found in The Binding of Isaac, all unlocked in a variety of ways and adding to the gameplay. The game starts with Isaac, there are more characters to unlock later, shooting tears and running around naked. From defeating bosses, random chests, or treasure rooms, Isaac unlocks various items that alter his abilities. Most of the abilities are passive and stack, and some are useable abilities like cards or a cat's head. These items are all random ( a treasure may net you a spiffy spider upgrade to your tears or just a teleporter) and the levels are procedurally generated. On top of all the game altering the items can do, they also change your character's appearance into something that is usually atrocious and hilarious.  The Binding of Isaac will kill you a lot (and not in the Dark Souls way where you can still get something back and respawn from the last campfire), but you will never feel like it was a waste. I've had some two minute sessions of this game that netted me a new secret item, and there is always something to unlock in The Binding of Isaac. After dying so many times you will get better, and then you will still keep dying, but you'll enjoy it.   ",

The game operates on the premise that your mother is out to kill you and you are trying to escape horrible, horrible death. So, you jump into the basement. This is where the game earns its keep. Isaac is a 2-D Top Down Shooter with randomly generated levels where death means the end of a run and your success can largely depend on the luck of the items randomly generated within those levels.  The game is pretty much about avoiding damage while clearing rooms while finding upgrades so you can win the game. It rarely approaches the level of bullethell dodging, but mostly just relies on sheer variety of enemies &amp; bosses to kill you, whether through that one bullet you walked into or the one fly who you ignored who rammed into you. Still, it's pretty much all dodgeable at the end of the day, with a few unfair moments. Still, that's what makes this roguelike so much fun.",

            "review_text": "The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike game in which you play as a child traversing through randomly generated levels with the goal of stopping your mom from killing you. There is a large number of items that also randomly generate each playthrough that you can use to aid in your adventure. As you play the game, you unlock secrets and additional items to use in future playthroughs.  With the Wrath of Lamb DLC, there are additional items, a new item type, floors (as opposed to levels), and bosses. The DLC also introduces challenges that limit (or otherwise challenge) you, which upon completion unlock new items for the main game. If you are considering buying The Binding of Isaac, I highly recommend also purchasing the Wrath of Lamb DLC.  This game is heavy on both skill and luck. You will die a lot when you start playing the game. It will take many, many attempts to defeat the first final boss for the first time. As you complete playthroughs and unlock secrets, you will gain skill and new items that may help you in future playthroughs.   The biggest issue with this game is that the framerate drops when a lot of tears (projectiles) or flashing enemies (flies), probably due to using the Flash engine. This is highly noticeable while playing the game, especially upon completing two certain bosses. It took me at least 10 in-game hours to get used to the wild framerate. Another issue is that the game may almost crash when it tries generating certain floors, which can be resolved by waiting for the program to respond even if the option to close the problem comes up.  If you are interested in the game and would probably play this game a lot (tens and tens of hours), I would recommend purchasing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which is a remake of the original game and DLC. A lot of new items, challenges, characters, enemies, and bosses are introduced. The art style is better (imo), the mechanics are better due to the change in game engine, and the game runs much more smoothly. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth costs $14.99 normally. It is up to you on which you purchase if you want to.",

Contrary to popular belief, The Binding of Isaac is not hard, more, unforgiving. Many will be turned off by the nature of reviews stating it is hard and requires much skill. I find it, however, more unforgiving than 'hard'. Yes, there is a difference.  'Well, what do you mean?', says random bystander awed by hearing other's analysis being gone against.   Well, you see, anyone who has played The Binding of Isaac can tell you it is a randomly generated game. This aspect gives it a very nice value of replayablility. Luck is a key factor in this generation, so you want a 'lucky' run. However, anyone with a lot of skill CAN beat this game with crappy items. You see, the challenge does not stem from its risky 1 life gameplay style, as you can restart and get better items, possibly a 1-up to give you another life, the challenge comes from the random generation and ♥♥♥♥ loads of projectiles. However, you can master this game. Like I said before, you can use your skill to beat this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Some strategies such as Secret Room guessing, and knowing how to avoid certain items really helps a lot. The secret to beating this game is to be immersed in its content and variables.    'So what? You can beat the game if you take into consideration your knowledge of this game. What makes you think more people will buy it?', says a bystander who keeps getting owned by Peeps.   Well, you see, The Binding of Isaac has had a reputation for being an infamously hard game. The real ironic thing is, people can beat it in their first few runs. Then more content unlocks, and they gradually keep becoming better at the game. The game is not hard, its just a thing you can't plow through. I hope this will help people off put by the game's reputation as 'hard' join in on the fun. I'm sorry this isn't much of a review, I'm really busy (With doing nothing) and I can't be bothered to write a full review. Though to truly know this game, you must play it yourself.

Considering that I have more than 20 hours into this game and have only beaten it 5 times :C. The trick to this game is that death is permanent for your current playthrough. Once you die you have to restart at the beginning and pray for good items.   IF you aren't accustomed to the perma-death scenario I don't reccommend this game. I enjoy it purely because of the flexibility of the levels and the ever-changing drops.   This game is a great game and has a good price imo.",

GAMEPLAY - 6/10  - Simple but hard to master controls. Depends on anyones taste.  - The game has its own economy and a SH*TLOAD of upgrades, active skills and consumables to be discovered. Each upgrade and skill is very interesting and fun to mess around with. While it's tempting to google what does what, it's way better fun to just pick something up and see what it does.  - Levels are randomized and there is a lot of various monsters and bosses to spice things up. You won't play the game the same way twice. From this point of view the game offers infinite replayability, but...  - The fact that everything is so heavily randomized prevents you from forming any sort of your own strategy. You just dive in and keep going until you win or die. Over time, this reduces the cool variety to the point where you're doing the same thing over and over again and it's only a liiiiiiiittle bit different because of some dice roll.   - There is not much persistence to keep you returning for more. There are few unlockable characters and mandatory achievements but upgrades and skills are limited for each run where you find them. While it's nice to know that the game doesn't have you on a leash trying to unlock everything, it doesn't really motivate you to achieve anything when you start from zero every single time.",

He needs to be cut off from all that is evil, and confess his sins!' 'I will follow your instructions, Lord! I have faith in thee!' Isaac's Mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from all the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her: 'You have done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me! To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.' 'Yes lord. Anything!' Isaac's mother begged. 'To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room, and end his life, as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else.' 'Yes, Lord,' she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the Basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door,  and threw himself down, into the unknown depths below.  And thus begins one of the best games I've ever played, on Steam or otherwise. In this game you play as Isaac (or one of 6 other characters who may or may not also be Isaac in different costumes, depending on your interpretation of the endings) and go through randomized floors of the Basement (and the caves, and depths, and maybe even beyond!), collecting all sorts of weird/gross powerups to eventually face-off your Mother. Even if you've played Rebirth, I'd recommend you pick this up, if only just to see where it all began. It doesn't run perfectly (since it was programmed in Flash it's capped at 30FPS, but if you're on a toaster like me, that might be more than you get on rebirth! The soundtrack is superb (and personally better than rebirth's soundtrack IMO), and the graphics just kind of work (it looks like it's all part of Isaac's drawings, which according to the first ending, it is) Pros: -Harder than Rebirth (due to mechanics changes and a lack of SUPER op items that aren't extremely rare to compensate for their power) -10/10 soundtrack (even just opening it up today i found myself subconsiously humming the title screen music!) -Spooky, but in a good way (ie subtlety, and not hamfisted jumpscares) -Replayability (especially with the new 'Eternal Edition' update, I still haven't been able to beat some of those new bosses)  Neutral: -Different styled boss fights than Rebirth (while Rebirth has a lot of bullet hell-type fights, BoI has more mechanical fights, for example, instead of shooting bullet hell patterns like in Rebirth, the 'true' final boss will shoot at you only when you shoot, matching your fire rate, and some bosses like Carrion Queen are more about dodging the ground hazards while making sure to hit her weak point. Some people may prefer it, some may not, it's mostly a matter of personal preference)  Cons: -Fewer item synergies than Rebirth (Brimstone doesn't really synergize with anything aside from generic tear effects, Mom's Knife SORTA works with Spoon Bender and other similar effects i can't remember the name of in that the knife sorta wiggles in the direction of enemies, but mostly just keeps its same trajectory) -Lower framerate  -No controller support (unless you use Joy2Key)  One thing to keep in mind if you havent played it before, is that Wrath of the Lamb actually makes the game harder (by giving you a random chance to get alternate, harder versions of floors, and various curses that can help/hinder you), so if you're playing for the first time, you may not want to get the DLC right away, at least not until you've beaten the game a few times to unlock stuff. Also, you won't want hard mode on unless you're experienced with this game. Normal mode in this is equivalent to hard mode in Rebirth, so it's already decently hard.  Overall i definitely recommend this, you basically have no excuse not to pick this up if it's on sale because the price gets pretty low, and if you're like me you'll probably end up with a ton of time in this game (ignore my steam played stats, a lot of my progress was offline or using SpiderMod/Community Remix mod, which is why i'm missing a few achievements and still have platinum god)",

Filled with a variety of items, which give you new powers and new aesthetics as well, every time getting randomized, one gameplay in 100 isn't even nearly the same, despite having the same levels, the maps and items are always random, but you could slowly but surly start figuring out some patterns, despite having a minimalistic tutorial at the start, you will be on your own after room 1. The whole game is a combination of LUCK and SKILL, both of them which are raised by EXPERIENCE (actually playing and replaying the game), it also involves some currency/item management and some though decisions, despite the lack of an actual inventory, you will gamble your way to the top or you will play it safe, the decision is yours.  WARNING: The game uses flash, not just once it happened to me that the game would crash due to high number of powerups/items picked up during the gameplay, resulting to a laggy/crashy gameplay. I played it a while ago, I heard of an upcoming new version, not sure if they updated or fixed the current one.

            "review_text": "note: I played this mostly offline, and have put considerably more than 4 hours into it.  I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really don't like the Binding of Isaac. There are a lot of things to like about it, most notably the wonderfully grotesque design, but I personally hate the core mechanics. I really really tried to love it (largely because it was a game that was easy to play on the bus), but eventually gave up.  Ok, so Binding of Isaac is a rogue-like, so we already know you're going to be dying and restarting a lot. That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that you don't get better with each subsequent death. There's no lineage system or inventory hold over that helps you make a little more progress with each new game, you are just literally starting from scratch each time. And the controls are not complicated, so there isn't even an element of mastering the game's mechanics as progression.  And then there's other major design decision that I hate, the complete randomness. Procedurally generated games can be a ton of fun and help to keep things interesting, but your success in each run of this game is largely decided before you even leave the first room. The enemies being random is great, it keeps things from being rote. However, the power-ups being random is a huge problem because of the disparity between them. Power-ups can be utterly worthless, or god-tier, and you never know what you're going to go get. But because your previous attempts don't have any impact, you're relying entirely on the much necessary power-ups, which are sometimes just going to be useless.  One of my best runs was actually one of my first. In one of the first rooms I picked up a power-up that just devastated every enemy I came across. I've never been that lucky again. I enjoy challenging games, but there needs to be some sort of progression either through leveling or mastery of the mechanics, and Binding of Isaac has neither. There are of course going to be minor improvements to how you play, but for the most part, your 100th attempt has just as much chance of success as your 2nd attempt, and it's going to be based on what procedural roll you got. While this clearly doesn't deter most people, I find it to be an uninteresting set of mechanics that generally lead to wasting time on a run that was doomed to fail.",

Also, though the story with Isaac and his Mother is not exactly the most emphatic or traditionally presented part of the game, or what really keeps a person playing it (I imagine), it definitely adds a boost in character to the game and really opens a lot to think on if one decides they feel like doing so.

With that in mind, I find myself going through spurts of loving this game to pieces, playing it bit by bit and getting better as time goes by, collecting more and more items as my personal list of achievements grows. With that in mind, The Binding of Issac more than delivers on its content for the price of 5 dollars (plus seven if you get the incredibly fun 'Wrath of the Lamb' DLC). The game runs as an overhead shooter that drops you in the middle of a basement of horrors, pitting you against enemy after enemy as you struggle to survive against the different waves. At its very core the game is very simple: Kill the enemies with your weapon of choice while also avoiding the enemies with WASD at the same time. Once you are able to grasp the difficulty, it makes this game a very rewarding experience. But the true gold of the game shines through as you realize that there is a great deal of items available. In fact, there are so many items available that it makes for a different experience every time you play the game. Add the randomly generated dungeons and enemies throughout the game and you get to the point where you find yourself with an entirely different experience each time you play through the game. That being said, the game is not for those who are easily frustrated, as you will find yourself playing through it multiple times before you even get close to your desired goal.

You'll probably rage quit a few times and it takes a while to get good at the game but it's worth it, I'm hooked! The DLC is pretty good too but I'd advise getting seasoned with the game first as it does make things harder. More monsters, floors and items.. Everything you need to make each playthrough even more different from the last! Buy this game, because for £3.99 it's a steal, and if you can get it in a sale even better!",

Of all of the games I have on Steam this is the game I most consistantly come back to. You play as Isaac a young boy who lives with his Christian mother, however one day your mother hears the voice of God telling her to kill her son as a sacrifice to prove her loyalty. The game definitely gives that creepy vibe of religious fanaticism. As far as gameplay it is very simply you move around with WASD and shoot your tears at enemies with the arrow keys. If is very simple but very elegant gameplay that takes very obviously after the original Legend of Zelda game. The difference is that Isaac is a rouge-like meaning that you play every run with permadeath, as soon as you die you have to restart and even cooler with the wide selection of items no two runs feel the same. You could get an absurdly powerful item such as brimstone or mom's knife to start off your run, conversely you might get something as awkward as lemon mishap. If you are a fan of randomly generated levels and runs that are different every time then Isaac is definitley worth checking out. Though just be forewarned of the messed up nature of the game. If you are alright with creepy, and downright ridiculous enemies, bosses and story then Isaac gives you a game with very solid gameplay that can easily give you countless hours of enjoyment that constantly leaves you with the feeling of wanting to play just one more run.",

It is just the very nature of the game itself to be honestly brutal. Are you up for a challenge? Even when the game gives you nothing, will your skills be enough to press on and be victorius?    Challenge accepted. I was victorius. It's now your turn!   I was very impressed with this game. I played it for free (Hacked version!) for 250+ hours. However, I knew that buying the game and supporting the creator was the best way to make sure more games like this get created. The level of detail to balance... the skill needed to beat the game... All the items that had super uniqueness about them... Priceless. Happily I bought the game and the expandsion, and it was even better than the hacked version. Tons better than the hacked version!   It is really unbelievable how wonderful this game is.   500 hours of my life, enjoyed so very much. I will be buying the remake in a heartbeat.

Anyway, TBoI is a game in which you are a small child escaping your mom coz she wants to sacrifice you to prove she loves God above all else. So you jump into a basement (coz logic) and the adventure begins. The game's areas are set out as randomly generated dungeons, meaning you could have the best item stream ever, or get a really s*** one. That brings me to items; there is at least one item you can pick up per floor (well, two, since you get one from beating a boss) and they can range from upgrading your tears (your main 'weapon' in the game) to making you Satan (literally).  And finally, the bosses. Oh man, the bosses. I'll just say this (coz I can't explain anything). Watch out for Widow, The Wretched and your mom.",

A downside of the game, for me, is the utter randomness of it. Sometimes you'll get lucky and have a super build, sometimes you'll just get crappy items over crappy items. I should warn you about it's difficulty, too. Some rooms are very hard and you need extra quick reaction time not to get hurt, and this is where Flash was a bad choice, making the game laggy when too many elements are on screen.

For the most part, even if you could care less about the story, music, or art, the game is downright FUN. It's (obviously) punishing, since it's a rogue-like, ridiculously simple to pick up but hard to master, and no two runs are the same. If you really want something that's BAD about this game, the only thing that really comes to mind is the lack of co-op, local or otherwise (solved in Rebirth), and item balance (for the most part, one of the first things you'll hear about this game is just how ridiculously broken Ipecac or Mom's Knife can be).  One of the very few games that I can say should be priced HIGHER, can only see that it's dropped in price probably because of how spoiled the community is with sales. Back when it was $10, it often went on sale for a whopping $2USD WITH DLC. I won't lie, I bought it at that price tag. Had I known how damn awesome this game would be, I'd have honestly bought it full-price.  Please do yourself a favor and get the DLC, it practically doubles the content.",

Some friends told me that it was not worth its full price and I should just wait for the discount but I didnt listen to them. This game is completely worth its price. Its only five dollars without the DLC and eight dollars with the DLC making it extremely cheap. This game requires very little power so I could play it on my terrible laptop. When I first started playing this game I was so bad at it and I wondered how anyone could ever beat it. But if you play this game for the first few rounds you will start to want to play more and more and beat what you got last game. The first ten times you beat the game, even if its with the same character, you get something new. Then you can beat it with all the other characters. Every character has their good parts and bad parts. Character choice is also a crucial decision even in the late game making you really have to figure out who you like to pay as. Some poeple say that this game is very small and that is true but you have to remember that this actually started out as a flash game. ocne youve beat the game a lot it starts to feel a bit repetative but to give you an example of what I mean by a lot, I have played over 200 hours of this game and only in the past 2 hours or so did I start to feel it getting boring. But that means that I got about 25 hours of gameplay for every dollar I spent. This is a great game if you like roguelike games. Every run is either a bit or completely different from the others depending on what items you choose to pick up. This isnt a multiplayer game but its fun to play around friends to see peoples different strategys. I really enjoyed this game and all my friends hate me because I played to much of it. 9.5/10 Stats: Money: 10/10 (Really cheap game) Controls: 10/10 (They work and they're easy to learn) Sound: 8/10 (The soundtrack is ok, I dont normally play with volume on) Replayability 10/10 (200 hours, each run is about a half an hour need I say more?)

The game can get rather tricky when tackling boss stages and using your money can be trouble; however, if you're into games that doesn't tend to last long or have sweet abilities and sometimes feel very powerful or very weak, I think it's a must play.",

In this game there is permadeath--no checkpoints; if you die you must start over from the beginning. In each procedurally generated floor, there are progressively greater numbers of rooms filled with progressively harder enemies. Within these rooms you get pickup items such as bombs and keys, as well as collectible items that upgrade your character with such effects as increased fire rate, homing tears, flight, and many many more. The enemies are varied and entertaining, the endless RNG ensures that no two runs are the same, and the selection of nearly 200 items will have Isaac finishing every run with a different look and different abilities. This is an absolutely brilliant game with well-balanced difficulty, (that is, hard, but not rage-inducing Dark Souls-tier hard) tight controls, amusing art, and endless replay value. Go ahead and spend the small price of five dollars. I assure you you won't be disappointed.",

The graphics surely are a matter of taste. They have a nice cartoony look but still is quite gory at the same time. The music is great. For a game that you're probably going to play for countless hours you need a fitting music that doesn't make you want to cut your ears off. And the melodies in this game surely manage to avoid that unpleasant incident. They are almost kind of subtle and somehow manage to be catchy at the same time. The controls, again, are really simple but fit the game since you really only can run, shoot and use some items. So in my opinion a simple 'yes' doesn't quite fit this game.

And the dev even goes so far as to tell you to deal with it and use some third party program to map your keyboard.  Can get frustrating at times because your success in the game relies mostly on two things: Complete and utter RNG and playing the game a lot. The more you play, the more things you unlock.  I could nitpick for a while, but there's no point. I love the game.  Breakdown: Graphics: 7/10 (A point granted for how much work they put in to giving all the items you pick up visual effects) Sound: 8/10 (The music is pretty solid, but aside from grunting and moaning there isn't much variety.) Gameplay: 9/10 (Not perfect, but it comes pretty close for this genre.) Total: 8/10. A complete steal at 5 bucks, and the DLC is completely worth it. Doubles the size of the game. Literally.

This game has literally been heaven and hell for me. :3 (bit of spoilage in this review)   Every run you start, you never know how it's gonna go down. Are you gonna make it past the first room? Find a great item drop? Die by spiders (ALL THE TIME)? Make it to    Sheol    or the    Cathedral?    It's all in how you play the game, and the more you play the more you learn and the less you suck, as it is with all games. I must admit that this game can be built off of sheer luck at times, and other times it puts you down before you get past the first floor. It's a roll of the dice, you can end up with a    Dead Cat    or    Tech. II   , but that's what makes it so fun and increases the replay factor, because you want to have the mother of all runs. And who doesn't? The thrill of reaching the    Cathedral    and fighting    Isaac   , then dying and realizing its all over can be a let down, but it only makes you want to go back and do it again, but win.   Overall (from my jumbled and discombobulated piece of poop review), I simply love this game. It's got the golden touch that only comes along once in a million other games, and its almost impossible to quit. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys indie games, who doesn't already have it. It's a must play, and don't let some of the negative reviews pull you away from a masterpiece.",

You are often come across a dilemma of which item to bring with you to the lower deeps of the game as you face powerful bosses and miniboss. Should you give up two life hearts for an attack upgrade or spend all your coin in the slot machine in hopes for a good item.   This is a good game and it is very addicting since the map changes every time you play. In life as in games, it is all about risk and rewards and a bit of luck. This is well worth your money.  ",

In comparison, this game is horse ♥♥♥♥.  By far the best value for money on Steam, The Binding of Isaac guides you through layers of depth and despair. The main story is that the child, Isaac, must flee through the randomly generated levels of his own basement to escape his homicidal mother. The rooms are filled with terrifying monsters and Isaac must fend them off by shedding his own tears. At the end of each floor, there is a boss room and there are many different kinds of optional rooms that will provide Isaac with powerful bonuses or fearful punishments.  The game is fiendishly difficult, with a health meter shown as a few precious hearts. Once you die, you have died for good and you’ll have to start afresh. The game has about 200 items that change the stats of the player as well as provide extra methods of survival and by the later floors Isaac should have a few helpful assets to help him achieve victory. At this point, the game will get LONGER and HARDER, so it really is a game that will keep bringing you back for another Isaac run. The DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, is an absolute must have for this game, as it adds 75% more content to the game in levels, secret room types, items, enemies and bosses. If you’re looking for a cheap game to last you a long time, this is it.",

You are on the hunt for your mother who tried to sacrifice you to whatever voice she heard in her twisted mind. Pure gaming bliss. Even more reason to play this game is the sheer amounts of items that will alter your journey. Ever wanted to vomit bombs? How about vomiting bombs that make a rotation around you and ultimately deal more damage to you than anyone else? How about launching missiles from the sky to rain down upon your enemies? How about shooting lasers from your mouth? If any of this sounds fun at all, (other than the whole bombs redirected at you thing) you should pick up this game. It's pretty cheap to boot!  Unfortunately, there are negatives. Like I said before, some item combos can screw you over. Also, since this game runs on flash, it will lag. A lot. There are more glitches than you can count, all of them unpatchable due to flash's limitations. But does this mean it's a bad game? No. Not at all. This is one of my top ten favorite games of all time, and I can't even describe the replayability of this game. The variety that this game will bring to the table is astonishing. If you're looking for a way to waste lots of your time, this is it. By the way, don't pick up the DLC until you know what you're doing. It will make this already difficult game into something truly nightmarish. But hey, I won't stop you.",

Each 'run' through binding of isaac is very quick, if you're new. This quad-directional shooter is going to ♥♥♥♥ you. I mean you have NO chance at the start, but then you start getting better and better, learning when to take an item, and when not to, how to deal with certain mobs/bosses etc. The levels in binding of isaac consist of usually 8-10 small rooms, each of which are randomized with different mobs, types and loot. For example, you have the arcade, stuffed with gambles for your hard earned pennies, you have the 'Deal with the Devil' room where you can trade off health for high risk/reward items. The art style is very much appreciated, some runs I end up with cross-dresser Isaac, some I end up with Demon Isaac, all of them look awesome. And by that I mean, each item can give you an appearance change, like demon horns, replacing an eye with a laser beam and all that good stuff. The storyline is insignificant, but cheesy and hilarious, namely a 1 minute video at the start explaining the situation that the game starts you off in, on every run, though if you are thinking of buying this for the story-line alone, don't. This is an all-gameplay fun run-to-your-death game which has massive replay value(One guy even has a playthrough series of 500+ episodes). It is also a flash game. I don't mean that in a bad way, I was shocked when I heard this was made with flash.  Protip edit- Download Binding of Isaac Spidermod. For arachnophobes; there is no spiders added in the mod, but there are already plenty in the game itself. Spidermod simply adds 1080p, fixes help strings and other good things. Fully recommend it.

It has dungeons in a basement, and you shoot monsters, y'know, standard rouge-like/dungeoneer/etc. what makes this one one of my personel favourites is 2 things. the story (a uber christian mother trying to kill you as a sacrafice, then you go to hell, and yadda yadda) and the difficulty. Many people say this game is very hard. In truth, I think its a good mix of powerful items, difficult enemies, scaling, and boss battles. 8.7/10, would reccommend getting wrath of lamb DLC as well",

The dungeons are randomly generated each time as well as the items and enemies you face each time, so expect a different and refreshingly new playthrough everytime you start a new game :) One big feature about this game is that once or if you die, you must restart all over again from the beginning. Why this may seem malproductive to gameplay, it is rather quite ingenious and works well for this style of games. it allows you to start fresh as every gameplay, all the strategies you use, and tactics you incorporate are constantly changing as you adapt to new scenarios the game dishes out at you. I highly suggest buying this game--it is cheap and you can find it for one key on tf2op most days. I hear the dlc content adds so much more to the game as well and based on my first impressions (a.k.a. 20 hours spent playing the game over 3 days time), I am anticipating myself purchasing the dlc in the near future.

It starts out with a very dour story regarding a fanatical mother who hears the voice of god commanding her to sacrifice her son Isaac, who then flees into the basement to escape her wrath (only to encounter a variety of demonic creatures).   After the opening cinema, the player starts the game and is introduced to all of the necessary keyboard commands via a series of cave paintings in the first dungeon room. From there, trial and error will teach you the rest that you need to know. The rouge-like style game consists of a random series of procedurally created dungeon rooms, monsters, secrets, item drops, and treasure chests. The monsters and bosses are hideously gruesome things that display Edmund McMillen's fantastic diabolic art style. There are countless homages to past classics such as The Legend of Zelda, however TBOI's treatment feels very original and fresh this day in age.   If you are a fan of A) Team Meat, B) Zelda, C) gruesome artwork, D) fiendishly difficult game play, or E) all of the above, you owe it to yourself to give The Binding of Isaac a try. Very addictive game with a high replay rate.",

The intro cutscene plays every time you start the game, but can be skipped by pressing 'spacebar' which I think is important enough to mention as it took me a few plays to figure it out.

This isnt exactly one of those games where you can call the scenery 'beautiful'.   Upon first gameplay, you will either love the game or hate the game; however, for most people... For a flash based game being only $4.99, this is a game where you will feel your money was well spent. You play as Isaac, one of the six unlockable characters, braving your way through randomly generated levels using very simple contrls. Each floor of the basement dungeon has monsters you must clear through before you can advance to the next room. Along the way, you collect money to purchase items from a shopkeeper and find weapons and power-ups to boost your stats and chances against enemies. Each floor of a dungeon includes a boss you must fight to move on to the next level dungeon. Though the controls are very easy to play with, this does not change the fact that you will certainly be provided with challenges; expect to die... a lot.   I was lucky to catch this game on sale for 0.99, and I was very satisfied with what I got, including the DLC and soundtrack. If you have any friends seeking an exotic experience, definitely introduce this game to them.  + Randomly generated levels = endless replay value + Wide variety of items to seek and collect, adding to replay value + Morbid illustration keeps you strangely interested + Simple controls  - Since levels are randomly generated, difficulty can occasionally spike.

The soundtrack get's a little repetitive after a while, although it is a short and good soundtrack.

Even though the game is depressing in many ways and there is an awful lot of blood and tears, there is a twisted and hilarious sense of humor in the game, and I found myself laughing at different bosses and loot I got.

In all honesty, the story is not very important to the game, and is not a focal point.  Gameplay (8/10):  BoI plays like a standard 4-directional shooter, introducing a gameplay style that is easy to learn, but difficult to master, so to speak. The game introduces numerous enemies, and staggering amounts of upgrades and items that the player must use to utilize throughout the game. Combined with an unforgivingly hard difficulty, the average player should be prepared to die. A lot. Unfortunately, the game sometimes is hindered by its forcing of the player to only shoot in the cardinal directions, since enemies come from all sides.  The game's ability to randomize the levels/powerups through each playthrough gives you motivation to continue to play, and feels satisfying throughout.  Visuals (8/10):  The game has a cartoony, Flash presentation, similar to Super Meat Boy, that is pleasing to the eye. McMullen paints a dark picture of Isaac's basement, introducing horrible creatures and disturbing imagery that is not always as cutesy as the main character. The game is obviously not trying to be a graphical powerhouse, and it works.  Sound (7/10): Solid, suspenseful music, combined with apt sound effects, give me no complaints about this aspect of the game.  Replayability (10/10):  BoI's entire purpose is to be replayed, over and over again. Games are very short, either because the player dies from the game's brutality, or finishes the playthrough (only takes an hour or so). Usually, a playthrough will unlock new items, reveal new strategies for the player to use, or provide some other incentive for the player to try again. The game tries to be addicting, and succeeds immensely. It's hard to put this game down once you pick it up.  OVERALL: BoI is successful in what it tries to do; make a rogue-like arcade shooter with RPG elements that allows for many quick plays, that incentivize the player to keep going. It's a real treat to play.  8.5/10",

The gameplay is simple, as are the graphics and storyline. This is the type of game I picture one would find in a modern arcade or on a flash gaming website like  Kongregate.com . I'm not necessarily recommending this horror flash game, but I can't say it isn't half-entertaining. If you have some money to blow and need a cheap game to play, The Binding of Isaac is one to consider. Otherwise, go buy a real game and stop being an idiot.",

While no two playthroughs are the same, the core gameplay retains its same formula: Isaac (or any of the alternate characters you unlock) will comb the depths of a basement and its many torturous chambers in search of items. No save points. No checkpoints. No hope. The atmosphere of the game is both cute and grotesque, and this duality reminds me of Invader Zim.  Overall, the execution of the game is superb. The simplicity of the initial mechanics are inviting and the complexity that the variable stats and certain items provide give a perfect level of depth to the arcade style of play. Unfortunately, this game can be frustatingly hard and after multiple playthroughs of poor luck in item spawns, playing can seem like a chore. Fans of Dark Souls or Demon Souls who are looking for the same level of masochism in a 2D setting need look no further.   Awesome visuals that fit the art style. Responsive controls. Hundreds (literally hundreds) of items. Difficulty and complexity increase during each playthrough. Killing the final boss might be the most satisfying thing I'll do this year.  8.7/10",

The controls are clunky and slow to respond, the game is rife with infuriating artificial difficulty, and no matter how many times you play, you will always have to rely on luck to win. Plain and simple. Power-ups are the life blood of surviving, and those just so happen to be randomly generated and you may not get anything useful at all. As the game progresses, more and more enemies are thrown at you, so it becomes a 'shmup shooter'; a poorly crafted one.

UPDATE : After the overwhelming posite reviews I thought I'd put a bit of effort in, thinking maybe I missed something. No, didn't miss much. I can positively absolutely confirm that this game IS A LOW QUALITY CRAP GAME!   Update 2: After trying to play this crap again for over an hour.  Here is a grown up point of view. The graphics are horrible. A 12 year old could draw better grahics. A circle, box and 4 lines is the main character.   O [ ]--   | \\ Most of the enemies are stick figures or bouncing circles of different colors.  Gameplay is near pointless and resembles that of the 80's arcade. Same thing endlessly! Randomly generated rooms with random doorways. You can't aim properly, and minor obstacles stop you in your tracks and often prevent you from obtaining the keys etc. This leads to many times being unable to continue as until you kill all the circles, squares of squiggly lines and get the key you can't move on in some rooms. The music is just annoying and after a very short time will be turned off. The sound effects are definately low tech and appear to be an after thought Many time you end up with nowhere to go so you have to start again like I've stated and the boss levels are ridiculously hard and make no sense. Shoot them 50 times they shooot you twice. Your dead! The younger players seem to like it as the endless reviews like 'Awsome game', 'Really Fun', 'Best game ever' 'Funnest game' etc showing that it does have a place for children or those children at heart. Hmmmm! If you are over 12, and want a little bit of intellectual game play then AVOID THIS! IF YOU ARE 12 or less age wise or have the mentality of herpies and are looking for a button masher, random generated 80's style, poorly executed, dungeon game that requires just simply randomly walking around shooting circles or triangle or stick figures then BUY THIS GAME or get your mummy and daddy to buy it for you! Its cheap for a reason! If you do like the 80 style monotonous type games then there is far better games than this, and far better value.",

I'm not slamming all indie work, there is quite a bit of good stuff out there. Next, this is a rougelike. Again, I know rougelikes are becoming popular.

With randomly-generated dungeons, numerous enemies, and an overwhelming amount of items (which can both help and harm you), it's difficult to get a firm grasp on the gameplay. This game will take a lot of practice and memorization before you can successfully play through. I do not reccommend this game to casual players.   With that out of the way, Binding of Isaac is a fantastic game to both adventure fans and top-down shooter fans alike. Personally, it feels like a healthy mix between The Legend of Zelda on NES (with all the secrets and permanent items) and Smash TV on the NES/SNES (with the shooting mechanic and enemies with semi-difficult attacks to avoid). The game also feels very different every time you play. As I mentioned before, the dungeons are randomly-generated, so you will never know what you will find/face first. Maybe you'll immediately find the ability to fly. Maybe you'll be bombarded by monsters, but for a decent reward. Maybe you'll find an item that will lead to your terrible demise (like I said, memorize everything). Depending on your taste and sense of humor, the plot and atmosphere can be strange, offensive, or absolutely hilarious. The game has a ridiculous amount of blood, religious references, etc. If none of this offends you, you will find yourself enjoying the satire this game has to offer.  I'm not sure what else I can point out at the moment. The game is fairly simple, so there isn't a whole lot to address. Just run, shoot, buy, bomb.  As for the price, I think $5 is well worth the money for this game. However, the game does go on sale rather often (I purchased it for about $2.75), but if you can't find a sale right away, buy it at full price. I guarentee you will not regret paying that $2.25 more.",

The game can become VERY frustrating if you don't luck out with decent items in a run. The game can swing from a breeze in one run to a complete hell in another run - all due to RNG. You will get decent items, decent enemies and have a blast going through but at times it will be the complete opposite.  Will require skill, getting used to, baring through with RNG but can be VERY rewarding, very fun and an interesting ride. The story is grim, dark, at times WTF'ish but all around Binding of Isaac (with it's expansion Wrath of the Lamb) is worth getting into ESPECIALLY if you're a loot-loving gamer.  4 tears / 5 tears - waiting for Rebirth for the more retro feel and NO FPS swings due to Flash.",

As you progress through the game you get upgrades that help you gain defense, offense, movement, or size.  There are many creative monsters and bosses in the game.

Not only will it help you become familiar with the long list of items that upgrade/degrade your character (including how they interact with one another), it will also give you a better perspective on the game's insane difficulty. All in all, while the amped up games like GTA and CoD are constanly being given high ratings, I'd without a doubt give this game a 10/10. It's far more exhilarating than those games and the replayablility makes it a never-ending quest to see what else you're capable of. Lead game designer, Edmund McMillen is a f***ing master at what he does and this one definitely reflects his incredible creative ability. Cheers!",

It needs a lot of agility on your fingers, pal. Plus, one of the achievements, if you see, is 'Everything is Terrible' that makes the game harder, and it really becomes harder, and very fun if you know how to play. Obviously, everyone have their rages on the game, I admit, that's normal.  Now, about the items, well, in this version, have some awesome items that doesn't stacks with others... and that can be annoying sometimes. But how they look, their effects, or how isaac look with them, can make you laugh a lot, or you can make the famous 'WtF?' face.  The Graphics, well, let's skip this, because they are good, but I prefer the Rebirth style, sorry folks, but not today.  The story... I will let you find by yourself, sometimes can be a little... confusing, but not that hard to understand... most of the parts...  For the End, the characters. It is really interessing how each character have their own starting gimmicks (different stats, starting items, etc) and it is really good if you want a challenge... or if you want to use another character to unlock another items...  Anyway, it is a game where fun never ends, it worth its price (including if you count some game bugs, unfortunately, but they are rare to happen) and I really apreciate it, no matter what.",

You also can collect items which affect your health, giev you special abilities for your space bar which can only have one at a time but can pick up new ones. Items also can boost your basic stats and affect your tears like turning them into a laserbeam.. The game doesnt tell you what any item does other than when it boosts a stat or hp so alot of it is trial and error. You can find pills or tarot cards which give you a 1 room use thing or a permanent stat boost like pills that increase a stat and a tarot card that teleports you to a random room. There are three items you can stack which are pennies, bombs, and keys which help you do things. Also can be played in one sitting easily, butt change each time for replayability.",

        {
            "review_text": "The Binding Of Isaac is a game I have been playing a lot recently. Picture running through the dungeons of Legend of Zelda, with one constant item and one item you can switch around and you have the basic setup of the game. You start off by selecting a character which controls your starting stats and items. Then you enter the first level of the dungeon to start your quest. Along the way you'll collect money, bombs, and keys which you can use to get into treasure rooms, shops, arcades, secret rooms and more. At the end of every level is a boss. What gives the game its great replay-value is that the levels are randomly generated, as are the items you'll encounter, and the bosses are randomly picked from a group of monsters who can show up in the given area. With over 100 items you'll end up playing through the game very differently depending on what items you can get your hands on.  The controls are very simple: shift to drop a bomb, space to use an item (if you find one that needs activation) and Q to eat a pill/use a tarot card. Killing all the monsters in a room will give you Tarot cards, bombs, keys, pills, hearts, money, and if you are really lucky a chest. The tarot cards have mostly good effects. Pills can add or take away from any of your stats, so be careful with them unless you have the lucky foot or the Ph.D. Silver chests can contain any of the above pickups including another chest. Gold chests need a key to open, but can give you an item or a heart container in addition to what a silver chest can hold.   On every floor there should be a treasure room, represented by a crown on the map. Make sure you save a key to get in because the items are free, and a lot of good items can only be found here. There is also a shop on every floor, but I'd only enter if you have plenty of keys and at least 15 cents. The good items cost 15 cents unless they are on sale. Be prepared going into the shop, because the mini-boss Greed can be waiting inside. If he shows up, you'll be locked into a fight with him, and will not be able to buy items when you are done.  One of the dangers you can run into are the seven deadly sins. Acting as mini-bosses they'll randomly show up in an unexplored room to ambush you. Luckily they aren't that difficult to defeat once you know their moves. The hardest of them is probably greed, who shoots 3 shots in a spread somewhat randomly and tends to hang out in the shop when you need to buy something the most.  You'll also find secret rooms, challenge rooms, arcades and other interesting rooms and creatures on your journey. Although the game is simple on the surface, there is a lot going on underneath. Take money for example. On the surface you can spend it at the store or gamble in a slot machine. You'll also find a beggar who you can give it to. Low on money? Drop a bomb on the slot machine (or the beggar) to get some money back (hopefully). Item Synergies are another fun thing to explore as you try and find a working strategy to get past the final bosses. There are a few items that can instantly kill some troublesome bosses. The trick is figuring out which ones work where and finding them.  Expect to die many times while you figure out how to get past the monsters, traps, and bosses. And expect to have a great time doing it. As you progress further the enemies can get pretty nasty. But hey, there is a great item that unlocks from dying 100 times, so get to it.  Once you figure out the game, completing the entire game will only take you an hour or so(Before you figure out the game, your games will be much shorter!), but it is still very enjoyable to load up again and again, finding new items every time. I think a lot of the reason I love it is because I know one game won't be a huge time commitment.  Pros:  List of items that might appear.  The game works on Steam.  Lots of built-in and steam enabled achievements. The achievements will unlock new items, bosses, and areas, so they are actually worth getting beyond bragging rights.  Multiple characters and a ton of items you can find give a lot of replay value. There are also a lot of different bosses to fight.(I'm over 60 hours myself and haven't unlocked the last bonus area yet.)  Small time commitment - Completing the entire game will only take an hour or so.  Entertaining references to many other video games such as Super Meat Boy, Legend of Zelda, and more.  Great Soundtrack! I spent the extra dollar to have the soundtrack. (You have to go to the steam game folder to find it.)  The game is very reasonably priced at $4.99 when it is not on sale.  Cons:  There are a few bugs with the DLC which cause the game to slow down a bit between levels. Nothing critical or that caused me to lose my game.  As you might be able to tell from the picture above, the game has disturbing imagery. It didn't particularly bother me, but I could see it bothering people.   The game is done in Flash and so it doesn't quite work with the steam overlay, meaning you can't upload screenshots directly into steam.  Final Thoughts:  This game is great, and well worth buying at full price. You can usually get it much cheaper during a steam sale and the winter sale is currently going. The Best deal for this game right now is at the humble bundle site. Pay whatever you want for BoI and the DLC and other games!  There is a DLC available for this game and it is also great and inexpensive, however, it does make the game harder. I'd wait until you have beaten the game a few times before adding the DLC.",

Gameplay The gameplay is very simple WASD to move and the arrow keys to shoot Issac's tears, the game is very focused on collecting items that will help you in your fight with the creatures in the basement. The Binding of Issac is a randomly generated dungeon like rogue style RPG that will have you upgrade Issac and have you make deals with the Devil and the Angel. And is really really hard... ha ha... sorry uh lost my maturity then.  Graphics The graphics are great for this type of game but because of it being a flash game The Binding of Issac is very pixilated game with nice enough looking enemies and environments.  Music However the music is phenomenal it sticks with you throughout your day and is one of the reasons why we love The Binding of Issac because the soundtrack makes you want to come back for more.   The Binding of Issac is a game that you must give time into but is extremely addicting ONE DAY I WILL COMPLETE ONE OF THESE RUNS and the music is brilliant hooks you every time plus the price is always really low on sale you may as well get it.  The Binding of Issac   8/10  Would spend £0.49 again.",

Isaac has multiple stats which items will often change in a positive manner: fire rate, shot speed, damage, speed, range and health.

This game is hard as hell. the enemies start brutal and the upgrades and items you discover are completly random which means you might not be able to get upgrades because you have no keys or even if you get an upgrade it might not be particualy useful and if you die you lose all progress. the only thing that stays is once you've discovred somthing new theres a higher chance of encountering it again in another play through.   That being said the game is fun and addictive. the enemies have learnable patterns so with enough practice you'll be able to power through them reguardless what upgrades you get. Like any good rouge like you'll want to give it another try as soon as you die. And everytime you beat the game new things unlock (including deeper levels to the dungeon)  There is a story but its kept to a minimum once again nodding to its nes inspired roots.   All and all its a fun retro styled game with good use of modern game design. Hard but fun...if kinda freaky ",

It also is displayed in a window and cannot make it full screen. I wish they would port this indie game for the PS Vita. The game is good enough for me to fumble with the keyboard controls to play. This is a long game and there is NO SAVE! It's one long playthrough! Each level and monster generation is random which keeps the gameplay fresh. Takes a little practice and luck to get powered up enough to survive. A real bargain when on sale.  UPDATE: I now use JoyToKey.exe to play the original BoI and it works very well! They have since released the Remix verision which is also a great game and is also on the PS Vita! Negative reviews say the new game is too pixelated (on purpose) and has a different soundtrack (true, but also good). Both game are a joy to play over and over. So many unlockables!

Because there is a LOT of them even to start with, and you are constantly unlocking new ones. Passive items, active items, trinkets, pills, cards. And after some them different characters to play with too!  The most of the fun (at least for me) in the begining is discovering what that those items, for example Wire Coat Hanger, that is now sticking out of your characters head, actually did. Later into the game you'll have a lot of fun with combinations of items that sometimes lead to very interesting effect.  In addition to such a interesting game desing this game has a really dark and wicked atmosphere, that makes it even more special:)  But, be vary of the fact that this is NOT an easy game, oh no! It goes from hard to brutal to #@$%! levels of difficulty, so be prepared for the pain and be prepared to worship the gods of luck if you decide to actually complete it 100%!

Each playthrough will be different: encountering new bosses, new enemies, new powers, new rooms, new items, and a new ending everytime you beat it up to 10-15 times, and on every run you do, you unlock even more content such as new items bosses and floors of the dungeon. The game is filled to the brim with content and refrences, and it's made even better with the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. For a game that is $5 or $7.50 with WotL this is a fonominal pick up and should at least be given a shot to play.",

One of the main flaws is that unlocking all the items requires beating it a bunch of times, and while it does get slightly harder if you play after winning once or twice (by upgrading the enemies/bosses and putting harder enemies earlier) the difficulty decides to wait until your fifth win to jump up by a lot; by the third time you win it'll start seeming to have lost some of its teeth and it's not obvious in advance that it will get them back if you beat it a few more times.

Don't worry, though -- the game does have a wiki that tells you what's bugged, as well as what every item in the game does (the game is not very good at telling you what things do).

I was hilariously terrible at playing this and I have honestly never been as terrified of flies as I have during my first few runs (Imagine my joy playing Wrath of The Lamb for the first time and discovering spiders. &gt;.&gt;). I'd pick up the demo, play one run, maybe two, then call it stupid and terrible and rage quit... I'd do this at least once, sometimes up to three times, a day. This went on for a couple of weeks before I was finally forced to admit that I was completely in love with this game. A Steam sale was all the excuse I needed and I bought it.  My first achievement ever was dying a hundred times and my first Mom battle lasted about 5 seconds. I hated this. I hated this so much, but every time I died I told myself 'Damn it, that was so close! Just one more.... I WILL BEAT YOU GAME!'  Beating Mom for the very first time was euphoric, but it was a short lived victory as the game rewarded me with a slap in the face and a note that said 'Well done, sucker... Now do it again... and do it better! I'm not done with you!'  The Binding of Isaac is a completionist's hell. It will make you work for every victory and then raise the bar more and more until it takes away just enough of your sanity that you continue to play it against your own better judgement. It will make you hate it and yourself for ever playing it until the very last boss. Then you'll have to pick another character and do it all over again. Along the way it will also show you secrets, make you question the meaning behind everything, tease you with glimpses of what Isaac's reality might actually be and give you hopes of putting together a story that is not actually relevant to its purpose. You will descent into absolute raging madness and love every minute of it.  I've played this for over 600 hours... 600 hours I will never get back... but I will achieve Platinum God before Rebirth comes out or so help me... Can't quit now... I'm so close... I WILL BEAT YOU GAME!",

This unanticipated successful indie game has kept me amused for literally hundreds of hours. Any description I give won't do it justice but never-the-less I will try; BoI is easy to learn and hard to master, it's a roguelike (meaning always random, levels, items, monsters and bosses ect) the top-down view reminds me alot of the SNES and GB releases of Zelda. However the dark and twisted nature of BoI is a far cry from Link's innocent adventures. No run is ever the same, the achievements are hard to get and feel great to earn. Don't let the idea of perma-death put you off - in my opinion it's the 'every heart is sacred' (although not as sacred as the sacred heart!) that keeps the intensity and challenge going strong each and every run!  100% recommend this game it's one of my all time favourites - play it now and prepare to get excited about the remake due this year.

Left controller moves Isaac and right controller shoots, pretty standard stuff. Game is still tough, but I was able to make incremental progress and get better as I played.

You spend the remainder of the game killing monsters by crying on them and powering up Isaac by doing things like sticking a coat hanger through his head to make him cry faster. Overall, I think it's a really unique and enjoyable game to play. It can get frustrating as first, though, since you need to start the entire game over when you die (which will happen a lot).

You're gonna love this game, each run is different and unlocks new items/bosses for the future ones, loads of references and great lifetime.   Though it's extremely hard and not recommended for babbies. 9/10",

As far as I know you can't finish this game in a single play through. You must play the game multiple times to unlock different thngs that are necessary to acheive different endings.   Thet being said late game areas can be really annoying. While early on you can avoid getting hit through skillful dodging, late game rooms and bosses can just spam out projectiles that can make dodgine almost impossible. It gets to the point where you know if you will get through the end game based on how much max health you have accumulated before that point. (That's my view but I also such at dodging shots).   All in all The Binding of Isaac is a solid game for the money. I recommend it for anyone that likes arcade style games with random dungeons.",

In addition, I like this version's art-style better than Rebirth's; Rebirth's pixellation reeks of a half-♥♥♥♥♥ translation, which isn't helped by the super-fancy lighting effects of that title.

That water-cooled 5GHz Core i7 triple-SLI gaming rig that you can run all the latest games on at 4K resolution and max settings? Hah!!! Watch as this developer brings it to it's knees with the kind of simple 2D graphics that used to run faster on a 486 back in the day. That's progress for you.  - Possibly the worse collision detection I've ever seen in this type of game. Instant death games are so much more fun when you die because your bullets went straight through an enemy, or you got hit by something that clearly didn't.  - Being told to use Joy2Key if you want controller support. Because input devices are hard, right? (PS. On Mac OSX I recommend Joystick Mapper from the app store, but it's not free. I much prefer playing with a Xbox 360 controller).  - Steam achievements don't work on OSX.  And yet... despite all that the brilliant game design still manages to shine through the shoddy implementation. It's well balanced and incredibly addictive once you get past the initial steep learning curve (and it really is steep - to succeed consistently you'll need to know how to maximise the use of limited resouces like bombs, keys, hearts, and other pickups for the best return, not to mention learning what the 100-odd different power-ups do. Or you could just read the Wiki...).  So, highly recommended if you like this type of game and have the patience to get past the above issues.  To the developer I recommend a book on the C++ programming language. Or in fact any programming language that isn't fkn Flash.",

The Binding of Issac does proceedurally generated dungeons right: The room you enter may not always be a challenge, but depending on what items you have at the time, and what transpires after you take a mystery pill, or make a deal with the devil, can compleately change the the flow of gameplay and sometimes, ruin your chance at victory (I speak from experience). The Binding of Issac is one of a handful of games of our generation that is inherantly fun; Playing it is just, fun. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, if you find the one item you so desprately need or not, at some point, none of that matters anyore, and I find myself saying 'I didn't win, but I had fun getting to where I died'. And when you look back at the death skreen filled with every item you've collected, you see the choices you made, or how close you came and it inspires you for next time, because every game starts with a blank room, reminding you of your controls, and every run hold potential for greatness.  Tight, responsive controls that are easy to learn and binded well. Graphics are crisp, but can easily be sacrificed for less lag via a menu. I play this smoothly on a low graphics setting on my laptop, so it's a game you can always have with you if you so choose. I have only sunken 80 some hours into this game but I wish it was more. Do yourself a favor: If your a fan of permadeath, and proceeduraly generated games and pick this up as soon as you can.",

It's strange though, because part of me was actually a little bit glad every time I died. Because it meant that I'd have to start over and enjoy this game for even longer.  The replay value is great because of the random generator (items/enemies/map layouts), granting a different experience each time. I still come across new items every time I play, and I've played 18 times by this point. I recommend playing in windowed mode with an internet browser open to the The Binding If Isaac 'items' wiki page. You'll thank me XD  The atmosphere is dark and lively, and really sucks you into its world. I enjoyed strategizing and deciding which weapons and items to use, trying to find the most effective combo for my playstyle. This game has a lot more depth than you'd think. It's honestly the most fun I've had with a single player game in a while.",

It's perfect, considering this is an indie game, so it's really well made. Buy it whenever it gos on sale, but if you really want it, 6 dollars is still a steal. It's a great game for people with enough time for this game, but not enough for hardcore games like Dota. You can easily waste an hour on this game.  The controls are great for anybody with mechanical keyboards, but rubber domes might be harder because you need to bottom out a key for it to register, taking more time/energy. Still easy to control though, just recommended to use a mechanical keyboard if you play many other games/ type a lot, as well. Play it with the music at its max, you will never regret it.  The DLC is actually well developed and introduces lots of changes, making existing bosses and enemies harder. I would recommend at least reaching Mom thrice before buying Wrath of the Lamb, as you get the vanilla, original hardcore experience before moving onto harder stuff.   Overall, this game is great, one of the best indie games I've had the pleasure of playing. This is great as sadly, most of the time, I just go back to playing dota. Binding of Isaac is one of the few games I have in my library that I visit quite regularly. Buy this game if you have more self control than I do and don't have problems with other games.  If you still aren't convinced, think of it this way: you get to shoot sp00ky monsters with your own tears. While naked. And you take pills that don't run your life.

            "review_text": "To start I'd like to say that this (with or without DLC) is very much worth your money. It's $4.99 regularly for the bare-bones game. On its own it's good, but with Wrath of the Lamb expansion (still under $10 total) the game is infinitely better. Think of how Brave New World completed Sid Meier's Civilization V, except for an indie video game about crying children who are tortured and made to suffer due to a religious radical who is quite possibly schizophrenic. Regardless, you're in for a good time.  This is probably my favorite piece by McMillen even after the release of Rebirth (not that it isn't a great game as well.) Mind you I haven't seen Super Meat Boy, but I've seen the trailer and it doesn't have the same appeal as this. I have Wrath of the Lamb and it really completes the game with the new collectibles and items as well as the new character. The premise is simple enough and the story is open to speculation. Little is confirmed by the creator.   From my favorite example of It Lives being Isaac as a fetus, it doesn't disprove any major theories and is a decent contribution to many of them.   One of my favorite things about McMillen is that he does allow his fans and users to follow their own thoughts while going through his work.  And now for the actual reviewing part. Gameplay is decent. It's confirmed to be based on Legend of Zelda games in how the 'dungeon' operates. It's randomly generated and each playthrough has different maps that need to be discovered along the way. Occasionally generation or a map will be different, but for the most part it's the same. Each floor has a guarantee of specific rooms spawns with a boss to reach the next floor.  Controls were always strange to me. This game requires no mouse. It's all in the keyboard, which I appreciate as a trackpad user. Cardinal movement is controlled by WASD while the direction of shots is based on the arrow keys by default. Items are used by the convenient spacebar and bombs are dropped with E, which I find better with my preferred configuration. McMillen did include an option for 'lefty flip' which reverses the WASD and arrow keys. This is my preferred configuration even though I am right-handed. The E bomb drop is also more convenient as all attacking items (save for certain spacebar items) can be controlled with the left hand.  Music is unique for each type of level. Sound effects are generic but each type of monster is recognizeable enough that you don't struggle to find out what you're facing in the room. It's nothing spectacular but nothing is bad either.  Some people say the game is difficult. I would agree that it is, but after awhile the game is fairly easily mastered. So long as you pay attention to how each monster attacks and react accordingly you should be fine. The no damage achievements are still difficult, though. The game also has an involuntary difficulty boost after beating one of the many 'final' bosses a certain number of times as well. Considering the amount of experience it takes to unlock that event I'd say it doesn't detract from the game.  As you progress further, the game adds new levels and bosses previously accessible as well as bits and pieces of story here and there. Considering many items are unlocked by achievements obtained over multiple playthroughs this game has a huge amount of replayability. Prior to buying it myself I frequently played on a friend's version and I loved it enough to buy it myself when I finally got my own laptop. Unfortunately I haven't played as much, but it's a great game to fall back on when nothing else is appealing at the moment.  Overall this game is fantastic. There are many pros (controls, story, creativity in bosses and items) to few cons (no voluntary upgrades, some luck-based aspects beyond gambling such as the contents of treasure rooms.) The cons are ultimately outweighed by replayability and how well the game ages in a library. I'll give this a 9/10 would recommend.",

If you like randomized gameplay, you'll like this. If you like long games meant to be played once, you may be looking at the wrong game here.  Isaac, to my surprise, was based on beating the game as fast as you can and as many times as you can. As you play, you unlock new items and characters to spice up the next playthrough. If you die, you lose it all and start over.  Still haven't beat it, but I've been playing this game to hell lately and would therefore say it's worth the five dollars. (Seriously, you can buy anything on the McDonald's menu for that price, you're not losing much if you don't like it.) I have't personally played the remake, but from what I've heard, this game is far inferior to it. Either way, five bucks is a good deal, go for it anyways.",

It's actually possible to arrive on a floor with a locked item room and NO key will spawn anywhere in the level. Roguelike is one thing, but this is just artificially difficult with unwinnable scenarios hardbaked into the game. Until they fix how utterly unfair the RNG is, I can't in good conscience reccomend this to anyone.

            "review_text": "When Isaac’s mom hears a voice from heaven instructing her to kill her son, he flees into the basement to face the horrors within. This is The Binding of Isaac. Note that this is the OG Isaac. The remake, Binding of Isaac Rebirth, is also available on Steam and has numerous improvements to the original Flash-based game. But I don’t own that, so I’m reviewing the original.  Lead Isaac (or one of his unlockable doppelgangers) on a dungeon-crawling adventure. The levels are laid out in the style of The Legend of Zelda, each screen being a room connected by doors. Kill all the enemies in each room to progress to the next. Sometimes you’ll find items that Isaac can attach to his body to make himself stronger, allowing you to take on the tougher challenges deeper in the basement depths. Unlike Zelda, this game is not based primarily on melee combat. This is a ranged twin-stick shooter style game. Your primary weapon is your tears, which are fired at enemies to damage them.  Everything in this game is random, from the layout, to the enemies on each floor, to the difficulty of each floor, to the items you can find. I did about 60 runs and I only saw about half of the available items. Isaac can gain laser eyes or exploding tears, homing bombs or defensive flies. Each of these will not only change how Isaac looks, but will force you to adapt. Either you learn to use what you’ve been given or you will die. The way Isaac becomes more and more monstrous the further you descend is definitely a metaphor for something.  This makes the game extremely unforgiving. Getting through the first two basement levels is easy enough, but without a good set of items that synergize well, you’ll be hard-pressed to get much further. And that’s not to mention the scarcity of hearts sometimes. You’ll often go an entire level at half health, just praying that you don’t get hit by a stray projectile.  The UI is obviously based on NES Zelda, and it works very well. I wish that items gave a little bit more description of their effects, even if it was just on the collection page once I had already seen them once. Graphically, the repulsive creatures of blood, urine, poop, and other bodily fluids are drawn as almost-cute cartoons. That weird disconnect serves the game well, keeping it serious but playful at the same time. This is some dark and twisted stuff, but you can strap a unicorn horn to your head and pop enemies like balloons.  I really liked the music in this, the original version. The updated soundtrack in Rebirth is also good in its own right, but give me the choice between them and I’ll take the old one. The gothic rock soundtrack pumped me up and helped my fingers to move that little bit faster in order to prove myself and get just a little bit further. This game almost never ends. Once you’ve beaten it, it turns out there’s additional chapters after that. And then you can go through it with every unlockable character, who each have their own quirks. And there are 10 challenge modes to tackle. And secret items and rooms to discover only after doing all these other things! In about 12 hours, I was able to beat the first “end” boss only once.  It took me 61 runs to finally finish, and I got really used to seeing that death screen. But the game never felt unfair, even with its total randomization and the way it seemed to stack the deck against me sometimes. It still felt possible to win on each run, and that is what’s key to a game like this. The gameplay is tight, and if you have enough skill you can overcome anything the RNG throws your way.  I would avoid installing the Wrath of the Lamb DLC right away, as that adds a whole load of complexity and difficulty on top of the main game. None of it is readily explained, but most of the new enemies and dungeon layouts are much more difficult and will make quick work of a new player. If you enjoy the original game a lot, then go ahead and expand your experience with those new challenges. Seriously, don’t start out with it.  This is one of the most successful indie games of the past few years, and it has a strong following. If you’re looking for a game to play long-term, where your twitchy reactions are just as important as your perseverance, one that never runs out of new goals for you to achieve, this might be the one for you.",

Heres a quick explanation; Your a kid named Isaac who lives a peacefull life together with your mom, but one day your mom thinks she heard a voice from above. It was God and he told her to sacrafice you in his honnor, so as an atempt to escape you jump into the basement trough a trapdoor under your rug. Your goal is to go through the basement to find your mom and kill her before she kills you. Ist a basic shoot-em up with basic controls, but the game is far from easy. Through evry stage of the basement there is a randomly shoosen mini-boss to deafiete, your only attack from the start is your tears which you blast at your enemies and you need to pick up power-ups so that you dont die of underpowerness. Its a really hard game, and if you have some money to spend i should recomend to you, and you who wants a great challenge and a great blast.",
