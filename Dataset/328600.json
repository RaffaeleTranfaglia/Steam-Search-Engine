However it remains as one of the best tactic game, especially while playing online, where you can discover tons of unique strategies and become the great tactician.

Frozen Synapse is a game of tactical skirmishes that gives you total control over a small group of soldiers and sets you loose in a building full of randomly designed, futuristic office spaces. The music is great, the multiplayer is tense and it's one of the best tactical games to come out in forever.  The port has some issues but I still love the combined soundtracks, the new graphics and the kill cams. I'm also happy to see there are some new modes included.  It sucks that they cut the level editor out but I never used it anyway so that's no skin off my back but it might be off yours.  If you have the original especially, pick this one up. Well worth the price at 50% off. If you're looking to get into Frozen Synapse then I'd probably get this one as well because I imagine it will have more multiplayer opponents shortly but you might want to wait and see.",

Though there are still a few bugs and such but it's a brilliant game  Pros:  More tactics (pun intended) Kill-cams Blood More themes More soundtrack Improved graphics  Cons: Still bugs left unquashed Controls are a little bit confusing Option to play with friends isn't there (yet, hopefully) Missing FS Red dlc content (which would be awesome)  Overall, I think this game is good for anyone who wishes to rattle their minds over this game  ",

            "review_text": "This game ROCKS!  I'm glad to see this new version, I loved the original but hardly anyone played online anymore since it's been out for so long. They have made some nice changes here, but the core mechanics remains. New mission types, ability to highly customize your random battlefields, larger battlefields, pre-set arenas, so much more.  FS can be really race inducing sometimes, and you can get wrapped up in editing your plans until you grow old if you let yourself. But the cat and mouse and mind games are hard to beat.  I don't really get the complaints about it being a Vita port. If it wasn't known that a previous version existed you would never know.. it doesn't affect the game at all. Controls not being remappable is an odd miss, but again it doesn't affect the game. There are only a few keyboard shortcuts anyway, and the game is fully playable with the mouse if for some reason you can't deal with the default binds.",

            "review_text": "Short version: Get the game and give it a little patience. Come join the ones who are playing and stick with it for a bit, it's worth it.   Long version: The game is great - it's in the top five for me - but it has a struggling multiplayer base, which can be fixed if you join in :)  One of the great features of this game is that it's turn-based and the players in a match don't need to be online at the same time, as a lot of time can pass in between turns and the match is still active.  Meaning that you could have, say, ten active matches at a certain point, that's twenty cycles (two hours' worth game-time) which you can prime without any the other players being online. If one day you don't have the time, no problem, the match will be waiting when you find the time.  All this game needs at this point is for players to come in and have some PATIENCE.  I started playing 8 months ago and I have managed to play many good matches, but it is a shame that many players come in and don't get that it's turn-based, and they leave thinking the game is completely dead.  You can read what other people think are good or bad aspects of the game, but ultimately it's up to you to try it out for yourself.",

Right now (patch 2) I would recommend to wait for a few weeks/ patches.",

We do our moves and sent it out and wait for our friend to response and email it back to us (like probably early 2000s).  You have a variety of game mode (hostage, kill all, capture the flag) with a variety of units (grenadier, normal, sniper, shotgun, rocket). I like the game as you get to simulate the various scenarios before deciding on your move. You can even put where you think the enemies are positioning and see if they will get the upper hand if you were to move your units as such.   I bought the game at 75% discount (or more with buy one free one). At this price, it is definitely worth it. I won't pay RM47 for it. ",

'If you enjoy turm based stragegies you will enjoy this game'  'f you like tactical turn-based games, strategy, and futuristic, sci-fi themes, then you will enjoy this game.'  The first thing I learned is that this game is NOT a Turn Based strategy game. Turn Based means, 'You Go' then 'I go' method of back and forth. While that looks different in a lot of TBS.   Yeah you get your turn, but you plan out your turn, and then you start the turn, and both sides play out Simultaneously.   Secondly, very early in the game, maybe the first mission, or the second mission. I've got my guys in good positions to ambush the enemy as they come down. Then suddenly.... the room where my guys were in simply explodes, killing everyone including the VIP I was supposed to be protecting. While it might of been a plot event, their was to my knowledge no advance warning, to suggest a room was going to explode, and if their was, their was no way of knowing which room would explode.  How am I suppose to plan out moves.... when rooms can explode, without simply playing the same mission over and over and over, and memorize all the stupid events that happen.... this room will explode on turn ... x... etc.  Maybe I missed something, and perhaps I should of read more of the game description than other peoples reviews. But I simply could not get into this game, and simply want to give fair warning to others.",

You tell them where to move, where to look, how quickly to do so. Great graphics along with intricate gameplay make a really enjoyable experience. Adding to its atmosphere is a cool, subtle feature that increases or decreases your volume output accordingly as you zoom in or out with the view.",
