            "review_text": "Racer 8 is neither a step forward or a step back when compared to its legendary original. It is in some ways better than the first and in some ways worse. It is really up to the player to determine if it is as up to par or even better than the first. I'll sum it up quickly in a PROS and CONS list. PROS   - Amazing soundtrack as usual. Not as iconic as the first but definitely more versatile.  - Slick retro graphics that are slightly improved and more vivid than the first. Soldier's missions also throw in a more hazy variety. And the last level...prepare yourself. - Cleverly written and delivered story that isn't shoved down your throat. In some ways it is open to interpretation, but it is more focused and clear than the original's narrative. - Interesting and engaging characters...whether you hate them or not (screw Manny Pardo though. You'll know why once you play the game).  - Core gameplay itself is as slick as ever. Nothing new as the system was good to begin with. - Upcoming level editor for near endless replayability and experimentation.  - GOTTA GET A GRIP!  CONS - Some levels have very annoying level design with an abundance of windows. Level design is NOT the same as the original. It is one of the key break-offs and differences actually. Maps are significantly bigger and that is bittersweet. You will die a lot more times by a road off-screen that you couldn't see. This may also be because of slightly smarter AI and I believe field of vision.  Overallscore: 14/88   Score: 8/8",

            "review_text": "Fundamentally flawed.  Being a mobile port, its a very simple concept and it is as expected interface and graphics wise. The idea behimd this game is that you click on tiles to turn the track so your rally doesn't hit a dead end and crash, instead keep the car going along until a finish line tile eventually appears. The problem however is that while you have the typical straights, curves and four way junctions, there are tiles that split in mutliple directions, for example one where you approach and can go left, right or straight and one where you go left or right. You have no control over which way the driver will go at these tiles. None. He will randomly go left or right or straight on a whim without any indication from the game as to why that direction was chosen. He'll frequently follow to the left and instantly crash rather than follow and complete path you made to the right. Without the co-driver bonus, you don't even know which way he will go until he actually does it.   The only control, the only gameplay element there is in this tiny, single concept game doesn't even work, leaving the game with nothing of value. How did the developer not notice this? Its the only thing in the game for christs sake and its bust. And if they did notice that a left/right/middle button is needed then they didn't even bother to do something. The developers should be ashamed of this game. More unnecasary crap on steam. More unnecasary crap on mobile.  0/10",

            "review_text": "I want to slam this game for outright false advertising. I’m mean “Racer 8”? The thumbnail image is a collection of Micro Machine like cars plastered on a huge logo that looks like it’s right off a shelf at Toys R’ Us. Everything about it gives the vibe of a Micro Machine knock off. So what is Racer 8? It’s a tile rotating puzzle game. Was it my fault for judging this book by it’s cover and booting it up for the first time without looking at even a single screenshot? Absolutely. But I don’t care, this game was an outright disappointment. Not because it wasn't what I expected, I can learn to enjoy a lot of games regardless of my personal expectations, but even as a puzzle game Racer 8 is dreadful. Being a driving/racing themed game it needs speed; contrasting this is the fact that a puzzle game of this nature need to be slowly paced in order to give the player a fair chance at being able to think through and solve the board. When you bring these two things together it just causes a train wreck. I would love to see a game bring such opposite concepts together in a very natural and appealing way. Racer 8 is not that game.",
