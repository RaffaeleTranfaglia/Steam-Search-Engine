    "description": "At first sight, Cubot is a puzzle-game with a minimalist gameplay, just move color cubes towards tiles of the same color. It's really easy, but it will be a torture for your mind to complete all levels of the game because the apparent simplicity of the game is in contradiction with the complexity of the level-design.",

            "review_text": "At its core, this is a really good puzzle game with some great ideas. You eventually have to track many things at once that behave in different ways, while figuring out how to make them work together.   Its not perfect. New concepts and block behaviors are shown with an animation before the levels in which they first appear, but these animations/descriptions are not particularly clear. It doesn't matter, though, because the first few groups of levels are exceptionally easy - in general, the game progresses a little too slow at the beginning. Its not 'that' hard to figure out the basics! And new mechanics are easier and easier to fit in, since you already have a handle on the previous ones.   It has a very pretty aesthetic, but the usability and controls don't live up to it. There doesn't seem to be an ideal setup - controller makes most sense for the core gameplay, but the menus are so slow with a controller that I stick with mouse/keyboard - however, mouse controls are awkward. Keyboard is fine, but I gotta be careful not to left click!   The biggest issue by far is lack of any kind of 'undo'. When you've got a level that takes 20+ moves at minimum, and you're going for that minimum score, you don't want to make a mistake 20 moves in! I'm stuck on one level for this exact reason, and its SO FRUSTRATING having to play the first 17/18 odd moves EVERY FREAKING TIME! Even a quicker way to reset the level would be welcome.   All that said, its worth playing and the price is more than fair.",

Here is my opinion of this game:  Cubot is all about moving each colored cube into a spot on the board with the corresponding color.  Very quickly, the game becomes more complex.   + Minimalistic + Music is absolutely amazing + Price is good  - Can´t really think about anything negative to say   'Beating it doesn’t take long; It took about two hours. But it’s a satisfying experience and I sure am glad I have played it.  Though there is no story, or deeper meaning there’s something comforting about a slow puzzle and smooth trance music'",

You have to escape to the menu to reset - The UI feels somewhat clunky; the transitions / animations feel a little slow and not smooth. It's not a big deal though. - The menu sound effect is jarring",

There are 10 sets of 8 levels. Each set introduces a new mechanic and does so with a couple almost trivial levels, so a quarter of the levels are trivial tutorial... Solving the other levels is reasonably challenging and completists will have some work if they want to minimize the number of moves in each of them. And then you reach the last level and there is a gigantic spike in difficulty. Meh.  But again: A clean and pleasant puzzle game that offers a decent quantity of entertainment for a low price.",

It makes some of the choices I don't like, such as equating complexity with the number of moves required to solve the puzzle, and it falls into some of the old pitfalls like allowing irreversible mistakes that require restarts. When it starts taking 30 moves to solve a puzzle and you can make a mistake 25 moves in that requires a restart, that's frustrating. Still, it has a reasonable mechanism for circumventing the levels you don't like and the achievements are managable in scale. Overall, a pleasant game.",
