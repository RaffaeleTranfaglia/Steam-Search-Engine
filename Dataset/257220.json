Still, I found the game rather enjoyable. Just don't buy it at the full price, because it's obviously overpriced, given the laughable amount of the content.",

Solid voice-acting, pretty locations, nice puzzles. True, Sam's character isn't as sympathetic as Nina and the game's quite short but it's worth checking out. Wait for the next sale and get it cheaper.",
