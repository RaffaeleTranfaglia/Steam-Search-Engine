    "description": "Arcane Sorcery is a 4x strategy game. You are a sorcerer king. Cast powerful spells from afar from one of 4 spell books. Train units and build your economy. High strategy on a campaign map as well in turn base battles. Challenging AI that does not get buffs in all but the hardest difficulty.",

            "review_text": "Go in with low expectations and an understanding that you'll be dealing with something that resembles an early 90's 4X game, and you'll have a good time. The low price of this game makes it worth the investment if you want to experience what strategy gaming was like circa 1992. That's not a bad thing, mind you. Arcan Sorcery doesn't try to hide what it is: a very simple, low cost game that brings back the early spirit of 4X computer games.",

            "review_text": "Decently enjoyable game which seems to be a modern attempt to ape Master of Magic. While the art itself is well-made, it seems largely to be poorly implemented. Lack of visibility options (colorblind, heavy region borders, etc.) would be appreciated, but it's servicible without them. Nothing particularly poor in the game, but too, nothing that's exciting.  Some quality of life and ease-of-use methods would be nice, such as universal development queues (setting up a 'basic' method for all towns to follow after having at least X in the coffers, and similar), and some automation ability therein. I'd also love to have arrows on mouse-over in-battle so I can tell which way a unit is facing for flanking.  The AI does seem to be somewhat aggressive, overall, but unit-wise in combat it loses match-ups that it shouldn't, which is frustrating at higher levels. Would also like to note that kiting a group of melee units with a horseman and Wrack wins battles, and probably shouldn't; perhaps the AI should handle disenchanting better? Or lean more towards having balanced units (more healers/rangers)?  I picked up the game for $0.13 USD, and it's certainly worth more than that, at the least. Would love to see it pick up some nuance, and correct typos (such as 'Thorn' instead of 'Throne' in the ending text), and the like. A bit more development or care and I'd gladly recommend this, but as it is, I'd recommend picking up Master of Magic on GoG, or Enemy Nations from its own site before paying for this.",
