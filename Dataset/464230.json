The puzzle is not hard but you need to have precise control to move water to destination. Generally an average rating game with casual gameplay. Worth the dollar.  Pro: 1. Simple movement but require premise control 2. Casual gameplay, no stress   Cons: 1. Not supporting 21:9 resolution. There is no in-game option menu to adjust resolution, etc 2. No sound at all. A bit dull when playing.  ",

It goes quickly and is easy enough to figure out as far as gameplay is concerned.  I had to go into the launch parameters and add 'FluidsW7.exe 1920 1080 false' to have it open in windowed mode, which was more work than I'm used to. But hey, it worked! Now if only the sound would turn back on...",
