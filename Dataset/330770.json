            "review_text": "To the developers: I don't want you to be discouraged. VR is going to change the world, and I want skilled, creative developers to build a name for themselves from the start. This is just my opinion, and if you passionately disagree, then do what you think is best.  To the consumers: I understand that the market is small, and as such, VR games are relatively more expensive. That said, I still think $25 is too much for what this is. The tracks/race mechanics feel dated, the music wasn't gripping, and as a result, it just couldn't compete against the rest of my VR library. When I got in, I just kept asking 'Why am I even trying to win?' Sure, to unlock the next levels (and ultimately the locked ships), but it felt like the game was wanting me to experience something beyond a simple arcade racing sim. Like it was telling me it had a backstory, when none was present.  For example: Price aside, this is just the importance of music. Holopoint, a VR archery game, is pretty simple and light on content, but the music is extremely complementary to the experience, making it a ton of fun. Granted, if they charged $25, I'd probably pass based on the content, but they didn't. They sold themselves as an arcade-style game, and they delivered on that very nicely.  Radial-G's art direction was very nice, and the ships and cockpits were nicely detailed. With some changes, I could see myself rebuying this one for sure (suggestions below). It's not a mess of a game, it just feels incomplete in its current state.  Maybe Radial-G is the most amazing game two hours into it, but half an hour in, it wasn't, and as a consumer, I just don't want to wait to find out. I have other games in my library that I'd rather play NOW. If I waited for every game that wasn't fun off the bat, I'd have wasted many hours of my life taking two hours to find out what I could take a half an hour to find out.  What I would suggest, based on my own interests:  1) It would have made it a lot more interesting for me if I got to see the other racers. Weird alien creatures, or seedy criminal-looking characters; something that leads you to inherently like or dislike your competitors based on your tastes, like the F-Zero games, for example. 2) Music that just caused you to really worry about winning; something that made you feel like you're in an intense movie, you're the hero, and you have to win in that very moment. 3) Some reason for me to really care about winning. Is there a bad guy who's the number one racer? Or maybe winning races earns me some cash to upgrade my ride and feel more invested in my career (considering how many races there were to unlock).    TL;DR   It's not a bad title, but it just feels like it could use some extra depth for the price.",
