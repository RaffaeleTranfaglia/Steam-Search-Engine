            "review_text": "The game appears to be very unfinished. Simple elements are absent. There's no sound effects for the rain or footsteps; performance is low in many places, motion blur is too high... hell, the pause menu indicates a 'Game Over' screen.  Worst of all, there is no surprise or suspense with the jumpscare (if you can even call it that). The control is taken away from the player, and the pacing of the game is slowed down, right before a very low-poly model of a zombie child 'attacks' you. There's no fun, and no variety in the environments, or in the scares.  There's certain parts that could have potential, but this is very beta-esque. And that price tag??? For this? Unreasonable. I filed for a refund after about a half hour of attempted gameplay (I will have a rather humorous LP video of it up, soon.)  Remember the movie 'The Room'? It was so bad that it was good? This kind of feels like that, only it's a game. It's kinda fun to laugh at it, actually, and that's what I enjoyed in my LP video. But, that's short-lived. Some super-big changes will need to be taken (haha, get it?) before I reconsider purchasing this game.  P.S. Thank you, Valve, for refunds.",
