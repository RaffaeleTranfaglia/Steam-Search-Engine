            "review_text": "At least at this stage the game is really not worth buying. While I believe the developer did a good job with music and atmosphere, the overall impression is very negative. While the fact that the game is very short (15-20 mins top) would be acceptable, the game lacks pretty much in everything. The english translation is terrible and in many places simply doesn't make any sense. The story, specially the endings, could have been better as well, as of now it looks incomplete and flawed. The coding needs polishing (for example, the character will comment things like 'that's my wife's tomb' both when entering and when exiting the crypt, breaking immersion) and there are plenty of graphic glitches and just incomplete/imperfect assets, the messages written on the walls look like bad photoshop result. Flashlight needs tweaking (in some places, if you turn it off, you will be in complete darkness, while if you turn it on you end up blinded) and an ingame tip to use it if needed (if I haven't checked the controls before starting the game, I wouldn't even have known you had a flashlight). Overall, skip it. This game still needs lots of work.",

Having said this I wanted to voice my opinion to aid anyone interested in this title. This game's style in terms of overall concept and creativity is quite good and unique. However I cannot recommend anyone to purchase it. 'My Bones' is incredibly short even for a narrative. I completed it with both alternate conclusions in sixteen minutes. There are many bugs, grammatical errors, and it feels like a student project. (And likely is.)   Again from an artistic stand point I can appreciate what the developer was trying to achieve, but this alone doesn't justify a price tag of any kind. This should be offered as a free experience for the casual and curious. I paid ninety nine cents for this download, and while this amount is inconsequential, it is unmerited.   -A short review, for a short title-",

            "review_text": "You can say what you want about this game but it offers a lot of value when it comes to commas. Never,have,I ever,seen,so many, incorrectly,used,commas. At £2, there's probably a good comma/4p, which is a very high rate. I bought it in a bundle so I'm laughing all the way to the bank.  If you don't care about commas though, there's not much here. It has a decent atmosphere, although the sounds are very low quality. The graphics are circa early 2000. The game took me 10 minutes to complete, but some of it was a little rushed, with exploration probably another 5 minutes. The gramma (as slightly touched upon) and spelling is bad. The story is confusing, after walking around a graveyard, your transported to a few abstract scenes, which involve more walking.  Can recommend if you're into: High comma/value ratio. Like walking with heavily compressed sound and bad graphics. Want a 10 minute horror game about a dude who was dead but now is not dead but is still dead.  Can't recommend if you're into: Not spending money on short games. Like the horror genre. Have,a,strong distaste for,bad gramma,and spelling.",

After that it's a bunch of random nonsense with the minimum amount of story to push you along, and even that doesn't really make sense. There was clearly no proofreader on hand, or if so they were dumb as hell, because the few notes around were absolutely atrocious, they made my brain hurt.  This game amounts to nothing more than a key hunt. That's it. You can beat it in like five minutes with ease.",
