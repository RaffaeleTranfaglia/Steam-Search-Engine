Im Pretty Sure That Theres More But I Just Got Pass The Cut Sence When You Meet Up With Davies Then I Stopped...   PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EVEN IF ITS ON SALE!   One Last Word Before I Go. My friend brought this for me as a gag xD",

I didn't enjoy that game,  I started the game, went through a bad slow loading screen, even on max settings the game really doesn't look that great, not exactly overwhelmed at this point, kill some enemies, get out of the chopper kill some more enemies, got to an annoying unskippable cutscene with terrible voice acting, got through a village got told 'Go through this canyon' I walked through the canyon, it said 'Come back you've gone to far' So I walk backwards and walk straight in to a cutscene, the timer continues to count down DURING the cutscene and because of that it says I failed the mission, click LMB or Esc to restart.. They don't work, check task manager, the game froze.. I've played games before.. Then there's this, it's like a cheap tablet game that you can get on the App Store or Google Play for roughly the same price, in fact it feels like a port from a tablet game, which is why it's so horrible, plot is weak, no actually backstory, I literally couldn't get far because the game was just pure bad design, I restarted the game after the crash, and the continue from last save sort of option was not available. Which means after the crash it deleted my save, GG Silden.. Also what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with the publisher? KISS ltd? So tell me then can I go and request a refund Gene Simmons? Because I dislike this game to the point I want my 2 quid back?",

I'm at level 9 one or the other ladder freezes and shakes, I have to reload saved game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. But if they fix these flaws the game can be decent.",
