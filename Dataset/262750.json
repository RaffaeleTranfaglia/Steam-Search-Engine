            "review_text": "After I first played this game during it's second kick starter run, I have been waiting for this release with great anticipation. GoD (Graphite or Diamond) Factory is definitely the space shooter I have been looking for. It has a tremendous amount of different playstyles available, with not only a staggering number of parts for customization (this is the first game I have played in a long time in which I was happy to have a part unlock system) but also 4 different races to choose from. Also, while each races has it's own list of parts for every possible ship part, these pieces can still also be put on the ships of other races, opening up even more possible customization options. Additionally as a nice stylistic feature, almost every part of the ships you build have some effect on it's appearance, even internal ones like the power core. There is also a very nice focus on team play, plus features which actually facilitate team cooperation and communication. While the game is set to have other modes in the future, I still love the carrier assault mode that has the center of all available versions of the game so far. Finally, while I would definitely advise that you do the tutorials before playing any matches, GoD Factory is in my opinion very easy to pick up as a new player and be an effective part of your team. This is partially due to the fact that ships in this game do not die quickly. It normally takes quite a lot of effort in order to take down an enemy ship. However I should mention that there is a very good reason for this, in this game once you lose a ship it is replaced for the rest of the match by a weaker species specific drone. The drone can respawn, but every time it does so it gets a longer respawn timer. GoD Factory is a game which rewards cautious gameplay styles, or at the very least play styles that don't try to act like a one man army.",

            "review_text": "God Factory: Wingmen is a rather unique game, combining space fighters, dogfighting, Moba style objectives and a great deal of customization. I'm certainly not the first and definitely not the last person to say this, but this is the first game in quite a while that has given me a legitimate reason to want to buy a joystick.  Firstly if money is a factor that makes you hesitate then at the time I'm writing this I would hold off for a bit, as the game is majorly PvP centric and getting a good match going can be difficult at the moment due mainly to a low population. You can play against bots but players are always the better choice, and the bots don't exactly go easy on new players even at low ranks. There is a major update incoming as well as a free weekend so if this interests you keep and eye and give it a shot while its free.  The game itself has a lot of depth, which is both good and bad. I personally really enjoy the detail that goes into building your own personal ship as well as the great deal of options in game of both tactics and maneuvers, however there is a LOT to learn, which can certainly get in the way of getting comfortable playing the game. It can be rather daunting starting out but I found that it gets better and better the more you learn. One mistake thats easy to make is getting too hung up on ship setups and equipment. Most weapons and such handle similarly enough (there are of course exceptions) that a player whos got good control skills will do well and one without will almost always do poorly, so I would focus more on getting the gameplay control down before worrying too much about trying to make a super flying deathmachine.  Most of the regular players are quite friendly and can give some pretty good advice.   Ship Customization:  There are tiers of ship parts, for the core frame parts (wings, body, cockpit) the higher tiers are generally higher stats but higher requirements as well, so higher end is generally stronger if you can fit it in.  Some special parts such as abilities and special equipment often have radically different effects with a same basic idea behind them per tier, so while higher may cost more it will not always be better performance wise depending on what you want to use it for.  weapons work similarly to the core parts but with the damage types and constraint limits with many high end parts, as well as the flexibility of having two wing weapons, maximum tier versions of the weapon are not always the best choice.  Ship constraints are determined by parts such as the body, and generator and such, however the constraints themselves are not hard capped, you can exceed the constraints and take a penalty based on what category you're exceeding, which scale based on how much you exceed by. It is quite possible to make and exceptional ship that goes over its constraint limits but is generally something you'll want to avoid.  overall - lots and lots of details, this can be very overwhelming but a solid basic setup will still perform well and doesn't need to be overanalyzed when starting out. I personally love the level of detail that can go into ship building but this can be a negative as well for some players   Controls:   Personally I found the default mouse and keyboard controls to be a bit awkward at first, after getting used to them a bit it worked very well, but I did end up changing them so I would conflict too much with other games I play as switching back and forth between control schemes with some similarities was more trouble then it was worth to me, but with a few minor adjustments it works great. Also there's word that the new version (incoming fairly soon) will have altered default controls to match up more closely with more commong Mouse+keyboard schemes players may be familiar with. And although I don't have access to a setup regularly the game is a blast with a good joystick.  There are a wide variety of built in maneuvers available to the player and they're flexible enough to be used in a very wide variety of ways to create some pretty crazy maneuvers.  overall - Has a significant learning curve but I feel the controls are solid, and offer enough options and flexibility to create a good non-restrictive experience   Gameplay:  The game itself currently consists of two teams fighting to destroy eachothers carriers, it has Moba style objectives where killing the oposing team players does offer and advantage but if not capitalized on doesn't garuntee anything.  Currently there is one map with several new ones reportedly coming in the next update, however I'd also like to add that the map is varied and balanced enough that with the way the game plays I would say that this is not a problem.  Dogfighting is important but as above with kills is not anywhere near the end all of how to win or even play. Ultimately the carrier is what matters and your ability to either stop the enemies attack force or simply outdo their offense with your own will determine the match. Additionally carriers have a main cannon that will periodically fire at eachother creating a limit to how long a match can last, with a draw being determined by either most gunship kills (a players main ship) or additionally the teams overall score if kills were even as well.  The carrier has several destroyable parts such as a radar, repair station, shield generator, which when destroyed inflicts a different penalty on the opposing team as well as suffering damage to their overall carrier integrity. This allows for many different approaches on how to take out the carrier, from going for surprise attacks on undefended parts, crippling the enemies ability to resupply and radar range, or even going for maximum carrier damage by stripping its defenses.  It's also important to note that players themselves can be harder to destroy than might be expected, often requiring at least two players to garuntee a kill before an experienced player can escape to relative safety, however losing a ship can be a major loss to a team or individual, as a lost gunship is permanently out for the rest of the match. A player is allowed to bring two seperate gunships into a match and they may not have any overlapping parts (with 4 different races to pick from even building two ships for similar roles and performance is quite doable), and a lost ship is replaced with a standard drong ship for that race, which are generally weak stat wise but cannot be ignored as they can still turn the tide of a battle as well as not costing the team any points towars a tiebreaker if the drone is destroyed as it will respawn. Also players are allowed to request to share ships with another of their teammates giving both players free access to eachothers ships for the rest of the match, altho the rules for losing ships remain even if another player is piloting one of your ships.  overall - a unique game with a focus more on team objectives than a straight forwards deathmatch. There is as much place on a team for a player who wants only to shoot down enemy fighters as well as a player who wants to focus solely on bombing the carrier. Survival is also quite important as you may lose an edge with too many gunships lost, but kills alone don't decide the match and a team can lose many more ships than the opponent and still come out significantly on top.    Final notes, again at the time of writing this there is an update incoming and reportedly shortly after this game will be available for a free weekend so if this interests you at all, keep an eye out.",

            "review_text": "Lots of Fun.... Needs More.... People.  This is quite a Stratigic game. To win you have to destroy your enemy's carrier (The Big ship). To lose... just let them destroy your carrier (the Big ship you spawn on). Simple right? Wrong!  The Ship is made up of various parts such as: Forcefield generator; Radar; Ammo Depot; ETC. Destroying any of these will inflict varied pain on the enemy team. on top of that some maps have special points such as healing stations that can be captured so that you do not have to retreat all the way back to your ship to heal.  As far as gameplay related to other space fight games I can't tell you much as the only other game like this one that i have played is Star Fox: Assault (Yes I know thats a Bad Comparision but its my only one)  Flight is slightly complex with you controling 4 dimesions of basic manuevering and a few special manuevers (180 flips, drifting, ETC.)  from what i have noticed the matches will be quicker as you upgrade your gunship (or exosuit) because you can easily do more damage to the enemy's Carrier.  One thing Ilove about this game is the customisation you can do to your ships. Tweaking this or that to make it just what you desire.  THE ONLY CON SO FAR  player base appears to be under 10 people  BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this con can be fixed. How? you ask?   BY BUYING THIS GAME  'nough said",

It deserves a lot of attention to tweak every gunship parts available and you can either choose to enhance the versatility of two species or to develop the whole culture of spatial craft from the four species/gunship types. It can be very exciting to play with players. Playing solo is also entertaining.   For hardcore gamers ! When you destroy your two available ships, you have replacement gunships that are weaker. It is very frustrating when you lose both of your very own crafted ships on the first half of the match but a good player lobby allows an easy simple balancing of the level of difficulty encountered by each team at the beginning of every match.",

Newer players who get too giddy need to take the time and explore the hanger and shop. Dear GoD do the tutorials! 2&gt; The UI could use some overhaul to give a little more clarity to stat affects or bonuses. 3&gt; No such thing as 'dog fighting' mode (I can understand it as it would turn it into a different game) 4&gt; Attempting to add friends can be a bit wonky 5&gt; Too many people complaining about losing a ship and quitting  Long Version  I have been playing GoD factory since it has come out and all I can say is I have found an arcade space alien(ish) style shooter I can enjoy playing. It does a good job of giving you hints as to how to play , but sometimes it can be a little daunting until you play your first match where you will die. Not a little, but a lot and if its not someone killing you then its you hitting your ship getting lost. You can save yourself a little time by doing a couple bot matches just to get yourself warmed up to the games controls, but your first real game with other players is goign to be where you really learn. Customizing your ship feels weird at first only because the game does not exactly tell you that your build is bad until you exceed one of your resources. I personally dont find this as a problem, but maybe the dev team should think about adding in a feature that shows you how to customize AND buy. I know it sounds like a lot of hand holding, but some information is better than none in some cases.   My numer one complaint about this game is the amount of complaining from people when they break their ships and then ask to use yours in under 5 minutes. I am not saying there needs to be a way to kick people, but if there were a mute feature in this game for really annoying people that would be great. Other than that see you in game!",

Controls are not very familiars but with a bit of pratice you can master your ship quite well and even make some kill. This game is not meant to be a pure Fps, so strategy is required and much collaboration. There's only one map but i think that they will be added as soon as population grows up and shows interest. Maybe playing many hours alone could get boring btw if you have some friend and you can play together and coordinate your attacks this game gets really awesome and i recommend it.

My first and second game went horribly due to flying issues. But after that, I actually loved the flying. It was challenging and you have to pay attention to the mini map WHILE making sure you don't ram into debris. If you love challenges, this is the game for you.  Customisation in this game is fantastic. Graphics are brilliant even on medium. I have yet to try low. I like the unlocking credits and colours through achievements. I find this concept smart. A sense of reward for the players, make them feel like it is worth hunting achievements unlike other games.  You absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY ... cannot solo. Unless you outlevel everyone else by what? 3 levels? I dunno. Not very fun smashing newbies unless you need a serious boost in ego.  The community is quite friendly surprisingly... Well, so far.  Hope they add more stages like racing, capture the flag, hunt the rabbit (kinda like a treasure hunt, looking for a particular ship or asteriod or something), co-op against a crazy alien race etc.",
