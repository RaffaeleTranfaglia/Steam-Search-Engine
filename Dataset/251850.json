            "review_text": "When I saw this game on the new releases page, the concept of the soul cloud, the soundtrack, and the art direction immediately caught my attention and got me to make a rare impule buy. Featuring gorgeous art direction, great sound design, an interesting plot, and an atmosphere that can get really creepy at times for a game that isn't strictly a horror game. It feels low budget and rough around the edges in places, but it's a great effort and a certain audience will absolutely love it. There's some actiony gameplay in here and a little bit of platforming, but the playtime is dominated by puzzles which are typically engaging but simple. Really, the puzzles are just a way to get you to explore the environment and the storyline and could have been cut without losing much.   The whole futuristic posthuman idea has always fascinated me, and I'd love to see a sequel that goes a little deeper into the world of the soul cloud.",

            "review_text": "Wow.  What should I say about this game?  I had been interested in it from the moment I had seen it on Steam nearly a year ago. What had kept me from purchasing it right away was the horror aspect, but that definitely added to the game, rather than detracted from it. I am absolutely glad that I bought and played this game through, and definitely plan on playing through again to unlock the alternate ending.  Master Reboot delivers an artistic experience with a story to match that leaves you eager to play each section and find every secret. This game will leave you wanting to play more of it even after finishing it. Step into the Soul Cloud yourself and learn about the Mysteri Corporation and those involved in it's origins.  Some of the 'horror' aspects of the game are predictable, but still managed to frighten me. Besides that the story is constantly compelling and the voice acting is well done. I would rate the game a solid 9 out of 10.",

Having just completed the game, I'm happy that I did end up getting this game and playing it. A couple hours well spent. The game carries with it a creepy ambiance, wide range of good puzzles, excellent story, and more. When it comes to visuals, everyone has their own cup of tea. Personally, I was a fan of this game's visual style and found it rather beautiful and to suit the game as well. The same goes for the game's soundtrack as well. I thought it was nice, and at times, suited that horror/creepy theme to the game. With the story, it can be a bit confusing, but if you collect the ducks thoughout the game, which provide further backstory and such, and once you piece it together, makes sense and doesn't leave too many questions open. After piecing together the story and thinking back on the game, I thought it to be good. Again, not a game for everyone, but it's a game I enjoyed and personally, I thought it was a good game. Glad I bought and played it!",

            "review_text": "I'm stuck on the final boss and completely frustrated, but I still can't say that I don't recommend this game. It's that damn partial controller support that plagues me. My d-input controllers have permanent button inversion and my xbox controller auto sidesteps making the random platform elements borderline impossible. If there was an ingame option screen I could probably just switch to keyboard and mouse (I need to invert the mouse) but no, I have to start the whole level over again. Anyways:  Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=loved  Game design: 4/5 The game itself is pretty simple. Run round in the dark and find clues to the story. It mixes elements of survival horror (I wouldn't call this an exclusively survival horror game though, very little can actually hurt you), puzzles, platforming, hidden object. It's actually a good mix, and despite my beef with the platforming, the game itself doesn't feel broken. Perhaps a bit dated. 3D navigation is a bit clunky, and some of the puzzles don't make any sense (but are still easy), but none of it actually gets in the way of gameplay. Maybe you could call this game 'casual horror'?  Tone: 3/5 The largest problem with the game is it's selection of advertised screenshots. It has some cool and haunting imagery, but like the game play, there ir a mix of styles present. There are weird little cutscenes at the end of each level that look like they were made in Flash. The impression of the game is a bit different than what is actually there, granted that it is difficult to present a game with this much variety. It simply might not be the epic horror mystery that you are looking for. The concept is great, but the story is overly simple and a bit confusing. I don't know if the game intends to keep you guessing about which girl is which, but I'm still getting them mixed up. I can nitpick more but ultimately it doesn't interfere with the experience that much. I really want to enforce that this game is actually quite casual, don't expect anything mindblowing and you should enjoy it.  Personal skew: 2/5 I'm not mad anymore, and might attempt that last level again. Hardcore gamers will find this game easy and possibly laughable, I don't think that most will feel it to be a waste of time, but some definitely will. Casual gamers will get the most out of this, especially if you're interested in horror games but don't want to be overwhelmed.",

First off this game took me by surprise. Although not as polished as a triple-A title it has a unique charm about it that draws you in and keeps you interested. The whole story behind this game is very intriguing and reminds me of very few other titles. And although the storyline was thin it was highly engrossing and kept me hooked right until the end. I just wanted to know more and find out everything I could about the world around me and the people in it.  The level designs are tremendous; they have a charm about them that is just so unique and imaginative. Every single one of them offers something different to all the others, I loved just looking at everything around me and taking it all in each time. The characters are pretty interesting and every titbit of information I gleamed helped me feel immersed in these people’s lives and how you ended up lost in this world. The art style is great, very colourful, striking and a word I keep using unique.  The gameplay is good too, a first person exploration game across a huge variety of stages, each with its own goals and objectives completely different to all those before. The puzzles are not the most difficult but offer enough satisfaction when you manage to figure them out. The enemy in this game takes on the form of a malevolent all powerful AI, as they often do, who will stop at nothing to destroy you. When she chases you it can be a little tense that’s for sure.  The price tag is little high on this one but if you see it on sale it is well worth a play through. It may take a short time to really get into but once it’s sunk its teeth in there is no letting go.  Have fun ^_^",

When I saw the QL on Giant Bomb, I had no idea that it was also an enviromentally terrifying game where the 'Little SIster/Alma from Fear' enemies are an ever-present worry even when you're not sure they are in the level. Having finished the game, I am very glad I played it. $10 is well worth it, I believe.  Be wary of the checkpoint near the end after repairing the tram. It's the last checkpoint if you restart the game after closing it. And the final battle has no checkpoint. Frustrating but doable.",

This game eschews tutorials and instead relies on iconography and experimentation. It works really well the vast majority of the time - there's one or two places where it doesn't, but I'd still take this approach over tutorials any day.  The puzzles themselves are mostly good, usually just dependent on exploring, which is an aspect I'm fond of. There were one or two that were frustratingly confusing and could have used a bit more guidance though.  Finally, my only technical complaint is that the maximum resolution is 1080p. Given the style it's not a huge deal, but I don't know why they wouldn't support higher native resolutions. It's just annoying, especially when I open the in-game Steam overlay and it's hard to read because its blurry.  In the end this game is a surreal blend of something like Myst and To the Moon. I loved it.",

It's a horror adventure game, which - funny enough - reminded me a little bit of Super Mario 64, in the way that you navigate through the Soul Village which acts as a kind of overhead map screen, from which you can enter the different levels. Each level is unique and offers a variety of simple or challenging tasks (puzzles, finding items, stealth quests, survival), which makes the game a lot of fun to play. I really enjoyed the horror elements. The little scary girl may be a clishé, but it's one I like and I think it's very well executed in this game. The abandoned hospital stage is pretty terrifying and when the game wants to be scary, it certainly manages to. The only thing I found a bit disappointing is how little time they give the story to conclude at the ending. Also, the intro stage didn't seem to be very appealing. But once you're out of the woods (literally), the real entertainment begins. Apart from that, I was absolutely amazed by how terrific the game was and how immersive the story unfolded itself.  10/10",

Why? people reliey on over the top Graphics to make there games now adays but this game has little money to put down for the looks but it makes up in it with the story that games have either over did it like Halo, or didnt have one that you or ♥♥♥♥-jo could come up with like CoD. BUT this story is ment for people that realy care for it rather then the people that crave it. giving a story that takes time and thought to come up with. i wounder if there is a book to this?    Rating-8.5/10 it was well made had some great shadeing to scare you (main thing that ever scares you is this).   story is there but you have to find most of it.    blue eyes in dark hallways with flashing lights.  Air ducts in planes?  INFO ON GAME.------ this game is a horrer game that is story driven, NOT like Dead Space horrer or Silent Hill. this game is for people that dont like the fighting part of the game but rather the story that draws you in and leaves you with a chuby that wont go away for some time or tell the next one comes out to end it with one that you find fitting or for me just happy.    SPOILER------- what got me for even the least bit of sorrow or greif is the ending when seren says that you cant return after removing the virus(it dont say if it was) she says 'sorry madeson you exeded the 4hour limet, your body is no longer livable. Welcome to the soul cloud.' then that teary music playes before she leaps off the edge into a massive ball of blue data as her body fades away. after seeing most of the blue ducks its easy to see what lead her into this fate. its just sad to see that she fell into her own prisen made to help people remember the dead as they once where, but in the end killed her and every one she loved.

Master Reboot is short of masterpiece status solely on account of simple graphics and a few non-intuitive puzzles; easy puzzles, but ones in which the solution is achieved by randomly clicking and with no logic between action and solution (here's looking at you, playground).  The pros far outweigh the cons. The puzzles and environments are varied, never repetitive; the story is haunting, pieced together by messages and pictures you get from optional blue ducks, reversed engineered as you progress; the demons(?) are creepy as hell and made me jump every single time, sometimes just in anticipation. The music, environments and atmosphere all combine for a disturbing and horrific reason to stay up until 3am.  I would definitely recommend, and will be getting Wales Interactive's next game Soul Axiom just as soon as it's out of early access.",

The setting is somewhat original, the ingame visual style and graphics fit the theme and the game has some nice moments. In terms of graphics, some of the animations (that involve depictions of human beings) sort of clash with the rest of the game, but that's excusable in my opinion.  There are only a few issues: some of the puzzles are a bit annoying (targets you need to shoot on top of a roof that are only visible from certain angles) and if they're not annoying: they're kind of easy.  The only exception I can think of when it comes to the otherwise easy difficulty is the pattern repitition mini-game that looks like this:        Worst mini-game of the game.&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "This game is a really good game, it is however, very directed towards thinkers. The story is one you have to be thinking about the whole time, as it's given to you in pieces, and the details at first are very confusing because of how general they are, later though, they get more detailed and as you start actively piecing them together, the core of the story starts becoming known.   A fair bit of warning is that the story requires a decent amount of interpretation on your own part. As well as this is a puzzle game, it is very well done, and some of them you really have to think for. This also goes to say that it's got horror in the mix, and I'm glad to say there are some parts where generally I felt pretty scared, and the environment and audio does a decent job of adding to the horror (not to mention the game does some pretty scary things too, however it's something to be experienced, so I'll just leave it at that.)   At first I thought it was going to be something like Amnesia, where you're gonna have to run and hide from the spooky scary peoples... Glad to tell you that's not the case, maybe there is one instance where it feels like that, but thankfully it's not painful to get past. Don't let that make you think that this game isn't scary though, it was at least to me, generally a decent horror game where I felt anxiety at parts to continue, however the story is what kept me moving, I wanted it to finish, and I feel that this was the best way to tell the story for the style of game that it is.  It meant sitting down after playing it, and having to think about all the pieces and put them together piece by piece to get to the point where I could comprehend the plot in its entierty, like a book. It was more then likely in my opinion the best way to tell the story, not only that but the mental workout of piecing things together while solving puzzles really gave me this feeling of satisfaction and giddiness. I haven't had to sit down and piece together a story in a long time, as well as I haven't played a good puzzle game that didn't involve trying to break space and time, in a very very long time. So it was a very nice refreshing change from the usuall games I have been playing.  I would most certainly recommend this game if you like thinking, especially when it comes to story, and enjoy puzzles.",

It gets straight into the action, unlike many games which have a strenuous introduction, complemented by a ton of cutscenes and such. Action is definitely what the game should be focused on, and right here, Wales Interactive have certainly nailed it.  The strange and mysterious worlds, dark and strange themes mixed in with a slight hint of shock horror, all in an indie game? Yeah, definitely worth it.  10/10 for me, no doubts about it.

In a nutshell: Everything's colourful. Then everything's weird. Then you go all over looking for little blue rubber ducks. Then there are creepy little girls and teddy bears all around, then things get REALLY weird, weirder still (!), then there's an epic boss fight, and then it ends - and you just sit there wondering what the smurf just happened.

The game ran great in full screen resolution set to 1920x1080 for the first two memories, but after that, it ran terrible and started freezing and skipping frames. Also the sound started popping in and out. This game doesn't seem to be optimized for Mac's. I even tried lowering the resolution but some parts of the game just are too convoluted and needs to be optimized better. It really takes away from the whole immersive experience. I ended up quitting because of this stupid platforming part in the game! I was doing fine and all of a sudden, I had to do every thing all over again! It's weird too, because you don't really need to do much when platforming, but initiate the jumps. It's fairly automatic. I don't know how I ended up back on the bottom. Anyway it was frustrating, so I quit playing. Upon quitting the game, it crashed hard! I had to force quit the game and force quit Steam to get completely out.  Anyway, on a positive side, the game is pretty trippy and has some creepy effects and atmosphere. It is unlike any other game I have ever played and sometimes has some very cool atmosphere. It has a very retro and a sometimes Tron-ish/Matrix-ish (the movies) feel to it. I only played the beginning and four memories. I will continue to play, but some of the puzzles are really dumb and frustrating! The gameplay can get stupid at times too, because lack of direction and dumb platforming sections. At times, you will be shaking your head and rolling your eyes saying to yourself; 'what were the dev's thinking of?'  Some people will absolutely love this game just for the atmosphere alone. I have not gotten to the real scary parts yet and some of the memories really were a real pain to get through. What is nice, if you don't want to finish a memory, you can leave and go back later. The school memory is tough and sometimes a bit stupid! I left and will go back later to finish it. I do like the game enough so far to recommend it, but only on sale!  I may update this later. I really can't give a fair review based on the limited time I have spent. Just know that this game is very different than most other games I have played and has a charm to it that may attract some gamers, but drive others away from the game. The graphics are not all that great but fit the game well. The sound is creepy and sets the mood for most of the memories just fine.  My main complaint is that sometimes the game with start running terrible for no reason. Some of the memory levels are tiny and should run much better than they do. Even when the lighting is low and the levels are dark, it still can run terrible for no reason. Just all of a sudden you go from 60 fps to 1 fps! It's frustrating at the least!  Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8.",

Though the scares are lame (excluding that freaking hospital level &gt;.&gt;) The game has very unique art style for most of the levels. Towards the end and in that stupid hospital level again it does change a little. (I think there's actually some more levels with a changed art style.) The gameplay is also very interesting, each level is extremaly different, For example theres the childhood level where you see a little girls room from the view of a toy as you solve pzzles and try to collect keys, then you move on to the flying (airplane) level. (Theres multiple parts of this level, but I'll just go over the first one) you have to find gold pieces while hiding from seren (the enemy) behind seats. In conclusion Master Reboot is a great game with a unique art style and great puzzles.",

The game has a strong visual concept and underlying story, and the point I liked most about it is that the story, once pieced together, makes sense, and doesn't leave too many questions open, instead of losing itself in self-indulgent generalities like similar games *cough*Dear Esther*cough* did. Master Reboot is plagued by quite a lot of flaws in its execution, from the fumbly aiming to the god-awful and at times pretty annoying sound design (especially the sounds that are endlessly repeated, like   Kali  's laughter) and the bland music. But these aren't necessarily deal breakers. Unfortunately, there's the gameplay. Where other story-centric games of the walking simulator variety have wisely chosen to be as free of traditional gameplay as possible, Master Reboot makes you jump through a series of hoops consisting of disjointed puzzles, brain teasers thrown in your way to slow you down. This, for me, made Master Reboot impossible to enjoy. Where I wanted to simply explore the levels, find snippets of the story and immerse myself in the game's atmosphere, it made me complete unrelated and pointless tasks that caused quite a bit of frustration.",

The polish is not there, the ideas are sometimes half-baked, but overall this is a fun game, at the right price. I found it to be a lot like something David Lynch might have done back in the eighties, around the time of Dune. The game does not hold your hand and instead let's you solve most things on your own, there are clues from time to time. Sometimes the path is so obvious it feels rushed and other times it is so obscure it becomes frustrating.   The visual style is something I enjoyed when the textures were not so muddy, it made me wonder why it wasn't polished more. I am not certain how big the team was behind this game, but I have seen a team of four put out something far better looking than this. Now, the lighting is well implemented, but the over all look of the game comes across as rushed. There are levels that seem forced due to how they rendered the environment, it looks like some student project out of Unity from time to time. This really takes away from the real well done segments, that seem to set you up for a great experience, just to let you down again.   The music is fantastic, being the real strongpoint of the game. I'm surprised it was not used more often, especially during the art cut scenes, that turn out to be sloppy due to a lack of music. Over all the animations are good enough to not make you feel ripped off, but I could not expect you to get fifteen dollars worth of gameplay out of this. For the five I paid, I am very happy with the game and it would be so much greater if he price was less.   All in all, this is a game I enjoyed playing for the most part. The story could have been better, but it works well enough to make you think at bit. There really isn't any voice acting, but when there is it works. There were times when I really wanted to like this game more than I do. It never let me down completely, but it also didn't blow me away. If it is less than ten dollars, pick it up. Otherwise wait it out.  The more I think about it. This game is not well made or fun enough to purchase at any price over five dollars.",

Very nice atmosphere with decent graphics (rather blocky, but well made) and a captivating story in a atmopheric and spooky environment and great sounds and music. The dreamy like landscape and the clues and cutscenes fit well together, even if the style of the drawings is a bit off compared to what you see in game. But its livable, and still ads to the game.  Some of the puzzles sould have been better thought out (the walls in the library are too similar to find way round, the symbols in the cemeraty are not clear, and the music repetition gets a bit old)  But now, when the developers ran out pizza, it took a turn for the absolute dreadful. The story has become technobable, the atmosphere in the game is completly gone, and the graphics unique style that hid the low polygon count blocky elements have all but gone, leaving a very poor version of Tron 2.0 behind. Flaoting squares and neon bands glowing ? How un-original.  But mst annoying of all, I have reached a point where I have to smash five cubes in 180 seconds, and having tried it for a long evening, I have given up. I consider myslf a seasoned FPS games I cant complete this. The games poor thought process (if you know you cant make it you cant restart the process, and you can save the exact spot if you are doing good) means its just too frustrating to continue. I did not go into this game looking for a jumping match, and even a very poor one at that. Furthermore the game crashes on exit.  I would hope for an update, but I doubt that will happen, so Ill just wish for a new game from the same developer when they dont run out of pizza and coke halway down the development and give it to some dilletant for completion.",

Now that I'm a quarter of the way through the game, I believe that the creator of this game was inspired by the Gettysburg Address.  EDIT (7/12/2015 1:56 AM CET) I took a trip to Berlin for a few months to find myself after playing this game. I had many sleepless nights, tossing and turning over what I had seen. There were two distinct ideas residing in my mind: this game was either my messiah or my personal hell. I needed to travel to a city as split in twain as my heart to understand how to move on, how to regroup, how to heal. This will be my last edit.   It was in the arms of a plain but empathetic 'woman of the night' that I had a revelation. I saw before me what could happen when two bodies become one. I saw a unification of ideas in a way I was not even capable of seeing before Master Reboot forced me to grow. I finally feel like I know what I have needed to know since I first clicked 'write review'.    This game is alright, buy it on sale I guess if you're really interested but it's whatever  ",

Mainly the atmosphere and the story as you can make it out. The game itself is broken into many set pieces which initalliy played like a variety of large scale minigames. This I really liked in the beginning until I started to realize that the variety was thin and it was essentialy the same scavenger hunt just in a different location usually with a gimmick to spice it up....find the three things in an oversized child's room.....find the three things on a plane while hiding from a spooky flight attendant of death.....find the three things in a hospital with a flashlight....find the three things using a metal detector..... you get the point.   That sound design was pretty bad to the point of painful in some instances....kinda laughable in others (shoot some bottles at the carnival and you'll know what I mean.) The controls however are what ended up killing the entire experience for me. Movement is clunky which is even more of a negative considering the game relies pretty heavily on first person platforming in several parts. Now combine this with a rage inducing bug plaguing the game that causes the controls to stick in one direction (usually left for me,) making you to run constantly into walls or off of platforms. After replaying the finale of the game (a rather long timed platforming bonaza) and failing three times due to the control issues, I flipped off the screen and decided that even though I was seconds from completion, it just wasn't worth the trouble.",

Its a shame really, this feels if it came out in 2001 and had a bit more polish it could have reasonably sold for full price. What holds it back is really a lack of cohesion and vision.
