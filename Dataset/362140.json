            "review_text": "This is the 2nd game in the Ashes of Immortality series, and begins in a small village where a white wolf named Lawrence is given a seemingly simple assignment of recovering a sword that has been stolen by a mysterious character the previous night. He is given a half werewolf (Landon) to travel with, and so begins the adventure that will take them throughout the world. You will visit several locations (towns, woods, mountains, tunnels) with various clues as to what is going on, and they all feature assorted treasures to discover, monsters to fight, characters to deal with, and quests to finish. It is, however, never confusing, and the path to follow is pretty straightforward (there is even a boat to use to speed up your travels and a quest log) ---- and this is the way it should be when the story is well told ---- as this one is. The game captures your interest quickly, and it becomes one of those stories that you want to just go to one more place, meet one more person, or finish just one more quest.  Like the 1st game of the series, this one uses a system of acquiring skills as you level up, then you must decide which skills to equip. Skills can be offensive, defensive, rare, or unique so you have to decide how and when to use them since there is a maximum number you can have at any given time. The various combinations can affect battle outcomes considerably.  The game features very nice artwork, runs smoothly, and sound effects and music add to the game experience.   I've not gotten far enough to see how much it will tie into the first game, but I have seen a couple of characters from the previous game that might play a part in upcoming events. Guess I'll have to keep going to find out. But overall, I believe it is an excellent entry to this fun and entertaining series about werewolves, hunters, vampires. and other mysterious characters. Recommended for sure.",
