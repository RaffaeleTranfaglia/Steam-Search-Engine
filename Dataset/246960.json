            "review_text": "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams - Rise of the Owlverlord, is an Action-Platformer with a little puzzle solving along the way. You play as Giana, who has the worst case of split personality I've ever seen, who has been recently captured by the Owls and thier King/Lord/Thingy and now you have to deal with them before they complete their vaguely referenced plan of dominance over the world.   As I said before, Giana has a bit of a split persoanlity problem that she uses to her advantage. While as Punk Rocker Giana, you have a power fire dash that, in some ways, can work alot like a Homing Attack from Sonic the Hedgehog. You can execute several of these dashes as long as you've hit an enemey. For every one enemy hit like this, you can dash again, great for traversing large areas quickly. You can also use the fire dash to break through cracked walls as well.  As Goth Giana, you gain a spin-jump that you can use to go higher than before and ride wind currents. You can also use the Spin-Jump to trigger mechanism.  Changing between the two personalities change how the world is percieved. Mechanisms, platforms, enemies, and even some attacks change when you switch between the two forms. Knowing which form to use is up to you.  The music is great, though it is quite short, only seven levels, though each level themselves are quite massive and puzzling.   I give this game a 4 out of 5, and a must have for those who like action-platforming in the same vein as Donkey Kong Country.",

If you beat Giana Sisters awhile ago, think it's worth replaying, then check out the new content. If you haven't played Giana Sisters before, you COULD use this as a demo... but the full game has about 3-4x the content and goes on sale for the same price as this standalone",

            "review_text": "The engine is literally not changed in the slightest from the original game, which is basically grounds enough for a thumbs down since the engine was in serious need of fixing before. Aside from that. The levels are generally better this time around, more action and less tedious waiting games. The boss is also way way better than anything in the original and actually fun and all that, so props on that. I can't say it's that bad level-design wise though there's still some stupid things like no spare hits in stage 2 and lots of moments where you're expected to predict the future (especially in regards to what path to go). The difficulty is pretty even throughout, about the same as the third world of the original game. If I were judging based on the level design alone I probably would recommend this but because the developers saw fit to push out a new game before fixing the previous problems I can't recommend it on policy.",
