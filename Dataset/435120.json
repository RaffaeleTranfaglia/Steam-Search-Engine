The atmosphere is also very, very good, it is like a horror story written and directed by Wes Anderson...  + Haunting and weird + Captivating atmosphere + Really great puzzles - Voice acting is 'B movie' like - Short (but fits for the price!)  - It is a Flash game...

When I got around to 'helping' Ms. Pidgeon however I had a small snit when I realized I was doing algebra for the first time since High School.  So wrong to snobbishly tell my teachers I would never use those skills again.   10/10 Would do math to murder hotel guests again",

The only time they gave me any trouble was when I had looked over something myself, or just missed something completely. At two dollars, an excellent value for the 2-3 hours you'll spend playing it.",
