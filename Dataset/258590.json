            "review_text": "Epic Quest is  extremely  reminiscent of ToeJam &amp; Earl. Not a bad thing  at all .  Performance is good, controls are tight and has support for 1440p+/120hz/60fps+.  Voiceover work has been done by the original cast. Plenty of new lines have been voiced which tie into the 'video game' world very well which is important. Most of your favourite characters from the series make appearances, both the friends and foes. Set across the different worlds each containing at least 5 levels, you will come across a bunch of familiar collectables while following your main 'quest' to obtain the relics.   Upbeat chiptune 8/16bit styled soundtrack. Not only fits the theme but is rather catchy too.  Great game for the price and fans of the series.  Easily recommended from what i've played. :)",

You go through maze-like levels, collect stuff and use some ridiculous power ups. The graphics are not amazing, but capture the charm of Adventure Time well. So does the voice acting (all of the original voice actors are here!).  It does get repetitive after a while, but the game is short and sweet, and it's hella cheap. Easy recommentdation for Adventure Time fans!",

That's some intense hide and seek skills.  10/10 would play hide and seek again  Now onto the actual review... This game is amazing. It has literally won a spot in the selection of my favorite games. It's a simple 'beat 'em up' kind of game, with fun spells, enemies, and courses. The music is cute and catchy, and the stages can be repetitive, but there's always some kind of a twist. This game is worth buying, and isn't a waste! My only regret is that it wasn't longer.",

            "review_text": "At the moment I do not recommend the game. There are several game-breaking bugs; such as killing the forest witch when she sits on Finn or Jake - your camera zooms in all the way and all weapons except scrolls are useless.  After the update I lost all my save data; I was already at the Ice King.   Another problem is the weird control scheme. It uses the arrow keys instead of WASD and it kinda catches you off-guard.  I also felt that there was a lot of hit and miss moments in this game, from the cutscenes being either poorly rigged mouth movements to just being a zoom in on the low resolution screenshot from the actual cartoon series.   I do appeal to the original voice cast, and many references to previous episodes. However a pet peeve of mine is the world isn't open. Easily you could have just mashed all levels onto one big slate, as the grounds already look like puzzle pieces or maybe used a wall or forest like boundary instead of have the entire land of Ooo floating on the sky abyss.",

Pros: - Voiced by the original cast. - 28 levels in total. - Levels are GIANT. - Controls are tight.  Cons: - You get lost VERY easilly. - Combat is repetitive. - Some of the spells are WAY TO OVERPOWERED. - The 'Puppies!' achievement is bugged, wrong image. - Re-using the same enemies in different worlds, even though they don't fit in. E.G 'Forest Witch' in the Fire Kingdom.  I would rate this game 5/10, playable, but flawed.",

            "review_text": "Its not the worst game of this type; y'know, the kind that sells off the success of the brand. There's plenty of references to the show, at least, and they are integrated with moderate success through the decision to make them affect gameplay rather than just be a collectibale on the side. The mechanics are, for the most part, bad. A fairly simple combat system with lots of walking in-between. Would have benefitted greatly from a more comprehensive map possibly accessible from the pause menu. All the collecting is meaningless; money and silver keys only get you enchiridion pages which are already in abundance and the combat is, again, so simple that the pages aren't really all that useful. There's been a lot of fuss over how much support the devs have shown after release. Well, cool your boots; its been like four days since release and, frankly, the game is so riddled with bugs it shouldn't have been released so prematurely. This is all the more embarrassing when you consider its a re-release of an, otherwise, free game.  All in all, the reasonable pricetag makes up for a lot of its shortcomings, and, for the fans, being able to interact with the Adventure Time universe outside of the show is great. But, ultimately, its not as good as the show, or other videogames, so maybe consider investing your time in those instead.",

Being a HUGE toejam &amp; earl fan from age 7, this game was a must buy for me and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. Gameplay is faster paced than toejam &amp; earl and instead of mainly avoiding enemies like in tj&amp;e, your fighting them. A very lite level up/upgrade system is also included. This game is a instant purchase for fans of tj&amp;e. This game gives you a hint of what tj&amp;e 3 should have been or what tj&amp;e 4 needs to be if we ever get that. The only complaint is lack of MP, which will hopefully be added down the road, but if not I'll still be having a blast with F&amp;J's Epic Quest.",

I think this game would be a lot more enjoyable if the physics and mechanics for movement and combat were more polished and actually felt complete unlike how they are now, as of now it feels like an alpha stage product.
