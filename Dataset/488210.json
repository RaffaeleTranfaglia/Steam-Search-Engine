There is nothing to this game and there are only around 5 buttons you'll have to ever press.  It's not even bad, it's terrible, tedious, and monotonous. It takes too long to level up even if you're winning every or almost every race. You'd have more fun printing a picture of a car and making engine noises as you move it around your room.",

A gameplay like this was in Race America for NES. But there were oil pits and some bumps on the road. Also it was like a mini-game before the race. Not the actual game, lol.",
