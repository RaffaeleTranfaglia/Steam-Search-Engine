            "review_text": "Totally worth checking, interesting characters and neat story but there is a few things that are pretty disappointing. For one the total amount of time you can really spend to enjoy looking at things is pretty short and the scenes will force you to move from location to location without really giving you a chance to soak in the area and forces you to rail along rather than be interactive, granted that I understand that the general idea is that it's a story based game. (Scary part is, is that you're a silent protagonist who actually doesn't DO ANYTHING which makes me wonder if this is more like a VR movie rather than a game.)  The total time you'll spend in the Mission / demo is roughly less then 10 minutes which includes what you can / can't do in the introduction aka the starting screen.  The rendering isn't smooth and looks actually horrible on the HTC vive as I looked at the comic and it was totally unreadable even when i put my face right into it, which cut down the time i spent in the intro significantly being that the only other thing you can look at really is a hologram and statues.  In the HTC vive, my height positioning is off the ground when in the mission which I didn't notice until after it forces you into the second location. You'll understand what i mean when you try it.  The audio location is pretty bad as if you turn your head and let your left or right ear stay on the character that is talking, it'll cut out in half the headset to 'simulate' sound location which isn't entirely good because it makes me feel deaf and breaks immersion rather then using 360 sound which I've enjoyed in other simulations. (If you really want to enjoy it, just simply look and listen to the characters, they're the most interesting things in the demo)  Besides that it's worth the 10 minutes being that it's free and it's a good introduction into a pretty interesting story line but for what it's worth, It'll need a lot more improvement and i mean alot of improvement to make it worth while to look into the series but I'm actually interested in seeing how this pans out since I actually liked the characters I've seen.  Also on a side note: It states that 'input' Tracked motion controllers are supported but it doesn't, it uses a reticle stuck to your headset to do selections via looking at it, also this seems more like a seated game rather than a standing one so I'm not sure what that's all about.  I kind of wish i could of shaked the guys hand, just saying even if i had to simply look at his hand to change the outcome. A special moment.  (Now for what i wish for:  I wish I could of looked at things, and the character could of explained what those things were which would of made me feel like I was actually in a living/breathing world where the character is actually interacting with me rather then it feel scripted  I wish i could interact with the enviorment even if i can only look at things.  I wish i had more to go on since i can clearly see that this is fleshed out and interesting.)",

            "review_text": "I don't understand the mixed reviews. The 'game' is gorgeous, though it is more a VR film than a game at the moment. I was disappointed when the girl told me not to touch the gun, and then there wasn't a gun I could have touched to begin with, and then the dinosaurs all had them when they [ahem], and I didn't, and then I [sound of vacuum to cover that spoiler]. ;)  It is labeled as a 'story experience', so no misdirection there. I do hope this becomes something more, as it really is something you can show off to friends who'd prefer the story route of VR. No controller support currently, so there's the slight irritation of activating panels by looking at them. But I like this world I was roaming around in.",

Amber kinda looked weird though, her proportions don't work in that sort of rendering enviroment (no idea if i explained what i mean right. maybe i just need to warm up to it) the other grip was the final part when the dinos were firing at the blackblood. there was no dynamic to their pose, it was a straight up cartoony shoot out. kelvin yells, 'scatter' but both stay were they are and just hip fire their weapons. the dramatic dialog was very out of place and did not match their rigid actions.  If those things could be addressed, I would pay for something longer with the same concept.",
