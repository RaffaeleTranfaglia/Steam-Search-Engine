Number of fighters and differents styles fighters are the real plus of this game. Each characters got his/her own style. I said that because of ... you know Ken, Ryu, Gouken/Gouki/Akuma, Dan, Evil Ryu etc You can make real feeling combos and that's make a suitable fighting game.  CONS: I start playing with the Xbox Controler and ... well it's pretty awful BUT after I choose the Mortal Kombat X Fight Pad and that's good and suit for it. Yes the control are still stiff like jumping attack or grabbing the opponent but the fun is there. And every characters got the same fighting control scheme like DOWN FOWARD PUNCH but the martial art moves are all differents.  The developpement team 's still improve the game and I will continue to play it. It's a great hommage for kung fu movies. And that's original And yes take a good controller or learn with the Xbox Controler but not the best choice for fighting game.",

Clunky controls and bad (read old school) graphics are the best part about this homage is the sound and levels. This was made for the very casual fighter. Get it on sale, play for a few hours and reminisce, then go watch Street Fighter or Enter The Dragon.",

All the characters are strongly based on a famous actor/character (Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris, all are included), so if you can tell the name of five Bruce Lee films, you'll love this title.  CONS: A little unpolished, the collision could be better. Sometimes it seems like pro wrestling, one fighter snaps at the air and the other one throws himself to the floor. Hopefully this will be addressed by the devs.   Warning",

            "review_text": "I was a big fan of old school martial arts movies... Bloodsport, Enter the Dragon, The Last Dragon for those that want to mix Kung Fu and break dancing.. which heck if you were alive during the 80's those were the two things which you loved...  This game much like the 80's an acquired taste.. it has some great classic characters.... an amazing sound track and the old grainy look will leave you busting out your breakdancing gear unfortunately the game play seems stuck in 80's right along with all these classic characters.  The game isn't fluid at all, the trailers are downright misleading. You'll never play the game as fluid and smooth as the trailers show. The controls are stiff and slightly unresponsive.. The Hit detection seems to be at best flawed, sometimes you'll see your foot fly through someone face with no dmg... other times you'll hit thin air and see someone fly to the ground like a sack of bricks.. Also the AI is weak, you can win by using the same move or combo of moves over and over again.. Cheese factor is high in this one...  If you want a good compaison think of the Original Mortal Kombat, this game's combat and character stiffness seems nearly identical if not slightly worse.. although button responsiveness MK has a massive leg up. I won't say the game can't improve, but seeing as the Development team removed the Early Access and the last update aside from adding cards to the game was done about 3 months ago I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet the game won't be improved any longer.  This just isn't a game I can recommend with a 9.99 price tag, if you can are a huge 80's kung fu flick type of guy.. it might be worth it just for some kicks and giggles, if you're a fighting game fan, you have far better choices for far cheaper prices..",

Unfortunately, the game itself is not much fun to play. The control of the characters feels awkward and the mechanics are off. Moves sometimes register as hits without actually making contact.  I hate to give bad marks to game that allows you to have a Donnie Yen Vs. Sonny Chiba fight, but I must in this case.",
