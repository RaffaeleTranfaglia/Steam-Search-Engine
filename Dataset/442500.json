            "review_text": "I did enjoy this game, I'm not sure if it will warrant more playthroughs in it's current state, but I did get my money's worth.  You are bound to get a few false starts while you figure out the mechanics of the game, and there isn't a single sure path to success. Overcoming that early challenge feels very rewarding. Don't be fooled though, this is a text and numbers management game.  Your starting choice of perk is extremely strong, and makes the early game very enjoyable and challenging. Once you get through the first couple cities though, I found that the game became a steamroll. The occassional death of one of my gladiators did little to slow down the momentum that I had started to gain. However, the Gladiator genre is very lacking, and Age of Gladiators is a welcome addition to it.  Pros:  Challenging early game Fun theme Many interesting mechanics Appeals to the business management type  Cons: Easy late game Almost zero visuals Light content outside core mechanics   My winning strategy and tips (some a little spoilery): 1. Buy a couple gladiators 2. Don't pay them anything 3. Run them into the ground for a few extra bucks. 4. Invest your early perk points into increasing the starting level of new gladiators- new gladiators will be stronger than the survivors of your first batches and opponents pretty quick. 5. Invest early gladiator perk points into being able to wear heavier amor- this will give them a clear advantage over the first few cities. 6. When upgrading your school, turn it into a prison with guards, and continue to treat your gladiators like slaves and not pay them.- No matter how low their morale gets, as long as security is strong they won't escape and nothing bad will happen. 7. Once you have a good system going, invest perk points into the +skill perk for gladiators you plan on keeping around, a decent mid game level 20 gladiator getting +5 extra points every level will be unstoppable by level 40 in the late game. 8. Once you have millions of bucks floating around, no reason not to get a full staff of trainers, medics, and blacksmiths. Make sure your money machine is strong before investing heavily into staff though. 9. A good perk to pick up once you really start rolling with some strong fighters is the one that removes gladiator fatigue, this way you can cycle through a smaller number of gladiators instead of trying to pay for a full stable, and train up some backups to step in when the occassional death happens. This makes having 10+ gladiators irrelevant, as you will rarely need to use any but the first 5. This was the final nail in the coffin in finishing the game once my deaths became very infrequent.  Various other tips- -The starting perk of showman is very strong if you are having trouble in the early game. -There is a perk that reduces wear and tear on weapons, 5 ranks removes wear altogether. When a gladiator dies, you keep their weapon -There is another perk that increases the stats on new weapons in the shop, up to 50% -Blacksmiths increase the effectiveness of your weapons and armor. Damage mitigation on plate can easily reach 65%+ -Combining all of the equipment perks and keeping an eye on the shop you can give you a permanent upgrade even if you get into the habit of losing gladiators. -Most schools before Rome have only one or two strong fighters. it is possible to zerg rush past these gladiators since they still suffer from fatigue and injury the same way your fighters do. Make sure that you have invested into getting fights more often. When you do lose a strong gladiator to an opposing strong fighter, keep pouring it on, there is a good chance that the next time that fighter shows up he will be exhausted or wounded. -Intellegence and HP do not seem worth investing into, finding a smart recruit can be nice, but the level cap of 40 comes quickly in the late game and those are wasted points by max level. -Dexterity is a priority in my early recruits and points. Misses are so common in the early game that just being able to land a hit is a huge advantage. -Once dexterity is decent, focusing on agility or reflexes is strong for being able to dodge yourself. -High strength becomes less necessary if you have focused on upgrading weapons and blacksmiths, but can be useful in the earlier game. -If you are planning on winning the game by being a cool dude, paying your gladiators, freeing them when they start to get a little sad, feeding them well, naming them after your loved ones, and trying to keep them all alive and happy... good luck, because that turns the game into a true challenge.",

            "review_text": "Game concepts are not complicated - get a gladiator with decent stats and make him the best so I wondered how quickly it would get grindy. I think it will, but not as quickly as I first thought. After 3-4 hours, I had understood gameplay and had 3 strong gladiators I thought I just need to repeat this in the next two cities and then I'm at Rome. However, 1 of them unexpectedly lost and was executed by a weaker opponent (RNG has to occur at some point ...). Then another walked out on me (!) because admittedly I hadn't given much care to their living conditions.  That's fine I thought. I still have my best and my matchwinner - and he has 90% chance of not dying if he gets defeated ... but then he wins a fight but gets blinded and so is no longer available. All of a sudden I have no decent gladiators to win any fights and so can't get any money in from big fights as I'll lose them all. Will have to fire staff and build up from scratch again. Trickier than I first thought!  Pros:  - fun spinoff on management games - creative and imaginative application  - admins released helpful update on game 2 weeks ago in response to people's feedback  - cheap.  Cons:   - not especially deep.  - won't be spending 100+ hours on this game unless a couple more updates come in.",

This is the kind of game I've been waiting years for, and I finally have it. Gladiator Management Game. As of now, it takes up 317MB... so there is that too.  Hint: For best results -   high dexterity is the best stat    Trained the greatest Gladiator the world has ever seen. Regulus went 70-0 and made me $1.5 million before losing his first fight to a pleb 10 levels lower. Logically, I had him executed.  Also, there is a fun easter egg in the game.

            "review_text": "Age of Gladiators is a first game from a 1 man development team. Basically it's a spreadsheet management simulator hidden behind an easy to use and clear graphic user interface, and while it can seem simple on the surface, there is a lot of hidden depth when it comes to min/maxing your gladiator's stats to get the best results. Scouting potential new fighters and rival boss stables is essential. Learning what stats have what effects is also important. The first few playthroughs can be brutally difficult until you learn how to manage your budget. In addition to managing your fighters and their development, you also manage their living conditions, hire staff, buy weapons and armor, send gladiators on side quests, manage your expenses between fights, try to increase your reputation to become rich and famous, and that's all before you get to the fights and the gambling! The developer is constantly releasing updates, many suggested by the player base, and what excites me the most is the potential this game has. History and facts could be added via an encylopedia, the fights could move from text based to 3D, your stables could move from sliders to a mini city builder, many more side quests could be added, multi-gladiator fights could be added, creation of gladiator events sponsored by you ... so much potential in either this or the sequel.  The game is not perfect, if you are expecting an action game involving gladitorial combat, this isn't it. It's more like Football Manager for ancient Rome. The learning curve is steep, but once mastered, becomes much easier. However, the game and it's setting is original, it's not expensive even at full price, and can suck you in so that the hours disappear while you have that 'just one more turn.'",

However the game is very deep. You need trainers, doctors,Weapons smiths, recruiters, weapons,armor. Then you need a strategy. How are you going to bring your recruits up to snufff. Fights against animals, or low difficulty gladiator matches. There are many skills each gladiator has. Do you want strong, armored fighters or quick, accurate, fighters who many not do alot of damage each hit, but will attack 2-3 times more than the bruisers. Its all up to you. You can be a kind Master , who treats his men well, gives them good food and shelter{ which can get very expensive, or go cheap and give them the bare minimum. You decide how much prize money to share with them. You can make side bets on or against your fighter. There are positives and negatives to each choice.. The only negative I have is a better graphic depiction of the battles themselves. It would really pull in more people, because once the battleb starts you hve no control over the fight itself. You train, arm, feed and encourage threm, but the fighting is out of your hands.....As it should be. I cheer on my fighter and do alot of swearing, LOL. Well worth the price you pay. Pick the game up. you wont be disappointed            ",

Maybe a troghy room and a way to mark people who have previously killed one of your gladiators for some revenge to give a bit of easy depth.  But overall a nice change of pace game.",

            "review_text": "Age of Gladiators is not a tactical fighting game, but rather a front office gladiatorial business sim. And it's more interesting because of that. It reminds me of Qvadriga.  You have to provide various levels of food, housing, weapons, armor, security and such for your stable. You hire staff (trainers, scouts, physickers, blacksmiths) and buy fighters, who you then have to train and equip with weapons they use. You also have to deal with your rivals, with random events, and all sorts of intrigue and competitive stuff. Fighters have many stats, which can be affected by training, fight experience, illness, morale, and likely other things I have not found yet.   Each turn is one day of training or recovery for your fighters. Scouts turn in new reports a few times a month, and you can spend money to sponsor events, raising the chance of arranged fights for your guys (and gals) occurring (the dev is going to put female fighters in, I think). You can bet on either fighter in a match, and you can choose how much of your purse to share with your fighter. You can even free your fighters over time. And each day, you bleed money to maintain all your property and endeavors...  Fights are resolved textually, on a turn-based system. You can skip to the result; you have no influence on the fight beyond the skill of your coaches. It's still nerve-wracking.  And it's fun!",

It's suuuper early days for this, but once we get lions/tigers/bears/ohmy! (next update!) and team fights, this will very much hit the spot.  It's kinda like the old Gladiator game from Avalon Hill, if you made the stable part much more interesting and the actual gladiating much quicker.   I love it!",

This could have been so much fun if some of the mechanics have been implemented with more depth. In my current playthrough, I just recruit high level gladiators due to the perks I put points on, wait for my high stat trainers to feed them with XP to get them to lv 40, and put them on fight events to rack up wins and kills. Also, leveling up gladiators are not rewarding and offers little to no choices. I got most of my gladiators exactly the same set of perks because why not? Giving gladiators different perks and skills are not interesting, because once the fight starts I have no say in whatever happens, and after some lines of texts the outcome shows who won and who's dead. I deleted the game after winning some hundred fights straight.  I'm really disappointed . This game had a lot of potential.... But in the current state, it feels like a glorified web-based flash game...
