            "review_text": "This game could have turned out a small gem, but it's not.  - the graphics are lovely, kudos to the artistic team (the forest? wow! charcaters and some items models may use some work though) - the music is also quite good and fits the game perfectly - I also liked the cameras despite the disadvantages they may give you while trying to jump to your next desination (but overall they are ok) - monologues and dialogues in rhymes are a nice touch - red hood voice is also nice  And that's all about the pros of this game. - the story is so so...mediocre at best. It could have been good if it had more depth. - the combat system is totally forgettable - the 2 boss fights are a total nightmare even at easy difficulty (yeah i started with normal and since the combat was meaningless I set it to easy just to make it faster) - health system is a joke. You insta-die touching\\hitting (broken) hit-boxes or you die in combat while still having some health (guess health calculation is not accurate) - checkpoint system is annoying as hell (many of them just in front of cutscenes or 'tutorials' that each time you have to skip IF you can. And yes: you will die a lot and thus you'll hate those cutscenes\\pauses) - ending is    a 'to be continued',REALLY? Really.   - your abilities are a joke as well. You even learn a new one during the fight with the last boss. And I didn't even use it because it's bad. - invisible walls where you expect to be able to jump (oh..guess what? you probably will die)  So... is this game a total disaster? Nope. The game is actually a pretty short platform with a unique style. I would have preferred an adventure direction instead of the combat.  Is the game finished? Nope. - the game is also very unpolished  Dlc with a decent endig or expansion may be coming; at least I hope they make it free.  Is it worth the price of 9,99? this is very personal. For me it is not; I played much better games at that price. Luckily for me i got this for 2,50 VAT included from a reseller site. That's a very small amount, but compared to other games it offers much more less as value: but the game is from a new indie company so I'm happy to have purchased it and I hope GRIN will deliver more games.  Still, when it is on sale, buy it if you are interested. It's an OK game after all.",

            "review_text": "8.5 / 10 - Beautiful game.  In the first place before even starting the game, it reminded me (for obvious reasons) of Alice. So i kinda end up compering both games. To be said, i really (!) loved Alice: Madness Returns. And thus been said, i can say that Woolfe is a really awesome game.  The  LOOK  of it is very beautiful, the effects are smooth. When ever you just stop, you get the feeling you're looking at an artwork. The  GAMEPLAY  in a nutshell is buttonsmash-action mixed with some basic plattforming. And it turns out to be really fun! The game feels very smooth. As soon as you start you just get into a flow and run through the game like you were born to do so. The plattforming part is not that challenging, but also not boring. The dev's managed to get a really balanced mix between action and plattforming. The  COMBAT  is not really difficult. You have 2 basic attacks, 1 dodgemove and 4 combo-moves. Those combined the combat feels very smooth and is fun, but it's not really challenging. Once you understand your moves and the enemy-behavior you can outplay very easy every single enemy in the game, without any problems. The  STORYLINE  is exciting and a bit different from the fairy tales, but you'll have to find out more about it yourself!  All in all i can say i really enjoyed this game. Woolfe gets points deduction from me, because: (1) there are still some bugs, which disrupts the game flow; (2) even on hard difficulty the game isn't really much harder; and (3) you'll have this game finished pretty fast. So in my opinion you will get a very cool game, with high quality content, for just 10 bucks. There are way more expensive games, with way less content, and way less quality. I had a lot of fun playing this game and really enjoyed it, and i am really looking forward to get the next part of this series!  Buy recommendation for genre fans - hardcore plattformers and story enthusiast might want to wait till its on sale.",

            "review_text": "1.Visually this game looks pretty good. It has a very brightly lit atmosphere like Trine. Major annoyance however, is the absence of mouth movements to the dialogue. I mean even basic lip syncing would've been acceptable.. 2.It's not necessarily challenging in my 2 hours of play so far, but you CAN screw yourself over and be forced to restart a chapter/from checkpoint.  3.The combat is incredibly basic. Hack and slash to the extreme. No block mechanic unfortunately. Fighting large groups of enemies may not always be a good idea. 4. The story seems fairly interesting, but it's hardly gripping. I'm not on the edge of my seat trying to plow my way through the platforming to find out what's going on. 5. Collectibles are pretty easy to find. They unlock diary entries. I haven't looked at them yet, so I can't tell you if they're really beneficial or interesting.  6. You're more likely to die from a mistake or misstep than anything else.  7. Is it worth $9.99? It might be more of a $4.99 game to be honest, but maybe more gameplay will change my mind. 8. Either way you should give it a shot when the price is right for you.   It's a rather fun puzzling platformer when you just want to play something for a bit and move on.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game, because it seemed to have a number of concepts that I'm really interested in. However, it fell flat in enjoyment level for me simply because there were way too many problems that I had with it and not enough areas that I found good. I started out being really into it, but quickly started wishing for the game to be finished already (especially considering that I was already aware of how short it is). Overall, I think the game could have been really amazing but I don't recommend it as it is, and as it will remain because of the series being dropped.  PROS - The visuals were great and most definitely the best part of the game, particularly the world design. I think that this part of the game was what was worked on the most and I can obviously appreciate how beautiful it is because, hey, who doesn't want the game they're playing to look nice? The forest area with the gravity defiance was really pretty and I almost wish that that could have been explored more (with better platforming, at least). - I liked Red's character design a lot for the most part, truthfully I like concept art of her more than her in-game model but that's mentioned more in the cons section. - Interesting use of rhyming dialogue that fit the fairy tale genre. - Red's voice acting was satisfactory, I mostly just liked the way her voice sounded rather than how it was in general.  CONS - Regarding Red's design, I feel as if she would have looked a whole lot better without the scarily big eyes that didn't feel like they were shaded properly (the whites of her eyes were rather freaky, it felt like her eyes were designed normally and then just blown up way too much for the final product). - The rhyming dialogue was sometimes forced and felt off, definitely wasn't very immersive after a while of playing the game. - The landscape depth or view and perspective was really disorienting for me. Often times it felt hard to tell what was an area I could interact with and what wasn't, and there were several instances where I believed I was landing on a platform but apparently wasn't simply from the camera angle being off. This fact could be rather frustrating especially alongside the fact that there were many instant death interactions that you had no warning of whatsoever. Needless to say, I died a lot simply from the platforming itself. - The combat was clunky and at times felt unfair. There were a number of attacks from enemies that killed me in one hit out of the blue, but even aside from that it could be hard to manage attacking and dodging safely because your weapon accuracy and the hitboxes of your attacks and the bodies of your enemies seem to bug out a lot. The special attacks you get throughout the game are highly unreliable as they miss more often than not, and you're not given much direction as to their usage being limited by whatever 'mana/energy' concept was used in the game. - The story was interesting, but felt so rushed. It really feels like the game could have been a whole lot longer simply from having the story drawn out so that players could experience more of it. I understand that this was only the first part of the game that was planned out to be a series, but regardless I think there could have been more added for the aspects of the plot that were developed.",

Cons: - battle system and damage feedback could be moch more directly - blind jumps / sometimes it's hard to guess were you will land - evil heroes are mute / granny get a voice actor so why don't the bad guys? - physics could be better - dialogues/story is' okay' . However is just don't feels very authentic sometimes.   Voice actor of Red sometimes overreaches her emotions...  I just don't get rid of the thought that they released this game to early. The game is also very short, but if you like you can get it on sale. However i also think it just don't needed to be that long because it's still a simple plattformer.

Pros:  + the visuals are great, I really liked the look of the game + it runs very smooth + some of the actual plattforming is good + sound is fitting and nice + controller support  Cons:  - I found the story to be a bit too bland - trial and error parts, where deaths cant be avoided. This was very annoying. - Checkpoints are there but way too far away, respawning every enemy. There is even a place where enemies are right at a checkpoint and yes, they do respawn and will attack you right the second that you spawn. - the fighting mechanics are awful. This game would have been much better without the combat at all. The fighting is the absolut worst part of the game. It seems as it was thrown in there at the last second - difficulty settings are lazy. I hate when developers do this stuff. The enemies get more health and damage. Thats it. Combined with a broken fighting system its almost impossible on the highest difficulty, unless you wanna force yourself through a very time consuming, untested difficulty setting. - the game can be beaten in under 2 hours, there is almost no content here. - its an episodic game, that will never be concluded, but worst of all, its not even declared as one on the shop page. Which in my book is a scam.  - the pricetagg is way too high. If you are curious, get it in a bundle sooner or later.  Disappointing in a lot of aspects, I wouldnt recommend it at all.",

Woolfe is Red Riding Hood and American McGee put into a blender and poured out. The visuals, dark story and platforming all come from Alice. The platforming is okay, but can be kind of sluggish. The game has very good voice acting from the voice actress.  My main problem with this game is the Axe. It is the worst weapon I ever played with in a hack and slash platformer. It is incredibly weak and there is something that is sluggish about Red’s Axe. Red can be also very annoying because the writing is horrible. Who thought the tag line was a good idea to say aloud in the game, not once, but twice. Also the games director did not know when to start or end a voice over.  I hope the developer’s address the issues in the sequel, but in the end buy this game at your own risk. ",

While not as dark and twisted as 'American McGee's Alice' this game does sport a lot of dark and beautiful backdrops that our heroine Red Riding Hood traverses to and from during her journey of revenge.  That said, the game is rough around the edges; combat is passable, but very rough. The platforming feels good, nothing amazing; but it works well. In spite of that, I found the game to be very fun. If you're a fan of the Little Red Riding Hood mythos, as well as a fan of American McGee's Alice, then this game is worth your time. I look forward to playing future episodes of this game.",

Terrible platforming, with no way to find out what is a platform and what is a decoration, but fall to your death several times. Countless bugs and game design flaws, when sometimes you don't even know what killed you. On the other hand, visuals are beautiful, and the narration matches it. The games makes up for crappy gameplay with really good aesthetics. And it's very short, beatable in two or three hours, which makes the gameplay's ordeal bearable.  All in all, it's a good game for a small indie team with a tiny budget, and for you to spend an evening. It's an eye candy that doesn't overstay its velcome, worth the little money it costs, and worth supporting: the game shows its developers' potential. If they survive to make another game, I bet it will be much better.",

            "review_text": "Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is side-scrolling platform hack &amp; slash game, developed and published by the Belgian ind(i)ependent studio GriN. In this game you play as the grown up Red Riding Hood to avenge the one who is responsible for the death of her mom, and dad who died in an work accident in the factory of B.B. Woolfe. Red doesn't believe it was an work accident and starts her own investigation. Armed with an axe, a red cape and a total overdose of anger, Red Riding Hood goes lone-wolf on an adventure from the dark Victorian city to the depths of the sewers and further into the woods to grandma's treehouse.  During the game, Red Riding Hood moves through the levels by jumping from one platform to another in order to make it to the end of each level. During the journey, Red collects grandma's breadbaskets which acts as a checkpoint, demolish crates to collect Woolfe's diaries, fight against foes such as the tin soldiers who occupy the city under the command of B.B Woolfe, rats of the sewers, the pixies from the forest and has to solve puzzles who block her path.  The game has amazing artwork, nice voice casting and great music!  I can't say the same for the combat system which felt quite clunky to me but it didn't bother me that much in the overall picture.  Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is a very short game and was supposed to be an episodic game. Unfortunately the studio GriN went bankrupt at the end of 2015 and canceled the development Woolfe Volume 2.  Not long after that, Rebellion acquired the title and its publisher rights and Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is in their hands since then.  If the game is on sale and you are looking for a short fairylike platformer with a dark favlor, then I do recommend this game!  Don't put the bar of expectations too high for this game because it's not a final game but an episode. ",

            "review_text": "I'm hesitantly recommending this game with a few caveats. I have several problems with it the first being it's insanely SHORT!! I was actually shocked when it ended as I thought it was only long enough to qualify as like maybe the first chapter or two of a game. I think I finished it in about 2 hours and I don't really call that a game I call that a game session. On top of that it made you think at the end that it really was going to be longer after the big battle but then did the old 'to be continued' thing. ALWAYS IRRITATING!  Gameplay issues:  For me the biggest game play issue is that it is often very hard to tell where the character is in the 2.5D space. I think it would have helped a lot if she had some kind of projected beam, below her feet, so that you could tell if she was over a platform or in mid air. I'm all for things being difficult but it stops being fun if you have to repeat the same things over and over again just because you can't tell where she is in space.  Another issue is that it is hard to know where you are suppose to be going quite a bit of the time. For example at one point there was an after death load spot and the character is facing right when loaded but is suppose to be going left. It's also odd that when the game first started off it would show kinda where you needed to go in a camera pan when you enter a new place (think how the Prince of Persia games would do a camera path follow when you entered a new area). But it stopped doing this pan about half way through the game making it very confusing in terms of knowing where the hell you were suppose to be going.  Another odd issue is that there are big fights that you can skip the intro cut scenes but not the intermediate cut scenes. The last fight with the Piper is so annoying because you can only skip part of the cut scene and have to watch the other part every single time. &gt;_&lt; Since Miss Red doesn't have a BLOCKING move in her repertoire it can take several tries before you figure out how to fight certain enemies making for a LOT of unskipable cut scenes.  As I sit here thinking about the game I wonder if it was originally planed to be longer and was truncated for some reason (money!). It makes no sense to me that they would introduce new abilities and attacks at the end of the game. You get a new attack in the forest and I swear there are only about 10 enemies left in the game you can use it on (effectively). Another neat ability the SLIDE isn't even introduced to you, I just happened upon it. (On the xbox gamepad you can slide when using RT for run and you press and hold LT to slide. Works well for the logs you have to go under!)  (The good?) The game is really quite lovely and had a very nice ominous feel to it. The main character is cool and I love her voice over during gameplay rather than only keeping it to cut scenes. She says some really funny things too. I also really like her exaggerated animation. It makes her and the game much more interesting and inviting. Some of the puzzles are fairly interesting. The fighting style is unique and if the game were longer would be more enjoyable.   If fixed, many of my problems with the game would most likely make it much shorter in terms of time spent playing. This makes me think that these issues were left in for that very reason which I don't think is a GOOD reason.  I really hope that if they continue with this story that they just ADD to this game and not make you buy a whole new one. This would be a great game for DLC chapters!!!  (Personal side note) The sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who decided to put that damn puddle of water in the last fight arena needs to be taken out and fed to wolves!!",

            "review_text": "Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries   Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries is an indie 2.5D platformer that takes upon the challenge of gritty rebooting the childhood story of red riding hood, where the game takes on a darker look on this fairy tale.  Now this is not a new type of game idea, it has the utmost feel of the previously made game Alice; the Madness returns, which was developed by American McGee. Where Woolfe is similar to Alice it seems apparent that it has only inherited the flaws, and fallen short of the game it could have been.   The game starts out with the female protagonist perched upon a rooftop looking down upon the broken down city of Ulrica, where she proclaims that “This is no fairy tale, because nothing here is fair”. Which puts on the more morbid tone of the game which where she continues to go on and tell you about the suspicious death of her father, who she believes the culprit is the Big bad wolf of the story; B.B.Wolfe. Now that her mother has gone missing to Red takes it upon herself to go to the ghost city of Ulrica and sniff out the truth. The game gives you about an hour and a half of gameplay, which includes Red running through the city of Ulrica swinging her axe fighting off groups of mechanical toy-like soldiers. While running back and forth through the level solving simplistic problems. There are 3 sections in the game where you are forced to walk around the scenery and relive the memories/ backstory of this twisted tale, which is a good addition to the game. Without these levels there is little lore to go around, there are little emblems that are scattered through out the few levels of this game, each one showing a little bit of backstory or art. As the game progresses i would rather have seen a leveling up method where you can choose the abilities that your axe wielding character possesses rather than just be given almost useless ones, leaving me to be just spamming the ‘Light attack’ which more than likely won't hit the target that you are aiming for.   There are good qualities about this game with in the sea of head pounding flaws, while playing through the game you do come across some undoubtedly beautiful scenery, from the slums of Ulrica to the (what seems to be) radiation polluted forest with little islands of land floating in the air. Another interesting feature within the game is, when you kill a soldier a little box comes up with the deceased name. Now i'm not to sure about this aspect, it feels like the developer spent time adding things into the game that didn't necessarily need to be in it, which time spent could have been used to refine the actual game play.  Even with all the slander in this review i still think that this game is worth playing even with numerous flaws. ",

Bugs: Camera angel gliches up and down fast sometimes, hitting on mobs it doesn't register all the hits, if you try to jump on a wall where you should be able to hang, it doesn't always work. You will encounter glitches.  Gameplay: short game, boring story and not good at all.   Graphics: good.  Grade: 3/10.  Stay away, this company even declared bancrupt becuase of this game, you do the math.",

            "review_text": "Worst platformer ever....  I was so excited for this game, truly I was, I remember watching the development video's and thinking what an incredible story this game would have, however what was delivered was... underwhelming.  For starters the kind of hell I had to go through to even run the game was complete and utter horror, who on earth programs a game that cannot determine the screen resolution of the computer before attempting to run? I had to tweak 2 different files to finally get this game to run and even still it stuttered a lot.  Getting into gameplay there were a few things that were just irksome.  One, no camera control. I honestly felt like I was playing Castlevania LoS again... and that wasn't a fun experience, the auto-panning of the camera made me misjudge several jumps, ones that counted.  Two, absolutely dreadful platforming. Ok I get it, this was a lower budget piece, but instead of putting the extra bit of shine on the cutscene's or spending quite as much on the music and title screen it might have been better to invest a bit more into the programming of the platforming. The sewer section was god awful, I actually got the 'fail death' achievement that some developers throw in for a good laugh. I didn't find it funny. In fact is really made me quite angry. There was a very precise timed jump that had to be done and I would fail mid way or get through it and not be able to move down to the lower ledge, it was infuriating, I think I actually glitched across it by smashing my keyboard, though that did nothing about the breakable platform that gave no warning before falling from below me.  I'm sorry, it looked pretty, but I just can't recommend this game unless you want to torture yourself.  Now then I'm off to have a strong drink because after trying to play this game I need it.",

            "review_text": "I played through this game, all 2 hours of it. I was a Kickstarter backer and this really was a big disappointement. I backed it because of the art design and its true that the game has plenty of style and looks really pretty but thats the only thing thats fully realised. Everything else in this game feels half-baked. The controls are unresponsive and tend to result in cheap and aggravating deaths. The fighting is boring and, despite trying to have variety, is shallow as hell. Plus the enemies aren't really helping since there are only 4 different types (not including bosses of which there are 2). The writing is also really bad and the narration is... no comment. I don't think this would be as bigger problem if the game didn't clearly think that it was cool and badass. I just found it gratting as hell. Really frustrating because it feels that it could have been really good but with all its rough edges and its 10$ price it really isn't worth it. Stay clear of this one or pick it up in a bundle. ",

I traded 1 CS:GO Key for this game, thus my expense was only $2.49. However I feel as though it would be well worth a $4.99 price tag. Its short sure, but not every game has to be an epic tale. The story is great and the bit of lore that it creates. It leaves its self open to sequels that may or may not ever happen. I didn't even know about this game until Rebellion bought the rights, and am now hoping that they work to bring this story to its completion.  Ultimately I'm happy with this game, and look forward to its future with Rebellion in hopes of furthering the journey.",
