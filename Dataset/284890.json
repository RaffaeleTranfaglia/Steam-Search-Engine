            "review_text": "When you're asked to investigate a boat that came back without its crew, you discover that someone killed them and is trying to trap you. However, a ghost appears to you and guide you to find the truth behind her family death and the disappearance of many sailors...  Left in the Dark: No One on Board is another Artifex Mundi's game, though they're only the publisher here. However, as you're used to me and many others saying it, Artifex Mundi is always choosing good games. Left in the Dark isn't perhaps the best title out there but it's still very enjoyable.  While the story has a correct plot, it's just a shame that everything is chaotic. Indeed, you're first investigating murders before having a ghost guiding you to the culprit and even discover that people thought dead are alive. I liked however the fact that it's a woman being the detective, in a time where I'm pretty sure it was though to be an active woman (it's maybe the 19th century but women were more seen as wives and mothers than a real asset for the society).  The gameplay is pretty standard: use items that you find lying around (or hidden somewhere), clear hidden objects scenes and solve puzzles. I must say that while the puzzles are really easy, the hidden objects scenes are a little harder than expected as some of the items aren't really visible and that the translation was sometimes a little bad. As I've said, you're in the 19th century but I don't why I was feeling that some objects were kinda anachronic. The only puzzle that could be a problem is the lockpick one, as you have to put your cursor on the lockpick to make sure it's working, however, the item in itself is moving, so if your cursor is too far, you will have to restart.  The graphics are more than acceptable, though I was under the impression that some of the backgrounds seemed rushed. It's the same feeling as in the hidden objects scenes. The characters aren't really seen, but the look of the detective is really great: somewhere with a steampunk inspiration, very badass.  The soundtrack is good too, so, are the voice actings.  Left in the Dark is a good game, though it's not the best Artifex Mundi, even when it was released. I would recommend to wait for a discount (and Left in the Dark has been often in the situation) or a bundle (it's also often bundled).",

            "review_text": "I realy enjoy HOG because they often have an interesting story and its enjoyable not to be stuck in game. This one is a bit of a disapointment really. This was outsourced and it shows. The Hidden object games are mostly hit and miss. Some of the items are the exact color of background scene making almost mandatory that you click the hint button.   The story isnt that well thought out and what should be a roller coaster ride ends up being a tame story in the end. I did finish the game and was expected you can expect 2 hours out of the game. Its very short. Also you can tell the outsource team was lazy as they have the same HOG scene that you have to do twice with the same object that you didnt click before. Now you have to click on the second set. They also look a little blury as well. Does it really take that much time to make another set of HOG scenes?  The puzzles are boring and mostly trial and error. One of the puzzles involves a family tree no less. I suppose that wouldnt have been bad if they gave you some hint in your diary. I couldnt find it. The price for this is crazy high for 2 hours. Thats $5 dollars an hour. If you can find the game cheap like I did. I paid $2 dollar for this and one other HOG game then its worth it otherwise save your money. Graphics while sparse are not bad and do look very good. Sound effects are also good and the voice of the women is the same that does Nightmare from the deep. A ok game if you can find it cheap otherwise their are much better games out their for the same price.  I own a lot of HOG's on steam and would recommend Abyss: the wraiths of eden. Nightmares from the deep: The sirens call. Nightmare from the deep: The Cursed heart. Clockwork Tales: Of glass and ink. All of these are much better looking and more interesting then this game. Just sayin.",

Very short playthrough, fairly run-of-the-mill puzzles, and a boring story that didn't really feel satisfying or conclusive in any way. I got it 60% off, and I still feel a little bit ripped off.",

            "review_text": "This was my first hidden object game on steam. This is not normally a genre I wouldve played, but I won it from a giveaway, and instead of letting it just gather dust on my account I figured I should play it straight away. Gameplay is pretty straight forward, first playthrough I played on easy, and just rage clicked on everything to find the objects. Second playthrough I played on expert and actually looked. Overall, too easy in my most humble of opinions. This is the first game I've 100 percented on steam, so that should give you an idea of its relative difficulty, especially considering I dont play these kind of games normally. Graphis seem better suited for a mobile game, story is mediocre at best, mechanics, well how do you screw up a point and click, so they get a point for that one.   Overall I'm giving it a 4/10, and thats being generous I think, because I dont like the genre, or at least I did not like this game, I wouldve rated it a 2, but I think my dislike of the genre may be affecting my opinion. So I may try a couple more HOGs before I decide for sure they arent for me. If you are looking for a quick easy 100% this is the game for you. If you want an in depth story, challenging puzzles, then look elsewhere.",

These games are meant to be brief, shallow, fairly easy, cheap, inviting and entertaining... but not actually GOOD. This is my first experience with an Artifex Mundi title and it puts all the rest to shame. The production values at work here are considerably higher than what the other companies churn out and this was the first time that I felt I was playing a HOG that was actually a good GAME, not just a good HOG.
