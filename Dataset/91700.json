            "review_text": "You have to admire a game with ambition. Unfortunately, sometimes, a game shoots for the moon and misses – a game with incredible ambition just may not have the budget or staff to fully realise those ideas, but you have to give credit to a developer for trying something a little different.   E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy does not shoot for the moon. It hammers together a death laser from twigs and spunk and accidently blows up an orphanage. This game was sold to me as “Warhammer 40000 meets Deus Ex”, but really that does not do this game justice. Everything about E.Y.E is completely and irredeemably mad.   Things start as they mean to continue. The game immediately asks you to create a character with a baffling recombinant genetic system – various genes are spliced together to form a statistical framework for your character, with absolutely no indication what the various stats might be used for nor how they’re calculated. This quickly becomes a running theme throughout this game, as you’re dumped into the universe with absolutely no clue what is going on - either in the games utterly labyrinthine underlying system, or in the bonkers story that surrounds it.   You play a cyber-knight wizard from a monastic order of Space Templars – immediately familiar territory for fans of Games Workshop, though there’s definitely an underlying layer of French surrealism that goes beyond the weirdest nonsense dribbled out of Nottingham. From what I can gather from the largely gibberish story, you are trying to topple a poorly defined federation, as well as dealing with a schism in your order which has lead to cyber wizard infighting. You also conveniently have amnesia, or cyberbrain damage, or something, though in a break from tired tradition everyone treats you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ whenever you ask any questions you should blatantly already know.   There’s also monsters that come from, or are maybe made out of something called the meta-streumonic force. This force seems to give you psychic powers (because of course it does), but is otherwise unexplained. It mainly serves to add a bit of enemy variety, though considering how annoying these monsters are to fight, you might wish the developers hadn’t bothered.   E.Y.E. is an RPG/shooter hybrid, one that takes heavy influence from genre luminaries Deus Ex and System Shock 2. The abilities and equipment available to even a starting character is surprisingly vast. In addition to the expected cybernetic upgrades, there are also psychic powers – you begin the game with the ability to clone yourself three times, which in addition to giving the enemies more targets also have an admirable level of firepower, though they appear to have graduated from stormtrooper marksmanship academy. Most characters will choose to specialise as the higher levels of psychic powers, cybernetic upgrades and weapons are only available to characters with an appropriately high stat. Unusually, every stat is useful, and it is quite possible to make a “jack of all trades” character without gimping yourself.   The actual missions are a hectic, sprawling and confused affair. The mission maps are absolutely enormous, and there are multiple ways to complete a mission with various styles that are effective. Combat wise, a character based on hacking and cyberwear might use his cloak to close , drop a drone and hack an enemies brain, whereas a psychic knight might teleport (well, telefrag) about the battlefield cleaving up enemies with the preposterously powerful melee options. Enemies respawn and mill about the place, and unfortunately are ridiculously accurate over long distances – early characters can often find themselves turned into cyber mulch before they even work out where fire is coming from. This can make a sniper weapon even for close range beatsticks an unfortunate necessity.   The ways in which characters can complete objectives are also rather varied – hackers gain a variety of optional shortcuts, and most missions give you two or three ways to deal with a problem, including a diplomatic path. Now would be a suitable time to bring up the game’s dialogue, which is without exception mental. I’m not sure whether it’s a translation issue or the script was just this mad to begin with, but NPCs seem to switch characters multiple times throughout any interaction – a stoic character that starts out your best friend may become incredibly aggressive for no reason, or regress into surfer lingo. That last part is not a joke. In all honesty this just adds to the surreal atmosphere, and whether it was intentional or not it’s certainly entertaining.    What is not entertaining is the way in which this game deals with death. I appreciate that there needs to be a penalty for failure, but this game is needlessly punitive and it very nearly soured me on the whole experience. Every time you die, there’s a chance you will gain a fatal injury – which vary from a minor to an enormous permanent stat decrease. Some of these are the equivalent of losing two or three whole character levels – and considering most people will finish the game at around lv25, this is not a small issue. There is a karma stat that influences the likelihood of these injuries occurring, but I never worked out what influenced it – it seemed to go up and down entirely randomly. A few early mistakes can forever cripple a character, and even with a VERY late game way of removing these injuries it feels like a very poorly thought out mechanic.   However, if you can put up with the rough edges, there’s definitely an intriguing game buried in amongst the madness. You might not love E.Y.E, but you will certainly remember it – and that’s more than can be said for some games with a hundred times its budget.",

            "review_text": "It's hard to know where to start with a game like Divine Cybermancy, a game with more ideas in the first hour than most franchises.  It's a shooter, so conceptually it's pretty simple: you click on things, and those things can generally be trusted to die when you've clicked them enough. But Streum On Studio has so many twists for the tired formula that the end result is barely recognizable, in no particular order: bullet parrying, summoning, real-time hacking, superpowers, non-linear levels, randomized objectives, real-time research, insanity, permanent debuffs, full difficulty control, spellcasting, cyber demons, augmentations, classes, PVP, and of course the old source standby prop killing. I could write a wall of text on any of these, but instead let's take an example. I was going through the campaign co-op with some pals, and at one point we had to seize a Federal scrambler, currently under control of a looter group. Mars was quite the war zone at this point--something we hadn't kit for--so by the time we finally reached the objective we'd lost most of our resurrectors to chopper attacks and were hurting bad. Despite our best efforts, negotiations with the hackers broke down and I had to try to hack it myself, which is fortunate because I'd rolled hacker for this character. It looked like a tough hack, but nothing to worry about. Worst case, the scrambler hacks me and I hack myself free before trying again. It turns out there's worse than being hacked, something I discovered when I failed the attempt and promptly exploded, consuming our last resurrector and putting an end to our comedy of errors. I blamed the party for trying to rush me, but still made a point to invest in my cyber brain more seriously.  As you can see, there's a lot going on in the world of cybermancy; this is both the game's greatest strength and weakness. On the one hand, you can kill people with your healing syringe. On the other hand, you have no way to heal until you figure out the research system and actually get one. The price of depth is complexity, and this has to be the most impenetrable shooter I've ever played. Let's try and break it down: at its most basic level you have a very cyberpunk tactical shooter, think SMOD: Tactical meets Human Revolution. Now add Warhammer type melee weapons with ability to block bullets and complementary magic powers to go fast, summon allies, teleport, and whole lot else. There's also the obligatory cybernetic augmentations to wallhack, godmode, cloak, see sound, etc.   But unlike those games, there's a comprehensive leveling system, which manifests itself in several ways. But before I explain what it is, I should be very clear on what it's  not . It's not WoW/Everquest/Division where the battle is decided from the first moment by who has the bigger numbers. While a higher level confers certain advantages, it's still first and foremost a high-lethality FPS. So what is it? It's three systems working in tandem. First is the generic leveling template: kill and accomplish objectives to get XP to blah blah blah you could finish this in your sleep. Second you have an augment-alike system where you can choose from a selection of cyber limbs to augment for a sum of brouzoufs (currency), improving the related stats along with some more technical benefits. Cyber arms to become stronger, a cyber reflex system to dodge attacks and move/attack faster, a cyber skull to prevent headshots, etc. My personal favorite is cyber legs, which let you go (very) fast and jump higher than most buildings are tall. The third and most interesting system is that of research. Every enemy has a chance of dropping a briefcase, which contains the information for a cryptic research. Research can be started from any time ingame by bringing up the respective menu and paying the brouzouf requirement. The research continues in the background for a set amount of time depending on how many brouzoufs were committed, and when it completes unlocks a thing. The research is system is intentionally quite opaque: researches don't have explanatory names or descriptions and it's impossible to know what benefits they'll confer until  after  the research completes. Some research also requires other researches finished as a prerequisite, and the best researches have many such prerequisites. It's a great system, one that works exceedingly well to reinforce the game's mystery, something this game has in spades but more on that later.  Take all this and drop it in huge, non-linear maps. Each map can be explored in its entirety from the start and enemies' spawn depends on your location. This is great because it adds significantly the dynamism of the levels and with it the replay value, perhaps Cybermancy's single strongest point. Every level can be replayed as a side mission, but instead with randomized objectives so that each play is its own unique experience. Add to this a fairly granular difficulty control and you have the chocolate to the maps' peanut butter. Namely respawn rates, reaction time, sight and sound detection, and accuracy can be configured. It's not great, but it's leagues above most of its competitors, the sad state of affairs that is. The downside is that there aren't that many levels in the game proper, about a dozen or so total. This wouldn't be a problem--the game supports custom levels--but for whatever reason the mapping community hasn't stepped up. So while the replayability is remarkably high, but you can expect to replay the same maps quite a few times. Again not as good as it could be, but better than the overwhelming majority of AAA releases.  Now If you've heard just one thing about this game, it's probably that it's bat-ｓｈｉｔ insane. Indeed this is undoubtedly the single strangest game I've seen since LSD Dream Simulator, yet here it adds immeasurably to the charm of the game. You're dropped unceremoniously in the middle of the action, left to pick up the pieces and figure out what's going on. The game seems to delight in your confusion and very pointedly goes out of its way to never really explain what's going on. You'd think that a game being intentionally obtuse would be a major point of criticism, but honestly I quite like it. It lends the whole thing a very alien, almost dreamlike quality that works exceedingly well in context. I'd love to say more, but we're venturing awful close to spoiler territory as is. Suffice to say it's half-past the future and you're fighting the man in a cyberpunk dystopia that spans the stars and if you want anymore than that you'll have to beat it out of me.  Like all decent cyberpunk games, Cybermancy makes an attempt at world-building and while I want to say the results are hit-and-miss, that's really not accurate. It's more like hit-and-didn't-shoot-out-of-budget. It's pretty evident Streum On wanted to make a huge living world but they ran out of money long before they could deliver. On the one hand, the maps are all gorgeous and bursting with personality in their architecture and such-like design, but on the other hand they're confusing ghost towns. About the only NPCs that aren't enemies are quest givers/targets, there's almost no obligatory background reading to be found, and numerous maps have strange and strangely empty dead ends that seem to exist as little more than monuments to cut maps. To its credit it's something I never really notice while I'm killing feds, but there is still a very palpable  lack .  In summary, Divine Cybermancy is one of the strangest games I've ever played. While that alone should be enough to recommend it, the excellent co-op tactical shooter, leveling system, replayability and sheer mind-numbing depth are more than enough to justify its purchase. The insanity is just the cherry on top. The game is far stronger in co-op than single-player, so bring a couple friends along for the ride.  And  always  check your legs before moving out.",

It took me quite awhile to understand the basics of the game. Any ailiments you encounter remember to press C, it is a life saver.  The game is set in a futuristic cyberpunk world, with some very impressive levels, Great care and love was put into this games setting. Half of the time playing I would set there being in awe, the city levels in particular are gorgeous.  The gameplay itself is where the game really shines, nothing is more satisfying than cutting an enemy with a sword only for them to explode into pieces. Any enemy you killed gains you brouzoufs, which can be used for different upgrades or can be used for research to increase your stats.  One of my main gripe is the hacking part of the game, nothing about it was enjoyable which can lead to some frustrating encounters. If you failing hacking your character can be killed, so you have to watch your hp all the time.   If you can look past some of it's problem, you've got a real hidden gem on your hands.",

            "review_text": "When I first read the reviews for this game, I assumed I would end up either playing a barely coherent, glitchy mess that one can only squeeze a mote of enjoyment from due to its inherent jank, or I'd get a barely coherent but functioning game that gets a passing grade only because of how much effort went into it.  Neither of these scenarios ended up being the case. What $2.50 bought me is one of the strangest, deepest FPS RPG hybrids I've ever played, and I've only put 15 hours into it so far. I've dug up inches of dirt in the face of a mountain. On some level, I expected a Deus Ex like experience, and on some level, I got that. I also got Half Life, Ghost in the Shell, Warhammer 40k, and the ocassional feeling of Goldeneye, all while on what seems to be a quest to reach nirvana. This game is everywhere, and somehow it works. There's almost nothing I can say that hasn't been said before.   The story isn't even something I can get into. Without a doubt, everything about this game is something that feels rewarding when the player discovers it, and that's just it - the player has to discover everything. If you came here looking for a game that tells you a story, you've come to the wrong place. You have to beg this game to give you its story, and when it does, it'll give it to you in the form of legends, hearsay, and double talk. The sense things make is the sense you give to it.   The enemy AI is surprisingly intelligent and offers up a challenge not in terms of firepower, but actually acting like humans would in a real firefight. They take meaningful cover and fire back aiming to kill. Think you're about to sneak past someone? You better have found a way to be invisible and make not a sound, or else someone is giong to notice you. Likewise, your AI allies don't suddenly become bumbling morons, but can quickly end up taking out just as many or more enemies than you. Sprinkle friendly fire on top and suddenly everything feels very hectic and realistic.   That's something that really sticks out to me - despite the subject matter, everything feels strangely realistic, while also staying firmly in the uncanny valley. The levels are massive and sparsely populated, but filled in from corner to corner. That being said, it still lacks something... even though it's gritty and grungy and obviously lived in, it doesn't feel 'alive'. There have been instances where I wanted to stop playing the game because things were getting just a little too uncanny, like the worlds in an N64 game - that kind of feeling. The very dated and strange looking NPC models don't do much to take away from that, but it almost feels like the surrealism is intentional.   And did I say the levels are massive? Supermassive might be a proper term for it. There's FPS games that lead you down a hallway, and there's FPS games with multiple hallways, and then there's E.Y.E. There's what feels like miles of terrain that go almost entirely unused, or connect actually useful areas of a map to each other, adding to the realistic feel, even if it sacrifices convenience in most areas. The best I can equate it to is like going to Wal-Mart to buy bread, and then walking to the tire section. Duh, nothing you came for is going to be there, but there's something nice about knowing that the area is fleshed out enough to have that tire section.  And hey, the more you discover, and the longer you play, the more you'll be looking everywhere but the bread aisle for the bread you so desperately want. You'll make visits to electronics and family planning, hoping for the day that you may find the special bread that they only stock in those departments.",

            "review_text": "E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is unlike anything you will ever play. Despite my relatively short playtime, it's one of the most memorable games I've played in a long, long time.  E.Y.E. has fantastic world design, extreme depth in its mechanics, and extremely well done core game mechanics, but it's also user-unfriendly, unpolished, and some of the text appears to be some sort of almost-English language. It has more quality content than most games on the market, even full-priced $60 games, but for nearly every good piece of content in the game, there's some factor that just makes you scratch your head.  Both as a shooter and as an RPG, E.Y.E. have a very well-designed core. It allows you to build any kind of character, from a high-tech, heavily augmented super-hacker to a nimble assassin, a cloaked sniper to a heavily-armored living tank, from a berserker wielding explosive katanas to a psychokinetic mage who can telefrag people at will while your clones distract enemies. And each of these builds, and all the builds in-between, can be tuned and tweaked to your liking.  There are no class limitations or restrictions, so long as you can plan your stats for what you want to use. These classes are defined by your stats you gain by leveling up, your research you commit to with items you find in the field, and your cybernetic augments that you graft onto yourself as you progress through the game.  However, despite the fundamentals of this system being brilliantly done, in practice, there are some builds which are far less practical than others. While being a mind-hacker or psionic mastermind may be very appealing, they are ultimately far less practical than a simple soldier with good guns, or a melee fighter with enough accuracy for an anti-armor handcannon. Fortunately, playing E.Y.E. as purely a shooter, with no bells and whistles attached, is still a great time, but this may disappoint players that were hoping to jump into a first run with one of these builds.  More straightforward builds will lead to a better experience for two reasons: difficulty of use, and utter non-information on the complex mechanics of certain builds. The difficulty comes from some builds giving you limited to no ability to directly fight enemies, leaving you with a lack of XP sources to improve yourself further. This is particularly egregious with hacking, as hacking an enemy takes longer, is less effective, and grants lower XP, and gives less money than just shooting the enemy in the first place would. And the greatest shame here is that almost every build in E.Y.E. is an absolute blast to play; it's a ton of fun. Some builds just don't give you the resources you need to reasonably progress like others do.  The other problem with certain builds is that they aren't well explained. The first sign of this problem comes in the form of a tutorial system that's better off ignored with how poorly implemented it is. The in-game tutorial shows you how to run, jump, crawl, climb ladders, etc., all things you should already know. But the fine details are left to videos in a menu. The predominant limitation, however, comes from extremely vague descriptions of items and abilities, leaving you to occasionally guess at what things do. When fundamental, build-defining skills can't be identified without being told, there's a serious problem. Fortunately, many of these issues are front-loaded, and after a couple of hours, explanation issues taper down to a tolerable level.  Speaking of incomprehensible content, the Research in this game is more of a crapshoot than anything if you don't look up a guide. Without researching it ahead of time, I couldn't tell you what my reward was for researching 'UbiCosif Substance', or 'Alpha Bio Optical Connex'. According to tech trees, some of the research  actually does nothing .   ================================  So far, this review sounds pretty harsh. I mean, it must seem odd that I'm recommending a game with such glaring issues, right?  Well, the pros, in my opinion, outstrip the cons.  The world and levels are wonderfully crafted, with obvious attention to detail being put into the atmosphere of the world. The levels are extremely large, allow you to approach objectives in any way you can imagine, and are very non-linear, with each zone feeling more like a mini-sandbox than a mission in a campaign. And it accomplishes this with completely procedural enemy placements, and occasionally with procedural objectives, and it  works  so well.  The atmosphere is spot-on, with the entire world being filled with cybertech and dripping in environmental storytelling. In fact, the environments tell better stories most of the time than the actual story. While the graphics are somewhat dated, the designs are wonderful, and the game stands up in its own gritty, dystopian sort of way.  The gunplay is also some of the best the Source engine has to offer, with every weapon giving just the right amount of feedback. The sounds for each one are unique and have fantastic bass and reverb, with the gunfire being just as deadly as the sounds would entail. Additionally, there's variety without excess, and each weapon ends up feeling unique, like there's a role for everything you could take with you.  Melee weapons are equally satisfying, and a nimble brawler can be just as entertaining, sidestepping blows and covering space rapidly to slash targets with dual katanas, or chopping up crowds with a sword that makes people explode. Even magic powers feel great to use, with skills that make enemies violently explode into blood fonts, or even the power to clone yourself, all backed up by equally great sound design. Even the aforementioned hacker can be engrossing in its own way, with a few well-placed hacks driving enemy squads into two warring halves while you simply watch from afar. And the hacking is very fun, and an example of a minigame done VERY right, with some strategy and quick thinking required to break enemy defenses.  The A.I. is also better than people give it credit for; on higher difficulties, enemies will be aggressive, flush you out with grenades, try to surround you, or even try baiting you into a bad position. It's not excellent, but when you crank the spawn waves to 'Invasion' level, these small additions can really have an impact on your survival in the long-term.  ================================  While the world is well designed, the plot is really fairly hit-or-miss. Some people love it, some hate it. It's very much a cliche storm, but it's so cheesy that I personally can't help but love it. You're part of a militarized secret society in a civil war fighting a totalitarian government, demonic supermonsters based on humanity's dark sides, and roaming bands of looters. There's at least three MacGuffins and up to five betrayals possible in E.Y.E.'s story, and it's fantastically stupid.  On top of that, the localization for this game is hilariously bad. While there is a fan patch that un-Engrishes the game, the stilted, strange speech and swear-storms the characters get into could add to or detract from the experience. For the most part, this doesn't interfere with gameplay, so I won't list this as a negative; it's more up to preference. In my first run, I was only stuck one one objective to 'Realign the Parabola', and even that was solvable within a few minutes. For those that don't like the transration, fortunately, everyone speaks in a made-up verbal language that works well with the environment, so thankfully, nobody's vocalizing the dreadful text.

Much has been said so I will just list some things I find worth mentioning to give you an impression:  - Art/Style: Set in a Sci-Fi-dystopian world with an asian touch - it feels like a...well...futuristic, steampunk chinatown universe at times. - Music: What shall I say, this creates atmosphere at it's best. - Gameplay: Confusing right from the beginning as it's a blend of FPS with deep RPG-similar mechanics. Your possibilities range from Research, to classic leveling up to some sort of skill tree etc. At the very beginning you can pre-customize your character in the way intended. It may be decisive if you want to choose a certain approach like stealth, hacking, combat etc. The maps are huge and you get lost pretty easily - one might criticize that. Also the level design isn't the best at times. The campaign is loosely structured with somewhat missions - each has its specific main goals and possible side-goals you may want to achieve or not, you can progress though without caring. From time to time the interaction with the NPCs will let you or force you to make decisions that affect your playthrough experience. - Other feature worth mentioning: This game is 'circular' in it's very best sense - multiple playthroughs intended, there is no real ending as there is no real end (storywise, gamewise). Replayability: 100%  ________________________________________________ This is a very very first impression comment on the game and I just want to share one thing with you guys because it's something remarkable for me as a gamer: It was the first time after a long period of FPS-gaming time that holding a gun in my hands evoked some kind of feeling. It just felt fresh and astonishing and I can't explain why. Well, there is something more to it. There has been a lot of talk about shooters and immersion and experience. Immersion - there you go.  (I will elaborate on this after I progress in the game. For now - there has already been talked about the cyber-steampunk setting with the asian touch a lot as well as the soundtrack and so on. Go have a read if you like.)",

            "review_text": "So let's try writing some review for these games I have. Anyways,  E.Y.E. You're a stupidly wierd game.  Good: The gameplay is fun for what it is, and I never got tired of the cool factor of being able to block machine gun fire with my sword or being able to hack into someone's skull to make them explode. Couple of other gadgets you start with too, and you have quite a few upgrades and new guns you can get that may or may not be fun to use. It never really gets painfully hard either, which I consider a redeeming factor for this incoherent game.  There are plenty of free missions and locales that you can play, several fun to use weapons, pyschic powers, a campaign that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and an awesome atmosphere that is both tense and unsettling. The entire setting has a nice cyberpunk feel to it, and there's plenty of cool factor to spare.  Bad: If you are expecting any kind of story to enjoy than good luck. Confusing English and a lack of explanation makes the story hard to follow at best. It doesn't help that the story plays with some insanity tropes as well; making things even more confusing. The rpg mechanics are worthless, and I never really felt like I became anything special aside from just a samurai guy. Some of the systems like magic/psychic power feels underdeveloped, and the insanity thing, which actually is an interesting mechanic for the game, can be removed by an 'upgrade'. As far as combat goes: the A.I. is ridiculous. One little detection can result in the entire enemy army walking in a straight line towards your location. There is also this weird critical hit/negative hit system, but I've killed enemies in one hit with a 'Failed Attack' several times so I don't know what to make of that. Overall, The whole thing just feels marred by poor design choices.  The story is confusing as a story can get. The core rpg mechanics lack complexity. There are way too dang many large empty areas. A.I. is clumsy at best. And you'll probably go through the whole game without buying or upgrading anything. Don't expect to be impressed anywhere here; there's just a lot of boring trash beneath a paper thin shine.  Overall: It's a game you have to play simply for the experience. Just to play for the overall unique strangeness of the setting. To get sucked in to the weirdness of the story about a cybernetic super samurai who may or may not be insane. It has it's cool moments to help things a long too, and to say again, you start with a sword that can block pretty much anything and sets people on fire.  But, if you are expecting a solid experience then you probably won't be amused by this at all. The game requires you to overlook a lot of problems. If it were even a little bit better I would change my overall opinion here. But there is just nothing to guarantee you will like this, so that's why I would not recommend it.",

Missions are semi-labyrinthian style maps with re-spawning enemies. Some are huge. You can alter the difficulty AI, and respawn rates in the options on the fly at any time. There is no manual save...auto save by way of a character profile. You can take your character online, offline, coop, and in-between independent from the single player campaign. There's a hacking mini-game with 4 different starting options and an additional layer of 5 options during the hack. There's over a dozen Cybernetic upgrades and implants and PSI powers (like Magic) on top of all that. It is a bit overwhelming with so many options.

You have stats that benefit your melee damage, accuracy, hacking, run speed, Psychic powers, and so on. On top of that you can spend ludicrous amounts of money to get cyber body modifications or to preform research on artifacts which will boost your stats even higher. At a certain point you will be able to run at ridiculous speeds, turn your foes into a fine red mist with a cybernetic claymore, and backstab helicopters with warhammers.  However there are a few places where it, debatibaly, falls short. There are a lot of bugs in the game, not including the ones that you can shoot. Even with an extensive ingame tutorial a lot of gameplay mechanics are somewhat unclear. Every character in the game talks and swears like a grizzled bandit, from actual grizzled bandits to your fellow psychic space illuminati assassin paladins. A karma and rating system that 'somehow' are intregal to gameplay probably. Getting shot in the face so hard that it breaks your legs, you get the idea.  The story is an absolute trip, even if you do get the final ending there's a lot that you probably wont grasp. With elements such as alternate/nonexistant timelines, internal conflict in past-present tense, and the psychic force of the universe lashing out in the form of monstrosities in retaliation to rapid cyberascension and the squelching out of other species.

Much is amateurish; little thought seems to have gone into refreshing whatever was borrowed from Source assets (namely physics and other special effects. In EYE, your hand is the Gravity Gun). And you may be unimpressed by the character models, and sickened by the abrasive sound effects and voices, and the ugliest browns and greens you've ever seen.  You will be tested. Here EYE hints that some of its flaws are not accidental, that they fit into a larger scheme. Perhaps you have played Pathologic, or STALKER, that other difficult game about acronyms. You have a suite of weapons with no clear utility and you will have to work for an hour to figure out which ones are useful. You have all sorts of abilities, but they are also spotty, and finding a way to even use them will take you at least one minute. You begin play with a rough idea that you can improve' by spending resources on various things, some of them new weapons, some of them abstract representations of the things you can do. You may or may not figure out a plot; you may or may not sort out an efficient way to become better using one of two unexplained single-player game modes, or to become functionally better (as in more skilled) using the insane multi-player game mode.   When a game puts up one kind of road block, who would I be to assume its other obstacles are accidental? I would have to be some kind of games journalist. I know that I am no kind of games journalist, because all deep questions recede as soon as I do the thing EYE most enthusiastically invites you to do: commit thoughtless virtual murder using a toolkit too large for my IRL kitchen. I blew up a man with a handgun called The Bear Killer today. I then hacked a computer in his friend's brain and compelled his friend to kill their remaining friends. I then summoned three psychic clones of myself to kill the confused survivor. Some mutants came, and I murdered them, too.   EYE: Divine Cybermancy gives you all of these gifts, but it taxes you. Somehow, this feels thematic: when it is as easy as Hell to disappear a million mutant men with a single shotgun, the real antagonist might be getting *into* it in the first place.   I sense deep genius, and complex fun. EYE makes you compromise for pleasure. When you ask why it might, you see that it wants you to think - but only for as long as it takes to reload.",

The quintessential Sci-Fi nerd's game, IMO.  There's a money system for investing in physical/cybernetic enhancements and weapons, and research toward the same, all funded by things like bounties, hacking bank computers, and lump-sum mission completion rewards. There's also a skill point-based leveling system with lots of options for specialization, e.g., stealth, brute force, finesse, faster/greater health/recovery, athletics/acrobatics, psychic control/telekinesis, hacking enemy machinery/weapons - even their brains to do your bidding (but watch out, you may get hacked if they're better than you!), et al.

It has a nice mix of RPG/FPS that isn't to far inclinded either way. There is almost a steam punky element to it, it is definetly a co-op game. I've had no problems at all so far, the only real negative i have for it. Is that sometimes it's a bit hard to see during the day, and the load times for joining a LAN is a little bit annoying. If you enjoyed Deus ex/ watch dogs you'll definetely enjoy this. It was a bargain at $1 but for me personally it was a $1 well spent.   The story line is very indepth and can take quite a bit to adjust to but, you can skip a lot of it if you just want to skip straight to the action. You can go all guns blazing but you may die a lot it does cause you to think about how you select your load out for each mission.   And that is the great thing your not stuck with one class you can use all weapons and change if you come across an amoury in the larger maps, they are scattered and easy enough to backtrack and find. There is a steep learning curve but if you keep at it, you certainly get many hours out of it.",

Combat seamlessly mixes GUNS, SWORDS, and PSYCHIC POWERS, while fusing with machinery. Its a lethal combination that can be crafted to your personal taste. Hacking, Machine control, rambo-style play, stealth, super-human abilities... its all here. Whatever you want.  This game sets itself apart in art style, excellent combat, nonlinear branching story (with meaningful plot points the player can influence), and a setting/mood that REALLY takes you somewhere else.  If you take time to pick up the snippets of story and explore a bit you'll enjoy it more.  The ambient-orchestral soundtrack is peerless for games in this category.  The customization is deep and allows you to truly craft any character style you can think of.  The fact that this was an indie game made for less than $1m is stunning. The production values for a game of this type are rather high.  While lacking in extensive voice overs, I found that the quirky dialogue and text based story actually added literary charm from the game and did not detract from the main idea.  Excellent gunplay, co-op, deathmatch, cool characters, and meaningful branching story choices will create a sense of intrigue, deep moods, and powerful action.  The only thing that would stop you from enjoying this is You are tossed into the game and expected to figure it out. Please take the time (5 minutes tops) to do so. You won't regret it.  For ten bucks (I got it for $5 steam sale), its a steal. It's been almost 3 years since this game came out and I'm still playing it.  Somehow it just hits on all of the right notes. Play it. And if you do, message me for a multiplayer game.  Good job. I hope to see more updates from this studio.",

Originally playing it back during release in 2011, it was a buggy mess full of broken translations and glitches that had further convoluted the game even worse than the present version. Over time, these issues were ironed out but the game still remains a very confusing yet enjoyable experience.  This game is primary a FPS with character leveling, allowing your character to grow even stronger as you continue to play through the title. You start off as a rather weak soldier, but as both your character levels up and you gain more experience playing the game, you will end up as a cybernetic powerhouse able to take on entire groups of heavily armored enemies in both gratuitous flair and efficiency. Generally all the weapons here outside of a few are generally worth using, much like an RPG you'll unlock more weapons and equipment as you level up and earn more money.  The story is both one of the greatest and worst things in this game. This game doesn't give you all the information outright and only gives small pieces every so often and the player is expected to piece all of this together over time. This can be a turnoff for some players used to more modern games that by the end of the playthrough, there is nothing new to learn or find out even in NG+. To the players that are patient enough to piece it all together, you do get a mostly intact yet shattered picture of the game, the factions and so on.  The campaign of the game is one of the high points with this game for me. You can do the campaign both in singleplayer and in coop, and unlike what the game description says you can have up to 32 people in one campaign. It's a fairly short campaign in comparison to other games, but requires NG+++ in order to 100% the campaign. When you get a group of people together to play through the campaign, it's something magical that reminds me of playing a Serious Sam title in Co-Op mode. There are other multiplayer modes such as a CTF like mode with classes and a round based deathmatch mode for multiplayer, but the multiplayer for campaign is overall a more solid experience than these.  In short, it's a fantastic yet confusing FPS that is especially fun with friends. Typically it goes on sale anywhere from $1.00-$2.50 which is well worth it at this pricetag.",

You can buy stuff from the store with money gained from killing enemies, etc, and research misc items that enemies can drop, which can unlock abilities or improve existing attributes of your character.  Hacking is also an element in the game, you can do things like hack a door open, turn a turret to your side, or even hack an ATM! But if you lose a hacking minigame, you will get hacked yourself. When that happens you get quite an annoying overlay on your screen saying HACKED!, and cannot hack anything else unless it either goes away on its own, or you hack yourself to get rid of it.

If you have high expectations, don't bother. This game has many flaws (none of which are gamebreaking), but the concepts are well thought out, if a bit lacking on execution.  The menu is strange at best and there's so many things that I don't even understand, but the research system is neat. You can also augment yourself very much in a Deus Ex style to boost your abilities.  If you've played Deus Ex or games like it: Yes. If you can enjoy a game with minor flaws: Yes.

You can buy stuff from the store with money gained from killing enemies, etc, and research misc items that enemies can drop, which can unlock abilities or improve existing attributes of your character.  Hacking is also an element in the game, you can do things like hack a door open, turn a turret to your side, or even hack an ATM! But if you lose a hacking minigame, you will get hacked yourself. When that happens you get quite an annoying overlay on your screen saying HACKED!, and cannot hack anything else unless it either goes away on its own, or you hack yourself to get rid of it.

Unfortunately, all of these good ideas can't do much to counter the game's terrible A.I., boring combat, constantly respawning enemies, erratic level design (some are well done, while others are just big empty boxes), and incomprehensible writing/storyline. So at the end of the day the game's RPG pretensions are for naught: no matter how many upgrades you buy or how many times you level up the game still plays like an amateurish, unfinished, sub-mediocre Half-Life 2 mod.",

This is simply not the case with this game. There are far too many required functions to be able to map them all to a standard controller, so you will need to use your keyboard so much that even attempting to use the controller just seems pointless.  Again, I realize that this isn't an issue for a lot of PC gamers, but I feel like those who, like me, prefer to play their games wilth a controller will be disappointed with just how hard it is to play this game with one.

I wouldn't exactly call the single player campaign 'fun'. To me it was very tedious, almost boring. Enemy AI is quite something, I often witnessed enemies turn and look at me from about 500 feet away and turn around and stand there until I kill them.

Interface is a little bizzare and unoccomodating at first but is a beautiful tapestry of the art theme, to which this game looks grand and psychological.  I immediately felt welcomed though with the tuturoials (wiki and community is really helpful and necessary), if not immediately challenged the dangerous world of E.Y.E. where an alien world is at the very heart of a surreal and deep plot of warring factions and hightened sense of mechanical combat.

Pros (?): + Its a shooter / 'cRPG' hybrid, and a pretty messy one if you're not into some kind of RPG background, but once you get the idea, its kinda cool. + It has not the best graphics, sounds or music, and yet it gets the job done: it depicts a nasty, lonely and weird dystopic future with [Cyberpunk, Warhammer 40k, Alien, Blade Runner, Matrix, etc] elements. Cool mix if you ask me. + It has a wide variety of weapons, armor, psi powers, cyber augmentation. + The hacking minigame its cool. Hard to understand at first maybe. + Campaign Co-op + You are part of a faction within a secret order that works for megacorps against the Federation. It consists of Cyber-Psionic warrior-monks that look like Templar Knights and Samurai. YAY!   Cons (?): - It throws you into some weird as ♥♥♥♥ situation and doesn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about you. You're on your own. Tutorial you say? Mmmm... good luck with it. Yeah, sometimes it is a good thing, but E.Y.E. fails at execution here. - The save system may be a pain in the butt. - Pretty weird / bad AI. - The level design its great... but sometimes they are HUUUUGE and E M P T Y, devoid of any sign of life. Good concept maybe, terrible execution for sure. - Poor story and background development, althoug i like it (more about this later) - You are part of a faction within a secret order that works for megacorps against the Federation. It consists of Cyber-Psionic warrior-monks that look like Templar Knights and Samurai. WTF?  I may be missing something, but you get the idea by now.  Now, one last, important and  HUGE  point: the key is the ending. All this whole mess of a game makes sense (and be warned, not necessarily a good one) when you reach the 'end'.   The actual one. After you've completed the game AT LEAST three times.    This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lets you wonder WTF just happened and, again, it doesn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about you, your feelings, your expectations. Anything. And i like that. What were you expecting? This has some heavy cyberpunk influences after all! But seriously, the end demands you to think about the whole experience, something that not many games do.  So, to get this to an end, should you buy E.Y.E? Only if you can see through some far-from-perfect indie game, if you like cyberpunk, weird and not so conclusive stories. If you're in doubt, wait for a sale.",

Biggest gripe I have is the 'weapon group' keybinds; every single time you start a game or load a level, they RANDOMIZE what groups they select. So one level your AR, SMG, and swords are 1, 2, 3; next level its your swords, grenades, and medkit on 1, 2, 3; level after that its your AR, grenades, medkit. It's frustrating to rely on the mouse wheel to cycle through ALL your weapons/gear when in a firefight. This is apparent with manual reloading, as its quicker (or SHOULD BE) to change weapons than to reload, especially with something like the minigun or the .50 sniper rifle. But no, unless you're a 2 guns, no gear, player, the wheel will annoy ya.   Overall, ONCE YOU GET THE THING GOING, it CAN be fun. Feels like an arena shooter with a poorly written plot. With friends, maybe more so, but solo it does get old quick, and the main campaign isn't easy to follow. Can't honestly say I recomend this game to the pick-up-and-go style players.

That said, I wouldn't consider plot to be the biggest pull to this game. Between the wide variety of weapons, hacking, psionics, stealth, and mechanical augments, the game is a veritable playground, with each mission being able to be completed in a variety of ways: Slowly hacking into the augmented brains of your enemies and turning them into mindless slaves to act as your meat shields to wearing heavy armor and mowing down hordes with a minigun, or even using psychic powers to fling broken cars across the map. Perhaps the most alluring aspect of the game is the power the protagonist can obtain, vaguely reminiscent of Deus EX, you have no conventional classes, and your progressive character building eventually results in an incredibly powerful, flexible--or specialized--protagonist. The main campaign can be played alone, or with friends on LAN, moreover, there's competitive PvP gamemodes to keep things fresh.   The game itself is fairly adequate in length, requiring six to ten hours to complete, but with endings for four complete playthroughs. Moreover, your characters will maintain from one gamemode to another, so if you play multi-player a lot, you can then port your character to the main campaign, or load it in to play with a friend in co-operative missions. As such, the same character can be made to play through the game multiple times, hitting ever high levels of power until you're jumping over apartment buildings and slicing through gunships with a Katana--that's also a demonic cyborg.  If you enjoy things like Warhammer 40k, Ghost in the Shell, or Shadowrun, this is likely the game for you with its dystopian cyberpunk FPS/RPG themes. While the plot, gameplay, and atmosphere holds up for solo play, the game is best done with a group of friends.",

It is unique in that the folklore of the world (which is beautiful, even by today's graphics standards) refers to your overall skillset quite a bit, which makes it feel a little bit more of a personal journey.

I would call the feeling I get from it similar to the one you get from the atmosphere from Dark Souls but different in it's own unique way to where it's not the same feel in an fps. As an avid fan of Warhammer 40k games this game gives you a seemingly copyright infringingly close experience to games of those vein but less of the Space Marine machismo and more of the simple pathetic human thrown against the tides of space. Game is rather unpolished, but that some how adds to it's charm in generating that unique feel.  Overall 7/10, a bit of spit shine and polish of the game design, character advancement, and in a few other areas and would easily be 9/10, but still overall a very fun and rewarding experience.",

            "review_text": "Imagine creating a game with elements combined from the original Deus Ex, STALKER, and Half-Life 2. Sounds like the best FPS/RPG possible, right?  Well, now imagine that the team behind it is a bunch of amateurs instead of a AAA studio. That's EYE: Divine Cybermancy.  There are some interesting things going on here, and the beginning of the game has a pretty good hook. But it falls apart quickly.  The graphics are what you would expect from an indie shop doing a 3D game. I actually  loved  the environments - they're huge with a great sense of scale and perspective. BUT the level design is awful. Without a map it's easy to got lost in the labyrinthine twists and turns. And the quest markers can hinder more than help; you often have to walk very far in the opposite direction from them in order to make a single turn that enables you to actually get to them. It's frustrating to see where you're supposed to go but not have any idea how to actually get there.  The combat barely passes for typical FPS fare, and the guns are all quite standard. I also never figured out how to unlock new ones, so I was left using the same weapon or two for the entire game. The fact that the explanations for how things worked were very poorly written (or translated) certainly didn't help me figure it out.  The real crime is in the leveling system. You get skill points to put into stats, but guess what? They can be permanently lost. I never quite figured out exactly when or how they got detracted though. You also have cybernetic implants, but they use money instead of anything attached to getting a level up. That's a huge problem because you also need the money to use for research to unlock new abilities and to buy consumables and occasionally as bribes for quests. Having all of those things under the same currency means you never have enough to actually improve your character significantly. I didn't feel any more powerful at level 20 than I did at level 1.  You can also get stuck if you don't put enough points into hacking and related skills because in the very late game it's required that you hack a few high level objectives. The only solution for me was to grind out a several more levels and put everything I had into that one skill. It was so supremely annoying that I almost quit even though I was 90% of the way through. The developers clearly didn't learn the lesson from Deus Ex that there should be multiple ways to advance and achieve your goals.  The story was a little interesting in the beginning, but it grew tiresome. Most of the interesting parts of have to be consumed by simply reading large blocks of text. It avoids forcing the player through exposition, but in this case I would've prefered more back story within the main game over a library where all the facts are dumped into a giant pile.  The ending is intriguing. I am glad I ultimately finished it. But the game forces you to complete it three times in a row with the same character in order to discover everything that's going on. How some people slogged through that I have no clue.  I picked up Divine Cybermancy because I love the FPS/RPG genre and this seemed like a solid twist on the setting. But the system and story and level design did not live up to what I hoped for. There  is  a core of a good idea here. The game just wasn't designed well enough on top of it to be worth your time.",

From the little I've played, gameplay is stilted - all the environments and levels are too large for how slowly you move, completely breaking the flow of the combat. Guns are vastly more effective than melee weapons, as I often died just getting into melee range. You expel the remainder of your clip when you reload, which leads me (as a compulsive reloader) to accidentally lose all my ammo. The writing is... 'poor' is an understatement. It's clearly a bad language port. No real story is given, literally every npc I met was absurdly rude to me, and it was generally just a really poor experience.",

The storyline and lore are very confusing after all of this, you could care less about the story in my opinion.  GAMEPLAY  this game did not play out like i was going to expect when i read other reviews on it but, it would be taking deus ex, some abilities from bioshock, and that is as simple as that. The enemies range from soldiers to Cyberdemons (literaly there is a cyberdemon in this game).  GRAPHICS  this game is made on the source engine and this game started out as a HL2 mod.  PROS  -good gunplay  -abilites  -the immortal king  -shopping and research  -very impressive hl2 mod  -COOP  CONS  -when you die you lose some of your stats permanently (no i am not joking there is no way to get them back)  - most of the people you talk to in this game are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  -not much content   Overall this game has impressed me for the amount of money i spent on it. 7/10     ",

The game allows all kinds of builds, from Street Samurai to Psychers, to Snipers and Heavies.  A notable shoutout is to the guy who came up with the hacking system, which is a riff on classic JRPG combat, which essentially means that the object you are hacking has as much of a chance to take over your body as you have to do their. Essentially, when you hack into a door, the door hacks into you. You may posess hacked soldiers and use them for stealth manuvers.  After loading up every square inch of your body you may begin to power through the gangs of raiders and spacemarines located in a dull industrial area. If you haven't noticed, you also have psychick powers, which allows you to create astral clones of yourself, as well as push enemies away from you, shattering their ribcage.

The basic structure is that of an ARPG: you get quests from a hub and then go into the wilderness of the cyberpunk future to kill people, gain experience and skill points, and get money to buy more guns with. Locales range from skyscraper-lined streets to bandit-overrun hive worlds. You will encounter entire mission locales that are essentially homages to classic action films.  You will meet some very badly written characters and kill hundreds of baddies attacking you via the means of massive amounts of firepower, PSI spells and magic. Oh, and melee. This is the sort of game where you start off with a cyber-katana. It is overdone, extreme and often overkill, but enjoyably so.  There is also a hacking minigame which allows you to influence and take over everything from the mundane door to turrets and even enemies, and make them kill each other or just fry their cyberbrains. However there's a catch: the things you hack will try to hack you back. This is the only game in the world where you can be hacked by a door. There's a fair amount of variety in the types of characters you can play, from minigun-wielding tanks to sneak melee attacking invisible ninjas. Skills and augmentations can be chosen to compliment your style of play.  The main problem with the game is the lack of direction and polish. It often feels like it was made by a mod team with no project management whatsoever. Everything someone wanted to make, or happened to make, is in there somewhere. The dialogue is also incredibly bad most of the time, and even feels like no-one bothered to rewrite placeholder dialogue for the final version. Example: you will meet an NPC who will say: 'I need you to bring back some stuff for me.' Your answer choices are: 'Interesting...', and 'Sorry, you're breaking my balls.' That is the entire quest dialogue. Most characters are foul-mouthed for no reason whatsoever, it seems like whoever wrote the dialogue just thought it was cool. It does lead to a fair bit of unintended amusement though.  The game could really have done with a copywriting pass by someone with native-level English knowledge. That it was written by people with less than stellar grasp of English is often painfully obvious. There is actually a fairly interesting grand plot behind it all, but good luck figuring it out from just playing the game, as it's obscured by the writing and the disjointedness of the missions. The hacking minigame is also incredibly tedious at higher levels.  The game may be rough, but it's still a diamond, at least if you think you could enjoy a Deus Ex-inspired shoot-em-up, dice-em-up ARPG made by a bunch of Frenchmen on LSD. Oh, and if you can gather enough crazy like-minded people for it, you can play the game through in coop with up to 32 players. You don't see that every day.",

For this price it's a crime to not buy it if you're into complex RPGs, Cyberpunk and can spend time on figuring out the game.   I've bought this game around half a year ago because I liked the picture and didn't know what to expect from it. Honestly, I played it for around 26 minutes and then closed it. Now after all this time I felt like I want some cyberpunk in my cup so I thought I'd give it another go. And now I'm enjoying it! It's clear that it was made with heart and love.  Opinions about this game differ from person to person, but everyone seems to agree that it's complicated. That's pretty much true, thankfully the community has several basic guides that will help you understand what exactly the game wants from you, because it doesn't explain itself at all and when it does, it does so very ambiguosly. I'd only like to add that it's also complex. Under all the vague descriptions of classes, stats and mechanics there lies a deep RPG structure. I can say without exageration that it is the most complex RPG (albeit not the most refined) I played on par with first Deus Ex.  That's not to say that the game has no problems. Obviously the mechanics could be explained a lot better and while the tutorial helps you out, it's not a particulary well put together tutorial. Also the world feels kinda dead in some places, not sure if its intentional or not. The voice acting isn't translated into english (native language seems to be french) and what's translated with subtitles has a plethoria of grammatic mistakes and due to poor translation the dialogues sound (or read) a bit silly. Another thing I have problem with is stealth. Not sure if it's bad, I'm doing something wrong, or there is simply no stealth system, but if you make at least 1 step not crouching, the enemies that are liek 200 meters away from you behind a building will know you're there and rush towards you. If you crouch it's a bit better.  Now about good stuff. I absolutly adore the world structure and lore, as ambiguous as it may be. You won't know much unless you read the world's history in an Archive in your HQ, but at least it's there for those interested. There seems to be potentially interesting struggle between 2 organisations of same faction and your protagonist struggles between his commander and his mentor who want different outcome (which you will be a catalyst of, I assume). Other good thing I can say about the game is that the guns feel great. Like really great. They have an appropriate amount of recoil and weight. Did I mention that you can dual-wield katanas?   I could go at greater length describing this game, but this 'review' is already bloody long. Tell you what, if you don't buy it now at this sale, you basically commit a crime against yourself.

That said, it is super easy to just grab heavy armor, whatever weapons suit your fancy, and just blaze through the game barely taking damage until endgame, which is pretty difficult at times. The game has its problems, such as needing a lot of grinding to get new weapon unlocks, the inventory system and other menus being really unwieldy, and silly high enemy respawn. The text is also really hard to read at times, and you'll be reading a lot, because there are no lines spoken in English.

Despite these drawbacks, I've found myself spending time playing this game (its most entertaining with co-op play).

The plot at first seems very uncreative and half-wit with lots of cussing and childish insults. However, the more time you play the game the more you come to understand the harsh world of E.Y.E and its mechanics. It certainly has a many flaws like its usually sub-par translation job, clunky UI, and up-and-down difficulty jumps. Fortuneately over some years the game has been patched to have (sort of) better translation, new UI options, and incredibly tweakable difficulty.  As 'meh' as the game was, I personally couldn't help but keeping playing it and get deeper into the story, characters, and combat. It's an alright game, certainly no triple AAA masterpiece (or as of lately to date, triple AAA flop), but it has more than enough content to burn some hours on and have fun while doing so.
