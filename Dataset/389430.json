            "review_text": "Just the fact that I felt like I had to write this review at 04:26 in the evening tells so much already. I was never a 'pro' in this game but almost over a decade ago while actively playing it I guess I didn't have the tools I have now to evaluate this the way I can now;  *Best Parts* - Even though it's incredibly tough to build up your character the reward is great enough to keep you addicted. If your gear is top of the notch and you are a skilled player you will be a respectable member of the community and you will earn reputation not just among your own faction but also among enemy faction too(They will respectfully run away from your reputation when they see your name on their screen)  -Incredible PvP mechanics. The combo skipping is a thing that people generally hate in games but in this one if you can do it right with your keyboard as if you were a pianist you are a god(not that regular pianists aren't, those guys are great)  -Even though there are only 4 classes in the game the diversity of each class is so vast you could almost think that they could have separated each talent tree into different classes which leads up to a very unique experience in PvP and/or in general gameplay.  -Despite the fact that you need great endurance of the far east people to farm for hundreds of hours to build your character(and presumably at liest 40$ a month) there are A LOT of things to sink time in the game. You could mindlessly farm to level up/earn money(those are generally seperate ways of getting yourself the carpal tunnel syndrome), you could PvP in minigames, faction vs faction wars, in PvP area or occasionally invading enemy faction PvE areas, you could try to upgrade your gear to a higher level, you could run around in a market area to make a profit(some people spend most of their time in this) you could hunt bosses for great drops with your clan and friends around the maps and on and on it goes..  *Bad Things* -The F2P concept is received very poorly by the developing company. What they didn't realize after the success of games like LoL, DoTA or some MMOs with a f2p or at liest b2p bussiness plan out there is that you can NOT allow your players to get ahead by huge margins by paying more money. Especially if you are forcing them to pay you 40-50 bucks a month packages to steam roll the plebs like myself whom actually make it more fun to play for everybody. Hell, if you even provide 10-15% advantage over people who doesn't spend any money in this game is already a great boost since it already is a grind heavy game let alone giving a 300% exp boost. Yes. 300%.(This may not hurt much until you are level 70 since most of the exp comes from the quests but after that the great miracle of exponential function kicks in where you have to earn x^2 of times of the experience you needed to gain the previous level*)  -Obvioulsy community.  -Brain hurting English, no real quests, no script, no scenerio no nothing.  *Conclusion* When I did my first PvP after I reached level 70 with my assassin in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear I immediately recognized how much I have missed to do PvP in this game even after playing almost a dozen of MMOs out there that came out in the last decade. This game still is in the top 3 of my PvP enjoyed MMOs. But after a couple of hours later I realized I had to stop PvPing because I was running out of money for spending potions, loosing money because of the repair costs etc. And so I knew that game was demanding one of these two simple things, My soul, Or my wallet. So just like that like a second chance given failed marriage I had to end it once more.  Rest in peace old friend. May we meet again when I reach my mid thirties.  *Writer might have exaggerated the actual experience amounts needed for each corresponding level to prove a point.",

When you kill a monster that gives you .0001 exp even though that monster can kill you with 1 hit and you lose 5% experience one death can ruin an entire day worth of grinding. The playerbase was as unfriendly then as it is now, but nothing was more fun than walking through a field of standing bodies during pvp and slaughtering everyone you could before they dissappeared due to an entire country disconnecting from the game.   Plenty of good memories.. like instant mage casting with the skeleton scroll.. aoe groups, rogue kiting like a pro.. christmas events.. but it's definitely not a game I'd reccomend to anyone in this day and age. I honestly can't believe it's still up and running. That horse has been dead for a very long time.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: I've edited my review, so if you think changes does not apply to you, feel free to change your rate to my review.  I played this game years ago and quit playing because it was full of cheaters. And it was free to use cheat programs as long as you were buying premium packs.  When NTTGame decided to release this game on steam, I hoped that they might fixed the bugs and improved the game, like improving the graphics, using VAC, etc. But game is still same as I left it. I've encountered same quest bugs that I've encountered years ago, which prevents you from completing the said quests. They still using Xigncode as anti-cheat. I hoped that they were changed it to the VAC.  I would like to play this game, but they need to fix these (a.k.a. Negatives):   Use VAC instead of Xigncode   Fix the quest bugs, monster name bugs, wrong monster location indicators, wrong item names, etc. Add a bug report system so we can inform you when we encounter them.   Improve the optimization. Even my high-end pc working like crazy when I play this game.   Remove all power-up items, scrolls, etc, only cosmetic items should remain.   Use one mega server. You've Cyper 1, 2, 3 so why keep opening new servers with new names. Why not increase these numbers to like Cyper 15-20?   Graphics should improve. NTTGame should know their rival games are TERA, Rift, etc.   To be just, here is the positives:   I saw banned player names flooding in chat panel. At least they're ban hammering like crazy the cheaters, trolls, bad language users, etc. (But I still prefer VAC over Xigncode, since Xigncode can give false postive much more)   After fixing negatives I've mentioned above, these would improve the game even more:   All big MMORPG games have PvP servers. A PvP server where you start at max level with fixed equipment would be good. This way players would skip all the boring leveling and jump in the PvP right away. And by fixed equipment, only player skill would matter.   All big MMORPG games also have language specified servers. If you really want to open new servers, there could be language specified servers like, English only, French only, German only, Spanish only, Turkish only. Using another language in specified server would cause a ban from that languages server. I mean like, 1 time warn, 2 times banned for some days, more than 2, banned forever.   I've heard that NTTGame says that the game engine is not capable of somethings like increasing servers max player capacity, etc. I've saw some games remade with Unity by some modders. If some modders can remake a game with Unity, why NTTGame not demanding a remake of this game from MGame, with a newer engine, like Unity, Unreal Engine etc.?  I'll update my review if they fix these. If these conditions does not apply to you, go ahead and try the game. It's free anyway.",

Don't let the playtime fool you, I have thousands of hours in this game. I played it 10 years ago. It was my first MMO. I didn't know any better. When I saw it on steam, I knew it would be garbage, but I assumed they had at least made some improvements on the pile of pixelated feces that I played 10 years ago. I was wrong.  I honestly don't understand what KO is trying to pull, and I especially don't understand what Steam is getting out of this. This needs to be removed from steam ASAP, before someone who doesn't know any better gets pulled into this garbage game.  The devs/mods/whoever the hell is still making money off this crap don't care at all about their players or any of the many problems that the game still has. I quit this game because of all the exploiters and hackers that they let run amuck. There was one spot where our group never bothered to go because the same guy was there botting for literally months. 24/7. Never got banned. How hard would it have been?   The people - and I hesitate to call them people - running this game won't lift a finger to make their gameplay experience enjoyable, and they definitely don't deserve any of your money. If you're looking for another F2P option, I'll list some below. These games aren't perfect either, and of course all games have issues, but nothing is as bad as Knight Online.

XIGNCODE3 You put spyware/anti-cheat in your software. It's from  Wellbia.com  (South Korean company). Honestly, as much as I understand creating a cheat-free community, it's annoying. It's used for other games   Found a report detailing how to beat XIGNCODE3. Seems that the software is only capable of checking out 'brand name' cheats and nothing else. It's not a good method to stop cheating and it annoys ME.  'I discovered that my issues with Xigncode3 killing the game were related to it now somehow being able to retroactively peek at what was running during the launcher. Well then, looks like my clipboard paste script won't work anymore. But, what will? Acting on a hunch, I wrote up a very simple keystroke injection testcase; you can see the code here. It's as simple as it gets while still doing what it needs to -- wait ten seconds, then synthesize keystrokes to produce '1aoeuaoeu' in a focused text entry. Using the exact same API AutoHotkey uses to do its thing, mind you. I compiled this with MinGW GCC, just a simple 'g++ -o injectiontest.exe injectiontest.cpp', with env CXXFLAGS='-O0 -march=native -ggdb' (on a Haswell i7). No optimization, no obfuscation; even the most primitive and basal heuristic analysis will be able to immediately deduce what it's supposed to do. On to the testing. I started the launcher, started the testcase as an elevated process, and put the password field in focus. Pasted right in; okay, AHK did that fine, but XC3 would flag it once the game started... nope. Didn't even notice. I hopped into a channel and walked around; this is WAY farther than XC3 would ever let AHK get, even if AHK had been killed off before hitting Play in the launcher. But what about ingame, now that XC3 is open and actively monitoring? Nope again. The testcase dumped its string into the chatbox without any interference or notice from XC3. The game continued to run until I manually quit. So, Xigncode3 appears to be a simple blacklist scanner, checking for specific programs and killing off the game if they're found. ♥♥♥♥ poor. Circumventing it is as simple as obfuscating whatever it uses to fingerprint programs, which would be trivially easy, or even simply writing a custom program, which as I have proven would be completely passed over without any additional effort whatsoever on the coder's part. If this is supposed to be a first-line defense against botting, it's a miserable failure right out of the gate. Any skiddie with half a working knowledge of any of C/C++/C#/VB (and more!) could write a bot that'll go unnoticed by XC3. Perhaps there's hidden heuristics to catch new botting/scripting tools and ban accounts using them, but that will only put you at a miserably hopeless disadvantage in an escalating arms race. Neople, if you want even half a prayer of beating the gold farmers, you better be using a smarter tool under the surface. Xigncode3 is doing you no favors and only causing headaches for legitimate players. Far as I can tell, there's a significant chance you currently have higher priorities, but this really needs to be addressed at some point, before ending OBT.'  2.

PvP is still partially skill based, so that's good. Premiums in this game are the most expensive I have ever seen in any game I have ever played, its truly absurd. The game is grindy, the UI is pretty cluttered and annoying. The DEV team must not really do to much because I see very little change to this game since I first played it roughly 8-9 years ago. So don't expect anything new for long spans of time, let alone new features. It could use quite a bit QoL improvements.  As for the community, its 70-80% of the population are Turkish Muslims. They don't speak English, and they most definitely are not going to interract with you if they can get away with it, and if they do, they are going to treat you unfairly, and get rid of you the first opportunity they get. They don't have a server for these people so its hard trying to find anyone to play with.  So key points are:  -Good PvP -Bad Dev Team -Unholy premium prices -Grind-fest -Turkish Muslims who hate you, and control the servers.  Do not play this game.",

The game play to get to the mid lv's of 60-70 arn't too hard to get but the grind from 80-83 is a tad repetiutive. I've play this game for years outside of SteamKO and Glad to see Steam to pick up this game. Sence then this game has recieve alot more attention then it did back in the day so alot of the servers have more people on them then ever before.  This game isn't for the chatacter lovers. The mechenics are hugly revolved around mid to late game PvP. With ranks, wars, and invations, if you love PvP, it's hard to get bored. Obtaining items to PvP might be a pain in the long run but it's worth it in the end.  A few of the classes have learning curvs that can clearly be reconized in PvP. Although it's not hard to learn the skills needed to be a specific class, It's when to apply them that counts.   If you are starting to play Knight Online be prepared for: -Merchants -Glitchy Monster AI -Misspelt Monster Names, Items, &amp; Item discriptions -Finger Cramping If you are a Assassin -Bordem between lv 80-83 -Chat spamming -Exhaustion from excessive grinding -Not knowing what anyone is saying becuase every one Types in Turkish but Speaks in English -KoXpers that steal your kills for quests -Long maintance times -Missing item names -Hair pulling after the low RNG of upgrading -Finding children in worms -Spamming Quest Tips -Obsessive same monster texture  But if your still here and still intrigued to play.
