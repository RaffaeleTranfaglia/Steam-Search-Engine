    "description": "Cyberpunk 3776 harkens back to the glory days of arcade shoot-em-ups. It all begins on a postapocalyptic earth and proceeds into space. Your journey will be a metaphor about life and death, a road that every person has to walk down alone. The only choices you get while on your path to the inevitable end: keep your head up high or forfeit.",

            "review_text": "The hitbox is too big that made the shield useless, you're literally can not graze the bullets because it will depleting the shield. This kind of behavior also forcing your position to always at the back line, because the bullets gaps are too narrow to perfectly avoid the shield depleted from bullets grazing.  And why the ship keep moving to the back even if you're not pushing the left button? Is this the game feature? Because I'm sure it's not controller problem. It doesn't make sense to make this permanent, it should be on some specific condition like when moving through water current or some liquids or against enemies laser.  Also the default key for exit menu when you're doing mission is silly, it should be 'esc' button, not 'backspace' button. Once I had in a bug situation where the level have no progression, no enemies appear. I didn't know it was 'backspace' button, so I just ended with alt-f4 to close it.  The game is not FUN unless you're a kind of player who like to grind all stat to max by repeating same level.",

            "review_text": "Classic sidescroller with nice but 'not enough details' graphics. Upgrade system is 'farm based' but IT LACKS visual impact; when i buy upgrades i'm expecting my ship to change in some way. Sound and music are average. There are bosses that show little but at least some kind of damage as you destroy them. Very bland in appearance but this type of alien uses that visual style for their ship so i guess i can't complain. They do look polished though. The lightning/glowing effects are also very well made.  Cyberpunk... don't really know why but at least it fits the depressing 'ambiance' of the game. Your character is a junkie on drugs that keeps having the same 'destroyed building' purplish/pinkish psychedellic hallucination throught the game... EXTREMELY annoying. As a lone survivor of the human race you are fighting while hearing him talk in his head in a monotone and totally negative and lifeless way. His speech isn't credible and tries to include some kind of teaching... this being backed by the level names who stands between the Bible's capital sins and the last thoughs of a man ready to shoot himself.  Although it is clear from the start that mankind was destroyed by some aliens there's no explanations, no flesh on this skeleton-of-a-story, just a monotone druggie painfully expressing how he's gonna fight and eventually die because ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan. I don't think a pilot could actually think like that in the middle of a fight with the aliens that vaporized his kind. Ending is predictable but still enjoyable at some point.   Is this release original? No. It does feature the toughts of a depressive pill riding junkie but the game itself is standard, even disapointing since you like to think that devs can do better in these modern times.",
