            "review_text": "Every once in a while a game feels entirely self contained and 'perfect'. The last one I can think of is Frozen Synapse and now there's this. It's been frustrating seeing it unreleased for so long, but now seeing the final product I understand the long delays. The visual polish is absolutely amazing. Slowly navigating through its post-apocalyptic wasteland reveals an infinite set of painted vistas. There's just enough visual storytelling to make you wonder of the purpose of the strange blob creature, but no more.  The closes comparison for gameplay is World of Goo with it's analog manipulation of complex physics systems. But otherwise it's entirely original. Nothing out there is quite like it and anything similar that follows will be branded as derivative. It encompasses every inch of the good ideas in this design space and nothing more. No filler.  Some of the later puzzles are a little difficult, but mostly they demand patience. Take a break and come back to it when you're ready to play with physics.",

The controls, I think, are what makes it both unique and interesting, and immensely frustrating--in the 'I know what to do, and I just need to, dammit. start over and try again' sense. There are plenty of checkpoints spaced out fairly well, so it's somewhat forgiving.   Are you familiar with those squishy tube stress releif toys? The ones that kind of flop out of your hands when you squeeze them, and are made of transparent plastic, and usually filled with colored liquid and sometimes small plastic toys. Imagine you have to push one of those across a rocky, post-apocalyptic landscape, over lava and acid pits, and defeat cyclopean terrors. Imagine that you can only really interact with by pushing it with a fist or a finger. Now you are starting to understand how Mushroom 11 works.   But, like, more complicated than that.",

To be honest, it's a big flaw for those of you who are easily frustrated and imaptient. I finished it after 8 hours with a good dose of satisfaction, but I don't want to go back to it again. All in all, I'm recommending it - difficulty of puzzles is decent, concept of the mechanics is greeat, frustrating experience is my only objection.",

            "review_text": "It's always risky to try some radically new base mechanic in a platformer game, so I tend to hail anyone who attempts to do so. Enter Mushroom 11, where you can't control your character directly - all you can do is erase a part of it. What you delete will regrow in a few seconds, randomly across the bulk of the fungus. Result: if you persistently delete the right side, the entire bulk will move to the left. And basically that's all. For such an odd mechanic to work, the puzzle design needs to be ultra careful, and this is one area where the game shines - most of the tasks ahead of our hero are well thought-out, rarely very difficult, and the checkpoints are thankfully frequent. The other aspect worth mentioning is the incredible background art and atmosphere.  Mushroom 11 is not without faults, either. One is a direct consequence of the base mechanic - whenever you need to do something with accuracy, you need a lot of luck or a lot of patience. The latter can run out easily when you're shaping your fungus into something elaborate for the umpteenth time, and still end up eg. falling down. The other is more strange - at some points, the game seems to interfere with the physics, forcing a certain solution path. I met this only 2-3 times - one example is the cart ride in level 5 where I found it impossible to keep the fungus in the cart at a certain jump.  Based on the above, there's a little secret to enjoying Musroom 11 - take breaks, even frequent breaks, depending on your skill. There are not many very difficult puzzles in the game (levels 5-7 are more difficult than 1-4, but not dramatically so), but the randomness tends to wear you down after a while, and you'll feel the game is unfair while it's only doing its thing relentlessly. Quit and come back tomorrow, it will feel fresh again.  Untame has done a great job with Mushroom 11 - made a very brave move with the base mechanics, and designed an interesting and visually superb world around it. Definitely recommended. ",
