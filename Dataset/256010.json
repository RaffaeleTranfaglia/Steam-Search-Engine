            "review_text": "Short opinion:  This is a piece of crap that brings shame to Jagged Alliance series. If you're a fan of any type of tactical turn-based games - avoid it!  Long one:  Yeah, i'm a long time fan of Jagged Alliance games like many others around the world. I don't regret that i was a backer during KS campaign, it was my choice and i was fully conscious about what i was doing. I only regret the final result of this project.  I really don't want to write a book about gameplay, so i will focus on advantages and disadavtages of this game. Here we go:  Pros:  - Graphics, you can love it or hate it, but i think that graphical style that was taken was a good choice.  - Fighting, well, sometimes fight is annoying, but sometimes it can be fun.  - Music, not bad.  - The game is clearly described, you can easily sense what is it all about  Cons:  - Graphics, style is ok, but there are too little details and 3D characters have jest few polygons.  - Sound, i don't mind soundtrack, but sometimes sounds in the inventory are too loud and overdriven.  - Just one save slot!   - Very small quantity of stuff thrown around, so there is no sense in wandering on a map, there are only few containers in which you can find some loot.  - Can't open/close the doors!  - There are no second floors, and you can't go on the roofs!  - There is no possibility to modify weapons!  - Bugged and totally unrealistic weapons. There is no such thing like UZI in .45 caliber, there is no such thing like Thompson with 7, 10, or 15-round clip. Sometimes I had action points, proper ammo and just can't reload the weapon.  - Can't see bloody thing during the rain/storm.  - Pathfinding is totally broken. You can click on a single and simple part of the ground and some of your merc will choose the most complicated and longest possible way to get there (and some of them will probably stay just where they are).  - User interface is not well designed, you can easily click on a random place and accidentally move your merc.  - AI, there are no sophisticated tactics that enemies can use, They just get closer and closer, one by one. Forget about flanking and such things.  - Useless militia, you train them, they lose and so on... There is no possibility to enter combat when your militia squad is fighting.  - Strange mechanics, aim shot is useless and sometimes you can embark into weird 'never-ending' shootout. It looks like this: the distance between your merc and the enemy is about two squares, you have rather high hit probability and you just can't shot him no matter what. Another thing: 103, 105% hit probability? What is it? Are devs kidding us?  - No noticeable mercs relationships, They're just callous puppets.  - You can use cow as a cover, the cow is...armoured...  - There is no, absolutely no optimalization!  - What the hell 'interrupt' button is doing in UI? Interrupt action should act automatically when given character have enough action points!  - Illegible table of guns characteristic.  - There is a shop of course (in text, not graphical form!). You can buy, but you can't sell your own stuff!   - Camera angles are uncomfortable  ...Jesus, i have enough, there are probably quite a few things that i could mention, but this list annoyed me enough. As You see, this game has been practically deprived of the most needed functions. I don't really see sense in existing of JA-ish game which is so neutered. Just look at Silent Storm and even 7.62, or Back in Action. These games have some flaws, but this is nothing comparing to Flashback. This game is so bad that i don't see any potential in it and any chance to upgrage the main problems of it.  People from Full Control said something like this: 'KS campaign succeeded with minimum amount of money needed to create Flashback project, and that's why fans and backers will receive minimum amount of content'. Pure and simple, 368k $ was practically the lowest amount of money necessary to achieve lowest stretch goals and start developing of this game. This is the point where Full Control made a huge mistake, they should never start developing this game with such a low budget. Some would say: 'but minimum budget could not be lower due to low interest in community. If the amount was higher , this game would never have been created!'. Exactly! Jagged Alliance: Flashback should not exist! This is so weak and embarrassing piece of crap that only brings shame to Jagged Alliance brand.   Maybe if FC had more manpower, capabilities, experience, consistent vision and skills to make things right, then they might have a chance to make a really decent game... But they hadn't and they were overwhelmed by the task which they have chosen, They had to feed their families and stay aflout, we received a game that is poor in almost every aspect. Was it worth it? I don't think so...   I believe that time will come and we will finally receive worthy successor of JA: 2. It doesn't matter how long i will wait, real mercs never die!;-)",

Pros: - a tactical shooter - some nice reference to characters from the classic JA2 - +1 to my game counter on Steam  Cons: - dumb AI (just running in, shooting from miles away, not taking cover) - simple character stats and in some cases poor leveling mechanics (walking on an empty road incresed my stealth... yay?) - cover mechanic seems to work for you but very poorly for the enemies which makes it even easier to kill oponents since they're all idiots - bad UI (starting from the character screen, through the inventory, up to the tactical view options) - bad inventory system (a bubble gum takes as much space as a sawed-off shotgun...) - poor graphics (no faces on characters in 2015?!)  That's all I can say after spending 68 minutes playing, but I'm pretty damn sure I won't be going back to this game. If you want to play a tac shooter, get anything else as this just feels unfinished at best. And reading up on the dev studio current situation not much will happen to this game in the forseeable future.  Avoid unless you can get it like I did for 2 euro. +1 to games library...",

            "review_text": "What happened to Jagged Alliance: Flashback? What happened was that it didn't have a chance.  Two things were working against this game: The sub-standard budget ($360,000 Kickstarter budget + however many sales this game got on Early Access at $30 minus royalties) and Full Control's developers, who have in the past turned the board game Space Hulk into Space Suck through a ham-handed understanding of the mechanics and lack of polish.   The former is unfortunate - because of this, features had to be cut. Features like character animations, a bunch of the mechanics from Jagged Alliance 2 (which is telling, because Flashback was supposed to be a lot like Jagged Alliance 2 with v1.13 patch features), running and managing your own base of operations, and skill trees. The developers didn't have enough funds or manpower to implement everything, which is a major disappointment.  The latter is also unfortunate, because this game has one of the worst looking user interfaces I've ever seen. There's only one font for this game and it's an obnoxious '90's looking Geocities font that slides off the eyeballs. Thankfully, there isn't anything worth reading here, because the character bios and flavor text that help make Jagged Alliance's storytelling have been neutered by word limits and bland writing. The enemy AI is poor, the kind of poor intelligence that makes enemies stop when they see you and open fire, like dumb turrets asking for a bullet in the face. There's all sorts of minor yet annoying bugs that coalesce into one huge Megazord of ♥♥♥♥. There is voice acting from every one of the mercs, but a lot of them re-use lines from Jagged Alliance 2 except in a worse manner OH ♥♥♥♥ HERE I AM COMPARING THIS GAME TO JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 AGAIN.  All of this is a huge leap backwards, turning this Jagged Alliance game into something functional yet generic. I did have a little fun (I ran out of bullets for my squad thanks to terrible loot distribution, but had three or four flashbang grenades. So I had my gunner flashbang all the mercs while my melee-only character runs up and delivers fists of death into faces), but I'm not interested in seeing where this game goes because it's too much of a mess to play.   I will say that the soundtrack is good and is successful at capturing the spirit of the old Jagged Alliance games. And I admire Full Control's persistence in trying to fix all of this with post-launch support and soldiering on when things look seemingly impossible. But I haven't seen anything in the past 16 years that would be a true successor to the franchise, and how Flashback turned out I don't think I'm ever going to at this point.  Rest in peace, Jagged Alliance.",

The AI was'nt the best, the interface clunky to say the least. I suppose it due lack of money and sales. The developer this week has annouced they are stopping developing more titles, and mainly supporting there other title Space Hulk Accession. You may get some enjoment if the title is dirt cheap, ie if like squad based TBS.   I did'nt help using the name Jagged Alliance as people have higher expections due to previous JA2 using the 1.13 mod.",

            "review_text": "I loved Jagged Alliance 2, particularly with the 1.13 patch. It was one of those games which despite its (often hilariously) simple production values, managed to combine rather deep tactical turn-based combat with tongue-in-cheek badassery. So I got a little excited when these folks put out their pitch about how much they loved Jagged Alliance 2 and intended to make a spiritual successor, and figured, 'Hey. I'll support this.'  Early access was basically unplayable, but I figured hey... it's early access. They're going to smooth things out.  But they never REALLY smoothed it out. What we ended up with at release was a rather lame reskin of the combat interface from the new XCOM, minus any of the polish and a lot of the functionality. For some reason, the game takes place in a country where literally every door is left open. There seems to be no useful stealth mechanic, or any form of suppressive fire.  Literally the only thing they've captured from the original -- and the only promise they really kept -- is the bad voice acting. Somehow they've managed to make each and every character in the game as grating as Ira or Biff.  Skip this. If you have JA2, download the fan-made 1.13 patch which refines the combat system and adds a wealth of new equipment. This isn't a spiritual successor. It's an abortion. If it were a $3 smartphone game, it would be mediocre.",

First thing: as a JA2 fan you'll definitely get the Jagged Alliance gameplay Feeling .... that is for sure!!!!!!!    negative:  - I discovered some minor bugs; femals mercenaries go phrone on every start.... but you can change them easily ;) - you can not flee from combat, when enemies reenter a sector, therefore you have to play strategic ... no problem - some options from JA2 are missing, like openig Doors and Cases.... beside the repair thing theres no Use for the mechanic skill - but I can live with that - no intro trailer, the story is similar to JA2 - its not possible to level specific skills, during level up.... the skill raise just by doing it -&gt; but in my opinion I can live with that - -&gt; anyway I push the shooting skill and the stealth skill for my custom merc ;) - some other options are missing, like using helicopter, delete the merc contracts, so you always have to wait til the contract is over, etc.   positive:  - very nice graphics ( I like the comic aspect) - really nice Jagged Alliance mercenary Music - very nice Weapon Sounds, much more better then JA2 - good blood and physics Animations - enough functions to at least play the game completely through - nice atmosphere through weather and nighttime - nice Weapon atachements - good balanced lenght of side quests and main quest -&gt; its not very complex, but enough - looting is really fun, because you get rather less at the beginning   neutral: - similar KI like in JA2 - Map Principle and Merc Management similar like in JA2 - Weapon ballistics feel similar - stealth gameplay is not easy butpossible... (Skill should be 60 or more)   So is it worth`?  for 3 Euro yeah man ... I like Independent Developers support them!!!  when I compare what big Studios bring out and how high the games are rated, like Assassins Creed Black Flag, Far Cry, Total War, etc... that I get fed up, becaue its no soul in it any more..... This game I can play till the end, without lossing the fun...   In the end it is a little reduced and renewed Version of JA2....  my Rating for this 75% out of 100%  because its not the best game on market but its fun... as I already said, more fun than many of the Mainstream games that get 90% ratings.   So buy it, when you are a Fan of Jagged Alliance and a skilled strategic player...   in my Opinion Jagged Alliance is one of the best Strategic games that exist ",

Did it succeed? Not completely. First off, if you're expecting Jagged Alliance 2, you'll be a bit disappointed. Flashback is closer to JA1 than JA2, in my opinion. That's not necessarily a terrible thing, though, as JA1 was a great game in its own right.  So let's dive into the details. Like the games it is attempting to emulate, Jagged Alliance Flashback is a turn-based, tactical, squad strategy game with some RPG-lite elements. You control squads of up to 6 mercenaries (you get to make one of your own then hire the rest), as many squads as you'd like, provided you can afford to hire them. You get dropped off on a tropical island and are tasked with overthrowing a warlord. The way you do this is by systematically taking over sectors to gain control of the island and capture areas that will generate revenue for you, allowing you to hire more mercs. You can train militia in controlled sectors that will defend the area from enemy attacks.  Mercs, including the one you create, have stats and skills. Stats go up when you level up while skills go up as you use them. It's a very simple RPG-lite system where you have fairly little control of how your squad mates will evolve. Beyond a short backstory, a different look, starting stats and skills, and different (often hilarious) barks, the hirable mercs are completely interchangeable and have no real personalities. In fact, no one in the game has much personality beyond extremely simple motivations in the game, which is one of its biggest weaknesses. The story is quite straightforaward and frankly pretty dull too.  Combat is the meat of the game and is thankfully quite good. It's obvious this is where most of the resources of development went into, and rightly so. The combat is turn-based and really well executed, in my opinion. I'd say that it's better in many respects than XCOM. While your characters lack special abilities, the combat mechanics themselves are quite well implemented. As you might expect, combat revolves around positioning, cover, and AP (action point) management. Every action, whether a movement or firing a gun, requires a certain amount of AP. If you don't have enough AP then you can't perform that action, simple as. You can stand, crouch, or lie prone anywhere on the battlefield (it costs AP to change stances) and can move in each stance (run, sneak while crouched, and crawl). Crawling costs more AP per distance than sneaking, snaking costs more than running). Crouching and lying prone also gives both offensive and defensive bonuses and can make you or your target impossible to hit, due to cover. There is an overwatch-like interrupt system too where you can save AP unused during your turn and an interrupt will trigger if an enemy walks into your cone of vision and you can spend AP to do whatever (fire, run, crouch, etc). Line of sight is implemented quite well, and lighting, time of day, and weather both significantly impact gameplay as they play into line of sight and the fairly simple but well implemented stealth system. Stealth uses line of sight, visibility, and noise (crawling makes less noise than running, firing a weapon without a silencer gives your relative direction away, etc). It all works really well and makes for a satisfying turn-based tactical experience.  Visually, while the game won't win any awards for graphical fidelity, I found the look of the game to be quite nice. It uses a somewhat simplistic art style that purposely omits small details in favor of more solid shapes. The highly saturated color palette works great with the tropical setting too.  The audio is pretty good too. There is not much in the way of voice acting, besides some pretty funny barks, and there isn't a whole lot of music, so you'll be hearing the same combat music a lot. The weapon sounds however are very punchy and satisfying, which adds a lot to the game.  The game is somewhat buggy. Nothing game breaking, mostly little annoyances that can be put up with or worked around. It's a somewhat rough around the edges budget title, but there's nothing I encountered that ruined my day.  If you like turn-based squad strategy then I would recommend this game, particularly if you're a fan of the old Jagged Alliance games. just know that it;s closer to JA1 than JA2. The game is far from perfect and has its share of shortcomings, but overall I thought the quality combat mechanics carried it and made it a satisfying experience. I'd love to see Full Control make another JA game now that they have a framework and solid mechanics in place and could concentrate more on writing a better story with characters I might care about.",

I think it is a great start. This game will allow people to spend years with this game and we will eventually be able to have JA 1.13 on steroids! I do enjoy the game and think it needs some work but it is very rare to find TBS squad level games these days and I love having another one to play with.",

Yes there are still rough edges, yes it still needs content and no its certainly not better than jagged alliance 2 (in its current state at least).   But the truth of the matter is that Full control made a game with what they had, not what they wanted. The tactical combat foundation is there and with some content and polish it has the potential to become something truly special. The developers can only continue doing so if their product is supported.   In summery. If you are looking for a triple A title, look elsewhere. But if you are a fan of the series or turn based tactical games in general your at the right place. Its not the Jagged Alliance I came to know and love yet but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Please support it.",

The combat is a bit clunky and the AI is not as great as promised.  Loot is sparse and random and the selling aspects with traders is abismal.  Graphics....well what can you say. While I dont mind the style of the overall game, the portraits (especially the lack of options for a custom merc) are ....well....sad for a JA game.  FC jumped up and down saying that THIS is the successor to JA2 and they would make it the true version of that, but so far I am not seeing it.  I understand...low budget etc etc etc.  I backed the game @ 25.00, but honestly....I feel a bit cheated since now I can get the same game for less.  And while my 25.00 helped fund them....I'm still a bit disappointed with that price.  This sounds mean, but anyone that spend more than 25.00 got screwed.  I'm not terribly TOO far into the game and like i said, I do enjoy it, there is just so many things missing and it DOES NOT flow like a true JA2 successor. I;m sorry, but its far from.  NOW...I know I will receive hate from people, but I actually REALLY liked JABIA. I did. I thought it was awesome and I spent A LOT of time replaying it, especially with the EXCELLENT 'combat Evolved' mod.  I didnt fully understand why so many JA fans hated it, but gues what JA fans.....BIA was better...period.  It held truer to the original series AND offered ALL the inventory, customization and weapon options of the original series.  Deny it all you want, but I will finish this game and probably not go back. I finished BIA 3x so far and will probably play a 4th.  ....and the comabt graphics were even better than this game.  That all being said (I'm sorry FC), I do recommend the game, but for the current %50 discount. This is not a full price game.",
