Cons: -The landmasses / Islands does not have many features to them. You can build Defensive Structures, Lighthouses or Cities. That's all. I would love to see some more stuff happening on the islands. -There could be much more loot to find. There could be Rare ships that you would have to find and destroy, in order to retrieve one or more special items, or you could implement a feature that allowed you to trade with ships. Maybe there would be rare traders who could be selling rare goods? I don't know, but I certainly think, that the game could use some new features. ",

            "review_text": "It's strange, this game. It's disarmingly simple, and to it's core is nothing but a series of fetch quests in perpetuity over randomized maps. Yet... the way it's put together makes it very addicting. In the lulls between combat, the game takes on a completely different feel - calming and soothing as you deliver goods to various cities. You can make it as stressful as you want - should you go where the winds take you, or try to powerlevel a city to max, so you can buy that one last boat? Up to you! Then when the cannonballs hit the hull, there's just enough variety of both loot and skills that there's more than one way to sink a ship. Disarmingly simple. The smallest sandbox game you can buy. No false advertising here.  8/10 - That moment when you realize it's a grind.  - Multiplayer seems half fleshed out.",

And thanks to the fantastic score in game, as well as the weather effects, you can find yourself playing for hours on end. I truly enjoyed my time with this game, and I do not intend to stop playing any time soon.  Winward has a distinct 'Table Top' game feel that sets it apart from most others in the genre. I highley recommend Winward to everyone. At the price it is at this game is a steal, worth every cent.",

Start with a small dinky little thing but work your way up to a flying oddity! 6 different factions that you can join, just 4 at first. And PIRATES ( you can join them too).  Pro -Interesting and easy combat -15+ unlockable ships (plus mods) -Ship customization (just colors and flag emblems but still fun) -Fun and friendly community -Nice calming music -Simple equipment system -WASD or Mouse controls -DRAGONS (when you get that far cuz they're difficult) -Upgradable equipment -Fast loading times -Looks great, even on lowest settings -Randomly generated maps  Cons =To do a Heroic/Raid you have to do multiplayer with 6+ people. =Low multiplayer traffic (25 on a good day, spikes around summer and winter sales) =Grinding. Completing a region takes a minimum of 20 minutes so i would suggest this more people with time on their hands. =NPC ai is lacking often leading to stuck ships =Gets boring fairly quickly if you just use singleplayer  I didnt go everything, theres still more pros and cons but i dont want to write everything. All in all, its a great game, not many updates now because the dev (singular) is working on Windward 2. Doesnt mean theres lack in content though. It's fun if you put some time into it and like mmo's.",

            "review_text": "Do not expect a new Sid Meier's Pirates! from Windward. Yes, it has ships and towns and cannons, but the game works totally different.  Essentially, this is a standard MMO (with over 100 players on one server possible), where you happen to control a ship and not a character. You level by gathering experience through combat or quests. You get points to spend on your skill tree of choice. Likewise, you get gold doing the same activities (add trade).  If you do that on your own, you will likely get bored after a few hours, because the grind is harsh and fighting against the same NPC ships becomes pretty boring after a while.  But then Windward shines when it comes to PvP, where you battle other players over the control of regions. There are also coop-missions in 'Heroic Instances' (WoW anyone?) for Epic Loot.  While the game mechanics remain repetitive, fighting against or alongside other players makes the game so much more fun.  Graphics, sound and music aren't exactly pretty, but they are not too ugly as well. Other than some minor glitches, I have not experienced any bugs, too.  Verdict: Solo play: 5/10 Multiplayer: 8/10  ",

            "review_text": "I'm really enjoying this game. It has some issues, but what game doesn't?  The lack of a tutorial is kind of lame, so you spend the first hour clicking on everything randomly. The game is pretty straight forward once you get the layout figured out.  The visuals are nice, but kind of looks like it was intended for console; having full controller support makes me wonder even more. The control scheme is very basic, which is nice for time when you just want to lean back and not worry about the keyboard for a while, controlling most basic functions with just the mouse. Its a beer sipping game at times :) Combat requires both hands lol  Combat is fun, though, dizzying at times from spinning circles around enemies; keeping them on your side for your broadside attacks. Not only can you destroy pirates, but you can also capture thier ships and add them to your AI driven team/ floatilla.  The game has an RPG style talent tree to make different builds for different styles of play (Think Borderlands skill trees). Lots of different colors and emblems to pimp your ship and sail out with. You equip items to your ship like it is your character, like new sails to go faster, armor to protect you from damage, crew to make you better at shooting enemies, etc. All i nall, theres 10-12 items you equip on your ship, then 4 vanity slots for 3 colors and an emblem. The equipable items are typical rarity leveled (White, green, blue, etc.)  I'm only about 5 hours into the game, so I've only seen the ability to buy 4 different ships, though the videos I've watched show way different ships than what I have available, leaving me to safely assume there is more ships as you progress through the 'character' levels, and find bigger towns.  The quests the towns provide are fun, but run into the problem of not being varried enough after a few maps: Place a turret here, ferry these people here, buy this stock and make a profit here, and a handful of other pirate elimination/ capture quests. There are lots of random quest drops that add a little flavor into the game, though usually its just bring this scroll you found to this place for a few resources and/or money.  The music is good enough to not be too distracting while playing, where as the sound effects are needed to be turned down for WHAT?! lol jk The sound effects/ ambient sound is great, but a little on the loud side when using headphones.  The worlds you play on are sectioned out by level, so you know where to avoid. Good size maps in each section of the world, leaving you hours of gameplay in each area. Random pirate attacks on the map you're curently on and have full control over are fun, and keep you on your toes.   I'm almost at 1:1 hours played to Dollars spent, and enjoying it more than I have with some triple A titles that I've spent over $60 on recently, and have almost beaten (storyline) in less that 25 hours... There is multiplayer and co-op, which I haven't tried out yet.  --TL;DR-- 8.5/10 good fun. There is a possibility of a 9-9.5 if the multiplayer/ co-op is good All in all, I can say I'm not disappointed with buying this game. Even at its full price of $14.99, I would've bought it; though I caught it on sale for $4.94",

There is very little in the way of a tutorial, and nowhere to look up keybinds (although you can assign new keybinds as you go), but once you get past these small obstacles and figure out how to play properly, it is a very fun game. Relaxing, especially in the lower level areas.   The first zone was almost entirely at peace. There were a few pirates to dispatch, but once they were gone, the only other I could encounter pirates there was when I took a mission to hunt one down. Pretty much what you would expect for any MMO starting zone. Enough to get your toes wet, but not enough to overwhelm you.  The second zone opens at level three, although you may want to consider putting off going there until level 5 at least. When you arrive, you cannot do any trading until the zone has been taken from the pirates that are trying to control it. This is basically a small capture the flag event, combined with blasting pirates. Take out pirates and towers, find a captured town or lighthouse, and park up next to it. That's all you need to do to capture it, which will change the allegiance of the town to your own.   Once the zone has been cleared of pirates, trade becomes possible, although be careful. After a while, a small pirate fleet will arrive and try to take the zone back.  Well, that's about as far as I've got, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable game, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of it.   Edit: I had a technical problem, where I couldn't create worlds or join them. Basically made the game unplayable. But, the technical support was brilliant. Mine was an odd problem which ended up having nothing to do with the game itself, but rather one of the Steam DLLs. Michael (the developer) was of great help in finding and fixing the problem with contact and new ideas each day until it was resolved.",

The maps are randomly generated and there are many regions to explore, each getting more difficult and requiring more skill and items The ships seem to have an endless ladder up to 11 ships currently in the game.  The combat may seem simple at first, but after you get the 'arcade' idea out of your head, you come to appreciate the MMO style weapons. You can bind the different cannons and shots to any key very easily. No GUI needed for that.  Trading and sailing are a lot of fun just in themselves. Figuring out how to max profits and create efficient routs take time, but once you get the hang of it, its really enthralling.  The game seems to have a slow, almost grindy progression, which actually helps with captivation rather than putting off new players.  Is this game as good as Sid's Pirates? Probably. Its very comparable and much more modern with a huge open world and multiplayer.  I'm looking forward too seeing where it goes, and I recommend you pick it up. It is well worth the money!",

This isn't a bad thing as I for one like a challenge and love being made to work for my rewards, however one thing this game lacks is the ability to stay interesting for lengthy periods of time if you're playing solo, which is something I would eventually like to see addressed though it's not the most important thing in the world.

(It's no Terarria, but Windward is up there)  A hack'n'slash game where the hacking and slashing is cannon fire and launching barrels of explosives/fire/old stinky fish toward enemy ships. Call it an ARPG (heavy on the Action, light on the RPG), and toss some (light) tower defense and (very light) RTS elements in to the mix for good measure.  Create your own custom map and factions or have the game make a random one. Manually set the challenge levels (level requirement) of each region in the map - tedious but also important if you want to, say, make a giant spiral map that goes from level 0-330 or higher (default is 0-39).  Pick a faction (*combat*/questing/trading/exploration) and set sail. Unlock more ships, better cannons, captain and crew. Level up and spend talent points unlocking new abilities and specializing in defense, offense, or support.  The combat is where the game really shines, and it's deeper than surface appearances.   Early on, pirates are rather easy to take out. In the higher challenge level regions you can no longer simply trade cannon fire. You will need to get better at staying in their 'blind spot' where they can't return fire. You will need to clear out enemy towers - which will quickly turn a winning battle into a losing one. Hire friendly nearby ships and send them off to create a distraction and buy you enough time to capture a town.  You can use guerilla hit and run tactics with a small, fast, high-damage 'Corvette' that can sail through smaller openings and shallower water. You may want to drop anchor in a huge tanky 'Ship of the Line' and soak up damage so your friendly ships can attack safely. You may choose to support your fleet by sailing a 'Galleon' and tossing out barrels of water that put out fires and heal your allies. Or maybe you want to try out the &lt;secret&gt; end-game unlockable ship that can be good at both damage and support but is extremely squishy.   However you decide to approach a new pirate-controlled region, it's some good fun and can be quite a challenge. To counter the 'too many pirates spawning' when trying to get the final town in a region - they cease respawning if you or one of your towers are in firing range of their harbor. Use explosives to dredge out a new canal to the town. They'll never see it coming. Fun times with moddable terrain once you find a construction kit.  The game is not for everyone. It can be frustrating at times. And it can feel a bit grindy and repetitive on the questing/trading side of things. But this can also be a tranquil relaxing time to de-stress from all your pirate murdering.  The majority of my play time is in single-player, but as with most any game, it only gets better when you play with friends (and sometimes strangers too).",

I mean he built a game intended for LAN play that somehow supported 300 simultaneous players in a single game instance running on his home server via cable modem! That is nutz! He added server limitation code after that to ensure more managable numbers since this was not intended as an MMO, but it shows the quality of his code work that it worked at all.

The sailing mechanic seems simpler than Pirates, but the combat is richer, with a number of skills to throw along with cannonball. The way I play, I spent a lot of time in each zone, including the starter zone, so moving to the next levels I had access to better ships than some might if they like to play through quickly. If you have enough speed and can 'cross the T', you can hold out against powerful ships.   One does need to be 'OK' with trade 'grinding', as that seems to be the only way to grow cities and subsequently get better ships. Personally I've liked this kind of mechanic since Elite, and after that Privateer (though both of those are first person flight, and Windward is top down looking very much like Pirates world).   It is a sandbox game, and in its current form, it might get too repetitive for some who aren't really into the premise. For me, though its a great find.   There have been a couple of updates already in the week since I got the game. I'm curious where the dev might go.

To start the game you make a map or join a server and pick one of four different factions, each with their own traits (combat, trade, exploration, questing). You start with a small little sail boat and overtime work your way up to big boy sail boats. Other than upgrading your boat, the other main goal seems to be capturing territory for your faction.   I really like this game because I enjoy the naval theme, however my main criticism would be that it starts off too slowly.

The Total War series had it somewhat right, but they lack the singular control which i savor a lot.   Those who know me, knows that I am quite fond of vehicular engagement in games. But for this once, I made the exception, mainly because I have a past with roleplaying and doing combat in SL, specifically in the same era as this game. So I thought; why not give it a shot?  I've been playing it on and off, and I've come to realize that Windward not only is a game reminding me about my old days where I played Overboard (The game is ancient and has graphics on the level of pre-FF7), but it struck me as being a highly amusing and semiinteractive game, both with the AI and if you invite friends along.  It is a defining game of its kind. Throw at me whatever you like of remarks about other games of this era or style, but it most likely wont get more than a snicker from me. It's hard to get me hooked on a game to this extent, and windward performed to a most satisfying degree.  The music is amazingly fitting (Albeit a bit repetitive when you've been junking the game for about five to six hours straight), the graphics are wonderful. The lighting, the shading, the details, the way the effects look with weapons firing, all adds up to create a nostalgic, entertaining mood.  The way the game handles, is simple; and even more simple when adding macros (Which are disgustingly simple to set up in-game). A brief introduction to basic naval tactics and you're set for combat. Navigation is amusing in the procedually created world. Want to do trading? Go for it! Wanna do diplomacy? Go for it! Fight pirates because you're a pirate! Ship customization for colors, crews, accessories, weapons, various sizes of ships, each with their perks for speed, defense and capacity.  If you want an entertaining game which is simple to get into, amusing to play and most efficient at Co-op, Windward is the game for you. It's a real hook.   ...

You can even create custom quests if you know some coding. This is reviewed in the workshop section. Still, these problems shouldn't exist. What's being sold here is really a game engine, not a game. Furthermore, mods don't really enhance the multiplayer aspect of the game since people don't play with them despite that's where the game thrives.)  I want to like this game. I really do, but it has a few seriously major problems:  The game plays very slow. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be an issue, but as an action RPG, the game needs to feel a little more arcadey and not so simulating. The game literally becomes a timesink of your real life time to achieve virtual progress, and at that, it's not that much. You just upgrade your ship and develop skills while expanding your faction's control of the map. It'd be a better use of one's time to make this a turn based game where you make career or campaign decisions instead of having to actually wait to do things.  On the other hand, for all the game is a timesink in the name of realism, sailing in the game isn't very realistic. You don't have to adjust your sail for the right point of attack to catch the wind. Yea, you sail faster with the wind than against it, but that's it. The game also doesn't make much difference between fore-and-aft versus square sails in how fore-and-aft sails are supposed to sail fastest at a 45 degree angle away from the wind while square sails are supposed to struggle much more with either sideways or backwards wind. A square sail ship shouldn't be able to move at all in many currents since the sail doesn't turn. Fore-and-aft ships don't have to use tacking to get from point a to point b, and weather doesn't change. Yea, the wind changes direction now and again, but there are never any choppy seas to sail through.  The singleplayer game has no narrative at all, so the quests you do are literally just sailing from point a to point b in exchange for points. This sort of mechanic works well in a multiplayer aspect where you're competing over efficiency and strategy to control the map among your friends, but in singleplayer, it's a pointless grind. On top of that, friendly AI boats bump into you all the time. There's no understanding of 'right of way' between smaller and bigger, slower and faster, forward and backward, or other different positions of ships.   The multiplayer game has a very small community, and is already dominated by elites who took charge with the Valiant faction. The other three factions have no chance of success unless you spend a ton of time developing your singleplayer profile and import it. Keep in mind that I've spent 15 hours by now just to reach level 34. The regions that Valiant doesn't control for you to start on the public server go into the 90s.   Also, understand that combat represents the climax of the game. Once you explore and trade a lot, the only thing left to do with your experience and money is spend it towards combat skills, bribing pirates or recruiting allies, and upgrading your ship and getting equipment. The Valiant faction succeeds in the climax. The other three factions are supposed to grow faster than it one way or another to reach their climaxes before it does, so once Valiant climaxes, it's pretty much game over for the other three.   Yes, you can host your own private game with friends or host your own server, but that's not something the game deserves credit for. It's an extra effort you have to make.  Also, yes, it's advertised that you can customize your own maps, but that doesn't mean anything beside choosing which tiles to deactivate in a square grid. Also, the public server isn't customized at all. It simply left every tile activated which means there's no direction in which way to expand. This wouldn't be a problem if the archipelagos had some real diversity to them, but they don't. Therefore, it just adds more monotony into the grind in order to secure your faction's borders.  Instancing in the game is what the game should be in general, but it's boring to instance on your own, and nobody really does it in multiplayer... unless they're importing their own superclassed ships.   All and all, the game is just passive-aggressively out of control. I don't expect the community to ever thrive because while the combat, trading, and exploration mechanics have potential, it just isn't handled very well. If the game played in 30-120 minute instances between 5 on 5 teams where everyone starts at the same level (like a MOBA), then the game would be great, but it doesn't.  Alternately, the game could be played in monthly seasons so people can have some sense of saved progress, but if the game doesn't reset periodically, then it will constantly alienate newcomers from joining while oldtimers dominate (which is exactly why I advise you, a newcomer, to not buy this game).",

The fact that pirates can turn on a dime and fire just as far as you, can aim farther with abilities, and do 2-3x the damage you do is rediculous.  DO NOT buy this game unless you are a masochist and have no friends.",

            "review_text": "The game is really relaxing and has nice graphics.  But it really lacks any depth. You can trade goods between ports, fight pirates, do quests, and capture/build some structures - which is not much to begin with, and on top of that each of these is a bit too simplistic.    Trading: Each port has literally a list of in-demand and in-excess goods that you can actually just see by looking at your map and hovering over the cities. Cross map trading is probably the most interesting since it requires you to remember what cities want, but when you travel between maps there's a loading screen.     Fighting is really simplistic - there's no aiming and only a few skills. Your ship will automatically fire on any enemies to the side, seemingly randomly picking one if there's more than one.     Questing is repetative. Quests are either a) fight some pirate, or b) go to another port (and maybe back), or c) build a strucutre (see below)    Building/capturing just requires you some basic resources (which you pick up from floating debris in the water) - and then just clicking a button and waiting for a long time.    The map is not an open world, but rather a grid of maps that you can travel between via loading screen. There's instances, but they offer nothing different - you still only focus on combat/trading.    There's various items you can equip - things like hulls, sails, crew, captains (Yea, as an item) - but all they do is change the stats of your ship a bit. The skill tree is mostly stat changes too, with a few activated skills you can invest in.  The game was interesting for a while and definitely a relaxing experience, but I feel that you learn all the mechanics in about a day, and then there's nothing interesting left to do.  Exploring really has no purpose, there's nothing unknown. There are unvisited areas, but you won't find anything unique there - just pirates and ports.  As it is, I do not recommend buying this.",
