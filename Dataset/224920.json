Turning the old-school mode on;  Edit:  Like many old-times characters, Raziel is on the likeable list of bad@ss-ery (together with others such as Fulgore, Predator etc) The intro is a classic and the saga starts very strong. The main theme is immortal, the voice acting is so good it makes nowadays games looking like a joke, the game was almost known solely for its good dialog 'cause they're like the work of some book's adaptation, the plot isn't cheesy at all and the gameplay used to be a new thing in gaming. It's an spiritual interdimensional power-to-continue kind of game, and a pretty creative one. So why you don't take a look on this old rare piece, are you affraid of the challenges of the old games? Don't care much for the artistic factor? At least my job is now done.   Some remarkable quotes:     'The birth of one of Kain's abominations traps the essence of life. It is this soul that animates the corpse you *lived* in.      'And this, Raziel, is the demise of Nosgoth.'     'Become my... Soul Reaver. My angel of death.'     'I would choose oblivion over this travesty.'     'As Melchiah and Zephon fell before my blade... the Reaver was consumed with my rage and I was intoxicated by its bloodlust. '  ",

There is so much lore and history to discover in these games. SoulReaver is technically the second game if you put the games in release order with BloodOmen being the first, but it's set far in the future of all the other games. This may be a little confusing with some of the characters dialogs because they often refer to events which the player would not have witnessed (yet). This for me is what has kept me curious of the whole history of Nosgoth and wanting to play more.   In this game you'll experience a unique concept, puzzles and gameplay. Exploration is rewarding and the story will make you want to uncover the truth behind Kains evenful actions. If you love vampires, a dark gothic atmoshpere and a gripping plot you'll love these games!!!!",

Many might knock this because of the graphics, however this is just a port from a ps1 game. The entire franchise has an amazing storyline to tell too. There is lots to do and for some it can take time to get into the story and play enjoyably, it is rather good. The puzzles that are dotted around the game isn't seem much anymore, at least not in the games I've played, and although an old game these puzzles do in fact provide a rather stiff challenge in some areas, even needing the assistance of guides.  This game, or at least, this version of it, although good for its story and such, the port is rather bad. I say you should get an original copy on the ps1 and play that or find some alternate way... Emulators are able to play games as though they were on there original consoles and as such can provide controller capabilities, which, sadly this version lacks.   There are also constant texture glitching, now this simply could be my system at fault, however it appears as though it's an actual fault with the port.   Get this game if you don't own it another way, or at least have a good long playthrough.",

The puzzles are a nice touch as well, although they tend to rely very heavily on the 'move a block strategically' idea. The only criticism I have is that the PC port has somewhat dicey control at times. I couldn't get my gamepad to work with it, so I had to use the keyboard, which isn't the easiest way to play this otherwise timeless classic.",

Well i would say yes but Blood Omen 1 to me rivals it but the Soul Reaver beats it by being more popular and by my guess that it introtuced more people the series.  Now about the game. The combat in today's stantards is not great but its simple, its not bad and the only need to actually kill enemies(theres 4 or 5 exceptions that make killing necessary actually) is to restore health... or because they are being annoiyng like not letting you solve a puzzle, or because you are playing with a super vampire turned wraith and just want to kill something.  It also some platforming, and puzzles i would say they are easy, but that might be because i remember everything about this game when i was a kid. But best things about this game are its story, the dialogue, the atmosphere and how the music fits perfectly with the atmosphere.  Unfortunely the port wasn't able to bring the 'dinamic music' so the music won't change when you are in combat, solving a puzzle, and every boss has the same music has the first one, Sad ;(  Can't really say any downsides since i have nolstalgia googles on, i didn't find any bugs either.",

            "review_text": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is the second game in the Legacy of Kain series, changing up the formula from a top down hack and slash to a third person puzzle platformer with heavy Zelda influences. Taking place some fifteen thousand years after Blood Omen you play as Raziel, one of Kain’s lieutenants who started to evolve past the Kain and he did not like that. The plot can be summed up as Raziel growing wings, Kain being jelly that he did not have wings, then deciding to break said wings and toss Raziel into a water vortex to send him into a painful death… there is more to it than that but without spoiling anything that’s the gist of it. Raziel stays dead for about five hundred more years before the Elder God brings him back to life as a wraith because vampires have taken over the world and he’s not getting enough souls to reincarnate which causes the land to decay, so he needs a ‘Soul Reaver’ to help kill off some vampires and what better one to use then one who would have a reason to go to hell and back to kill the vampire lord Kain?  Overall the plot is solid, I enjoy the story and the feel of the gothic world they created and it stands the test of time, delivering great writing and voice acting which considering Amy Hennig of now Uncharted fame was the director, it is not a surprise. On top of that the graphics still somewhat hold up and for its time I am sure it was an amazing looking game. Now it has that PS1-era fabulous polygon look to it but even still I enjoyed the look of the game.  However that being said it is -very- hard for me to recommend this game in this day and age. Combat with vampires is horrible with repetitive button mashing and having to find a way to ‘kill’ the vampire, which means beating him up enough to toss him onto spikes or into sunlight and then eating the soul to make sure it doesn’t come back. Because of this I found myself in the later stages completely avoiding all combat as much as I could, only fighting off creatures in puzzle rooms. The puzzles are the second core part of the game, and for the most part they still hold up at being challenging while never being too frustrating, though near the end they start to feel like busywork as you do pretty much the same puzzle three or four times in a row, sliding blocks around to match up some picture on the floor being the major offender of this.  This all hinges on you knowing where you need to go however and the game does a bad job of telling you. It’s ambitious for its time to make this open world with a realm shifting mechanic allowing you to switch between a material and spectral world with the environment sometimes changing between the two, but when you are actually trying to get from point A to B and move the story along and the Elder God tells you its north of somewhere, you’re going to have a somewhat hard time figuring out just where he mean and how to get there.  The controls are straight up bad and at many times unresponsive, I found myself falling off ledges tiny ledges due to how fast you jump or how hard the gliding is to control and because of this the dungeons become a slog very quickly, when the game asks you to do lots of platforming you’ll want to tear your hair out and smash your keyboard when one little mess-up makes have to walk all the way back to where you were before. And the bosses… oh my how they are horrible. Pretty much all the bosses are puzzle bosses because you can’t really fight them directly, but once you figure out the puzzle they all become incredibly easy, breaking down to smashing a few windows or pulling a few switches at the right time.  Overall I can’t recommend this game. As much as I love the mood, tone, story, and characters, at the end of the day it is still a game you have to play and after about ten hours of tedious platforming and combat just to get an ending that gives you the middle finger and explains nearly nothing I was done. I can sum up the gameplay as ‘Off-brand Zelda’ in that you fight through dungeons, solve puzzles, fight a boss, and get a new power to help you out but it all just feels worse than how Zelda or other platformers of the same ilk do it.",
