The music is good if you're a trance fan and the gameplay is good if you're a big fan of grazers, otherwise there are cool patterns that drag on too long if you don't graze to charge your meter. All the bullets are red and kinda ugly and there's little offered visually as a whole. A worthwhile purchase if you're bored or want the complete set, but completely bypassable if you're on a budget or just want to get to the meat of the series--2nd and 3rd are exponentially better in every way.",

The music is probly the best, and only good aspect of this game. Colours 3/10. My eyes got cancer. Red for every bullet. EVERY BULLET. Hitboxes 2/10 I've encounted some pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hitboxes in my time, but this...this is something special. Waifu's ???/10. Game is in moonspeak. Cant understand any character development, assume there is some.  My biggest problem is when using the slow function, you cant see your defined hitbox. All I see is a blinding, rotating star that looks like it could have lead the 3 wise men to baby Jesus.  Overall, I give this game a steamingturd / 10.",

You play one of three girls specially trained by the Catholic Church in the ways of magic, each with different attack paterns to hunt down vampires. Bullet hell games often require a lot of patience to graciously dodge the enemy projectiles and like the Touhou series has a focus on story driven character boss battles. It's a game that requires a lot of patience but is a lot of fun.  Only downside about this particular game is that the controll is not optimized for analog sticks nor is it translated from Japanese. You'll need to download at patch to get it in English.",

EDIT: go through forums. there's a fix for language and a fix for fps. although.... the company themselves should be fixing this, not the customers.  Even as is, totally worth the $1 i paid for it.  Extremely underrated compared to the rest of the series. the extremely long boss battles actually somewhat add to the gameplay, I think... kind of a mental endurance game. Soundtrack is great. Shibuyan's also done a ton of Touhou Project arranges as well. ;)   The game developers should push for steam acheivements, leaderboards, and some soundtrack dlc, etc. There's a lot of potential here that's being missed out on.",

            "review_text": "eXceed isn't a terrible game, but it is an entirely inessential one. It gets the fundamentals of a bullet hell game right but does nothing unique to distinguish itself, and with so many other similar, better games to choose from (including two superior sequels) I'm at a loss to come up with any reason to spend time with it. The overly compressed graphics and audio, and the inability to save or continue a previous game also cause it to feel particularly dated and archaic, presuming you actually manage to make it work.  I can't exactly call it broken, but eXceed has major problems running on modern computers. For reasons I'm still unclear about it's virtually impossible to get the originally intended 60fps on anything but ancient hardware, and with the speed of the game directly tied to the frame rate less than that is functionally like playing in slow motion. With enemies and bullets moving at a snails pace the action changes from fun and challenging to downright boring. I'm not joking when I say I had more trouble keeping myself awake than completing the first three levels, at which point I just couldn't take it anymore.  Outside of for free I wouldn't recommend eXceed, and even then only to those with an old computer lying around to play it on. Everyone else can skip straight to the sequels and not miss anything, as the original is now little more than a placeholder.",

Catch it on the right sale and you can get it for free once you sell the trading cards.  CONS - Low resolution (640x480 which can't be changed). No English.
