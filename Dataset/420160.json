I have never experienced either crash, and the controls are very intuitve.  Alphabeats is a great game to play when you have some time to kill. You can use your own music to play the game, and it also helps you figure out just how good your own vocabulary is. You can even have contests to see who has faster reflexes and thinking.  10/10 would recommend.",
