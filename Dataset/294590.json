            "review_text": "So, I first saw this game as a demo back when XP was the latest and greatest.....  It just as brilliant then as now.  Yes, the levelling system is grindy, and people get stuck on scenery from time to time, and just DON'T get on a horse (the controls are god-awful), but the game is FUN! Kill hundreds of englishmen (for once they're the bad guys!) and somehow it doesn't get old......  I've completed this game on easy, and the storyline is pretty good, with some optional side quests that generally give you a worth-while reward. The cut scenes use the same engine as the game (except the ending) and the dialogue is pretty good, even if bordering on the cheesy (and for those OCD out there the text doesn't match the speech). Also - the soundtrack, whilst it can eventually get a bit irritating, as it tells you there's an enemy just out of sight.... the soundtrack is magnificent.  I've had no issues with the game on Win7, so I can only presume those who are having issues are on other OS's.....  If you've played the demo before and liked it or you think you'll like it - buy it! If you don't think you will, buy it when it comes on sale, and you might just be a convert...",

            "review_text": "Kill Englishmen as Joan of Arc, in this 100 years old war historic fiction game. Yes. Kill Englishmen. They want the French throne, its the 1300's and using Joan, you single handedly get to thwart and kill them for trying. Relive battles from this epic war as akin to '' Dynesty Warriors'' to fight to level up your gear, your stats and gain a larger troops through 8 beefed up missions. I say ''beefed up'' because they start small, there are large maps and the sub quests are lengthy. Its not that quick and easy as you thought. WAR just isnt. The quests/ missions revolve around mainly The Basterd of Orleans and the defence of the French city and the villages around it. Use Joan or and other French commanders she befreinds to complete the missions. All have diffrent fighting styles and weapons to your choosing. ( I stuck with Joan as being a pretty solid one handed sword user with top commander stats) . With French like classical music, sound effects of clashing armor and swords with accents, the game is pretty solid. The graphics and game play remind me of old Nitendo 64 games and runs rather well. The combat style sometimes can get jumpy, but its not so harsh. Yes, you have to learn gameplay and easily can be cut down by muarading English swords or pikemen, but thats the skill part that needs to be learned. Overal a massive army hack and slash for you French, I think its a fun one to play along with Total war and other like games. Kinda of a Age of Empires first person thing going on...   ",

            "review_text": "First review ever, have to warn, even at such a low price this is a laughably bad game.  Pros: The music and voice acting are at least average for the dated title  Cons: Glitches ruined the entire experience from level 1. Basic controls are ugly. Your sword often swings straight through common enemies to no effect. The auto targeting gets me confused as it makes 180s to target enemies you aren't even engaging. Enemy commanders go invincible whenever they attack, maybe suppose to make them harder or just waist more time dealing with them. Attacking downed enemies only seems to work by luck as downed enemies tend to teleport to safety because of poor collisions. Don't even try to ride a horse, you'll end up inside it surrounded by enemies you can't fight.   If you feel like getting frustrated, give it a go, but I would recommend just playing a Dynasty Warriors title.",
