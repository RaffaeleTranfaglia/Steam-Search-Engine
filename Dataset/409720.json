I have managed to play through Bioshock 1 Remastered, although it crashes randomly sometimes and will delete all but the autosave on some ocassions. Until they fix the issues (if they do) I would say hold off on buying the remastered versions and instead just play the originals because there is nothing new other than a graphics update.

But, there's no excuse for a game that has 8 broken Achievements.  The longer version: even though the game has a good story and mechanics (though I had to change the keymappings a bit), and even though I'm apparently one of the rare ones who didn't suffer from graphical glitches or the fatal 'Press Space to Continue' crash, along with those broken Achievements, the game is just as tedious as BioShock 1 (assuming you're going for Achievements). The biggest difference between BioShock 1 and BioShock 2 is the change to the hacking mini-game: now, it's a mindless muscle-twitch activity instead of the 'make a tube' activity of before. At first, I thought that might have relieved the tedium a bit. But, no. It's actually worse. So, I'm sad to say that I've got to Not Recommend the game. If they ever fix the Achievements, it might be OK. But, with them broken, nope.",

Just my hud elements and black. I know the game is running, and I know I can get things to appear on particular settings, but none of which that is at a good FPS and still looks crisp and clean.  I was EXCITED to hear this get a remaster. The whole Bioshock collection and its spinoff Infinite getting this nice treatment when we'll probably never get another Bioshock.  But I wish I had actually read the user reviews before buying.  The consolation? This product comes with the old, none remastered version.  I'd recommend getting this ONLY if you're an absolute diehard fan in hopes that this eventually gets patched up to where it needs to be (it's only had two patches and several dozen of these types of issues since its release between then and now). Otherwise, the only other reason to get this is that it comes with the old version. If you're wanting to actually play this game; you're best off just buying the old version and forgetting this one exists for the time being.",

Especially after playing the first game, you'll notice how little effort was put into originality. The game is also incredibly easy compared to the first game. While I was able to play through the first game on Survivor difficulty with 1 life, it was still incredibly challenging but also rewarding. This game however takes a major step down in difficulty. I was able to get through this one on hard with 1 life with almost 0 challenge. If you've never played Bioshock 2 and you're curious as to how it's held up over the years I'd say pick it up on a sale, but if you're looking for a Bioshock game worthy of being called a sequel to the first, go pick up Bioshock Infinite.",

Issues that I excountered: The game will randomly crash which is a bit annoying but I save often, but the crashes are inexcusable in my opinion and should be fixed. I've also incountered some texture streaming issues where the super low res would persist, but switch when I am in very close proximity, not sure why due to my specs.  My experience: The options menu is quite fair for an avid PC user, but the UI scaling is some of the best I've seen in any game. I was able to downsample this from 4k onto a 1080p monitor without any of the downsides that I expected. I expected to have slow mouse control, the UI to be super tiny, blurry font/game, among various other issues.  I never got into the originals but b1's remasted version grabbed me by surprise and now Im on a roll. The entire game was buttery smooth when using nVidia's 'Fast' vsync option  Good: Buttery Smooth Great UI scaling  Great Mouse Scaling and customization  Bad: Random Crashes, probably every 30~320+mins, usually after an intense scene settles Texture streaming issues Some options were not described(like what form of AA?

            "review_text": "So far so good. Got up to Siren's Alley without a single problem on this Remastered. Now this doesn't mean the remaster is perfect, there's still quite a few people who are experiencing problems. But I'm only reviewing my own personal experience so please keep that in mind.   The game seems to run perfectly fine. Graphics are all by default set to the maximum values of the original with additional textures added into this remaster on characters and weapon models. I haven't seen anything that really stands out as being different otherwise like the remaster of the first game, but I'm sure there's quite a few additions.   One issue that I've encountered that's rather minor is some low framerates when you first load a new level. It doesn't happen every time, but as the atlantic express is slowly approaching the next stop, i'll rotate the camera and notice the framerate is significantly lower than it should be. By the time I'm actually capable of walking around, the framerate is perfectly normal, but it is reason for concern.    Aside from that, the game appears to functioning fine with no audio hitches, graphical artifacting, crashing, or bugs. And I have to say, it's a shame that Bioshock 2 is so often overlooked. It's a very interesting game with a lot of improvements over the first game. It has the same fantastic voice acting quality and story telling capabilities as the first. I particular like the audio recording stories of Mel, a father that discovers Rapture as he searches for what happened to his little girl and learns about rapture piece by piece with each audio recording. The fact that this story takes place several years after the events of the first game also makes for an interesting setting as rapture is more ocean than city at this point. Coral and barnacles line the hallways and the splicers look horrible deformed with disgusting growths on their limbs. It's a great presentation coupled with some much needed improvements to the game's combat that makes for a great experience.   Again, it's a shame that not everyone is having as much luck as I am with this remastered version, but I can happily say that I personally am not having any issues and perhaps you won't either.",

The most recent one is 2-3 levels back. Im not going to finish it. I had been waiting for a fix for years. Was totally excited when I heard they were going to remaster it. Its not a remaster. Its a 64bit patch and some retexturing. All of the problems and bad decisions made by devs in the original are here to stay.  Pros: Looks a little better  Cons: Controls are terrible Not all keys are can be mapped Stock key settings are terrible (see above) Camera and movement are terrible (open console and use 'setFOV XX' for some relief) During battles player can get stuck on basically everything and even invisible objects Live stream cuts FPS in half (or worse) Cant tell what it going on with their mouse settings-disabling still doesnt give a true feeling CRASH + SAVES DELETED!  Dont buy this. 2K is taking the DICE strategy (like reskinning SW Battlefront and calling it BF1). I really wish they took the time to actually address and fix the issues this game had. And its not lik they cant make a good, working FPS (hello Borderlands series!)  Luckily I got this for free because I had owned the entire series. BS1 remastered worked fine. Never crashed. Any minor issues a player could have can easily be tweaked and fixed. I guess I'll just read the wiki to know the story here. Had I bought this I wouldve asked for a refund.

Similar to how BioShock 1 and Infinite are deconstructions of Objectivism and Religous Fanaticism, respectively, 2 has a strong narrative that focuses on and is a deconstruction of Altruism, which is essentially the polar opposite of the Ayn Rand-inspired ideologies of the first game. The villain of BioShock 2 isn't nearly as compelling or interesting as Andrew Ryan (not like you could ever top him), but the game doesn't suffer as a result of it.  All in all, BioShock 2 is a MUST buy for fans of the series. It IS worthy of the BioShock name, and I'm kicking myself for not playing this game sooner. The first half is a bit of a slog, but after you finish both the game and the absolutely fantastic DLC 'Minerva's Den' it will give 1 and Infinite a run for their money in regards to being the best BioShock game.",

            "review_text": "First off let me just say the Bioshock series is awesome! I love the storyline and the gameplay is fantastic. I have been a big fan of the series since it first came out. That being said I was hesitant to pick up this re-mastered version for a long while due to all the reviews of it being buggy and crashing constantly. I decided to take the leap and I purchased the whole collection on steam, even though I have the original cd's. I have been playing for a few hours now and I have not had a single glitch or crash. I am playing the game at 4k resolution with vsync and all the other extra graphic settings. I am very pleased with the updated graphics. Obviously they are not as crisp as they are in infinite but they are still a great deal better IMO.  UPDATE: After playing for 16 hours the game is a little buggy but not unplayable.(it just makes the game that much more challenging) It has crashed on me maybe twice so far. My opinion stands however that this game is still worth the purchase.",

Protector and boss battles are total pain and quicksaving gives you disadvantage after loading. If you have enough time to waste, save every 15 seconds.  Also I had to download that hotfix for crash at new game. Good job 2k.",
