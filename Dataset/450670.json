            "review_text": "Table Top Racing is a very aptly named game, because you race around on various sorts of tabletop surfaces. I'm not sure about the World Tour part, though I did see an American Flag in one level and a Union Jack in another, which I guess are flags corresponding to different parts of the world. Four out of five words is pretty good for a title.  Now I couldn't really make my mind up on whether I liked this game or not. I spent an extra five or so hours more than I feel this game deserved trying to decide. The graphics seem to lend to an illusion of this game being much better than it really is, at least for me as someone who enjoys racing games quite a bit. The flaws to the game and total lack of documentation on certain game features lend to my depreciating opinion on the game.  I know a lot of people will compare this to similar games on Steam like Toybox Turbos or Super Toy Cars and I'd definitely put this on a similar quality level. The graphics are much better but the gameplay lets it down a fair bit.  The handling model is incredibly simple and doesn't interact at all with the physics. If your car is acting under physics, whether you hit an object, got rammed or just landed after a jump, you have no control over your car until that stops. You have very mild 'air control' which is the same level of control you have while on the ground. This means the most powerful weapon in the game is ramming someone from the inside on a corner and makes the handling feel very inconsistent. Not to mention, the physics system itself isn't perfect by any means after landing from certain jumps or even little bumps in the track I've had my car rocket in total random directions. The very simple handling model and poor physics implementation means the meat of the game, the actual driving, is very hit and miss. I could forgive it if the game didn't force jumps on every track but every long race I was just constantly in fear of the next jump destroying my chances of coming 1st.  The AI doesn't offer much challenge either, none of them take any shortcuts, they all follow one racing line and drive at set speeds and only ever fire their weapons at you. This means the best events become the Time Trials, Hot Laps and Drift Events since all of the Combat Race style Events are braindead easy provided the physics don't screw you over. This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing either, but there's no Single Race mode, you can't pick any of the tracks you've raced on, pick a mode and some settings and have some fun. You have to race on their preset events, whether they're in the Championships or Special Events. There might be a track you really want to drift on with your favorite car, but unfortunately you're not able to. They're working on local multi-player, so perhaps this could come in a future update, but as of writing this review, this feature's not in the game.  There's also a lot of undocumented features. Lots of weapons in the game counter a weapon and are countered by another. Like bombs attracting Heatseeking Missiles or the Electricity blowing up the Bombs. Some of the pink glowing things on the side of the track are Shortcuts which can be opened by hitting them with a Level 2 powerup, the things that aren't shortcuts usually toss some debris on the track. There's a boost start you can use at the start of the race somehow which was recently added in an update. There's also a lot of little things on the tracks you wouldn't be able to find out without making a serious effort to. Like the orange GO! Sushi signs on the Sushi shop track actually being little doors you can drive through. Or the Circular Saw on the Workbench track actually hiding a shortcut you can take. I understand some of these things are meant to be 'secrets' but if you have some shortcuts highlighted and others not it doesn't really make sense. It's just confusingly inconsistent for no real reason. The level 2 weapons are also locked at the beginning of the game for some reason so you don't even really know they exist, which means things like shortcuts are unavailable to you as well.  Now the Drift Mode for the game, even though I've been decidedly negative about it this whole review, I found to be quite enjoyable. The DLC also adds an AE86 that's 'Legendary' for drifting, so I spent a good amount of time sliding around in the few available drift events I could use that car in. I'd personally say it's the best part of the game even if it's limited. There's also another great undocumented 'feature' in that a lower handling rating makes a car drift better. Especially useful on cars with lower drift ratings and high handling ratings like the Supercars.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game just because I hate the way the physics are handled. For a casual racing game player, once you start racing on the more difficult tracks I could see the difficulty spiking way up, especially with all the hidden things that aren't really common sense. For someone more experienced, the game won't challenge anything except your patience with the poor physics. A little more effort and it could have been a brilliant game.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those I LOVE THIS GAME but I wouldn't reccomend it reviews. Here's why: 1. Almost no one is ever online, which sucks, because when there was, there was a lot of customization you could have in every game. EX. Set track, Set cars (or only one kind of car), set all or select rims (like drift rims, bouncy rims) and my personal favorite NO UPGRADE option, because you know, you can upgrade your cars or have them race like 50CC in mario kart. But overall, having no one online to ENJOY these features takes a major draw out of the game for me. 2. Following number one, the tracks are well done, music is kind of....well decent(?). But the problem is that I can only enjoy the same variety of tracks so many times because of the gameplay mechanics.  3. Following number three, Gameplay mechanics are really simple, which in most cases are great! But it feels really lackluster here, it just feels almost....uncomplete.   SO IN SHORT STORY MODE: No one is playing online, it has great variety in ways to play the game but lacks overall gameplay mechanics to keep it interesting in single player mode, the music is somewhat of a turn off and the tracks get redundant. THERE'S JUST SO MUCH TO BE WANTED. Give me a car shunting system instead of just simply ramming the car and falling off with them and I would think the game is great for the whole 'TABLETOP' experience. ....Oh man....that wasn't really short story was it....?

            "review_text": "Basically a modern Micro Machines, what's not to like? Nicely and what can only be described as 'charmingly' detailed little tracks and just generally rather good visuals for what it is, tight handling cars, well some of 'em anyway, there's a surprisingly distict feel to a lot of the cars and some are definitely more suited to drifting than others. More charm is thrown in with the references to real cars and their descriptions and liveries, it was clearly made by people who like car culture or at least know people that do. :) The game modes and power ups are a pretty standard, run of the mill sort of affair, nothing to complain about but nothing to get excited over either. A.I is plenty competent as is the multiplayer which if you can manage to get the full 8 people is incredibly tense as these kart racer type games always are as you can go from first to last in no time and vice-versa. Oh and punctuating the whole experience is a funky and very catchy soundtrack.",

            "review_text": "My god.. this is beautiful!  I'm a diehard Re-Volt fan - probably spent a good 1000 hours playing it through the years and still play it every now and then. And well, this is the best spiritual successor I've ever seen.  First, the technical part: graphics are amazing, sounds are great and soundtrack is unbelievable good.  The gameplay itself is great. The tracks design looks more inspired in Micro-Machines than Re-Volt, but the race action is absolutely Re-Volt-like. Frantic battles, tracks obstacles, jumps, pits, and, of course, power ups! While most of power-ups are already staples from the genre (and some related genres, like Mario Kart), they managed to introduce a innovative weapon design with Frostbite Weapon.  Another great innovation is the wheels choice: basically a extra power-up for your own car.  I could find only two minor downsides: the cars feels too heavy - meaning impact from other cars or weapons won't send it flying away.. I personally think it would fit the arcade-like style of the RC-race/battle genre.  The other downside is the length of the tracks: although I get the design idea of TableTop racing (as opposed to whole museums and supermarket in Re-Volt), the tracks are way too short.  However, as stated, they're very minor downsides which doesn't hinder the fun at all. Table Top Racing is an amazing game, I had a blast playing single AND multiplayer (lets hope people keep playing it!) and finally, after 17 years, someone managed to develop a game to live up to Re-Volt standard.",

The only problem with the game, it uses Unity Engine in borderless mode and there are framepacing issues and some stuttering here and there. You can mitigate a bit using '-window-mode exclusive -force-d3d9' in steam for game launch parameters and using a 60 fps limit in nvidia inspector game profile or RTSS.",

            "review_text": "Can you remember the RC Revolt games? If so, then copy and paste a glowing review for that game here. Better than Micro Machines, if for no ther reason than the cars. TTR:WT has better cars. They're awesome, but I worry that there aren't enough 'vanilla' cars, and any extra are going to be paid DLC. I'm not against paid DLC at all, as long as the base game has enough to start with. Please release some free cars to make the base game more attractive to customers, who will then buy more out of choice, and not feel forced in to it. Game runs really well, looks great, and even the sound is pretty good too. The cars are really cool, and the handling is good. The level design is a lot like Micro Machines. The game's title should tell you that, but I do think more scenarios are needed.  In short, the base game is a little light on cars and scenarios, but it's cheap enough, and plays really well. Worth a buy.",
