            "review_text": "Machinarium is unique in so many ways, which makes it difficult to write about. It's also one of those games that is best experienced firsthand rather than after reading a spoiler-ridden review. As much as I'd like to lecture on about something that impacted me so greatly, I'm left with very little to work with; but what's there to discuss paints a picture of a masterpiece.  Visually, Machinarium takes a Victorian children's book illustration style and blends it with dystopian psuedo-steampunk imagery. It's not only as striking as that description suggests but it adds layer upon layer to the gameplay and storyline. Characters and scenes are beautifully hand-drawn and painstakingly animated to bring life to the citizens of the eponymous metropolis. When I say life, I mean it metaphorically as the cast are entirely robotic; their endearing movements and actions convince you that they're genuine creatures, acting out of circuitry or as puppets.  The whole game is a juxtaposition. The pure and sweet protagonist stands brightly against the grim, dank underbelly of the city whilst the dark despair of obsolescence and helplessness is often paired with love and hope. There's a great story to be discovered without ever uttering a single word, written or spoken. That alone is a remarkable feat but the characters you meet along the way are just as impressively fleshed. From the musical troupe in need of new instruments to the brutish and bullying pair that serve as antagonists; so many moments will ring in your mind when you reminisce years later, which is a powerful statement.  I don't personally enjoy point and click adventures very often as I find they can sometimes be generic, predictable and require great leaps in logic. There are always exceptions, especially when it comes to LucasArts game, but lumping Machinarium into that category does little to help explain just why it's something every gamer should experience. It's on a par with the bests but ultimately nothing like them except in some key ingredients. The puzzles are frequent and never bordering on torturous like say 7th Guest, but they will certainly test you at times. It's a story-focused experience without sacrificing those times where you need to take a step back and hope for a eureka moment.  There are moments where I wish you could walk across scenes a little faster, but the protagonist's gentle hobbling is endearing and easily forgiven. Puzzles that prove an irritation are quickly overshadowed by the sheer genius of the next. I'd have liked less of the retro-gaming elements but that comes down purely to preference. I can raise minor criticisms but there are no dealbreakers, nothing that will make distract from how compelling it becomes to see through Josef's quest to reunite with his girlfriend. What Machinarium does, it does extremely well.  As with many games of the genre, it's a fairly brief journey, clocking in at around two hours if you're adept. It's not the longest game by any means and the ending is abrupt and slightly underwhelming but it manages not to overstay its welcome. The brevity does nothing to impact a powerful tale that had me smiling at several moments; you can put a value on the length of a game but it's much harder to put a value on something that makes you feel.",

Since all the characters are robots and speak gibberish, but the story is cleverly told through recognizable pictures, gestures etc.  The hand drawn art style is very unique, and gives it its charm. The characters are fun and quirky, especially the main guy, with his ability to contort his body.  All puzzles are easy to understand, but challenging too.",

The point-and-click system could have benefited with a little more clarity about what’s clickable and what isn’t, but once you get the hang of things it’s easier to figure that out. There’s a good mix of straight-up puzzles, logic games, and find/create the right item challenges. I used a fair amount of trial and error, but reaching the solutions was satisfying, and  most  of them made sense. (There is a hint system that’s available, but I ended up not using it because I’m stubborn.) In terms of story, there’s no dialogue in the game, but every now and then the characters will use thought bubbles with animated drawings to “talk” or recall background information. The art style reminds me of concept art - not polished, but instead focused on evoking feeling, and the soundtrack is written similarly. Overall it’s a very well crafted game best suited for players who are patient and want puzzles that make them think.",

            "review_text": "I was fortunate enough to pick this game up in a bundled sale a little while ago. It was also my first experience with a point-and-click adventure game, and I have to say that it did a great job convincing me to play more in this genre. The art style is wonderful, with a rough and hand-drawn feel to the environment and characters, while important items stand out just enough to notice them without losing the immersion in each area. The setting and the story feel very rich without any words or text throughout the entire game, though sometimes it feels like you're not accomplishing anything, just finding things to click on.  The puzzles in the game are varied and plenty, testing your spatial reasoning, forethought, attention to detail, and in a few cases, reaction time. While collecting items to propel the story, there are times when you'll be carrying three or four different things around, but it rarely goes past that, and figuring out which items to combine is never a struggle. Some of the obstacles actually require you to use items separately, but in conjunction with each other, which took me a good deal longer than I care to admit to figure out how it was supposed to work.  There are times you'll sit in front of your computer, just thinking 'I don't know what to do...' for 10 minutes, and some of the puzzles are so frustrating that you might just force your way through them instead of thinking through it; however, I don't believe those moments detract from the game that much, because even when you're wandering aimlessly, not noticing that one item sitting on the ground that would let you move on, you're still treated to a beautiful environment and great music which creates a perfect atmospheric feel to the experience.  Overall, I think this game is worth playing, and I don't think $10 is too much to spend on it. There are a few thing's I would have liked different, but that might be because of my inexperience in the genre. It is a challenging, engaging game that will give you 3-6 hours of fun the first time through. The biggest issue for me is replay value, and a second time through will let you focus on the story instead of the puzzles, which I consider a good enough reason to play again.",

The adventure starts with you laying in a scrapheap figuring out how to piece yourself together. And once you get past that little puzzle, you quickly realise this is not an easy game... The puzzles are definitely more inline with the difficultly of the 16bit area of video gaming, not that it is a bad thing thing. The difficulty of the game naturally fits in with the aesthetics of the art, one can spend so long on certain puzzles, it gives plenty of time to admire the sheer beauty of the hand drawn art. The puzzles are creative and fresh, with a strong touch of quirkiness and humour with every completion. The music is easy on the ears and integrates with the games deep atmosphere. My criticisms of Machinarium would be that pointer can be a little imprecise, also if you move Josef while he is in tall or shot form, he hobbles along at a tedious pace. And the game does not offer any video settings, on certain monitors it can appear 'boxed'. Besides these minor setbacks, Machinarium is a beautiful work of art and a solid puzzle game full of humour, unique surprises and character. I strongly recommend this one.",

Addition as of 12/5/2015:  To elaborate, Machinarium does not play to the genre's strengths. It does not make many meaningful strides to get you to soak in its lustrous environments. The environments are... not quite lustrous either, which contributes to this disengagement. It needed to utilize the environments way more for it to be considered a really great point and click adventure game. Just see The Secret of Monkey Island: that game makes such excellent use of its environments, backgrounds, and setting, that it's no wonder why it's lauded as one of the BEST point and click adventure games ever made. Machinarium, on the other hand, is very amateur and did not make nearly as great an effort in immersing you within the game world.",

The setting and tone put me in mind of a Pixar silent film in 2D, with a moderate amount of puzzles, and the addition of a few minigames. Some of the puzzles were quite challenging, but fun, and often logical and solvable if given appropriate thought and study. When I needed a little nudge in the right direction, the ability to access in-game hints was nice. And for when you're really stumped, the inclusion of the comic-strip style handbook of solutions (accessed via a minigame) means you never have to go outside the game to find your answer. This is appropriate for those who enjoy the adventure game genre, but are not willing to grind through the tedium of puzzles that are beyond their ability to solve (myself included).  The artistic style and settings contribute to a somber mood, yet the robotic characters and their animations have a light-hearted and endearing quality. It is a place of quiet meditation, where you become aware of every texture, every sound, and all the small creatures going about their small business. Then there are special moments that bring forth a smile from the deepest parts of your being. One of my personal favorites was the final performance of the street-corner musicians.

Point-and-clicks are known for beautiful, often hand-drawn, character and background art, and as you can see from the trailer and screenshots. The genre hinges on having an interesting setting that the player will want to explore, and the rusty, robotic city of Machinarium fulfills that purpose wonderfully. However, the most infamous part of the genre is the puzzles, some of which were so unintuitive and infuriating that people often blame them from killing the genre. Machinarium has a variety of puzzles of different types, and it has some of the best deductive reasoning problems I’ve ever seen. Players will often times be presented with a machine, and they must use trial and error to learn what each button and lever does. However, for every one or two brilliant puzzles, there is an infuriating pixel hunt that drags the game down.  Also the demo of the game is a tad misleading. During the demo, the player will be confined to a small area with a clever deductive reasoning problem. While the best moments of the full game are like this, you will also have to deal with moments when you must backtrack through areas you have already been to find that one item that blends in with the background. In other words, the demo only represents the good parts of the game, so if you don’t care for the demo, you won’t like the full version. However, if you are willing to keep a walkthrough open in your web browser for the unintuitive puzzles, you can have a really excellent time in Machinarium",

That might make it sound a little easy; but the thing is, while the book is open you cannot see the rest of the screen; and whenever you close the book, you must replay the minigame to reopen it.

Figuring out what to do next was usually no problem due to a helpful 'idea bubble' button, and there's also an INCREDIBLY WELL-ILLUSTRATED built-in walkthrough just in case.

Most of the time you'll have to complete a string of actions before getting to the next screen and more often to solve some brain-teasers to proceed.

One of the best parts of the game is the hint mechanic where you play a little minigame if you need a hint about a puzzle. Charming and well designed.",
