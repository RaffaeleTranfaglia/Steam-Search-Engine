Oh, and if they say you lose connection before you even make your first move, those tokens you spent to play that map are gone. There is no such thing as owning this game. This is an arcade game where you need to keep pumping in the quarters to pay from now to eternity. At least Candy Crush lets you come back after a cooloff period if you don't want to pay for immediate continue.  So... play this decent game for 50 tokens. If you get addicted, start looking for the quarter slot on your computer. Or if you love it, go buy the board game and get reaquainted with your IRL friends. It'll be cheaper in the long run than entering your credit card number.  Would I play again? If I had been able to buy the game instead of rent it, sure I probably would. Would I pay from now to eternity to rent time on the game? Not on your life. Would I buy the table-top game IRL? Not after the sour taste in my mouth from losing my last 3 tokens trying to Storm Paris and having it say I disconnected.",

Which can be really annoying. Also the 'Free to Play' thing can be REALLY deceiving for this. You have like, let's say credits in this game, which you NEED to play some maps. And when you run out, you're down to 2 very boring maps, so basically you need money to make this game interesting.   As I said before, the strategic level of the game is very good, but other features just decrease the ammount of fun you recieve playing this game. Just get the board game.",

Long story short, I am glad that this version was free because this game is just terrible. It's joyless, nonsensical, and void of any real decision making. It, like Twilight Struggle, is simply 'Here are your cards... base your strategy around them!' That is not fun by any stretch of the imagination.",
