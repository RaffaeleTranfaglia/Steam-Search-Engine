            "review_text": "Made it to level 9 before I couldnt take it anymore.  Levels are literally 'Kill x number of people by either using them as a human shield while other AI shoot them without second thought, throw them around until they die or use the needlessly complicated bullet-catch technique then collect x number of keycards to pass through doors.'   Levels look HORRIBLE. I was able to break the game many times simply trying to climb I was able to get out of the map many times.  Do not buy this even on sale.",

            "review_text": "Release on PC, played by few and abandoned by the devs and that last point is the main issue. Bubbeling underneath this game are some promising mechanics that with some better level design, some fleshing out and polishing could have lead to an amazing game. However the game was clearly rushed through production to get a release soon enough after the tv show it was related to was cancelled to not be entirely irrelevant.  Graphically the game is sub par, likewise the voice acting and sound in general simply does nothing to draw and beyond the average sound effects the sound work is lower then I woulkd expect from such a release. Especially how they push the sound of character tos your left entirely to the left hand side of your sound system and similar.  The story is terrible, and the characters completely forgetable, but at its core there is some gameplay value. Which whilst it never feels fleshed out remains entertaining enough. However with all the negatives present and its extremely small amount of content the only time I could recommend this is once it is on a steep discount (think 75% off or more). It isn't terrible, but it misses the numerous opportunities it has to be something special and is just okay but overpriced for its length and quality.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: English is not my native language.  Sigh... Where do I start here? How did they manage to do a timetravel-telekinesis game based on a good meaty 'Heroes' universe so mindnumbingly boring and dull? This is so... uninspiring to play. I'll try to go piece by piece here. Even if u have such cool things like timetravelling and telekinesis the gameplay itself is extremely cluncky. You are either doing pretty mediocre platforming/running from point A to point B or fighting stupid AI dummies. Four or five times across the game you are forced to solve time- or phisycs based puzzles. And that's it. There is no exploration in such a linear levels. And there is no depth in battles - the best strategy is to shove any throwable object into every single enemy up to 6 times (by using rightclick-&gt;hold-&gt; leftclick again and again and again). There is no upgrade system - your abilities will become stronger after sertain points of the game (and you are reaching your maximum potential to have at least some kind of fun with your TK right before the last boss is coming).What did I miss here? Two (maybe three) KINDA boss battles are boring. Bonus collectibles are... kinda... meh... You are collecting random stuff that don't give you any kind of depth to this game's universe or main story plot . It is just... stuff. Ah, the plot. There is no real story here. Four or five cutscenes and a script shorter than this review. It is short, predictable and there is nothing positive I can say here. No strong characters, no unexpected plot twists. It is as generic and barebones story as it can be.  What else? The graphics are mediocre and dated. And when the backgrounds can be nice from time to time NPC's models are terrible.  The soundtrack is good. Both action and exploration sequences. I have zero claims here. Do not get me wrong here. This game definetly had potential. Time-swapping mechanic and time-vision are pretty cool on paper. Just imagine if you can slow the time flow and just destroy bunch of bad guys using your TK! Sounds cool but the realisation is... meh. And it is still 3 hours long game for 15 bucks.  If you ever ever want to give this game a try wait for a huge sale.",
