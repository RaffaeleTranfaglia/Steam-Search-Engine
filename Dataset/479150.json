There is no load game option in the options menu. It is only available from the title screen.  Would be nice if the game auto-loaded your last save file too.  Thanks to the dev for responding to this.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Previous review:  Was really enjoying this game, and then I had a break from it. All my progress was lost. The save functionality does not work. Therefore I cannot reccommend this in it's current state",
