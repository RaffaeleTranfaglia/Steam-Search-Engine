In my opinion, this game is bad, i only got to play once for 1 minute (literally 1 MINUTE, 60 seconds, how short is that!?) until the game froze completely, when i restarted and opened the game, the screen was blank, nothing, BLANK, and it stayed like this until now, that i uninstalled it. They didn't even bother in changing the way of the title, not even a little.  (Agar.io/Mitos.is , you can note the dot, obvious details, etc.)  The game isn't less laggy than Agar.io, the problem is that when you open an .exe file from your computer it will run depending on the performance of YOUR computer, your CPU, RAM, etc.  On the other side, Agar.io is more 'Laggy' because Agar.io runs on a WEB BROWSER, instead of Mitos.is, that runs from steam/desktop/program/whatever etc.  Agar.io is a more simple game than Mitos.is, which makes Agar.io a much better game. For example:  In Agar.io, you play as a simple cell, with the only pourpouse to eat, form, and get to the top of the leaderboard. In Mitos.is, you play as a cell, with the only pourpouse to get coins, wait for loadings, adjust your settings for better performance, pay the title screen, pay the loadings, pay everything.   Mitos.is, the popular Agar.io ripoff only on steam, it will empty your wallet.  Mitos.is is a bad game, almost as fun as Agar.io, but worst. Rating: 3/10|Next time try harder! Oh and, for all you people reading this, Mitos.is is a PAY2WIN.",

It is in this mindless consumption of your faceless equals that the game reflects not only itself and Freakinware, but every other attempt at cloning Agar.io. It consumes and absorbs everything Agar.io is, was, and will likely ever be, in a mindless bid to fuel it's own growth, and become the biggest fish in the pond. As it tries to devour and conquer, it is opposed by countless others vying for the exact same goal. Each as pitiless, remorseless, and fearless as itself, purely driven by the id. And yet, despite the goal of growth, no true growth or progress can ever be made. No matter how big one grows, they still continue to hunt the same objective, never satisfied, never accomplished.  As far as one may have physically grown, there is no mental development, no questions. No whys. In leaving behind their mental abilities in the pursuit of growth, they have become exactly as Freakinware are. No interest in the cultural or philsophical, no interest in becoming something more than they are. They only care about being the biggest circle on the screen.

It's much more responsive, detailed, interesting, and comes with default music and sound effects. The principle of Mitos.is is exactly the same to Agar.io, but like I said, they've spiced it up a little bit.   What's Added/New to It?  Here I'll go more in-depth.  It's more responsive. A hell of a lot more. Agar.io revolves around you getting lucky whether the website would actually detect your mouses' location or not, and Mitos.is fixes that. It's so much easier to squeeze yourself out of sticky situations and catch people out.  They've kept the skins. But you have to level up to  earn  them. I'm not too sure what I think of that. On Agar.io, it's nice to be able to just pick your skin and boom, there you have it, and Mitos.is lacks that. But at the same time, isn't it nice to wear a skin that you've  earned ?  Sound Effects and Music. That's what Agar.io really, really lacked. Yes, sure, you can download mods for it and all, but why not have it there anyway without some tacky browser add-on? Lovely, isn't it? Mitos.is' music is also 10x better than the Agar.io modded ones. Bleugh.   TL;DR  ~ It's Agar.io with better graphics and motion control with ranking, leaderboards, leveling up, music and sound effects. 7/10   EDIT  Well. I have to pay to continue? 3/10.",

            "review_text": "Mitos.is is a nice free game in which you can hop in, play a bit, and jump back out at your leisure. Play a few minutes in between other things, or have a few hours to spend trying to get big, either way works.  The gameplay is basic, but solid. You spawn as a circle/cell and you collect little things laying around to get bigger. Once you are big enough, you can eat smaller players by running into them. Games with this premise date back litterally as long as I've been alive, and probably further back as well. As for this one, the bigger you are, the slower. So you can avoid the bigger players while gathering your own mass, and then come back to take them out instead. You can split yourself in two for a speed boost and control both orbs to chase down your prey, and then you can keep splitting yourself again and again if you want to. Of course, being smaller like that means there is the risk that someone bigger than you comes by and eats up part of your cell, and you'll have to keep on running to avoid them. That said, you can use the speedboost to run as well, when things are too bleak to stand for them, yet you want to not lose it all, leaving behind part of your collected mass may be preferable to losing it all. There are also virus nodes, and eating those will burst you into smaller chunks. You can use this by throwing a part of your mass through these and then onto your opponent, thus giving you an easier snack.   Mitos.is comes with multiple game modes, including free for all, teams, CTF, and guild based modes. One thing I initially disliked was that FFA servers included people teaming up at times, but after a few more times playing I ended up realising how good this actually was for the tactics available in the game.  Once you're large, you may attract someone else who is a lot smaller. Sure, you could throw a whole lot of your mass over at him, eat his tiny amount of mass, and be vulnerable to bigger blobs coming to get you...Or you could not. Just let him stay around near you, buzzing around you and growing bigger in safety as you scare away (Or eat) anything that preys on the little guy. Then in turn, when someone bigger than you comes by, the small guy you've been protecting may throw his own mass at you to allow you to overcome the threat. And if you then throw back some to your new friend, both of you profit. I'm fairly sure this is how the first monkey-like creatures decided to start living together, and it works. Teaming up can arise organically, and there is nothing wrong with that. Just advanced survival tactics   Mitos.is is a simple but good game, it's easy to pick up, easy to put down, and varied enough to keep you playing it and coming back occasionally. It's small size and price of 'free' makes it hard to justify not giving it a try, but do not expect too much, it's not some deep masterpiece or complicated puzzle, it's just something nice for you to enjoy until you grow tired of it",

My personal favorite is Free-For-All. The game also features a level system, where the bigger you are, the higher place you are, and the longer you last, get you more EXP. Levels show other online players how skilled you are, and let you purchase more items/power-ups. Items in the game will help you in different ways. To get these items, you need coins, which you get from doing the daily rewards, collecting them around the map, and getting achivements. Achivements in-game act as a purpose to playing the game, so to speak. And, last but not least, there multiple different skins to choose from, and you make your own skin, with the right amount of coins, that is.  Overall, this is a great game, and I really do recommend it. You will get more steam hours, and it is A LOT easier to play with friends and family, than playing Agar.io.",

The game is simple; you try eating little dots and avoid bigger onces. Sounds familiar? Agar.io yes but this is much better and you would know if you actually played the game.  - P2W I honestly can see that it is a little P2W but thats every game EVER that sells in-game currency, this however is NOT P2W. You can buy coins with real money and spend it on items that gives you bonuses in-game however what other have fail to mention is that it is also level locked. You cant buy the best equip ingame when your low lvl and even when your faced with a better equipt enemy you can still dodge everything they throw at you... meaning THEIR ITEMS DOESNT MEAN JACK ♥♥♥♥ IF YOUR GOOD AT THE GAME. If you need some tips I'll be willing to help you.  - Agar.io Where do I even begin with this... Honestly go play agar.io right now and compare the 2 and you will have your answer. This game has so many more features like uploading your own skin (yes even .gifs), guilds, tournaments, gamemodes etc.  - Lagg I have almost never experienced lagg in this game but when I did it was my fault. Check your procceses if you do because it's not the server.  Summary: Join the game without expectations and you will be amazed. The sounds fit really well and the gameplay is amazing.",

Reinstalling the game doesnt fix the problem. All the games made by the developers such as Mitos.is- Strike.is and Snake will not load. Simply at this point the IOS users are quite enjoying the games alone. Which is quite weird or an eye opener that a competive update came out for 'everyone'; but however IOS users are only able to compete. SO is it intentional or not? Multiple users for pc are having a problem; while others can compete with a clean slate or at the least with out the competion of cross platform users- Pc. If you on any platform support the games by this developer, you need to look at how and why a competive update came out while stopping the amount of possible players from competing; in logic terms it's simple they needed to unoffically clear some of the players out the way. Some might say 'no way they'd be able to do that'; well ask yourself first do you think they will restart it after they fix the problems? 'NO way; they cant strip the winnings from the player(s) that did win', even if the devs toke half the playing field away. Good luck to the ones still playing that will enjoy less players. It really doesnt take alot to see that the timing is the key to this lock out of player. It even calls it an update opening more compation to the game with a new season. They are inadvertinly stating that it is a hand over to IOS users to feel grand about the support they are due. DO NOT support this action or the future actions like this. Simply they know what they did and it will happen surely to the communtiy again when season 10 comes. Donations would be asked by the devs to fix these simple 'scandals tactics'; which in its self is one correct?

They like all game modes, and always hang in Random Team, as well as CTF. They are a dying species, and are smaller in size, might I add. Lots are left but aren't too common. I am personally a feeder.)  Defenders (Use their large cells to defend team mates, and the flag depending on the game mode. They are seen in all game modes, and are very common.)  Predators (Prey upon smaller cells; Most are hostile. They sometimes respect the Feeders peace if they get mass. They tend to hang out in All for One, Guild Wars and Random Team. They tend to stay away from CTF considering it has a different goal than to survive and kill. They are very common.)  Peaceful players (Don't eat others; prefer to stay away from large crowds. They may sometimes be seen in All For One mode and Random Team. Hardly even a category anymore. They are smaller in size, like a feeder. They are dying out.)  Hostiles (Oh boy.. Well. The name speaks for itself. They are ruthless. Many still litter the population, and it's hard to pin point them. They are a lot like a Predator, but do not respect feeding boundaries. They DO NOT respect others either. If you kill one, you bet your ♥♥♥ they'll come and hunt you down like a dragon hunting for a measely chicken. Beware of these. They are seen in all game-modes, and WILL kill you. Steer clear of these beasts.)  I rate the game 10/10. It's amazing, and I don't understand why it doesn't have more positive views.

I've tried it, and the more I tried, the more Mitosis provided me a much better playing experience than Agario ever did. It is different. The cells don't behave the same way on both games, the team section on Mitosis is much more efficient (a goal to reach), the map is smaller, we can add people to our friend list and chat with them.

There is a store element to buy items that give your little Cell perks, like initial size boosts, speed boosts, and split perks (Splitting your cell is one of your attacks to consume the enemy, or run away and be harder to eat!)  The controls are simple... Pint in the direction you want your cell to go... Run into stuff you want to eat... run away from stuff trying to eat you. But Dont let the simplistic style lead you to thinking there is no strategy. You can FEED players to make them bigger, giving BIG benefits to team-play. Using friendly cells and sharp obsticles, you can survive... Or can you? In some modes there can be only one...   Honestly, its a fun game to play. Dont expect much in terms of graphics, but for what you get for the norhing I had to pay for it, its honestly one of my go to time killers these days.

And it isn't even my PC, I just recently let all of the important updates install, in hopes it would get everything up to par. I end up losing connection with the server at least more than a few times in a few minutes. I recently just started the game and before playing no more than 10 minutes, I cannot play because my cell keep stopping and cutting with lag and ending my game. Not to mention, trying to play other game modes and being forced to wait, and wait, and wait, which isn't something I planned on doing, hence why I played this game, in hopes I could gdo it whenever. And theeeen, you decided charging power-ups by coin to players, giving them advantages over others players without the necessity of skill level, unbelievable. I understand that these games are popular, but what isn't popular is society's tendency to catch on to something of interest and try and rip off of it. I haven't played most of the game mode, primarily because I can't play without lagging at minute intervals, making gameplay not only tedious, but near an uncertainty, but I really tried with this one. Please Be Original Next Time and fix that AWFUL LAG, I CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH.

E.g. - Human Biology &amp; chemistry (medicine), Physics (engines etc.),chemistry (fuel) to name a few of the applied technologies that together make a modern society possible. In the game you play as a cell and increase in size the more stuff you eat ( it looks like D.N.A though a cell users glucose as it's fuel). The cell can divide into exact copies (biology - mitosis). And, like white blood cells (leukocytes ) in the human body, can also eat other cells ( though in the game you target cells that are smaller than your cell). The basic game play is comparably straight forward, however there are many play tactics (and weapons/defences) at your disposal to help you become the largest cell. The games includes several game modes to choose from. These include; Free for all (though there are a few whom play together, which isn't playing to the free for all game ethic. Kind of cheating); Team mode (The mode for playing together!) ;hunger games (20 players start, highest score/size wins, amongst other game modes.   Mitosis is a fun game (I hope the game develops program a linux based version of this game soon.) with a scientific narrative made possible by the appliance of science (computing technology). Though as with most modern technology Mitosis is a game that can also be enjoyed by people whom are comparably scientifically illiterate. For example, people whom have been unfortunate in not having excess to the vast amount of scientific information freely available on the internet( another scientific invention) or/&amp; exist in a scientifically illiterate social bubble where it seems normal not to know any basic science &amp; how science gathers reliable knowledge. Thus, having games/films/music lyrics based on the supported publicly verifiable evidence, can help people learn about objective reality as they play &amp; decrease the level of ignorance in our society.  I hope the game develops program a linux based version of this game soon.",

You end up with 3-6 level 69s who just cover the entire map and no way to eat them.  They changed the way the other games work now too. Capture the flag resets your size after each flag is captured, which is really jarring and frustrating. Several other levels do this too. I can see why they might want to do it, but it is the worst idea, honestly.  The big problem with this game is it is unbalanced. Once you get to a certain size, no one can hurt you. Even with viruses, they only knock you down so much. The game was amazing, and I would love to keep playing it, but it isn't the game I got anymore.  Also, worm.io is glitchy as hell. I would be willing to play it if it wasn't so arbitrary and messed up. It solves some of the problems that mitosis has in that anyone can kill anyone, but the actual rules are unclear and frustrating.  ALSO, there is no guide on how to play? Like basic stuff like spliting and ejecting? I had to figure it all out by dying a bunch at first. I don't own dark souls for a reason.

Well, sadly this is not the game for you. This game had lots of potential that was wasted. It could have been even better than Agar.io. This game has lots of teaming in gamemodes not meant for teaming, such as FFA. Also, the fatigue given to the teaming players doesn't stop them nor strong enough of a consiquence. In conclusion, this game is poorly regulated by the Devs, with new gamemodes constantly being added to increase sell rates of coin packages; allowing users to buy items to make it possible to 'win' or become the highest on the leaderboard which without outrageous amounts of coins you are unable to buy.  Last Words:   Don't download this game. It simply is a game created so the company can make quick easy money. Lastly, most of the time people become big or 'win' it's due to teaming, luck with small amounts of skill, or simply having enough skill to pull it off on your own (this is a very rare occasion due to all the others problems with this waste of time game).",

            "review_text": "When i first started off, i played a couple of games named as 'player' and it was quite good at first, then i made my account to see all these equips, potions and stuff, first of all, the potions, its so unbalanced, theres like a potion that mades it impossible for to move, a potion where you gain huge speed + with split, it eats you with another 10 players, and etc.. so unbalanced, and when you goes as far as to go to max lvl (max is 69, like srsly xD), then you're alerted with a evolution, and bruhhh, when your lvl 69, some people are around 100 coins, but the evolution, its 5000 coins, and when you do quests which like gives you 25 coins per quest, when you go to like hunger games, there's literally no other players than you, and there is the deleting quest button, but only once per day, and then you get another quest to pass the ball in soccer, and you go on soccer, same thing, your the only 1 there. sometimes there's a change where you enter the game but the only 1 there.. like in Team mode, and by the way, adding chat makes the whole game a lot worse, people calling each other C.unts and yea,,, so over all, i do not recommand this game because of its unbalanced gear and horrifying community, also when for example in teams : RED: 2000 BLUE: 230 YELLOW: 110, it doesn't end, and we blue and yellow have to suffer and get our stuff broken over and over and over again, its so unbalanced, do this game think they're better than agario?   Edit: When i heard that you can buy coins with real money, i now realised that, that's the reason they made it 20k for sapphire evolution etc, to my conclusion, the game developer's are money ♥♥♥♥♥s, if you want to spend your $20 then spend it on a game or somthing not a lame game that's a copyright of agario that just added equipment that seem to make them look like that the game was their invention not a copyright",
