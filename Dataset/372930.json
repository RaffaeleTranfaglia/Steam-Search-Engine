It crashes every so often for no apparent reason but I was still enjoying the play-through, despite this, until I ran into a game-breaking bug and couldn't continue. After reading some of the discussions and researching online, I realized mine was just one of several game-breaking bugs and it doesn't appear the developers have any intention of fixing them.",

            "review_text": "Before playing New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia by Five-Bn Games, I'd never heard of the developer.  After playing New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia, I bought two more of their games and added the rest to my wishlist!  The Good. Strong story telling combined with outstanding graphics, excellent soundtrack and effects, good voice acting, lots of cut scenes that were high quality, original and challenging puzzles (I hang my head in shame that I had to skip two, which I don't often do), original HO scenes where rather than simply finding objects, you needed to find objects that would allow you to interact with the scene in order to find other objects. You get to keep your knife for the whole game! (it doesn't disappear.) Decent length, and a very big bonus content chapter that was as high quality as the main story, expanding on the background to the main storyline while giving you completely new scenes, puzzles, and left me wanting more. Fast travel via the map. I loved it. The Bad. Almost nothing. Ok ... I went into the game hoping to find a story set in an interesting gangster era that didn't involve supernatural forces and/or missing loved ones/children ... which this genre really needs to forget about and do something original, it's getting stale. What I got was yet another supernatural mystery involving the hunt for missing children with the mafia mainly background to the main story :( ... but I got over that disappointment relatively quickly as the story dragged me in. A few minor translation problems, but nothing to take away from the enjoyment.That's pretty much it.  I'm hesitant to call this game a HOG, as the HO scenes are more like large puzzles than pixel hunting, it's a puzzle/adventure game ... and a fine one at that. If you like puzzle/adventure games and/or HOGs ... then give this game a go. It's an outstanding example of the genre and has set the bar high for future games. Well done FIVE-BN!",
