Galbadia, a Global Superpower, has declared war on Dollet, a country whose training academy is home to two personalities: the hot-headed Seifer and the 'lone wolf', Squall Leonhart. Both are equally at conflict with each other as their country is with Galbadia; to others, Squall appears lacking in team spirit, while...",

            "review_text": "The black sheep of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VIII is a game that divides opinion to this very day. Is it good? Is it bad? Does it make a lick of sense? Is Squall a sexy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? No one entirely agrees on an answer to any of these questions (except for the last one, the answer of which is YES), but I have my own take it. FFVIII is perhaps the most underappreciated games in the entire series. Much like how FFVII deconstructed JRPGs that existed up to that point, FFVIII deconstructs the wave of RPGs that followed in Final Fantasy VII's wake, mocking their tropes and characters, while at the same time telling a very unique story. FFVIII follows Squall Leonheart, a student at Balamb Garden, a military academy that trains SeeDs, a mercenary force designed for one purpose: to hunt down and destroy Sorcerresses. Squall is probably my favorite lead character in a Final Fantasy game, and that has one clear reason: he's realistic. Unlike Cloud or Zidane, he isn't a teenager who can somehow fight the forces of darkness without sweat: he's a flawed person, broken by a crappy childhood and a dehumanising education that taught him how to kill. In essence, he behaves how a real person would in his situation. Over the course of the game, we're treated to a near-constant internal monologue that tells us about the struggles he faces internally and how he deals with them. He's a great lead. The rest of the cast is more mixed, with high points being Irvine, who often reflects Squall, and Laguna, who's chipper attitude is a nice respite from the grim tones of Squall, and low points being the annoying and fairly useless Zell, the bland and boring Quistis, and the game's dumb villain, Ultimecia. The plot itself is also a bit of a mixed bag, with some really good moments offset by some really dumb ones. The battle system is a clear departure from the rest of the series too. Rather than levelling up your characters to build stats, instead, stats are built by 'junctioning' magic to various stats to increase their parameters. This is a great system, one ripe for experimentation, hampered by one thing: Drawing. Magic works like items in FF8: once you use a charge, it's gone. The only way to get magic early on is by painstakingly drawing magic from enemies: an incredibly tedious and boring prospect. It's rectified later once you get access to card refinement, but it's still a hassle. Speaking of card refinement. this game comes with a very entertaining trading card diversion called Triple Triad, and it's a blast. Simple, quick, yet endlessly addictive.   So, that's Final Fantasy VIII. Honestly, I love it, and it remains one of my favorites of the series. However, it's a very flawed game, so chances are, you may not like it. However, approach it with an open mind, and I think you'll enjoy what lies in store.",

I got mine about 24 hours after I asked for it. Playing with achievements is nice, and this is the only way I've found where you can access Chocobo World, but the music is low-quality MIDIs for some reason, and you need to download a mod to restore the audio.  If you're an old fan looking to come back, I'd just see if I could find a PS1 and a disc instead. Newcomers, maybe give it a shot, but be prepared to wait for that email.  EDIT: Also crashes like a blind Nascar driver. You know those sections with the ticking timer that gives you game over if they hit zero? Imagine one of those ALWAYS counting down and you can't see it. That's what it's sort of like playing this. A crash ever seems to be lurking around the corner. It makes you paranoid and tense, and it's not the least bit fun.  Do yourself a favor and track down a PS1 disc and a system to play on. Do not waste your money on this.",

Everything looks like it was put through a blur or blend filter. The forests look horrible the towns look horrible, the world map looks horrible now.  2. Monsters: They don't really look any different from the origional, ****they also don't level up as you do (like in the origional). Why would you change a feature that allows casual players to play through at their own pace while still making random battles worthwhile, into something where people are going to be equipping Enc-None for 90% of the game. The point of that system was to make the game for everyone, if you wanted to play hardcore, you level grinded at the start and the battles became harder, enemies got new moves and so on. Now, nothing changes.****  **EDIT*** The normal monsters do level up equal to Squall's level, the Bosses/GF's don't seem to. Diablo was 7 levels lower than my whole party and Ifrit was 4 levels lower. I didn't check any other boss so far.  3. Controls: The keyboard equivilant of 'select' is default set to the J key while the 'Square' button is set to S. So when using the boost command on your summon, you end up crossing your arms to hold J and mash the S key to boost your summons. Not a horrible thing, but for people who are right handed, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥.  4. Sounds: While I don't mind the normal sounds of the game, memorable although lower quality due to being original PC MIDI files. You summon Quexelotl (lightening bird) and while it look pretty the sound is horrible, listen to the origional compared to it and you will be horrified. (haven't noticed the same with other summons (yet).  5. Official description of game: Really, Galbadia didn't declare war on Dollet, it attacked it in order to take the Comm. Tower. Squall and Siefer are not a part of Dollet nor is their 'Training Facility' Balamb Garden, as the name might suggest it is located elsewhere (on another continent). The person who wrote this part should be fired for not even playing the game, how can you screw up something that is explained within half an hour of gameplay.  Overall, I recommend buying the game from the playstation store. Either via a ps3 or PSP (any version) or if you don't have that then I'm sorry but this lackluster game is the closest you'll get to the origional.  FInal comment and biased opinion: This is the crap that happens when Square Enix gets a hold of a SquareSoft origional, please don't support this utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because it's obvious that they don't care about you, only your wallet.",

Apart from that, the port is as good as can be expected. Game runs smoothly and looks better than my PSX version slightly. There are some fun achievements if you're into that too, more interesting than FFVII's terrible ones at least.  The game itself is fun. Somewhat easy/game-breaking if you understand the Junction system but remains a game I usually beat every 1-2 years. Triple Triad is the highlight of the game, addictive, fun and a welcome distraction when the story begins to go off the rails slightly.   I recommend this (£10 is nothing for the time you'll get out of it).",

It doesn't take away from the game itself, though. I had no technical issues with the installation, account sign-up, or the game itself.  FF8 is an underrated title in the series. I see a lot of people saying it was the beginning of quality downturn for the series, and I mostly disagree. The 'draw' system for acquiring spells is a bit monotonous at times, but that's the only flaw that could have been thought out better. I may not like every feature of the game, but I chalk all of my other issues up to simple taste preference. You can't please everyone.  Where this game fares well is storytelling, and that's really what these games are known for. Relatable characters on journeys that pull you into the game, and almost make you feel as though you have a personal stake in defeating the antagonist(s). The length of the cut scenes may seem a little excessive at times, but I enjoyed the vast majority of them.  The mini-game is card-based, for those concerned with making this game last as long as possible. It isn't as repeatable long-term as Chocobos from FF7, but on the plus side you can start playing cards a lot sooner in the game, and most rare cards are attainable even if you choose to skip the task (or miss it) originally. Like I said, it's not as fun as breeding and racing Chocobo from 7, but they were never going to top that for my enjoyment anyway.  Overall it was well worth the purchase. I have the original discs for PS, so I waited until I saw a nice sale on it.. but for those who are looking to play for the first time, or play again and no longer have it on Playstation, I think it's worth the full price.",

I love the ability to speed up the cinematics to 60 fps, which make the scenes look fantastic, although everything is moving at twice the speed, thus making it a much shorter cutscene, which is the closest thing to being able to skip it. But if you've already sunk hundreds of hours into it before, then it's definitely worth checking out, especially when it's on sale. If you havent played it before, its still definitely worth the money. The cutscenes still look good (for the time they were released, especially) and the overall game doesn't look too shabby compared to others from its time. The ability to summon GFs (basically pets) and unlock loads of skills for then as well as everyone in the party is awesome. The magic/GF/Ability junction feature is also one of my favorite implemented systems, making it much easier to help overcome more powerful opponents once you've gotten used to utilizing it. Only downside to that is that you constantly need to stock magic in order to keep your stats as buffed as possible, which can take awhile and becomes a bit tedious. But overall, the mechanics are very smooth and simple. The story is very well done too. It's enough of a driving factor to keep people who may not like grinding very much to stay interested, although there's no journal or anything of that nature to keep you focused on where to go next, which may become a problem if you decide to stop playing for a while and resume later. That's one of my only real problems with this game. Most adventure/open world games have some sort of journal or objective list in case you forget where you're supposed to go next, or at least who to talk to. That aside, I'd still highly recommend this game to just about anyone who loves the old school RPG style of game play with some unique mechanics and a good storyline.  TL;DR Buy this game. It's a great part of the FF series.",

After playing 7 and 8 for the first time on the PS3, I was so impressed by how these old games made me fall in love with its worlds and characters, it proved to me that AAA graphics, Sound design and even voice acting doesnt make a great game. By todays standards, these game are dated. When i first played FF VII last year I laughed at the terrible graphic, cheesey music and blocky characters. after destroying the first Mako reactor, I was hooked: The pre-rendered backgrounds looked beautiful, The music was emotional, and combat was rewarding and fun, the blocky characters still look bad. In short terms, I no longer look at these games based on their graphic's or age. FF VII is one great game, even by todays standards. theres a reason why everyone calls it the best. which brings me to FF VIII. Just like VII it was an excellent game. Not as mind blowing as VII, but still great. Playing the mini card game Triple-Triad was a blast. Can you believe it? I was playing a game......within a game (that was actually fun). Yes these games where so good, I decided to throw my money into Gabe's face and buy them both on Steam. FF VII = perfect PC port. HD graphic's, same music from PSX and achievements. The same could be said about FF VIII, everything is great, but the MUSIC!. Seriously, what the hell am i listening to? everything is a note too high or too low, it sound awful compared to PSX music. Its a real shame, because if you've already played the thing on PlayStation, then the music will stick out like a sore thumb. Apart from the sound issue, this is a great game to play. I just hope SquareEnix release Final Fantasy 9 on steam to make yet another game that much better. Just dont touch the sound. Kupo.",

            "review_text": "At first, this game took me a while to get into due to the strange magic and stat system as well as the general world of the game, but I ended up surprising myself by how likable it ended up being.  In this game, you can gather magic spells from enemies via battle command, and then recast the spells, or equip them onto your stats to make them increase. This felt like a very weird system, having to gather and collect spells just to cast them later, as well as how slow you'd gather the spells. I later learned that the higher your magic stat, the faster your magic gathering would become, and I also learned that magic generally wouldn't be used a lot in normal combat anyways, so you'd rarely touch your huge pile of magic spells unless a boss or healing.  What really makes me like this system is equipping the spells to your stats, since the more magic you have of that type you're attaching to a specific stat (maximum 100 stack of any spell), the higher boost that stat would recieve. It also takes into account what kind of magic is being placed onto the stat, so placing something like... haste onto your speed stat would give it a massive boost. Casting spells equipped to your stats would cause that stat to lower, due to a smaller stack being there now, so you might end up finding a use for many spells you'd never even give the chance in other FF games.  I've personally only played FF4, 5, 6, and 7 (as well as this game), but I find this manages to be my second favourite, even beating out games I have a nostalgic feeling for. A well-written and interesting story, wonderful soundtrack (even though I think this port has a different one, but I haven't heard the original), and a cast of characters I ended up warming up to the same as the protagonist. If you haven't played this, I strongly recommend you give it a try if you're into 'turn-based' RPGs, since it was a wonderful experience for only $12.",

With in the sea of criticism and broken theories to make since of what's going on, all of us found ourselves comming back to it. Is that not what a great game is all about? Being able to come back and re-live the joy it handed to us the first go around? If we find ourselves going back, who are we to not reccomend this to anyone else? Sure the steam version has it's flaws but it still contains the heart of FFVIII. This is a game everyone should enjoy. It's not getting easy to just go buy the ps1 version of this game, and people willing to actually play this style of game are increasingly dwindling.   Serisously if you are looking at reviews to decide rather or not to buy/play this don't let the people itching for nostalgia ruin your decision. If you can handle some grinding, turn based fighting, and a rich story line, this game is something you should delve into.

As a player who has played almost all FF game in the old generations consoles (from SNES to PS and later on to Android/DS versions and Onlines from FF XI - was in beta for XIV also) IMO is worth getting.

The graphics have been improved upon, I'd say more but for those of you who played this when it was brand new, I will save the description so that you can see for youself. A personal favorite of mine of all of the final fantasy story lines. Game play seems a little simplified from the original game play version in that commands for the gunblade as well as other small functions in the game and it is enough of an improvement that it makes the game much kinder to a first time final fantasy player.   Final Fantasy is hard to get wrong, especially the originals but if you're new to the final fantasy experience I would recommend getting into it with these older versions as learning how the game works in these versions is easier and allows you to learn quickly when moving on to the newer versions of the game (you dont feel as lost when you know what you're doing).   Final Fantasy VIII's story line is one of the more light hearted ones so if you're looking for one that is feel good, this is one of the few. I would recommend this game to any one and especially to RPG fans out there. If you have not played it yet you really are missing out. The game is fun, chok full of 90's jokes/referances and of course as with all Final Fantasy games, look forward to the grind ;).",

In saying that, the game is technically poorer than the PS1 version in terms of both visuals and audio. The soundtrack is good, but it's no FFVII, and the cheap midi sounds are jarring when compared to the PS1 version. The pre-rendered backgrounds have very low resolution, and the characters stand out starkly against the world around them. The greater articulation and realism given to the character models is a blessing and a curse - their gestures are much more varied and identifiable, but the stylised actions and humour of the characters clashes with the life-like designs. The cuteness of FFVII's characters allowed a sense of humour and slapstick that doesn't comfortably carry over into this more realistic design, and leaves some moments feeling awkward, as if the designers couldn't quite meet the goal they were aiming for.   In contrast to FFVII, the game world opens up almost immediately, and rewards the player generously in terms of money. The 'Junction' system of battle is quite confusing to begin with, and may be prohibitively overwhelming for those with little patience, but once one learns the ins and outs of the system, the variation it allows makes the FFVII system feel like button-mashing child's play. The abolition of 'magic points', in favour of 'drawing' spells from the enemy and the environment is a refreshing change, and makes the battles feel less restrictive as you can more-or-less cast away to your heart's content, rather than constantly worrying about refilling the MP bar.   One feature I don't quite like is effectively making the summoned Guardians a default attack - watching their stunningly cinematic (and lengthy) attacks is fun for the first few times, but gets really tedious after a while, to the point that I could set one attack for each character, and then surf the web while all the cinematics played.   All in all, the gameplay is a noticable improvement over FFVII, although it comes a distant second in terms of audio-visual quality. Hopefully these issues are addressed at some point, but who knows. It doesn't kill the game for me, and FFVIII is much easier to pick up and play than its predecessor, but they are both worthy additions to the series, and were iconic games of their time.",

This version is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the MIDI music. The DRM is not an issue as you just need register once for a SQE account and you can play offline, mod, cheat and generally do whatever you want afterwards. It also looks a hell of a lot better than the original PC (and PSX) release, the backgrounds obviously aren't improved but the character models, attack, GF and spell animations are all greatly improved by the increased resolution support.  I played this when it was first relased on steam and at the time there weren't alot of mods available besides Roses&amp;Wine which is a must for improving the audio but some of the mods that are available now make the game look a hell of a lot better and i'll definately be using them next time.",

            "review_text": "Story – 1/5 -&gt; 20%  The story is the typical “defeat the evil mastermind who threatens the life of the entire planet” type of story. However, it is also incredibly convoluted and filled with many plot holes. If you finished listening to some NPC's explanation about what is going on and still have no clue who's side they are on, then the story is too convoluted for its own good. The one redeeming quality is that the main characters are well-defined. You could easily identify with the main character, Squall.  Graphics – 4/5 -&gt; 80%  The graphics are much improved over the horrible graphics of the previous game. Some parts of the game still have rough edges, like a few of the character models, but for the most part, you shouldn't really notice any problems (at least for graphics of its time). In particular, the FMVs look spectacular and flow smoothly with the rest of the game.  Sound – 5/5 -&gt; 100%  None of the music or sound effects felt out of place. Of particular note is the boss theme music which provided an appropriate adrenaline rush.  Controls – 9/10 -&gt; 90%  Even if you have a problem with the default controls, it is possible to redefine them, and none of the extra ways the main controls were used for “minigames” felt awkward or misused. The only problem I experienced was that the overworld was incredibly disorienting to navigate without the map open.  Resources – 5/5 -&gt; 100%  Unlike the Playstation version, this version of FFVIII comes with Chocobo World without the need for a Pocketstation. This provides an extra source for items beyond the main game. Even if you choose not to abuse Chocobo World, FFVIII provides plenty of ways to keep your stats in tip-top shape.  One interesting resource system in this game is the SeeD rank. Depending on your rank, you will be paid a certain amount as you walk around the world. The higher your rank, the more you are paid. There are a variety of ways to increase your rank, including monster kills and several sidequests. This ensures you don't have to always face monsters to grind for gold if you don't want to.  Player Growth – 3/5 -&gt; 60%  FFVIII's unique system is the Junctioning system. Summon spirits are called Guardian Forces, or GF, which can be linked to particular characters to give them new abilities. GFs can be taught new abilities for your characters to use as well as slots for particular stats in order to boost them with magic.  In addition, enemies level with you, in order to attempt to balance the game. However, the game is not very well balanced for both newcomers and veterans alike, as leveling up too much tends to make the game more difficult, and it is possible to obtain late game magic spells at the beginning in order to boost your stats ridiculously high.  Learnability – 4/5 -&gt; 80%  The game regularly provides the option to view a tutorial on various game mechanics. Unfortunately, it can be rather invasive when you are given a chance later in the game to view a tutorial of a concept you have already been taught.  One feature of note is the SeeD Test. In addition to increasing your SeeD rank, tests also provide a way to test your knowledge of the game mechanics. The tests can prove to be a nice refresher if you forget anything, since you can view them at any time.  Difficulty - 12/15 -&gt; 80%  The game initially provides a nice blend of challenging gameplay. However, it does not provide enough challenging end-game content. There is a super boss, but it is easy to defeat compared to other Final Fantasy games with super bosses.  Entertainment – 38/40 -&gt; 95%  While the game is not very challenging overall, the Junction system still makes the gameplay very enjoyable.  Replay value – 3/5 -&gt; 60%  As with most single player games, there is not much incentive to play the game again, especially if the story hurts your head. However, the Junction system provides many different ways to approach boss fights. It can be interesting to experiment with different approaches and create your own challenge runs.  Total – 84/100 -&gt; 84%  I would recommend at least giving the game a try if you have never played this game before on the Playstation. It is very fun to experiment with the Junction system and different magic spells. If you have played the Playstation version and you are a completionist, you might still want to buy the PC version for the inclusion of Chocobo World.",

Thirdly, the music they included are the awful MIDI files that are terribly low quality. You can fix this (one of the top-rated posts includes the link), but it's a needless hassle. On the plus side, the graphics look pretty good and the game includes ChocoWorld, which we PSX users never got. So like I said, it's a mixed bag. If you still have this on the PC with ChocoWorld, there's absolutely no reason to get the Steam release. If, however, you had it on PSX and would like to play ChocoWorld and use the items/characters from that side game in the main game, you might be interested in picking this up when it goes on sale.",

It holds a huge sentimental value to me and I bet to many others. It can still be enjoyable for newer generations, but the gameplay didn't transition well into this decade and Square Enix didn't care to enhance the game properly. For those unaware, this is a re-release of the 2000 port of the original released for the PlayStation. It doesn't improve much, if at all, over the first port and it can be a huge let down for people used to the PS2 gameplay mechanics onwards. For those familiar with the storytelling of FFX and above, VIII might also feel lacking in that department as the world feels very shallow with little history. None of this, however, means is not worth it. The player, epsecially if new, just has to dive into with an open mind and understand that yes, it's a very dated game. Modding the game (check the guides for a list of mods) can help with the experience and bring a twist to the nostalgia seekers.   A note on the DRM:  Is not REALLY a DRM. Steam DOES NOT require your to have a Square Enix account to save your progress and register achievement progress. The Square Enix account is optional and the lack of it won't get in the way of your game progress. The problem with this is that the launcher is constantly reminding the player to login, but you don't HAVE to. If you already have a Square Enix account linked to your Steam account, you won't even notice this, not in VIII, not in other Square Enix games that make use of their social network.",

The Bads -Completely original graphics: SURE, we have resolutions! but..I mean, this is awful. Some characters inworld are so blocky and hard to look at due to the significant upscaling thats taking place, and it gets much, much worse past 1080P (Deling city..LOL) -Controls: This game screams controller. No ifs, no ands, no butts. The keyboard layout doesn't even work right unless you have a controller. Its a game thats really bad as a port. -Need a Square Enix Account: This one is pretty self explanitory. Took a while to get that setup due to SE's slow network or, my email just is slow. either way, its another form of DRM really. -Cloud saves: This game has cloud saves, however it is not as bad as FF13-2 or FF7's cloud saving. Saves are instant and straight forward, however I have had a few moments where the saves did not update on the cloud, and the previous cloud saves were used, resulting in a backtrack of storyline, which annoyed me greatly. -Midi Music, Low quality video: Everything is upscaled or compressed in this game. Videos are not that great looking, and to be honest. I feel if i had the PSX version it would look, and play better -Locked framerates: given, because of how the game was built.

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy VIII was such a terrible game. I feel bad buying it on the Steam Marketplace (during the summer sale). It is just a nostalgia game, like how Dragon Ball Z is just a nostalgia anime; it sucks terribly, but we have fond childhood memories of it. Final Fantasy VIII had a combat system that made every single character the exact same, without any differences. None of them had any real differences, except limit breaks. The graphics were terrible, even for its time. Final Fantasy VII, its predecessor, had better gameplay graphics (less pixelated individuals and backgrounds; even though the models were much more simple). The game is more based on waiting than anything. It has no strategy, as the closest thing it has to complexity is 'use the summon that does its weakness against the enemies'. Your basic attacks do nearly no damage, and your summons will almost never die (unless you are really stupid), so there is never any point in doing anything (other than buffing your party with haste/debuffing the enemies); which each summon takes about 30 seconds to do its animation. The animation is so ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive that it is not even funny. You can't even customize your weapons or armor; past the tiny amount where you can find blueprints (maybe) to create slightly better weapons (barely a noticeable difference). The dialogue, transitions, story, and character connections are so badly written that I honestly have no idea what I am doing or what my motivation to do said action is half of the time. Literally, there is no reason, past working in the same organization, that most of these characters should be working together. They are all forced to gravitate around this annoying emo character, Squall. Literally he does nothing to show he is leadership material and only continues to push people away like an ♥♥♥ hole, and for some reason everyone seems to go 'HEY LEADER! WE LOVE YOU. TELL US WHAT TO DO'. The only seemingly proper relationship between characters that would make sense (friendship or anything more) would be between Zell and Selfie, but I am 14 hours into the game and I can not remember them speaking to each other even once (if they did speak to each other, then it was such small chat that it is not even registered in my memory bank), instead they just continue to go 'Hey guy that is a complete ♥♥♥ hole to us and does nothing but mope around all day, you are our leader and we think you are just the coolest bean'. There is not character relationship building, past Quistis and Squall, which seemed interesting in the beginning, because they seemed to have some sort of love interest type thing going for them, but it is suddenly dropped for no reason and never brought up again; it was mostly Quistis going 'Squall, I was your instructor and I know you so well over the amount of time I have been teaching you. You act like a less talkative version of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't stand what so ever, but I think I will show romantic interests in you anyways', while Squall goes 'Get the ♥♥♥♥ away from me, you don't understand my pain. CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!'. By the way, I am so far into the game and I still have no idea why Squall is such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who seems to be depressed all the time, he just is... It is his character, he is just an unlikable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that people are FORCED into loving (for no explained reason).  But seriously, this game is so ridiculously cringeworthy. I have not played a game worse than this in a while, but seriously. This is why you don't play games from your childhood; you will find out the game you used to love is actually a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. There are so many discrepancies I have with this game that I have not even voiced. I really do not recommend this game; it is easily a 3/10 game. I may try and finish it, but only when I get extremely bored; it is not worth the ridiculous amount of time it takes to complete it.",

I have to fight a boss to pass just about every screen, some of which I can't defeat and can't escape.

I feel betrayed when I finished the game and one of my friends pointed me to the theories of why the ending was so...strange. after reading the theory I was a bit peeved that was the best explaination to the ending of the story (and even though it made me step back and go 'whoa' I'm still mad). Also I enjoyed the sarcastic humor in this game. I suggest you first play the game before you look into the theories about the ending or else you might loose interest in the game all together.",

            "review_text": "I know a lot of people will say they got into gaming from early age with titles like Mario Brothers and so on. I was playing those games too. Sure. I was playing the early Mortal Kombats and so on. I loved going to the arcade. But if someone had to ask me to really pinpoint the one game that got me absolutaly fascinated with gaming as art form as well, I would say FFVIII. I know there were many other games of note before this - FFVII for example and other non Square titles, but I didn't get to play those. We didn't have a console growing up because my parents got addicted (HA!) and decided to get rid of it, and we were always just alittle behind with the technology to play the newest stuff on PC; I would hang out with friends and watch them play or play on their systems. This game we got when we finally had a PC then that could play it, and it was first time I played an RPG like this (although Zork Grand Inquisitor is my ultimate fave, there are differences here). This game is not something you can really bust your way through. It takes time to properly level your characters; you have to collect magic by either drawing it out from enemies or going around buying it, and I loved the concept that you could run out of the number of spells you had as opposed to mana; you have to really play through the environment to get the full experience. Okay, well, you can get through it faster by just sticking to the main story, but there are a lot of fun side stories and puzzles and bosses to deal with.  Story wise, it's another romance tale, but I think Square Enix does them pretty well. You gave a broody, emo, angry male lead, Squall, but you learn why he's like that as you go on in the story. You're not really supposed to like him all that much until his character is further revealed, in my opinion. You have a bubbly, romantic, but motivated young female lead, who has other sides to her revealed as well. There's time traveling involved, and just don't focus on thinking about it too much because the storyline as a whole that involves a few twists and turns when a powerful sorceress makes a move on the world these characters inhabit is pretty interesting. It's character based too, and you tend to fall in love with a lot of them.   The dynamics of gameplay is that you can design a your core group with up to 3 play playable characters. If you're not into custamizing characters often, might not be your thing, but they have a neat auto option that you can select and it does all the hard work for you. Combat is turn based, and it's not timed. I kind of like that, and it's almost more like chess (umm, just not the timed kind, I suppose). You can also collect guardian forces (GFs), which are powerful magical monsters that you can call upon and level up to create devastating attacks. Magic is, as previously stated, a collection game, and the most annoying thing can be spending hours fighting enemies to collect magic because stores sometimes only carry a certain amount of some magics. However, if you're into that kind of long haul game, it shouldn't bother you.   If you're picking up this game as someone part of the new generation or just having gotten into gaming in today's age, you might think the graphics a bit backwards, but they were pretty spectacular from that time, and I still find them rather breathtaking. Cut scenes are pretty awesome and cinematic, as Square does. Also, I've heard the music for the game when bought and played through Steam is the midi stuff, and not the actual musical score originally played with. It's not that big of a turn off in my opinion, but might be for you, but for the price that FFVIII usually goes for, I'd say it's worth it to try and see. You can easily purchase the phenominal orchestra score on any web sites like amazon for example - and I highly recommend that (there is also a full piano album!).   All in all, I highly recommend giving this game a try, especially if you are a fan of the RPG genre and haven't been able to play some of these older titles.",

If I had to pick out a few negative points it would be the god awful controls for some of the mini-missions. In particular the section where you sneakily input numerical codes on a train while avoiding guards.. and then later on an airborn tekken-esque fight scene. Though I'm going to asssume this is to me sticking with the choice of using a keyboard.  Also, I'm not sure if this is just my personal experience, but some of the sound quality seems a tad compressed?

Though there is no voices for the characters but thats what was part of the charm. You didnt need voices to understand the characters. Learning their background, gaining insight to who they are and focusing on what their challenges are brings the true magic of the game. On playstation one, the era of gaming when people knew what they were doing, this was a crown jewel for anyone to have in their inventory of games. Yes the graphics are dated but that should not stop anyone from trying this game out. It is one of the few FF games that stick to the turn based system with a number of summoning forces to aid in battle. You can spend hours on this game and still feel involved. The characters personalities are abundant with variety and similar in few traits. The music was given great attention as it gives off atmosphere of the games mood, from one moment of calm and serenity to another of tension and haste, from a comedic setting to a sorrowful gloom of emotion.   In my opinion this game has everything you would want in a FF game, or any game. Its detailed down to the smallest asset without sacrificing the story or the character development. Its not in a rush to get to the point yet it does not drag too long when making a decent background story. It has charm, decent story and involving characters. The combat system can be overwhelming in regards to eqiuping your character but overtime it sinks in and helps you decide on how to station each character in battle according to your preferences. Also this game rewards you with the various GFs (Gaurdian Forces) you will aqcuire throught the game and the weapon upgrades. A game worth been called a legend amongst games. As this game sets an example of a studio who knows how to deliver to the fans. I purchased this game because I respect the studio and the game itself for delivering such magic into my game life. For me it is the best game I have ever played yet regretfully not finished.  Other opinions may differe to mine but I strongly recommend anyone who wishes to play a very length game with great rewards awaiting them behind every scene should pay this one, atleast past disc 1 or Act 1 as the case maybe.",

The story is complicated which is Square's trademark from the late 90's and clearly you can see some similarities in the storytelling from FFVII but once you get yourself into the world of FFVIII you won't regret it.  The only thing that I found out to be weird coming from Square was the Junction system, is pretty hard to undestand at first, hell about 5 hours into the game and I was ready to quit until I read an article explaining how the thing works and it all made sense after that. It actually makes the game easier than using mana pools and equipment but doesn't come free though, it takes a lot of your game time to make it easier by drawing all the magic that you can at the very beggining of the game.

            "review_text": "Ahh... Final Fantasy VIII. The great divider. Some people love it, some people hate it, some people  really  hate it.  Final Fantasy VII and VIII were the first (and for many years, the only) Final Fantasy games released on the PC. This version is very similar, and likely based on, the original PC port released in 2000. Final Fantasy VIII was the first in the series for me, I played it near to its PC release, when I was 17, and have since finished it about 9 or 10 times. It is not a great game, but it's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination. It has flaws, but as a complete package, it's a very enjoyable experience.  Most of the criticism for this game comes from the kitschy story and the terrible implementation of the Junction system; specifically, the Draw system. This review will cover those systems.  On paper, the Junction system is phenomenal; and it completes the process Final Fantasy VII began with Materia affecting character stats. Simply put, the Junction system allows you to directly link a spell to a character stat. Life magic linked to your HP stat will give you more health, and strong magic such as Triple or Ultima will provide huge bonuses to various other stats.  The system really shines in its Status and Elemental Attack and Defence junctions, which allow you to link a Status spell (such as Sleep, Drain and Blind) and an Elemental spell (such as Fire, Water and Holy) to your weapon attacks and defence:  Linking Fire to your elemental defence will reduce the damage you take from fire spells. Linking higher level spells, such as Fira and Firaga will reduce the damage you take further and eventually even allow you to absorb that damage. As you'd expect, linking Fire to your elemental attack will cause your attacks to deal fire damage, which is a big advantage against monsters weak to fire.  Similarly, linking a Status spell, such as Sleep to your status defence will reduce the likelihood of being affected by that status effect; and eventually, will negate it completely. And naturally, linking a Status spell to your status attack, will cause your attacks to have a chance to afflict the enemy with that effect. This, by the way, also applies to the Death spell, which has a chance to one-shot a non-boss monster.  Holy hell, what a remarkable level of customization! Amazing, right?!  Not quite.  On its own, it is a great system. Unfortunately, it's not on its own. It is joined by the Draw system; which deviated dramatically from the series' norm and drew (get it?) most of the criticism leveled at the game. Prior to (and since) Final Fantasy VIII, magic spells in the series had a cost of MP - that is, mana. Spells were permanently learned (for the most part), a character had a pool of MP, and each spell cost a certain amount. Not so in this game. Final Fantasy VIII's spells existed in a large, but finite, inventory and each of your characters was able to stock 100 of a spell.  Obtaining these spells required you to extract - or 'Draw' - them from your enemies. Stronger enemies yielded stronger spells. And the type of enemy you fought affected the kinds of spells it possessed - for example, enemies in snowy regions were likely to have the Ice spell and its variants on it, aquatic enemies had Water, and so on. Add to this the fact that your characters' magic stat affects the amount of magic you are able to retrieve in any given Draw action. It is entirely possible for you to spend more than an hour drawing between 1 and 5 spells each time. On each character. Three times.  The option to synthesize these spells from various items dropped by enemies, as well as quest rewards and cards from the card minigame is available; but it's fairly clear that enemies were intended as the main source of most spells.  And the grind begins.  Final Fantasy is not a series foreign to grinding, in most other games in the series, this is implemented as the traditional grind for XP and levels; but as those are fixed in Final Fantasy VIII (every single level requires 1000 XP), the grind was shifted to the acquisition of magic.  OK... So far, it's not so bad... Grind is always a thing...  Ah, but what I have yet to mention, however, is that the quantity of the magic you link to your stats affects them directly. The less of a spell you have, the less effective it is. And if you follow along the logic, you'll come to the conclusion that the magic you link - ostensibly, the strongest magic you have - are the ones you are  least likely to want to actually use in combat.  Yep. I can't remember the last time I actually used a spell in combat.  And so, the other shoe drops. Magic, which is one of Final Fantasy's most recognizable aspects and, arguably, quintessential to the nature of the series, is effectively removed from the combat system.  That sounds terrible, doesn't it? Nah, it's not as grim as all that. You get used to it, and the rest of the game absolutely makes up for it. Final Fantasy VIII is not a bad game, it's even a good game. The art is great for its time, the cinematics are awesome and the story is a bit juvenile - maybe a bit more than your average Final Fantasy (or highschool anime for that matter) - but if you're into that, then you'll enjoy it quite a bit.

But that dosen't mean that FF8 is bad by any means in fact Its better than a lot of the Final Fantasy games out today especially the FF13 games. But that does not mean that its a must buy for everyone. In order for your character to do almost anything they need a GF which is a summon, a character equip multiple summons but make sure everyone has at least one or they can do nothing but attack. Only attacking takes a big chunk of the strategy out so make sure evryone has one. Also some of the characters are unlikable at some times so you never really want to get to know them that much. Now on to the good, the cutscenes look masterful and the gamplay (when you have a GF) is great. the battle animations for your summons are fluid and great to look at but the sound effects are not that great. Those who love FF7 will find plenty to love in FF8. despite a few flaws its still one of the best final fantasy games and a must buy for fans.

Even though that trip brings me all the way back to when I was in about the third grade and stumbled across our family's copy of Final Fantasy VIII for the PlayStation.  Personally, the updated sounds are annoying, though there is luckily a mod in existence that brings back the even more nostalgic PS1 soundtrack back into the fray for anyone that is willing to extract it in. I enjoy the partial controller support as well, especially since that partial controller support can be edited back into the original PS1 set up of how one was introduced to the Final Fantasy controls.  There is actually much neutrality in this post about actually recommending this to someone that is interested. I would say that if you have a PS2, or even a PS1 (or if it's available off of the PSN), to start from there instead of jumping the gun and buying it off of Steam. For someone that has not played the game and is unsure that their computer will run into the same snags and bumps in the road everyone else has, it would ruin a really good game that has a storyline that makes you sit and wonder about the reality of what is actually happening.  As for me, I've come to grin and bear the outcome of what is going on with my game (and even ended up finding a solution that worked for me!). After clearing some data off my computer and verifying the integrity of my game cache, I'm quite pleased to say that the game is running for me. Though, this is a solution that may not work for everyone; if it does, then kudos to you! I hope you enjoy Final Fantasy VIII!  Overall, I am personally happy with the game at this current time, and I'm even more happy to have Final Fantasy VIII officially show up in a collection of mine somewhere since my original PS1 copy cannot be found, and hasn't been able to be found for quite some time now.",

It's about adolescents becoming adults, being forced to grow up in a thriving but apocalyptic world. It's a very Final Fantasy story.  While some hate it, I love the junctioning sytem, which once mastered becomes a really awesome. It's so much different from the Final Fantasy games. Some say that it was a ♥♥♥♥ poor idea that the monsters level up with you, however monsters actually cap, they're just weaker when you're a lower level. Regardless of level, this game is actually not that hard if you know how to junction (Which comes to some people more easily).   Then there's triple triad, possibly the greatest side game that I've ever played. You can play this game before you even fight your first monster (although impossibly hard), however through in game actions (such as turning monsters into your cards) you can collect cards that make it an even game and actually fun. Winning these games earns you more cards that you can later turn into items and magic, making a spectacular addition to those that play.   But should you buy it? After all it's a 'Lazy port and a quick cash grab by Square'  Between chocobo world for those who never had a pocket station and a magic boost that solves many people's issue of having to draw magic from monsters, this game is worth it's asking price.

While the game itself is mostly fine (If you like FF8), Square Enix put stupid unneccesary DRM in that you have to sign into in order to play at all. There is no offline mode as far as I can tell, so if you can't connect to their servers you're out of luck. The port itself is alright, the visuals are a lot cleaner looking compaired to the ps1 counterpart. There is the option for keyboard or controller controls and you are able to edit both so whatever works for you works here. There is some weird problem with the music by default, but there are several quick fixes on the community page that will sort that out. I'll still mark this positive because I like the game, but like I said, its probably not worth it if you have it on the ps1 and can play it on that.",

Easy controls with the keyboard (if you want a gamepad go play it on a ps3).  The story may resonate differently if you originally played it as a teenager, but still retains its enjoyability.  The magic booster mostly eliminates the grind of the early on Card -&gt; Mag Refine, and definitely is nowhere near as OP as FF7's character booster.  Chocobo World is a delightful addition to the game for those who didn't get to play it originally. Overall, while needing a mod to fix the music and perhaps being slightly lazy with the FMV and world map textures, FF8 still deserves the time we gave it back when it was released.",

A lot of the things that many felt let Final Fantasy VIII down are, in my opinion, what makes it so great. The unique junction system, different to any other Final Fantasy, is brilliant. The concept of having stocks of magic is a little off (how.... exactly?), and grinding to get those magics can be a struggle but it makes you appreciate them a lot more, especially when to be the most powerful you can be you have to have stocks of the most powerful magic in the game. But then if you use that magic, your junctioned stats will get less powerful. So then you have to weigh up what matters more. Many couldn't get used to the junction system, but I found it just as easy as the materia system from FFVII.  The music is brilliant, some of my favourite music in any of the games. Also some of my least favourite... But that's a hit and miss with all the games. But honestly, some of the music had it nailed down.  The story is excellent. A lot simpler in concept than FF7, but a lot more character driven than other titles. This is where most people either decide on their love or hate for the game. I personally love the storyline, think it's much easier to relate to than other main characters through the series and the characters are more real. Although Squall, as a main character, has to be the most emotionally unavailable person in history.  I would recommend this game to everyone if I could, but I understand you may not like it as much if you're as hooked on the styles of the other games.",

            "review_text": "I'll start this off with a bit of context: the first time FF8 rolled around, I did not finish it. In fact, I barely got past the first disk. From what I recall it wasn't necessarily due to any particular fault on the games part as much as it was during a deluge of RPGs and it eventually got lost in the shuffle. As of today, I regret not finishing the story, since I've enjoyed this play-through rather extensively.  While I often would expect to defer to the original PS One version as being the superior, I do feel that this may have been the best possible way to experience the game since there are quite a few nagging details that the PC version helps avoid. The game mechanics are a bit out there as far as FF titles go, and can create a significant amount of time devoted to grinding magic acquisition. It is actually to the point in which I could have blamed my initial reluctance to finish the game on that alone, but at the time that was not a particular obstacle, since I really enjoyed abusing those kinds of mechanics and had no problem spending time setting up goofy ways of making it easier (set the control on memory and do some studying while the game ‘draws’ things for you). In the PC version though you can bump up your stock with a push of a button (F5, by the way) and then go on your way, saving significant amounts time. I would say ‘effort’ as well, but it really isn't hard or complicated, just tedious.  So… is it worth playing if you are circumventing game mechanics? Easily, yes. There is still plenty of other facets to the game that are much less annoying (the card game, GF customization, gathering weapon materials, etc). Boss battles are occasionally interesting and have some quirks, though it probably could have had that occur more often since much of the game is face-roll-on-keyboard(gamepad) easy. It should be noted that like any other PC port of a JRPG, expect to use a controller. It probably could be handled with a keyboard alone, but it is not really made with keyboard and mouse in mind (shocker, I know).  The themes of the game can be pretty quickly summarized as being about an awkward romance (note the specific title silhouette with a couple embracing) involving an introverted male lead and a heroine determined to tease him constantly. They spend some time world-building and such but it is clearly tertiary to the main focus, Rinoa and Squall. That would probably be part of why I hold it in higher esteem than many other FF games in that it achieves this much better then most. The main boss and overall conflict is kind of explained, but not terribly well, but it never feels like it was that important anyway. Admittedly, it could be considered a bit of a cheap way to get a pass regarding some of the most frustrating and goofy aspects of JRPGs in general (the antagonist mainly just be crazy, no real solid motivation or realistic goals), which totally do apply here as well. But, quite frankly, I didn’t really care. I still enjoyed every minute of it.",

While time and retrospect has changed my mind on which FF games were the 'best' in my opinion, one thing can be said about FF8: it is still great today.   This title is among the top in the franchise for sheer amount of content. There is plenty to do (including a card game that is still played today outside of this game!), and a whole lot of secrets to find. Also, a variety of different characters and personalities make going through this great journey of self-discovery and saving the world even more enjoyable.  The game play mechanics are actually still among the deepest in the franchise. The 'Junctioning System' allows the player to truly customize their characters game play style in almost every way possible. Players can attach Magic onto every slot in a characters stat-line to increase their potency. Players can even add Magic onto their attack and defense slots to add elemental and status effects onto their attacks (or make them immune to various types of attacks and effects). Conversely, if you don't really understand this system, players can just rely on just casting the powerful Guardian Forces (GF's) throughout the game. This can be repetitive as the animations for these summoned companions cannot be skipped. But, at least you have options.  However, when looking at production values out-of-the-box, this game is certainly dated, and filled with flaws. The pre-rendered backgrounds are hideously blurry and the sound is made up of awful midi-files. Fortunately, the avid gamer can find a fix for all of these issues. Mods exist to clean up the graphics and interface and make them look decent. There are also sound mods to bring the orchestral soundtrack back into the game.  All-in-all, if you've never played FF8, but like JRPG's, this one is certainly worth the play-through. It can be considered essential to fans of the genre. If you already played it back in 1999, I can definitely say it is just as good today (if not better) as it was back then. A lot can change in 17 years, and there are possibly many story elements that you did not understand or certain nuances and poignant moments that could have gone past your head.  9/10 'Excellent'",

            "review_text": "BUY THE ORIGINAL PS1 VERSION OF THIS GAME IF YOU CAN, IT'S WORTH IT JUST FOR THE MUSIC ALONE.  Anyway if I hadn't made it clear enough, the original PS1 version is superior in almost every way but if you can't get your hands on one (it's not difficult to find though) I guess this port is good enough.   FFVIII is an absolutely great game that gets ripped on too frequently by the few loud FFVII fans that wanted another VII when it came out. Needless to say: ignore them. I'm going to list some gameplay related features that make FFVIII different to other games in the series below, whether these are pros or cons are up to you.  1. THIS GAME IS TURN BASED (ATB). You can configure in-game whether you want turns to wait when you input your commands (like FFX) or whether time will pass regardless, meaning the battle doesn't pause when you in put commands. It's great for RPG beginners or veterans.  2. NO GRINDING NEEDED/ENEMIES LEVEL WITH YOU. I think this is a great feature if you like a challenge. You can stay at a low level and breeze through boss fights or you can level up and make things more challenging for yourself. For those that hate to grind, you'll never have to.  3. LOTS OF CONTENT. FFVIII has the best minigame (triple triad) which is almost like a full game within the game, card fanatics will love it. There is also numerous story-related side-quests, weapons to upgrade, hidden GF's/summons to collect, chocobo minigames and if you love retro-bit games (like tamagotchi or pokewalker) the pocket station is included in this version where you can raise a baby chocobo, collect items and train it to summon in-game.   4. BEST MUSIC. I'm actually not being biased here, in my opinion FFVIII has consistently great music and every battle and boss theme is epic. Sadly the port uses MIDI whereas the original game does not. I had to mod this port because after playing the original game I could not bring myself to listen to the MIDI tracks.  Anyway the best way to judge the game for yourself is to play it yourself, this is my favourite game I love everything about it and I hope you will too!",

I can't say enough how happy I was to find it here on steam and be able to add it to my collection. Just wish this one could get an HD makeover like VII is getting... Regardless, buy this game and play it, then thank me later : )",

This game is a wonderful classic from the past and while I still own the origal PS1 game I bought and played it on steam. The game is just as great as I remember it. Epic story, fun game play and combat system. I have no complaints on this game at all and look forward to the next final fantasy game that ports to pc. &lt;3",

The gameplay is amazing, the story is breathtaking and you really get attached to the world your placed in.   While the skill and 'draw' system in this game might seem abit awkward at first, its very easy to understand and definately fun to play with. Tons of summon, LOTS of customization too.To add, the card game within this game is just so addicting.  Very open world, akin to older final fantasy games. In my eyes, a game that can hold the test of time. For any final fantasy fan, this is a must play. For anyone wanting to play an 'old school RPG', this is a must play. For anyone, this is a must play.  ",
