            "review_text": "I played the game through in a little under 2 hours but I had a bit of a break in between where I had the pause menu open. I would say you could play it through in 1h 30m or maybe less, depending how long it takes you to figure out some of the puzzles.  The game is a very beautiful platformer with a few puzzles here and there. The game is not very hard and when you die you do spawn close by, not having to repeat to much each time.  In this game you control a little Robot who starts it's adventure near a crash site. Without giving to much away, as you progress through the alien world you find audio tapes which have recordings for you from someone who knows you, giving away pieces of a background story about you and your existence with each audio tape.  The story is light but has a bit of a 'surprise' revelation to it at the end, adding a nice touch.  The game is just beautiful and colorful with an amazing looking alien world and creatures. The different environments you play through are stunning and the atmosphere and music are perfectly balanced.  The game is very short and given you can complete it in under 1.5 hours it is up to you to decide if that is worth a price tag of â‚¬9.99.  The game makes up for it in its stunning looks and the amazing experience I had playing it and I know I will play through it again.  For me it was worth it and I would definitely recommend the game.",

Plus it was an interesting story too!  +voice actor for said audio logs is fantastic.  +nice ambient, calming music.  +doesn't take too long to beat (90-120 min)   (very minor nitpicks below)  -I'm not too crazy about the graphics. They're simplistic but somewhat detailed (if that makes sense). I could only imagine how awesome this game would look if it used detailed sprites with lots of vibrant color all over the place.  -I think the title of the game will put a lot of people off from even trying it.  -$10 is a bit high with low incentive to play multiple playthough. $5 is buy price for me.   8/10 ",

The art is simple yet elegant in its design, with a wonderful soundtrack that pulls you into the mysterious cosmic world of our little hero. Was planning on taking my time with it but the gameplay was so enthralling I ended up finishing it in a few hours. There are a few challenging puzzles, but likely won't leave you banging your head against the wall trying to solve. For those who are fans of Cave Story (incidentally the last game I played many moons back), you're in for a treat!",

            "review_text": "Planet of the Eyes attempts to replicate Limbo's success, but lacks the kind of atmosphere and challenge that made Limbo good. It has the simplicity and core puzzles, but beyond that, it is a very bland title.  Playing it I never felt challenged by the platforming or puzzle design, only frustrated with its limitations. Towards the end, you'll encounter rotating arrangements of boxes to traverse. You have to carefully balance your little robot to not slide down on either side of a block, and figure out the right angle to jump off from. It is a matter of timing and precision, yet the controls feel noticeably unprecise in these sections. This is mostly down to when your robot will find it in himself to latch onto a ledge. The angle of a box has to be just right for it to happen, and even when you feel you should have been able to grab onto it, the automatic system might think otherwise. In reverse, you might end up sticking to ledges when you didn't mean to, and die as a result as well.  That kind of design quirk makes me wonder why the devs couldn't have implemented, I don't know, a button press for hanging on to things? Its not like the game offers more than jump and interact buttons, plus a joke/achievement related dance button. Well, there is the pause menu too, but that, while it has a 'Resume' button, doesn't actually pause the game. Oh joy.  A lot of the puzzle-platforming could have been improved simply by requiring my user input, which a ledge-grab action would have helped with. There are a lot of spots where you have to jump from ledge to ledge, and the button-press timing necessary for that would have made them a lot more engaging. The way the game plays now, however, just had me  bored . Beyond the clean and quirky art style, and the occassional audio log detailing the plot passively, I didn't feel like this was something enjoyable to play. The minimalist sound design adds to that as well.   Compared to Limbo, which it is closest to, everything felt too basic, too simplistic and without real tension. There were a bunch of cool sections with alien wildlife making things difficult for you, but those mostly happened in the earlier parts of the game, and the closer you get to the end, the more it turns into pulling switches to avoid repetitive traps and waiting for platforms to move on their pre-described rotations or ferry you over lava lakes, while you're standing in place until reaching the jump-off point.   It is an utterly inoffensive game, but sadly, that also means it has nothing really going for it to keep me playing.",

The platforming mechanics are effectively used, and the puzzles, though easy, are varied and paced well such the game flows well in a single sitting playthrough.

The 'puzzles' are easy and you will mostly just find yourself stuck if you can't get the timing right, which happens every now and again, it's really just a game about timing except for that one water and that other lava 'puzzle'.  It has good art with a nice clean aesthetic and vibrant colours, it doesn't quite hit the spot for me, but it's consistent and well executed.  The story is conveyed through the surroundings and tape recordings left behind by your creator, how he got to those places alive, and how your path to that place isn't destroyed from him reaching it, is left up to game logic. It's the ramblings of a man who's been rejected by his fellow men and has only one friend, us, the robot. Which basically takes the role as his child.  If you enjoy short games like LIMBO, give it a spin, it only lasts for 1-1/2 hour. Is the price right? I got my copy with the humble monthly bundle so it's hard to assess properly, but, neh, I wouldn't say so, maybe at 33~50% off.",
