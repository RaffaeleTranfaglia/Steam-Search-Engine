            "review_text": "Despite this game being older than the majority of Steam users, this game is and will remain a gem.  Once you start off you'll notice all the small things like weird pathing, choppy animations, lag and such, you'll want to unistall and never touch this beauty again. But after playing abit and realising the depth this one has to offer plus all the fun that comes along with it, you'll be hooked.  I used to play this ages ago, when the servers were full of hackers and stuff. Those days seems to be over.  Theres also no other game like it. Definitely worth trying.  Hopefully this game will build up a small and dedicated community again to continue the war between humans and vampires! :D",

            "review_text": "This game used to be so magical when I was a kid because it was my first MMO, and also one of the first korean MMORPGs as well. I spent way too many hours on this game back in the day getting the best guns in the game and ALL-RES gear through trading with koreans. I did my first bait and switch scams here too. I PK'd people mercilessly in the heaven's open-area because I could because why not. I met people from all over the world here. I learned some korean too playing this game, like how to buy and sell things when I was like 10 or something like that. I learned the wonders of dungeon raiding way before WoW came out, and it was glorious  I never played cataclysm before and this reminds me nothing of the vanilla dark eden. Resolution hurts my eyes I cannot even full screen it, communitys dead (to be expected anyhow).   Playing it through was fun for like the first 20 minutes then it got stale really quickly.   Some things are better left untouched and cherished for when they were revolutionary at the time  ",

            "review_text": "Overall, not a terrible game, but.......The graphics are too outdated and the view is too far back, my eyes are great, but I don't have superman vision.   Pros: Pictures are nice ( not in a sexual way ), Music is amazing.   Cons and reasons why i won't be playing this game:  No zoom option Text too Small Everything is too small Graphics are just outdated and too old looking.  No run feature. Do you really expect me to enjoy walking around everywhere across massive large maps , no thanks.   Advice to the devs: Update the game to 2016 standards, in every department.   Suggestion to players looking for a similar game but with bettr graphics, zoom feature and random loot and a run feature---&gt; There's a game called ' Zax: The Alien Hunter '. You proabldy can download the game at this point, even though i bought it years ago and i play it daily. Trust me.",
