            "review_text": "On the surface, this game is just a big bunch of stereotypes put together. However, this turns out to be one of its biggest strengths. The game strikes a good balance between rolling with the tropes and subverting them, constantly leading you into an 'obvious' conclusion and then pulling the rug from underneath you. Then, as soon as you start accounting for this, the game once again switches gears to keep you guessing. I encountered quite a few unexpected plot twists during my first playthrough of the PSP fan translation a few years back, which was a pleasant surprise given the predictable nature of most video game stories.  While the story is still pretty fun even if you do know what's going to happen, if you are currently unspoiled, I suggest you try and keep it that way. Stay away from forums, don't look online for fan art and for God's sake  do not listen to the soundtrack until you finish the game  (I managed to spoil myself by reading the tracklist during my first playthrough).  In terms of replayability, I consider the game to be worth at least two playthroughs: there is a lot of clever foreshadowing that you will simply not get on your first playthrough hidden throughout the game and focussing your gift-giving and free time activities on different characters will reward you with additional backstory for them. As such, I'd say the current asking price is very fair, even for a six-year old port.  Aside from buying the game based on its merits, if you are at all interested in seeing similar games get ported from Sony's ill-fated handhelds to Steam, buying Dangan Ronpa is a good signal to companies like Spike Chunsoft that there is, in fact, a market for them. It's unfortunate for Sony, but thanks to Spike Chunsoft, I won't have to consider buying a Vita (TV) anymore to play the second installment of this series and I sincerly hope that other hidden gems will eventually make their way to Steam as well.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR at first: It's Phoenix Wright meets Battle Royale with quirky art direction and fantastic music. It's p. damn good!  Got introduced to this game when Onenronen started the quite legendary thread on Something Awful where he translated the game for his screenshot LP. At the time it was literally the only way to experience the game in any translated form and it did gain quite a huge cult following, thanks to Tumblr's involvement etc, and this eventually attracted Spike Chunsoft's attention and they eventually decided to release the game in the west.  Now, few years later, I'm getting to play this game on Steam and having first hand experience with this small web phenomenon that I was checking up multiple times a week for many, many months... And the game's tight. Definetly recommend using the japanese audio instead of the english one, as the english one's pretty damn cheesy, and you will miss some quite notable voice actors - for example Shinji's VA from NGE is voicing the protagonist in this game, and the old lady who voices Doraemon does actually do VA work for Monokuma, that's quite a fresh and unexcepted from her, really fitting though!  Playing on controller, it might look or control a bit clunky at first, considering this was originally a PSP game, but other than that it works fine. Only had one crash and that was due to too much alt tabbing for matter of hours and it eventually didn't like that.  But yeah. Very fresh 'n quirky art direction (jeesh the cutscenes in this game!), music is fantastic and while the characterisation is bit tropey at times, the writing saves a lot and this game packs quite a bunch of twists and mystery for you to untangle 'n experience.  I'd say give it a shot definetly if you dig murder mysteries and visual novels. I do like this, but I'm a sucker for these sorta games anyhow.",

There is much thought put into Danganronpa's story, as it is very fascinating in it's murder mystery plot and dark humor. If point an click adventure/visual novels are your thing, along with an Ace Attorney style court drama where you present evidence and do fun little mini games is exciting to you, then I recommend this game to you. It even has an optional 'dating sim' type mode called free time where you can unlock more about each character to find out their information and backstory. They may seem like stereotypical tropes at first, but later on you find there's more layers to who they are and you'll get very invested. Again, if this type of game is your thing, then I highly recommend this experience to you and guaruntee it's worth your time and money.",

For people who played ace attorney series or 9 hours 9 persons 9 doors i can nothing to add just buy it. But for others who never watched an anime, played visual novellas and keep wondering who the fukc are all those geeks with anime avatars giving this game almost perfect 100% score i will try to elaborate)  Visual novela in most cases is living embodiment of story driven game played as the book with pictures in the background and music. But the biggest problem is quality- overwhelming quantity of them are made as eroge. You read a tremendous amount of text to finally get that girl that you saw on the scrennshot. That sums up in brief 90% of all visual novels) But there is always an exception when some autors try to step up from genre boundaries. And thus we can see the appearance of titles like fate stay night/clannad/ umineko and ext. Their overall quality of plot/ charachters is so high, that they get immediately converted into anime/manga and its paper counterpart.   Danganronpa on the other hand same as ace attorney or 999 series is def among the best. But unlike others top notch novels those 3 share 1 thing in common. They actually have a gameplay elements which are trials, investigations and puzzles( mostly 999 series). And this mishmash between heavy text focused story and gameplay create such a huge profound immersion into the game that even best recreational books wont be able to deliver, Especailly in this particular one. Trials. That are well made. always keep up with good story and where you actually can try and recreate whole situation of how the murder was unfolded.  Overall i could spout for a few pages about this game, but il be brief. I loved it and i highly reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "Danganronpa is a fantastic game. That's about all there is to say. The plot of this game is gripping and paced excellently. Each character you meet is well written with their own quirks and personality traits, and you care about all of them. This is what makes the game so tense; you don't know which of your friends is going to die next. One day you could be talking to them in the laundry room and the next moment you find their body at the scene of some horrible murder. It's a grim experience, made even more so by the presence of Monokuma's insanity.  The gameplay itself is logic based, requiring you to listen to what each character has to say and work out the events of the crime. The mechanics whilst in the 'class trial' sections of the game can be a little clunky at times, but it's still a highly satisfying experience. Finding that contradiction you've been struggling on for a little while fills you with a great sense of pride and the tension of what's going to happen next makes these segments highly enjoyable.  The sound design of the game is what I have the highest praise for. I've been listening to playlists of it's soundtrack since the game came out and every time Monokuma's damn theme hits I can't help but grin a little bit and sing along. Each piece of music is very well implemented and fitting for the moment, and the voice work is believable and well delivered.  This game is an experience, a pretty damn fun one at that, and if you enjoy cute anime girls getting murdered in brutal fashion, it should be right up your street.",

It does take some hours to finish and replayability is not that high (although there is School Mode after you finish the game, which I haven't played yet), but it's a nice game, very thrilling and will make you play for hours and hours to know who killed someone, what happened and what is about to happen next.

Because that's what this game's about: the story. Which is fantastic, and although some plot points could be seen as a teeny bit... well, anime, and the sheet definately has a few holes, it was incredibly engaging and interesting, most everything makes perfect sense, and it's very well crafted. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this.  There are a few gripes I have with the game, but they're very minor. One is the main menu system/basic controls; it's very awkward at first, as the navigation is keyboard controlled, and selecting things is left click on the mouse.

I knew nothing of the manga before beginning my experience, and honestly that doesn't seem to take away in any way whatsoever. The story is beautifully original, and brilliantly executed. The characters are likable and relatable. The dialogue is witty and filled with ironic banter. Truly a unique, fun, and engaging game.

It will devour an ungodly amount of your time with kawaii anime waifus, challenge your brain with orange text, and kill off your kawaii anime waifus that you so desperately wanted to do all the things that Monokuma says...like humping plastic bottles, or engaging in some boy-on-boy action with Genocide Jill. It's the greatest game ever created.  Here are some spoilers.  Taka and Mondo profess their love for each other in a steamy hot sauna like naughty boys. Taka strips down to his n00ds and Mondo keeps his clothes on to fry his e-Handbook. This eventually leads to you figuring out that he killed the kawaii anime waifu that you so desperately loved, but then fall out of love with as that waifu is a man. That's for Taka to take.  But things don't go so well for Taka, because he gets killed by our good friend Celeste. So our gay fantasies take a halt, but only for a while...  Because our good friend Toko, who is also a serial killer, is into that hot boy-on-boy. She loves watching master slap her and insult her.  Hifumi is one of the most poorly designed characters in existence. Watch as he makes cringy video game references and tries to act hip and cool. He looks awful and makes me want to throw up every time I see him. Luckily he gets killed by our friend, Celeste. That's right, 2 for 1. He comes back to life for a while, and I screamed 'NO DIE PLEASE,' but luckily, my plead to the heavens worked, and that monstrosity died.  Makoto is the main character. He's a jerk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Kyoko Kirigiri is the most kawaii anime waifu to ever be seen in decades. After being revealed as the ultimate detective, which is pretty obvious after investigation of the first murder, but it's not official until the 5th chapter, she becomes even more kawaii as she shows more emotion. She was my personal waifu, as Toko left me for another man, and Aoi loved doughnuts too much. Oh and Sayaka is dead.  That man that stole my waifu was none other than Byakuya Togami. He's awful. I wish he died.  Sayaka dies after professing her love to you. Did she just lie? I don't know, but she was kawaii. RIP Waifu #1.  Leon dies too. He's an awful character really. I'm glad he died first.  Aoi swims and eats doughnuts, and for some reason she survives. Why? I don't know. I would have traded her for Sayaka but oh well.  Our friend, Yasuhiro Hagakure. ♥♥♥♥ this character. He doesn't die. He keeps making stupid and useless comments all the time. He doesn't add anything to the game, he isn't funny, and he's just mentally ill. I feel like his memory was wiped a little bit too much. You will hate this character. Don't like him.  My buddy Chihiro got killed by the gay man himself, Mondo. He was a man, and I didn't know. He wanted to get stronk, but his dream never got realized. So he got killed at the gay bar my Mondo.  Sakura is what some people call 'underrated'. I call her 'Naruto'.  Celeste is pretty kawaii, and I love how she killed Hifumi and Taka, some of my least favorite characters. I just hate her for having the chance to kill Hagakure and not doing it. What a waste.  Junko and her sister are kind of the same. One gets killed and the other pops back up again when you're not even thinking about her. Why? For plot. I don't like her really.  Monokuma is a bisexual bear controlled by Junko, I guess? Who cares? He likes to hump bottles and he has a water fetish.  Don't succumb to despair.  10/10 for Kyoko Kirigiri.",

I don't usually like visual novel style games, or dating sims for that matter. However, the story in this game is rather intriguing, and the game gives you opportunities to really feel clever. If you like watching mystery TV shows and figuring things out, or if you're a fan of Ace Attorney games, you'll probably like the story and court-like gameplay elements in this game.  The worst part of this game is it drags on a little sometimes. It could have been more succinct. In true anime fashion, sometimes characters just have to do their 'catchphrase' and all you want to do is focus on the murder at hand. I ended up occasionally holding down Ctrl to skip through when I knew what way a conversation was headed, even though that option is surely intended only for multiple playthroughs, as it skips rather quickly through the text.",

            "review_text": "A linear experience but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.   Danganronpa is an incredibly stylistic visual novel with a morbid atmosphere where you play as Makoto Naegi with 14 other students, trapped together, in a prestigious private school known as 'Hope's Peak Academy'. The only way to escape however, is to kill.   But wait just one second, there's fine-print, isn't there? T_T  In order to escape or 'graduate', nobody must know who is the real killer, by placing the blame on someone else, only then, may the blackened one can truly escape from the despair that is Hope's Peak Academy.  In a classic 'whodunnit' game, you're tasked to find clues &amp; evidence leading to the true murderer followed by a showdown in a class trial, piercing through statements &amp; contradictions for the execution judgement. If you get it right, the killer gets punished. If you get it wrong, the real killer walks away and everyone else gets punished i.e. dead.   It's a dialogue-heavy game with some engaging gameplay mechanics that'll leave you hooked for more. You just have to try out Danganronpa. It may deter you if you knew there's no multiple-routes in this game which is expected for most visual novel. Hell, if you have no love for visual novels, you might not enjoy this game.

            "review_text": "Honestly, having been a fan of this series for years going back to when I read through a translated guide for the Japanese PS Vita game, I was more than excited to see this up in the steam store. When the English version came out for the PS Vita I was a little crushed to realise that I didn't have a Vita to play it on and was actually considering just buying one for the series but I guess now I don't have to!  If you've seen the anime, or you've watched someone play though it on the PS Vita, then nothing's changed from that. The anime came from the following the game garnered so the story is just the same, but you get to know the characters a lot more and you have to pick up the clues yourself which is rather fun! And as far as I can tell, the difference between PC and Vita is just the hardware you have for your PC really. It seems like a simple port with the added bonus of you get to use either the keyboard and mouse or you can use your own controller.   In terms of playing the game itself, I like it. The music is near always on point, there's not very many loading screens and if you do get them be ready for them to disappear in a few seconds if your hardware is of good quality. The characters are all very unique and different, you could say a personality type and there wouldn't be two of the same in the cast of characters. I also really like the designs of the characters, and the overall way they look is very stylistic as well. Though their eyes seem constantly wide open, even when they're relaxing I can't blame them in a school of murder.   I guess one thing that's a little bit weird is that you can tell what part of a character is going to move in I suppose the 'cutscenes'. When a text conversation moves from a backdrop and a character to a drawn screen, sometimes you'll notice that the characters will have a white outline and sometimes their arm might have a line between the arm and the shoulder. Click along a couple of times and that arm will move for example. It's rather minor and if you're reading the text it doesn't matter but still it's definitely something people with sharp eyes would notice so it's something to point out.   And another thing, be careful when you get the launcher up on the first time that you open up the game. If you're not sure of the resolution or the filtering don't tick the little box that says 'Don't show this again' because you'll have to boot that up with the launcher.exe you'll find in your game files. But if you manage to get the right settings right away, then congratulations you can click that little box and jump right to the game if you'd like!  All in all, this game is a must if you like murder mystery games and games that aren't just about the action and have a good plot and solid characters! And if you get sick of hearing the English voices (who would get tired of listening to that Monobear?!), you've always got the option to switch to the Japanese voices which is rather enjoyable! I can't recommend it enough.",

If you've played the Vita version before, the PC version is better in that it has up to 4K support, 60FPS, KB plus Mouse support that works better than expected.   Danganronpa is, in my opinion, visual novels done right. The game doesn't have much in traditional replay value, but that didn't stop me from getting this version immediately. It's well written enough that you don't get bored when the game goes full on text mode, but has enough interactivity to be a 'game' and it breaks up the pacing enough to keep things from getting stale.   But that wouldn't matter if the story wasn't interesting or well written, but thankfully, it absolutely is. I could explain why the mystery is so intriguing, the mechanics make a whole lot of sense in the context of the story, but those would be spoilers in themselves. If you enjoy a good mystery, anime in general, or just love crazy characters to get attached to then try it. You won't regret it.",

The game is very similar to the Ace Attorney series in that you'll follow a structure of 'lull period &gt; murder &gt; investigation &gt; trial', but it's a much darker setting where an average joe and various eccentric upperclassmen are locked up in a private academy, with the only way out being to kill another student and get away with the crime.

It's a hybrid between visual novel and adventure game, with a cast of absurd characters who you actually get pretty attached to over time, ratcheting up the tension of wondering who's going to off who next. Whereas the court sections in Ace Attorney are fairly static affairs of 'present evidence here', in Danganronpa they're comprised of these ridiculous minigames, like firing your evidence at opposing statements in an on-rails shooter, or playing a rhythm game to out-argue your opponent. It's nuts, and it's awesome.  Masafumi Takada's soundtrack is a real gem too, it's an absolutely fantastic blend between the creeping dread pervading the grim atmosphere and high-energy electro beats during the court sections.

            "review_text": "In this review I will cover three things; story, gameplay and visuals.  1.Story (SPOILERS) (There will be a no spoilers explanation after this) (9/10)  The game is a challenge where every chapter aims to make you feel more tense as numbers of students drop. Some students you may like, or you could claim them as your waifu. Think again! Danganronpa knows that and will kill your waifu for the lulz. As the story progresses, you become more determined to find out who the mastermind is. That's if you're playing for the story, anyway. If you wasn't, you wouldn't be reading this section.   (No spoilers)  The story is decent. As the game progresses, the story deepens as you learn more about the mystery that you have become involved in. Thankfully, this game actually has a backstory! What's also good is that it's incorporated into the game itself, so you don't need a Masters Degree in backstory identification to put the pieces together. There is a particular point in the story that focuses on this, actually.   As well as that, you can develop bonds with the characters, enabling you to learn more things about them. Some conversations may be less than happy sunshine rainbows, and others can be entertaining. It depends on the character you choose to bond with. A specific character doesn't give you much information about herself as there are only 2-3 interactable events with her, whereas the others have around 7 events. Yes Sayaka, I'm talking about you. This was a little disappointing because I wanted to understand who she was before the incident before everyone starts going The Purge on each other, but it's something I can tolerate.  Another feature I liked is a couple of important choices you need to make. Depending on your input, the story can follow an alternate path, but take you back to the same moment after. The story is linear, so there is only one possible ending (apart from a secret alternate ending, as mentioned above). I like to think of Danganronpa as an interactable Visual Novel because of this. However, some features make the game exceed from just an interactable visual novel into a challenging game on the first play through, that's if you're not being a dirty cheater and using GameFAQs or YouTube. On the first blind play through, it's a great story altogether.  2. Gameplay (9/10)  There are two main aspects of the game; investigation and trials. When a murder occurs, you need to investigate the scene and contact the students for more information. These statements and evidence will be converted in the form of truth bullets. Once all truth bullets have been collected, you will enter the class trial.  The class trial has numerous parts; talking, identifying contradictions and mini games. You need to listen carefully when everyone is talking so you can understand the viewpoints of other students, then speculate possibilities.   When you enter a non stop argument, statements will fly on the screen, some words white and some yellow. The white words can not be interacted with, but you can interact with the yellow words by shooting truth bullets at them. The truth bullets will only shatter the statement if you use the right truth bullets. This means you have successfully identified a contradiction in the statement. For example: 'I went to the shops mainly to buy some drinks'. You would shoot the last part of that statement because I actually went to the shops to play Pokemon GO. If you used the wrong truth bullet or you shot at the wrong statement, you will lose some of your HP, in the form of hearts. One loss: one heart. 'Black noise' also appears, absorbing your bullets.  In the trial, you can also answer questions that require you to think back, which is why you need to remember previous conversations. If you answer incorrectly, you lose a heart but if you answer correctly, you gain half a heart. This is why it is important to conserve your HP; if you answer more questions wrong than you do right, you will expire your HP.  Mini games such as a hangman style game and a rhythm style battle will be challenging in your first play through. If I recall correctly, some words are very complicated to guess but you'll eventually guess them in good time. Slowly but surely. As always, HP is in effect. Another thing- you can obtain special abilities that help nullify your weaknesses. For example, if you like to lose HP, you can unlock a skill by bonding with a certain person that equips more HP.   Gameplay in general is great, but the Hangman Gambit words confuse me sometimes, especially the fact that I've never heard some of the words before (SPOILER: Never heard the word Schizo. Or is that DGR2?) I guess it's part of the challenge.  After you complete the main game, there's a separate section where you can force your characters into manual labour to clean up the school or go treasure hunting in various parts of the school to build projects that Monokuma never appreciates anyway, the spoilt brat. Most cases you will not win the extra mode on your first or second play through, but you might on your third. Stats carry over, of course. So every time you start a new game after completing your old game, you will have the same cleaning/discovering power as you did last game. For example, if Makoto had a level 5 cleaning power on the end of my first play through, he would have the same level on the start of the next.  3. Graphics (8/10)  Graphics are mediocre. The backdrops are cartoon style, so some areas are exaggerated. Not a bad thing. At first, I thought the protagonist was hallucinating because the blood was pink. The characters appear to be anime style, but somehow vary from the usual anime style artwork. For example, the eyes are different, with rings in the iris. Speaking of artwork, did I tell you there's a separate section where you can unlock artwork in exchange for mono coins? A neat feature.  However, some of the characters artwork look odd. For example, when I look at Sayaka's hair, it looks like fabric. It's also weird to see everyone as flat as if a Panzer II tank had flattened them, but I guess that's part of the artwork. It would have looked nicer if they were 3D however. That's my main concern with the game. Apart from that, graphics are okay. I like how the scenery builds itself instead of just appearing. Very unique. Also Junko looks very nicu.  Overall, a 9/10. A great game, but could have used a few finishing touches. Please give me feedback on my reviews, it helps a lot!",

            "review_text": "Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a PC port of a PSP game released in 2010. It's a visual novel mystery adventure game, similar to the Ace Attorney series. However in my honest opinion, this game is the poor man's version of the Ace Attorney (AA) series.  The game is about 15 teenagers, trapped in school where their only means of escaping is to murder other teenagers trapped under the watchful gaze of Monokuma, a derange psychopath remote controlling a mechanical bear. It's up to the main character, Makoto Naegi, to find out the murderer when a murder happens, discover the mysteries of the school and escape.  The characters are very colourful and well diverse (except for the main character who is self-aware to be completely average and have absolutely no special traits or talents whatsoever). Thankfully the supporting casts are not as boring but since this is a murder mystery game, players might not have the chance to fully know some of the characters. In fact, there's literally only 3 characters including the MC that are fully capable of running an investigation. The others are basically dead weight. Some are more likable than others but most are completely useless. Even worse, one of the characters who survived the whole game is a comic relief who brings absolutely nothing to the game other than making stupid and bad jokes. I assure you, the jokes are not funny and it honestly makes me question the devs decision to keep the character alive.  Gameplay, as I mentioned before, are similar to the AA series, only not as polished. There's an element of dating sim in the game but sadly underdeveloped. I appreciate the first person mode but it honestly doesn't do much to add to the game. The murder mysteries are inferior compared to the AA series and the clues are either too obvious or too vague. Nothing is more frustrating than not knowing what exactly the game really wants.  The ending sucks, too. The games tried so hard to give a fulfilling ending with it's plot twists and all but I found it to fall short. Honestly it kinda makes me a bit depressed in the end.  One thing people should know about this game is that there's little to none replay value. Once you've beaten it, that's it. Unless you like reading mountains of texts and re-solving the same murder, you probably won't replay this.  Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a good game, so I'm giving it a thumbs up. However compared to the AA series, this game is clearly not as good.  RECOMMENDED: For anyone who enjoys the AA series, visual novel games or solving mysteries. NOT RECOMMENDED: For those who doesn't enjoy anime-styled visual novel games.",

It's basically Phoenix Wright on steroids while snorting Dr. Pepper (I don't know...).  -If you're into reading, this game has a lot of it. It's basically a visual novel.  -If you're into quirky characters, the design and personality of all the characters are great. You'll hate and you'll love, but just as intended.  -If you're a massochist, well not really. This game won't break your balls like Telltale loves to do, but they do allign on crushing your hope.

I entered not knowing much, I knew it was on the PS Vita or something, and that this is a pc port, not like remake so I wasnt expecting it to be super super graphically amazing, but I just wanted something with a good story. Now, this game on a whole is one of the best games I have ever played. The story had me hooked within the first 5 minutes, and since then I have basically only been thinking about Danganronpa. The art style is fantastic in my opinion! Now sure as I said its not a remake I dont think, so the graphics are not like new triple A games or anything, no, instead it has a very interesting art style that still works great despite the blurriness of the cutscenes, some objects etc. The story in this game is both messed up and amazing at the same time. The whole investigating part I thought was amazing! Sure it was like quite linear, the class trials only really start when you have all the clues (I think anyway, only played through once but I have not failed any trials so I assume that I had all the clues for it), and in my opinion a more non linear approach could have been more interesting, but, that said, it was still absolutely amazing! Hmm, I suppose I should do that 1 to 10 scale for different aspects of the game, here goes:  Graphics: 10/10 - I know people will disagree because of the quality, but the art style which is technically graphics, is brilliant in my opinion, its unique and will forever be in my mind as one of the best art styles in a game in my opinion.  Story: 9/10 - Now I know I said about how amazing this story is, it was AMAZING, but there were a few parts that I was... Less keen on. The ending of the game was a little... I dont know, it worked, the ending was amazing! I still feel like all adrenaline-y from it so it was REALLY good! But it also felt a little... Open? Not expected? I cant say why really without spoilers, but it was a good end.  Gameplay: 10/10 The gameplay of it was amazing, a combination of point and click, visual novel, detective investigation was brilliant! One slight complaint, nearer the end of the game I did encounter a few bugs, like with the preparation for the 5th investigation case thing, I couldnt click on the rubble without it clicking the body, and to get the rubble debris thing, I had to turn the camera a lot to click it, slight bug but nothing major! The gameplay itself though was absolutely fantastic!  Performance: 10/10? I dont know about anyone else, I had no performance issues for this game, 60fps constantly, no drops, didnt seem particularely demanding, then again, my computer is pretty good so I would be suprised if there were issues with this sorta game.  Phew, I have rambled enough x3 I am sure no one will read this anyway but if anyone did, uh, thank you for reading? Buy this game, its really good, I genuinly would recommend this game completely to anyone~ I cant wait till Danganronpa 2 comes to pc now :3 I hope its not tooo to far in the future, I will cling to the hope it isnt too far and fight the despair of waiting and hoping ;3",

            "review_text": "Edit: To clarify any confusion, I origninaly gave this game a negative review due to a somewhat game-breaking bug. The bug has been fixed since then, and I can now in recomend this game without feeling like I'm needlessly setting people up to rage.   Danganronpa is a visual novel about a perfectly ordinary boy who gets accepted into a top tier high school and proceeds to have fun adventures with all the quirky characters he meets there. The quirky characters are also being forced to kill each other by a robotic teddy bear, and you have to solve the murders in Ace-Attorney-meets-light-gun-shooter trial sequences that end with brutal executions. Very Japanese.  The visual novel bits are half way inbetween over the top drama and standard high school visual novel fair. You have all the standard tropes: talking with people and giving the presents to increase your relationship status, multiple choice answers in which the correct choice tends to be blindingly obvious, watching your character jump between incrdibly strong willed and a total push-over as the plot demands, peeping on the girls in the bath, and having the possibility of everyone in the school developing a crush on you. That being said, I find I can stand them in here a bit better than in most similar games I play. Maybe it's that the characters are just more interesting than most. Or maybe it's the fact that you don't know who will die at any time that makes seeing them interact so enjoyable.  The trial scenes are the meat of the gameplay. They also feel like they're about five different games mashed into one. You have spelling bees, picture matching, and what is essentialy an ace attorney segment, on a time llimit, in a shooting range. Even if you know the answer and what to do, it's pretty difficult to accomplish everything perfectly the first time around. Fortunately, the game tends to be pretty forgiving with mistakes, although achievements require you to do some flawless runs.  Also, the plot. Can't say much of anything without spoiling a lot of things, but know that it's good. Plenty of twists, some creative motivations, and enough insanity to tide you over any boring bits.  That being said, this game is far from perfect. The trial scenes tend to be overly complicated, incorperating way too many mechanics into acomplishing what should be a relatively simple task. The English translation of the game, while generaly good, has a few moments where it has trouble getting across relevant information (As an advanced warning, the answer is   schizo  . This will make sense when the time comes to enter it in, and no sooner.). And the port has created some bugs, one of which was bad enough that this review was marked as negative until a while after it was patched.   I stand by my assesment from the old review that this game is 'good'. Not for everyone, and not perfect, but good.  8/10   Old review:  This is a good game. I really wish I could give it a positive review. But, at the moment, I can't.  A few chapters into the game, my save files all vanished. Thus far, I have been unable to retrive them by any means. If you check the discussion page for the game, you'll notice multiple people are facing this problem, and that it has happened to several people multiple times. Considering this is by no means a short game, I can't in good faith recomend anyone buy it untill after the bug is fixed.",

However, I have many complaints about the port.   The controls are clunky, awkward, and not well explained. It took me a few minutes when I started a new file to realize that you can only save AFTER you've gotten past chapter one. Many of the trial's mini games were horribly explained (I wanted to make sure that the controls were what I assumed them to be) but, I realized that anyone who was new to this game would have a hell of a time figuring out what the HELL the instructions meant.   The localization of this game changes a few of the character's names; giving them nicknames rather than their full names. This, and the fact that the characters are no longer refered to by their last names, destroys quite a lot of context and characterization that the original had. (ie; hearing Hagakure call everyone 'name-chi' to show how laid back and unprofessional he is.) Hearing Ishimaru being called 'Taka' was something very annoying that I never adjusted to.   The grammar in the dialog is very awkward at times, and hard to read.    The dub is mediocre at best, some voices fit very well (Celestia, Asahina), some are decent (Kirigiri, Mondo), and some are cringe-worthy (Togami, Naegi, Chihiro)   With these things in mind, know that the actual game itself is FANTASTIC and a wild adventure.

To summarise the plot, you are locked in an academy with 15 other students and the only way to leave this school, is to kill another and get away with it. Once a murder has taken place, a trial will be held in which you must reveal the killer based on the evidence you have found.   Characters develop throughout the game as more gruesome murders take place, paranoia become a common theme while true intentions and secrets are revealed. The students are so well written, all having vivid backstories and deep personalities it is easy to become attached to them, causing you to fear for your favourite characters life.   If you love solving mysteries, plot twists, eccentric humour and compelling characters then you will love this game.

        {
            "review_text": " Thrills! Chills! Kills!    Since Danganronpa is a visual novel, the game's main focus is reading. As such, if you aren't into visual novels, I'd suggest you to look for something else.  The game's main gameplay revolves around you investigating places, talking to people and spotting contradictions during the class trials. In this aspect, it's VERY similar to the Phoenix Wright games, only changing the famous 'OBJECTION!' to 'NO, THAT'S WRONG!'. If you love those games, you'll probably enjoy this as well. However, it goes a step further and throws mini-games during the trials to make things more fast-paced.   During the trial sections, you'll have to actually aim at the statements of people while they auto-play on the screen and shoot them with your evidence. Think of it as a mini-shooting game. You'll also have to play a mini-rhythm game when certain characters do not want to accept something. By the end of the trial, you have to select images to reconstruct the events that happened during the chapter.   All of these are fairly simple and fun. However, there is one more mechanic that I personally dislike due to how intrusive it feels, and that is the Hangman's Gambit. As you expect from the name, it's basically hangman where you shoot the letters that are missing from a specific word. My problem with this is that, while all the other mechanics feel fluid during the course of the gameplay, this one seems to just put a stop to the action for no reason. Most of the times, it's a pretty obvious word that you know 5 minutes before even going into the mini-game (and when it isn't, it's merely a synonym). It feels as if you are wasting time. With that said, it's very short so it's not as if it's a major problem.  The game has another mechanic that has nothing to do with the Class Trials/investigation themselves, but exists to further develop the cast. During your 'Free Time', you can spend time with any of your classmates. This leads to them receiving more background and leading the main character to understand them more. Since the main story can't really give every student the spotlight, this a nice little way to make you care more about your friends. However, the 'Free Time' feature is certainly not a big part of the gameplay. They are generally short dialogues and don't affect the story in any way and are completely unneeded if you choose to ignore them. Still, even if unneeded, they are still very entertaining to read.  I really loved the story and (most of) the characters. Yes, they are very anime-esque so if you are not into that you should avoid this game at all costs. Most characters are exaggerated archetypes that will grow on you throughout the story. Their interactions are very interesting considering how different everyone is, with each character choosing their own way to deal with the situation.   The story boils down to this (no spoilerinos): 'Ultimate high school students are trapped inside a school with a perverted bear-thingy and the one who kills someone and is not discovered will be the one to leave. All the others will be executed.'  Bias: The art is awesome. I just fell in love with it the first time I saw it. It just has a very distinctive feel to it. The English voice acting is mostly amazing. There are only a few lines here and there that I found weird, but those are very few. The music is also great.  I was completely blown away by how good this game is. I honestly did not expect it to turn out to be this good. I actually feel kind of bad by waiting for a sale since this game deserves its full price. It certainly is one of the best visual novels I've ever played.   TL;DR: Buy it or face despair~!",

To be honest, what got me into the Danganronpa series at first was the anime, which I had only heard bad stuff about. 'It's a crappy adoptation of the game, they say.' So I thought I'd buy the game when it was on sale and see if it was as good as everyone said. Little did I know, it was   this good.    Story: 10/10 Obviously the same story as the anime, but with more depth into it, covering things beyond what the anime could adopt, considering the anime was only 13 episodes (around 5 hours), while the game took me a good 30 hours+ to complete.  Art: 8/10 Nothing too special, allthough some parts of the game were very detailed and well-made. The most good looking part of the game has to be the still-images during certain investigations, discoveries etc. and ofcourse, the Execution Scenes.  Character: 10/10  The characters act the same way as they do in the anime (obviously) but same as with the story, the anime has left out parts that shouldn't have been left out.   Overall rating: 10/10   I think it is safe to say that if you liked   Danganronpa: The Animation   just as much as I did, then this game is worth your time and money.  I will soon be playing the Sequel,   Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair   and write a review of it as soon as I've finished it.",

I saw people getting excited and the description of the game here on Steam seemed interesting so I bought it early to get the bonus soundtrack since I love listening to game soundtracks. Fell in love with the game quick, and spent any free time I had playing through it. Glad this came to Steam or else I might not have ever played it or learned of this amazing game series. If you love story-rich mystery games with some horror, this game is for you.  Also about that anime I mentioned earlier, don't watch it until after you've played this if you're interested in checking it out. It follows the same story as the game, but a lot of stuff is skipped over because of the rush to fit the entire story in the limited amount of episodes (And I'm only refering to the anime based on this one game called Danganronpa: The Animation, not the Danganronpa 3 animes).",

Despair... But my hope also got stronger! This game got me 100% interested! Character designs are great, plot is really REALLY good and gameplay it self is also great!   So this game is taking place in Hopes Peak Academy where are ''Ultimate'' students with special skills and they are going to be bright future filled with hope for humanity and this Protagonist Makoto Naegi is going to enter to school with title of Ultimate ''Lucky'' Student, but then.....That happened..... Later in the game A headmaster Monokuma is making this school life as Killing School Life in other words....A killing game.... where somebody is going to kill someone in secret in order to get out of this madness and then you need to investigate all evidence and in the class trial you need to find out who did it, but you also need to find out another way to get out of school and find out who is the mastermind behind this killing game.   This game easily goes one of my favorite games ever and i highly recommend this game! And sequel is also amazing!",

The important part of this game is the story and the less you know about it the better it is.",

            "review_text": "I'm not a big fan of Visual Novels usually, even when I'm a huge fan of their adapted animations, and yet I loved this! Enough to play the PSP version first, after watching the anime, and then this one.  I was also delighted to see a native Linux binary, on release day I believe! It works perfectly, no issue encountered.  The story is probably not for everyone, many crazy characters and the bad guy being a robotic teddy bear, but to me the cast was great. I wish that we had more voices from the anime, as a PC game has the room for that... oh well.  There are a few negatives but nothing too bad:  - for the last few chapters there are a lot of repetition of what happened in the chapter, it's suppose to help us but I find it more annoying than anything. - You have to do certain things in order, so even if you think you are spotting a clue, you may not be able to get the game to register it yet. - In school mode there's a lot of useless down time that slows down the whole thing with no benefit. (- I liked the fan translation better)  Oh and here's a tip for first timers, that I wish I had known on my first playthrough: In the debate mini game, at some point you will be allowed, and will need, to absorb a gold argument in your bullet and then wait for the discussion to end and restart before using that bullet, to then use it on a gold argument that is before the one you absorbed.   The main game took me 20+ hours already and school mode is likely to double that.",
