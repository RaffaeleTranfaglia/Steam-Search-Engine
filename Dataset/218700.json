            "review_text": "The only thing that annoys me about this game is the title. 'Catch Me When You Can'? When I can what? Be bothered? Find the time? It doesn't sound like much of a challenge! However, the game itself is better than its title.  Angelica Weaver is a psychic cop. Wait, it gets better! Actually, it really doesn't, but when it comes to fruity storylines these hidden object games usually take the biscuit anyway. Honestly this one is better than most, and it provides as good a hook as any to find all those hidden objects. I also appreciated some half-decent voice acting for once, at least with the main character, who fortunately is who you'll be hearing most of the time anyway. I do like the fact that hidden object games have such strong female characters; some other games could learn a thing or two.  The game itself is a pretty good point and click adventure game for the most part, collecting objects in your inventory to apply them in other locations. It's not quite Monkey Island, but it's a good time. There are quite a few puzzles throughout the game, although you've probably seen their ilk before, and they're mostly easy. Stress free, you might say. You'll also find quite a few hidden object scenes, and really that's what we're here for right? Fortunately these are very good, some nice artwork and objects that help to push the story forwards, often prompting brief pieces of dialog from the main character. Even better, you can replay all of these from the main menu later to try and find every last object in the scene, rated by your speed. You'll only do this once after which you'll have memorized where most things are, but it's nice to see.  The game will last you at least 5-6 hours if you do the bonus content as well (which acts as a suitable epilogue to the main story), and another hour on top of that to do the infinite hidden object scenes, so it should keep you busy for a while. You can also unsettle your friends and family with Angela Weaver specific wallpapers and screen savers [not tested].",
