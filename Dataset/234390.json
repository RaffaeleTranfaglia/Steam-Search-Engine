It's brutally hard, I still haven't been able to get to level 7 yet (I probably need to use to learn the knife better), but you rarely feel cheated from your many, many deaths. Like Nethack, all your problems could have been avoided in hindsight.   The graphics of the game, while extremely rudimentary, actually add to it; I love how much horror shows through, even though the monsters and worlds are just a few blurry pixels. The storyline is interesting, and vividly describes the terror of the world you're living in, with a touch of humor as well. If you're not interested in reading the computer logs to know how things got they way they are, they're also completely avoidable, and never forced upon you.  All of the monsters have their own unique personality (and freaking TRICKY movement patterns! Those stupid small ones, yeeeeeaarrrgghhh!), and none of them seem repetitious, or rehashes of earlier versions.  The best part about this game? THE CRAFTING SYSTEM! Holy heck, I wish EVERY crafting game was as intuitive as Teleglitch. Instead of needing a wiki article explaining how to make things you'd never have known exist, all you do is press a single key, and the crafting menu pops up, showing your entire inventory, what can currently be crafted from it, and what each of those items will cost you, using an easy to follow line diagram system. Crafting is so easy, it can be done on the fly, during fights! It couldn't be improved upon, except possibly to see items you can't craft yet, so you know what they take, but IMO, that would take away from the fun of discovery in the game, and add very little.  Teleglitch is a game I'll always be happy to own, and if I had somehow pirated it (why? it's SO cheap!), I would actually pay money for a retail copy to support the designers. I collect games like they're little works of art, and am proud to display this in my collection.",

The mood, the environments, the story (if you're paying attention) are all quite macabre. Bird's eye view with an in your face sound. The crafting system is nothing short of genius with its ease and simplicity. The graphics are pixelated, and they add nicely to the overall creep factor going on here.   At its heart, this game is a brutal shooter with rogue/survival horror like elements. Not everyone will like this game due to its ridiculous difficulty. The onslaught is generally relentless and you're damn lucky if you have a moment to catch your breath and re-align yourself. Ammo and health and crafting supplies are few and far between and the further you go, the less you'll find.  But there is so much to this game. 40+ hours in and I'm discovering new items, enemies and weapons still. Every gameplay is a critical and unforgiving surprise. Every choice and shot counts. The tensions at times are cruel. Wasted ammo and supplies will happen, and you'll mess up and die. Again and again. And you'll get mad, And you'll have learned. And your failures will taunt you to do better. And you will. And the game knows that.  Simply brilliant. An easy favorite.",

            "review_text": "I feel like this game is overly pretentious and utterly underachieving. Bear with me, I will explain why.  Let us start with the bugs. Sometimes (fairly rarely) you'll find yourself locked in an area because the randomization algorithm screwed it up. Tough luck bro, start again. Much worse is the randomization of the enemies, which ***relatively often*** unbalance the game. For instance,an unjustifiable large number of enemies waiting you right by the first room of a new map. Nowhere to run, no pillar to hide behind, no means of defence - it often means 'death in 2s' or 'good bye all ammo and medkits'.   That wouldn't be all that hateable if only you would be allowed to save at the end of each map. The game 'checkpoints' allowing you to start at lvl 3,5,7 or 9 once you finish lvl 5,7,9 and 10 respectively. That is mostly a trap, however, since you start with a much inferior gear in a game where ammo is already scarce.  I like a difficult game more than most (check my profile) and I have completed all the achievements (took me quite long), but this game just doesn't deserve permadeath in my opinion. If anything, there should be a 'permadeath mode', for those who like a challenge - like me. Having to put up with the flaws of the randomization system while trying to learn how to play, learn which ammo is more useful against each enemy, all of this just makes this game sound overly pretentious, achieving very little or nothing and giving absolutely no satisfaction. It feels like the only reason the permadeath is there, is to make the game hard. The devs should tune down their tone.  Other remarks - 'It has Quake aesthetics!' did you mean 'the colourpallete and nothing else'? - 'Wow, this is a nice horror game!!': I feel zero sympathy for my 8 pixels protagonist, and not scared or tense whatsoever. - 'But it has so many nice reviews!' I've seen an awesome explanation to this phenomena, too bad I can't find it. Teleglitch was given 'for free' in a bundle, many people got it for the free cards. Those people reviewed with 'good game' and 'cool' and have around 3~5h gameplay. Think twice before trusting that Steam Rating up there.  At least the achievements are well developed.",

            "review_text": "Probably one of the only games since System Shock 2 that's been able to get this kind of atmosphere and experience down, with you often scraping by bullet by bullet, smashing things together and scavenging to desperately try to keep moving and keep alive. If I have problems with the game they come down to the graphics, procedural generation and writing of the game, and they are somewhat intertwined. System Shock 2 was so terrifying because of the enemies being horrible mostrosities, perversions of what was once human flesh often now coupled with machine parts. Here, I feel like that's supposed to be the case, but I can't tell due to the simplistic top down style. This could likely be circumvented by having sound design that lets your imagination fill in the horrifying gaps for you, or writing for the datalogs you find to elaborate on the backstory of these things but no, that doesn't happen. The sound design seems to be content to the 8-bit aesthetic and the writing seems to be confused about whether it wants to be dead serious or a little tongue in cheek with its subject matter. I ended up skipping through most of the data logs given the total lack of personality or a good level of backstory handed out beyond the words 'necrotic tissue reactivation' and 'genetic tampering'.  Also the procedural generation itself feels too cruel and really, really same-ey. The environment never really feels... I'd almost say navigate-able or 'comfy'. I don't expect it to feel Comfy obviously, it is a survival horror game, but it never really feels anything but stuck together out of different parts in a way that's jagged, lopsided and poorly balanced.  The reason resource management this strict works in games like System Shock is because the level design is manageable, it's obvious, and you can rely on things. You aren't going to end up luring enemies into a courtyard because the hallway feels so rough and fiddly to move around in that you will probably waste vital supplies.   This is a game that didn't need to try to be a roguelike or a procedurally generated game, or even one that needed to try to have a story.  Teleglitch could have made itself into a pretty good linear top down sci-fi survival shooter with a decent story, but instead it throws in procedural generation on top of the already difficult resource economy of supplies v.s. dead enemies, which just pushes things too far. It could have simplified and just been a fun procedurally generated shooter where you explore a randomly drawn up location and try to survive that's slick, mean and embraces the retro aesthetic further. I  Instead it feels like it collapses under its own elements into a muddled mess of scrap metal, crafting, nails and ugly brown pixel art.   My recommendation: If you want to check it out, wait for a sale and don't pay anything under $5 for it.",

Even though this game is quite difficult I found the game super fun the game had a really cool story witch was told through dialogue found in terminals which was found in terminals witch also harboured valuable information and through dialogue at the end of a level. The graphics arenât fancy but i think they are done well and present everything I need to see as well as looking good for a indie game. The inventory and the crafting are also great, inventory is simply a bar on the side of the screen that can be easily scroll up and down to equip weapons. The crafting is really cool it allows you to build many different pieces of equipment to help you defeat your enemies and to defend yourself, things like nail bombs, can guns and single use rocket launchers are just a few of the many craft able weapons. The gameplay is awesome in this game, I am a big fan of the rouge like genre (a game where when you die you have to start again or maybe from a checkpoint) so that was definitely an upside for me, controlling your character is super easy and smooth witch is super important when your dodging bursts of machinegun fire and running from hoards of zombies or quickly switching out your weapons and equipment. Just playing through the main story of the game is definitely the best part but there are set of arena levels that you can play on the side. There isnât much to do there other than enjoy having lots of ammo and explosives. All in all I think this game is bad â¥â¥â¥ and I really enjoy the gameplay, story and even graphics (which some people hate). Buy itâ¦..please. 9.5 out of 10",

I think the best part of this game has a lot of bosses, but I have not even got out of the first boss I did not understand how to play.  I personally do not recommend the The game. Not even for free",

Every game mechanic - fighing, crafting, avoiding enemies is so, so good! Haveing almost 20 new, untouched games after last steam sale I still play only that one.

Its storyline and little facts about the game were boring and hard to read in the pixelated text it uses. having to complete 5 levels before being able to save the game is just lame and ruins the whole fun of the game, overall I felt this game didnt offer enough to make me want to keep playing over the same maps versing the same units, getting up to level 4 and spawning next to a room filled with the strongest enemies who immediatly swarm you and murder you making you have to go back to level 1 and work your way through a pixelated nightmare of repetition. 2/10",

Because the developer needs 1 year just to fix the bug that doesnt let me to play the latest version.  I am really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off because of this.I waited: one week , two , three.Now the new update came out ( 9.3 ) and I was hyped because I thought the problem was fixed.Guess what? It was not. The developer added tons of new stuff but left the people with problems behind.Now I want to quote what I think he would say: 'They gave me the money and they cant request a refund because steam wont let them.Now let's add more stuff and a DLC just to make a little bit more money.'  Now back to the review:  The game looks like a 90's game.I like 90's games and I bought it.But it did not want to start so I tried the demo version.I played the game like 1 hour since the demo version wont let you get past level 2 or 3 ( I don't remember exactly ). Well the game is hard.REALLY HARD. It took me that hole hour I played just to get past level 1.You will find weapons or materials which you can craft weapons with or bombs.You will find bigger monsters which are harder to kill.Basically if you love a 90's survival game type thingy you should buy it.  Just remember: IF THIS LOOKS LIKE A 90'S PC IT DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN RUN IT WITH A PC THAT HAS 14 YEARS. Mine has like 5 years and I can't run it because of that bug.It seems that you need a PC that can run crysis 2 or 3 first.  Conclusion: If you want a game to stay in your library it's worth the money.You won't play the game more than 2 hours then you will leave it there.If it doesnt start... well you will play the demo version and wait 1 year or 2 for the developer to fix the problem.",

My recommendation is to avoid it even at the 75% discount cost, which feels about full price for something like this(Hint: This is a 0.99$ game you get in a bundle).  This game is Hack, Slash, Loot under a different coat of paint so if you did for some reason love HSL then by all means pick this one up. For those who don't know what HSL is, It's a rogue-like, but without any of the tricks and strategy that goes into beating other rogue-likes. In other rogue-likes you might die because you got careless, forgot something or just didn't know any better, but H,S,L will kill you just because F@#% You, it's a terrible game that can be summed up with just a few words, unfun RNG â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  Back to this game. There is no playing smart, no strategizing with this one, you either have a gun with ammo or you don't because you couldn't find one, but too bad about not finding one because the mobs running at you don't care. The only way to progress though this game is to bash your head against a brick wall over and over again until the RNG smiles down upon you and you some how managed to make it past the level 1-5 floors you kept dying on and you got past level 5, which now lets you start at level 3, repeat head bashing over and over again for floors 3-7 until the RNG smiles on you and you somehow manage to beat level 7 which will let you start a new game at level 5 this time, repeat once again for floors 5-9 and 7-10 until you can finally beat level 10 and finish this POS.  It also auto deletes saves because it's a rogue-like and we can't allow save scumming in a single player game, which is fine I guess but unfortunately the game has crashed on me twice now after beating a level which has deleted my save, so you might also want to consider holding off until some bug fixing patches first.   It's an incredibly shallow rogue-like, and after an hour of play you'll feel like you've basically seen everything the game has to offer save some special bosses. At 3.25$ (never mind the laughable 12.99 regular price, holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ what were they thinking) it's just to much to ask for, for this copy/paste floor design for 10 levels game that adds a ton of aggravating â¥â¥â¥â¥ to it that makes it overall unfun to play, just like with H,S,L.

            "review_text": "My inventory is nearly empty. It always is, I don't know why I thought this time would be any different. My health is low and I haven't seen a can of rejuvenating meat in what seems like hours. Everything is completely silent. In front of me I see a pair of doors leading to the only area I have yet to explore. I take a breath and slowly walk forward.  As the doors open, I hear the screams. A pack of things rush me and I only have a few shells left in my shotgun, not nearly enough to take down this frenzied mass. As I wait for them to get closer, I say my prayers and ready my last explosive. I place it at my feet and, at the last second, run back through the doors. The explosion echoes faintly and, with my gun raised, I wait to see what's going to come rushing through.  This is Teleglitch: Die More Edition.  Teleglitch is a top-down roguelike with omni-directional shooting that launched late last year on PC. The Die More Edition institutes enemy AI tweaks and adds new levels, weaponry and lore information. It tells the story of a hapless researcher stuck in a military complex after a teleporter experiment goes awry and something comes through from the other side. It's a typical sci-fi trope to be sure, but it makes for a quick and easy vehicle to explain fighting monsters, zombies, robots and other genetically enhanced nightmares.  After emerging from his hiding place and pushing aside a clumsily arranged barricade, the silent protagonist must progress from zone to zone, always in search of the next teleporter that will bring him one step closer to freedom. That pursuit is a silent one: Without a backing score and only the faintest inclusion of sound effects (gunfire, monsters screaming and explosions) the silence only amplifies the tension accompanying each step forward. It's an interesting choice to forego any sort of musical accompaniment, one that serves the atmosphere's overall sense of terror in a palpable way.  In Teleglitch: Die More Edition, you can choose to start with only your 9mm pistol (as in the original game) or to spawn with random items - fitting given how integral randomization is to the experience â but it's never enough. You're never truly equipped to handle the situation at hand.  No two sessions of Teleglitch: Die More Edition are the same. The levels are randomly generated, as are the enemy sets, item drops and layouts of each particular wing of the massive facility. And every single level is a haunting endeavor, full of enemies silently milling about, waiting to pounce as soon as they sense your presence. You never know what might alert them â it could be a stray bullet or something as simple as opening a door.  Part of what makes the experience so harrowing is just how strong and unpredictable enemies can be. Low-level enemies tend to employ patterns, behaviors you can monitor and learn and adapt to. Later on, you have to deal with groups of mixed enemy types, and certain baddies start packing guns. One high-level enemy shooting at you is tough enough â surround him with a horde of zombies and panic sets in. And you will panic. Mistakes will be made. Death will be inevitable.  Every enemy in Teleglitch is dangerous, which adds weight to every encounter. Learning and understanding enemy patterns is challenging, but the real payoff comes from exploiting them at a moment's notice during tense, sudden skirmishes â the intrinsic value of Teleglitch: Die More Edition's combat model. When you desperately lead a line of running madmen into a carefully placed bomb and watch seven of them go down at once, it's utterly empowering. And Teleglitch: Die More Edition offers no aid whatsoever. There's no tutorial to guide you by the hand. You're all alone, and you'll have to discover the game's essential strategies organically.  That's a rewarding experience, but it's also a brutally difficult one. Teleglitch is demanding and hostile towards its players, and that's bound to turn some people off. There's incredible satisfaction to be drawn from success, but some may not find it a worthy trade-off for all the frustration. Outside of discovering random items, a rudimentary crafting system is in place to create your tools of survival. Combining a can with a high-powered explosive and a box of nails can turn it into a devastating nail bomb or a vicious can gun, a single-use weapon invaluable for dispatching crowds at close range. You can create stimulants that boost your performance, modify guns to be even stronger or even build detectors that help warn you of nearby enemies.  The crafting system works well, though sometimes it's impeded by the game's art style, which is full of chunky pixels and basic sprites that can make it hard to see items within the level. It's crucial that you uncover and acquire everything you can, because the game so seldom tosses you a bone. It's a shame, because the art style is unique and beautiful, but it's frustrating to occasionally backtrack through a room and discover you missed a vital pickup the first time around â not to mention however many items you may have overlooked entirely.   Progress in Teleglitch comes at a snail's pace. Every death earns you more knowledge and (hopefully) you get just a little further along each session. Thankfully, you won't always have to restart from the very beginning, as reaching certain levels allows you to start from later in the game. If you reach level five, for example, you can start a new game from level three.  That adds to your sense of accomplishment, obviously, although completing any level in Teleglitch already feels like a triumph. Even the first level is tough, and once you reach the first teleporter it's a satisfying and formative moment, one where eventual victory seems possible â until the next level kicks your teeth in, of course.  Teleglitch's greatest strength isn't the constant tension and the ever-present fear of what lies around the next corner, it's the empowerment you feel from besting the seemingly impossible odds. It's the sense of development, learning from each death and relishing in the sweet moment of triumph when you deftly react to a sudden problem. Teleglitch is a harsh mistress, but the cruelest lessons are often the ones that truly stick with us.  I give Teleglitch: Die More Edition a 4.5/5",

There's a brief tutorial to help with controls instead of dropping you in a life or death situation. It's definitely a point to appreciate considering as soon as you leave the room and hallway on Level 1 you're off into Hell on your own.  In spite of my time spent so far I've not needed crafting or even weapons. It's all a mad dash weaving around obstacles and hoping to lead enemies into Teleglitch Anomalies. That's probably one of my favorite parts in the game, but it took me awhile to figure out why landing in it myself causes death.  Overall it's a good game. There's going to be a lot of time spent on discovery. Lore and game mechanics are very vague at the beginning of the game, but are definitely built on as the game progresses. If you're not one for story it isn't heavy or intensive enough to cause a bother, but for those who want it it's definitely there. I haven't noticed the soundtrack for anything outstanding.  On occasion the enemies will be similarly colored as the floor. That's something I'm going to pray to the Teleglitch gods to have a little mercy for. You should probably pray too, because this game is low-commitment, highly addictive, fast-paced run-for-your-life-holy-â¥â¥â¥â¥-they're-after-me action.",

Die More Edition is actually the difficulty-jacked port of Teleglitch, which itself is only a few months old anyway and wasn't that easy to begin with.   You should play this if you're a very risk-reward type of gamer. The progression is slow, you are encouraged to explore EVERYTHING you can, ammo is sparse, and 6-legged military biomutants are never in short supply. I hope you're good with a knife.   I think the key feature that's defined the experience for me so far is that when you encounter a new type of enemy, it's usually such a dramatic change from what you've seen previously that you are almost guaranteed to either die in the initial enounter or to expend so much ammunition dealing with it that you'll leave yourself in an unsustainable state.   Mobs don't lose your scent. There are no doors that lock. There is nowhere to hide. You win or you die. That's how I like it.",

Eerie environments and a great on-the-fly crafting system make for hectic eerie fun with a heck of a lot of replay value. Every log is worth reading, every enemy is worth shooting, and every secret is worth finding. Even the loading screen when you start the game helps set the tone. I highly recommend this title. Especially when it's on sale... Unfortunately, this game does have a couple of bogus things with it. The DLC. It comes with a soundtrack that is not implemented in-game, that was not included to begin with. That in my opinion is unacceptable as a dev, with the insult to injury being that the soundtrack is REALLY GOOD. I've seen people complaining about the new weapons being added in as DLC in a roguelike-like such as this, but that I have no real problem with. That just adds more content. All that said, The DLC is entirely optional, and unless it is on sale (for like $0.43) I'd say it isn't worth it.",

The game does an amazing job with creating a dark, incredibly creepy atmosphere despite the very minimalistic artstyle, choosing instead to focus on sound and visual distortion and light instead of sp00ky grafix. The game puts you on edge at all times, and does a great job terrifying you in ways you wouldn't expect- even the growl of certain enemies can freak you out, since you know deep down you're ill prepared and it's too late to run. The eerie and mysterious atmosphere and storyline are as creepy as they are intresting.  Teleglitch:DME has a very solid combat system. Weild an arsenal of standard weapons, such as a grenade launcher or pistol, detonate various explosives, or cobble together a haphazard (but effective!) arsenal of makeshift weapons, like a literal Nail Gun or the rediculously powerfull Cangun. Combat is as brutal as it is rewarding, take a few shots from some poor, mind controlled security guard and its game over, but the feeling of elimenating an entire horde of enemies is awesome. Plus, if you take meelee damage from monsters, it plays a comical 'WHACK!' sound. Which is just great.  The crafting system is fantastic, letting you make or improve weapons, such as adding another two barrels to your already powerfull grenade launcher. There's also the tactical stuff, which usually requires rarer materials, but can be very helpful. My favorite is a motion sensor that will tell you if you're near a certain horde event, mostly for the peace of mind I get once I make it. The other fantastic thing about crafting and the inventory in general is that it allows for you to manage and craft on the fly, so you can keep trying to outrun the enemy while slapping some dynamite to a box of nails.  One of my favorite Roguelikes, Teleglitch:DME is worth trying. And there's choclate included in the DLC!",

I've logged upwards of 40 some hrs and only beat it once. By the skin of my teeth. Definatley agree there should be a sequel (doesnt matter graphics revamp or no). this game proved a great game isnt dependent upon looks alone.",

Weapons and ammo are scarce, but scrap items are fairly abundant. An incredibly streamlined crafting system will have you hastily sifting through your inventory as you kite a cluster of enemies throughout the compound, eventually sacrificing valuable crafting items to assemble a pipe bomb.
