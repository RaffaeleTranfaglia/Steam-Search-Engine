    "description": "This is a little girl simulator. You control Yagi, a 3rd grade elementary school girl, and wander around town. There's no goal in this game. You need to decide the goal for yourself. It's the same as in life. This is an amazingly realistic simulator.",

READ READ READ THIS FIRST!: a good number of the downvoted reviews are there because the steam community is still upset about a completely harmless easter egg and are trying to take this game much too serious.  before I start let me say this. This game is one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. I bought this game for 59$ from a friend of mine rightn after it was taken off steam and let me tell you it has been the best purchase ever for a normal 5$ game.  While the map is considderably small there is always something to do, you make your own goals. Fly into space using a traffic horse... FLY INTO SPACE DOING ANYTHING WITH THE PHYSICS.  The music is also an amazing part of the game that I listen to daily whenever I can. this game is definitely worth the 5$ price as you can easially throw over 100 hours into this game before you even know it. Get this game if you are bored and need something addicting to play!",

Cute girl (...)  3. Bugs (but mostly are good for the game, maybe...)  4. A few easter eggs (not clean content)  5. A few characters (lot of naked men, so not clean too)  6. A little map   7. A few content  8. Awkward control  9. Difficuty  10. A lot of invisible wall  Let's see what is missing here:   1.Goal  2.Menu  3.Dialogue  4.Control introduction  5.Meaning   Well, actually we DO have something in this game(?) overall. (Have 10 &gt; Missing 5) Lost Pause's video is more fun than the game itself. I bought this game because of it. Damned curiosity.

This game isn't what you'd think it is. It's empty, the physics are wild. Like, I couldn't even jump onto any of the buildings. The developers just took a hilarious idea and did NOTHING with it. There's a few guys you can knock around and its gets glitchy which can be pretty hilarious, but it's just another 'Simulator' that tries to hard to be another one of 'Those' games. I thought this genre woulda died Out. I think it should. Here's a link to the video if you wanna have a good laugh.         YouTube™ Video:  WTF IS THIS GAME!?- Yohjo Simulator&nbsp;",

About 15 people walking around if you count the naked guys dancing on the rooftop. As far as interactive content goes, the only thing interactive is headbutting people and boxes around the map, which starts out boring and gets worse as you continue. I played for about 5 minutes and have done eveything there is to do in this game.  Don't waste your money.",
