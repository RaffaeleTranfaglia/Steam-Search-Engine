    "description": "Richard and Alice are prisoners. Both their cells have a leather sofa and a state-of-the-art computer. But only Richard’s has a TV. Outside, the snow falls. It has done for some time. Elsewhere, they say, parts of the world have been rendered an inhospitable desert, the earth parched and cracked. People live in the zones now.",

            "review_text": "A pretty decent point &amp; click game. It took me around ~4 hours to beat and the rest is used for achievements. The story speaks of of loneliness, desperation, and a world that has to fight against two inexorable enemies: nature and human kind. If you look at the gameplay, there's not such a great challenge, but, on the other hand, you may find dramatic and somewhat decent storytelling. There are 5 possible endings in the game, and with replays from several save points throughout the game, I was only able to arrive at 2 of them. Each offers a slightly different potential outcome for our two main characters.  My main complain with this game is the huge frame drops, and it always happens whenever Alice (2nd screenshot) goes outside. I tried several things with no avail, so I just sucked it up and finished the game. There's also the problem where I found it a a bit hard to become emotionally invested in the characters. After all, if everyone is a survivalist animal, why should you care which animal survives and which one doesn’t? The game tries a little too hard to tug on your heart strings with Alice’s cute and naive five year old son, Barney, and while Richard does at least invite a little bit of sympathy, the same can’t be said with Alice. In describing her childhood and her background, she strikes me as a perpetually depressed melancholic for whom the Snowpocalypse is just another average day. She is the kind of person who would be insufferable even in a utopia. Other than that, it also feels like the game didn't really live up to its own potential, and instead of leaving you with a rewarding experience, it constantly hammered you with a message that all humans eventually succumb to their evil nature, and that none of us are deserving of good fortune, nor will we find it, in the event of global tragedy—and that, frankly, perseverance will be a wholly useless endeavor should we ever reach such a level of desperation.  Maybe that's all true, and maybe Richard &amp; Alice at least deserves credit for being able to stimulate this kind of discussion. It may also deserves some credit for being engaging enough for me to want to play it to its conclusion, even though that conclusion isn’t very satisfying. It isn’t a terrible game by a long stretch, and it is possible to like it if you don’t mind playing through what amounts to an interactive novel. My final rating: 7/10",

If you make it past this you'll see the characters start to develop, and then it gets really good.   This is a point-and-click game with nice item puzzles thrown in for immersion, so don't expect mind-blowing gameplay. The story and writing are what you're here for. I was constantly impressed by how natural the dialogue felt. My only complaint is the walking speed is slow, and this got on my nerves on two occasions when I was trying to figure out how to progress, but it's forgiveable.   The game takes around 4 hours to complete and I think it's the perfect length. It never dragged and I couldn't put it down. I was surprised to get choked up a few times, but the characters are so well written it's hard not to get attached. There are multiple endings, but for me it ended on a perfect note. Bravo, Owl Cave.",

I really enjoyed this game because it offers a sort of apocalyptic perspective through a mother's eyes and the struggles that had to be endured in order to survive in a frozen, chaotic world. The story is very emotional and will touch your heart and soul. The graphics of this game remind me of 'old school' games and give the game itself a vintage feel to it.  The only thing that I would change about this game is to couple the dialogue with voice-over in order to give the story more emphasis and emotion. This will certainly keep a player's attention.  Overall, I think this game is worth buying and playing for the dialogue and story alone.",

It's not a long game, to be sure. But, I liked how it played with flashbacks and especially how it depicted an apocalypse that was a little different. It's a game that leaves you with some ambiguity at the end, and that's great. Not many do that.  I will say that it has one bad puzzle that feels like a throwback to the random item combinations of earlier adventure games. But it's only one, so I'll let it slide.",

Heh, yeah, yeah it does.  Fault of this game is that the gameplay interferes with the point; some of the slowest walking ever - lots of backtracking / painful trial-and-error to figure out (('))puzzles((')) step by step.  The story, having to fit with that game(play) is drawn out and tries to make characterization and interactions amongst characters be the core of that story. Thus far, the majority is banter between a loving but stressed mother and an ignorant but lovable (if not a tad annoying) child.  Heh, yeah... yeah it is.  I understand and am not cold-hearted to the point of being put-off by that sort of exchange - not at all, I can dig it actually; a human 'Shelter,' (badger game) so to speak - but when I have to spend two minutes to get from one screen to the next *times* 3 (because backtracking), to be rewarded with more of the same ('No baby, blabla [I'm being pushed to the brink, not necessarily because of you, but you sure aren't helping. *trying to keep my patience and figure this out*].')...   Yet again, another game that seems would've been better off as a written story (disregarding the fact that gamers must have been the target audience, since the devs are/were apparently professional game journalists); as a video game, it is (sub-)par. Thusly, I have to vote against it (though I don't want to). Perhaps when (-IF-) I beat it (because it's trying MY patience, too), I might find it worth the grind, as it were. For now, I must say it's too much a chore.  Heh, yeah, yeah it is.  ...That might be twisted to be a triumph, as the bleakness of the in-game world is being thrust upon the player. So. Mind♥♥♥♥(?) I've no interest in such... deep/pervasive storytelling if I have to push myself as hard as those who are in the story do themselves, so that I might know the story, 'specially when it hasn't even got to the gripping part yet... dig? Me neither.    TL;DR *Meh* to *Feh* - Gameplay gets in the way of the game - Wish I could twist this into a positive. Heh, yeah, yeah I do.

            "review_text": "The developers seem to be browsing Steam reviews, which leaves me in an interesting dilemma. If I plunge forth with my typical double-fisted, pull-no-punches Steam Review vitriol, a developer will no doubt respond and be very civil and infect me with Sh­ithead's Remorse. However, if I soften the laser-focused, razor-sharp barbs of my serpent's cybertongue - making it 'constructive' criticism, if you will - they may just mark the review as 'helpful' and offer no further comment, hence leaving me open to accusations of being a 'sellout' with no easy rebuttal. Hence, this hand-wringing introductory paragraph which hopefully is even more of a tedious chore to read than it was to type. Anyway, trigger warnings: Constructive Criticism, lack of excessively brutal cyberdunks and net.owns.  In an age of everlasting betas, this game stands out as an ironic example of a game that could really stand a final coat of paint before being shoved out the door. The story is mildly captivating (though both 'twists' were readily predictable by the fifth game-day or so), but the script is pretty rough and could stand to be re-edited once more. Maybe English baby formula contains mercury or extra lead or something, but no American 5 year old would be quite this, er, saccharine. Even if artificial syrupy sweetness was the intent, there's still more effective ways to capture the hyperactivity of youth than 'la-la-la, tra-la-la' repeated three or four times in a row. Characters in this game tend to speak in tangents, rather than as people - again, this may or may not be part of the post-apocalyptic intent, but if it's the intent, the dialogue should still be punched up a bit and made a bit less stiff and clinical. The script feels like the words someone would use in a script, rather than either natural dialogue or natural writing - one or the other would be the way to go.  Leaving the script aside, the 'game' itself could also stand a brief 'final revision'. I typically don't mind a bit of backtracking here and there, but when the backtracking involves clicking multiple times on a huge scrolling screen, waiting for the droopy little character to trundle across before the screen scrolls enough to click again, it gets extremely tedious extremely quickly (to say nothing of the incessant CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH sound of the character in question walking through packed snow). A cardinal rule of adventure games is to try to keep each scene on a single screen if at all possible. I appreciate that the developers wanted to capture a bit of distance, but zooming the perspective out to an 'overworld map' style would be so much better than depicting an entire 'neighborhood' at the same scale as a single prison room. There's absolutely nothing 'interesting' in between point A and point B that warrants such close zoom - no background fluff to click on and get a cute little scene-building dialogue reaction, and of course nothing particularly interesting to look at.  Finally, the story itself is 'told' in a labyrinthine mix of tangent-dialogue, soliloquies [violating the Show Don't Tell Principle, but ehhh], and scraps of paper / journal entries which are presented rather non-linearly; confusing to form a narrative from and quite easily forgotten. This impacts the ending somewhat, as it makes it pretty hard to figure out exactly why the various characters in the ending emphasize the little details they do. I'm not someone who demands compact, simple, everything-explained scripts (for instance, I quite like how the game left a certain element - which those have played it can no doubt guess - pretty much a zen 'so, this happened') - but, on the other hand, figuring out the various in-world factions, and the various characters within those factions, and what said factions did to other factions, and the little dramas and personal conflicts in between said factions, is pretty critical to understanding the ending beyond a surface-level 'oh, yeah, this guy was a _____, I knew that was coming since the midpoint' -- but figuring that stuff out involves piecing together a handful of paper scraps and non-linear breadcrumbs.   So basically what you're left with is a moderately interesting setting, some random Adventure Game Style Puzzles (USE [INVENTORY] ON [BACKGROUND ITEM], ad infinitum), and some decent atmospheric music all brought down by a heavy-handed 'rough draft' script, tedious backtracking, and characters who - mostly as a result of the unpolished script - are pretty hard to give a sh­it about one way or the other. If one digs a bit, there's easily the makings of a game worth $5.99 here, but what's on display isn't that game.",

Pace: This is my biggest problem with the game. It drags on like it has smashed legs. Not only is the story slow, the characters walk like they've just learned how. It makes the game agonizingly boring. I love the game but jeez, speed it up. I feel like you went for a more drawn out story. The story has about five scenes, but the game is just so slow. 2. Plot: It never climaxes. Ever. Enough said. 3. Characters: Alice is a cool character and all, but what about Richard? His story takes place in a cell. Does he get a backstory? Is like a DLC I'm just missing out? 4. Art: It's not as good as RPG Maker. RPG Maker is only $60. You couldn't budget that? 5. Tutorial/Help: It has no help. It plops you in with no guidiance in the game. How do you know whats right? Score: 4.5/10 Fun and interesting, but slow as all heck. It has a nice enviroment, but it needs work.

But the movement speed of the characters is so slow, the dialogue progression is so slow, and the thought of replaying this game to see the different endings made me want to tear my eyeballs out.  The other problem is the kid in the story, Barney. Especially early on, in Alice's first story, he makes the story into The Room. They're locked in a tiny room by an angry man who comes in and (possibly rapes alice and) have to work together to escape their long imprisonment. It is The Room but with different names, and I hated that story too.   Maybe it's just my virulent hatred of children, but I found Barney to be generally irritating. I know kids in stories like these are usually there to make the unpleasantness of the surroundings all the starker, and it probably would have been a very dull game without someone for Alice to talk to, but in later chapters where you go out on your own ocassionally it wasn't so bad. I guess I should be grateful Barney doesn't have some kind of transliterated speech impediment. Sigh.  Honestly, I'd probably be easier on the game if it was free, but I bought this puppy.
