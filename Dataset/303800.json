            "review_text": "Turn-based tactical board game with fascinating art and the story, based on the (finally) world-famous fantasy universe written by Andrzej Sapkowski. You have four playable characters, each with own strong and weak points. And you've got some quests to do, by travelling in the dangerous world, fighting and tricking monsters and politicians, helping and betraying other good guys around, to make a better final score for yourself.  Surely, card game is looking better when you have 3 pals around, free evening and cozy place to gather. And maybe pizza to fill the list... But! Funny thing is that this Adventuring Witcher game is more suitable to the PC, than to such gatherings as a gaming party of good friends. It's a bit more on the digits side, than I'd really loved to see in my basement (or garage), when I meet my people.  On the other hand, for the multiplayer little session, game feels quite alright: fast, challenging... If only a bit too cold, though, during a little amount of real interactions between players. Still, for its current price, this game is must-have - if you ever were about turn-based games where you gotta think and calculate your steps miles ahead.  My mark is 8/10. Not the thing I'd take with me on the space flight to Alpha Centauri... But quite fine as a card game, a gem among many others there on Steam. And - yeah, I'm biased, as I'm really love the setting.",

            "review_text": "Do you like The Witcher universe? Do you like board games? Well then you are in luck. Game is well designed and pretty easy to pickup. The game looks great and sounds great and takes a lot of the sound effects right from The Witcher 2. There are built in rules in case you need to bone up on something while playing. Playing online with friends is a snap. The only two issues I see are you cannot adjust your sound settings at all while in a game, and if you disconnect from the game by accident it is not possible to rejoin, as far as I have seen. Also I find it weird that Zoltan is not a main character you can play as. Anyway, despite it's drawbacks it is a lot of fun!",

Gameplay itself is straightforward, but there's a lot of depth and strategy involved. Deciding which quests to go after, weighing the difficulty of completing them against the points they award. Choosing what path to take, what upgrades to go for, as well as when you work with other players or to focus on yourself.  It makes for a great game to sit down with friends with. Highly recommended.",

With matches lasting several hours it is crucial to have a means of continuing a game after a player lost his connection. Since this is currently missing I can not recommend this game. There is the option to play locally but the bot AI is rather extremely poor and won't provide much of a challenge.  Bottom line: Hope for improvements or get the board game.",

            "review_text": "For an adaptation from a board game, this is a far cry from poor. The game's replay value is very high, and is a lot of fun to play with friends both locally and online. This game is very easy to learn, and introducing someone to the game is very quick, as short instructional videos are included in the game itself. If watching videos to learn isn't much your fancy, the game can be learned fairly easily through gameplay. The game successfully captures the darkness and the bad-to-worse story development of the Witcher literature and games, making the experience familiar and fulfilling to those familiar to the franchise while also fun to those who are not so familiar with the Witcher world. It also includes a feature allowing players to vary the length of the game by changing the number of requirements to be filled in order to achieve victory, making the game last anywhere between a twenty minute spree to a night-long affair depending upon what is desired.  There are occasional bugs that crop up, such as results from dice rolls momentarily disappearing from the screen or development cards not glowing when they are usable, but such glitches are so few and far between that they do not hinder the experience much. The only other complaint worth mentioning about the game is that, to some, the experience may grow repetitive after successive playthroughs, as the gameplay is much the same from game to game. As such, many tend to take breaks in between playthroughs.  I would rate this game an 8.5/10 for its fulfilling play yet repetitive nature.",

            "review_text": "I have never really gotten into board games but I am a massive Witcher fanboy so I decided it would probably be worth the $10 and I was correct. The game may seem daunting at first but it is very easy to pick up on and if you are still struggling, there are nice tutorial videos for you to watch.  Although many reviews say that it is a 50/50 mix between luck and skill I would say that it is around 80% luck and the rest skill as you mainly depend on the role of the dice to be able to progress. I am not saying that this is a bad thing either.  Here are my pros and cons for the game so far (from what I have played)  Pros:  - Enjoyable music that sets the mood nicely for the game  - Easy to pick up on  - Nice tutorials  - Graphics are quite nice as well for a board game  - Auto save games for later plays  - Based on The Witcher  - Different from majority of other board games  - A little bit of The Witcher story is told through the cards etc.   Cons:  - Daunting at first  - Games take forever although this is too be expected for a board game so not really a con  - If you are unlucky, you're going to have a bad time  I will update my review later.",

It differs a little bit from a tabletop version - but it does not really matter, because this is still a fantastic little game.",

However, my problems with this game have nothing to do with the gameplay because i haven't seen it yet. i wanted to play this before dropping 60 bucks on a physical copy, but unfortunatley this game runs like garbage. I have an a6 with 12 gigs of ram and a 2 gb graphics card (raedon saphire) and have had no problems with all of my other games but for whatever reason this game refuses to run well. It goes black on the title screen, certain cards dont show up, and the ai just freezes in place. Maybe it's just my processor, but this game has not run correctly since i got it.",
