First off, the game was is more optismised than than last year's title. On my 970, I'm getting over 100 fps on high settings in both dry and wet conditions. Wet conditions on the previous game would always have severe drops to 30-40 when driving near a few other cars. The last game also had micro stutters occasionly. I have yet to get any in this game.  The actual driving is largely the same. I've noticed the rear tyres don't spin up as much which I always thought was a bit extreme in F1 2015. It's still more arcadey than sim but honestly I'm fine with that. The addition of steam workshop support for car setups is a nice feature.  It's got a proper career mode! And the best in the series to date! I love the addition of the track acclimatisation, tyre management and qualifying simulation programs in the practice sessions. It's a great way of prepping for the race and improving your car during the season by earning R&amp;D points. I started my career in Manor with the aim of bringing the team closer to the front of the grid.  I've seen a few bugs, such as a UI graphic that stayed on screen for an entire race and a floating ghost driver during a single-shot qualifying session. No crashes thus far. The multiplayer isn't broken at launch like the last game.  I just want to play more!",

I skipped 2015 due to a lack of career mode and generally unfavourable reviews so my opinons on this are based on a comparison to 2014 (which I loved).   -Career Mode feels immersive -New R&amp;D format is fun and feels rewarding -the graphics are a large upgrade  Took me a little bit to get used to the steering and I miss the old tyre/fuel menu whilst driving but now that I'm getting comfortable with it I like it. I had some issues getting 1440p settings to work but it seemed to have resloved itself. Pit crew communication phrases are a bit limited.  EDIT: Finding the AI to not be the brightest...a few instances of them smashing into the back of you when you make a good move on them. Doesn't happen too frequently.  The framerate in the office scenes is pretty low and choppy, but it's a minor thing that doesn't affect gameplay and isn't encountered frequently or for more than a few seconds.  9/10 for sure. They'll definitely let me know if a storm-front moves in.",

            "review_text": "  I'm an occasionnal racing game player and so far I love F1 2016. I was hesitant to pick this one up because of all the bad reviews and bugs from the last year version.   No crash or bugs. I had no problems running this game with a gtx 980ti with 60fps or more all the time on Acer predator X34 (21:9 ratio supported). There seems to be performance issue with the player hub in carreer mode where the fps drop really low but that wont keep you from enjoying the game. My only deception is that the game don't support multi gpu SLI.  My thrustmaster t500rs wheel work really well and the forcefeed back is amazing. No configuration needed. Everything just work as it should.  Graphics are good espescially in rain condition. I think Project cars look better than this.  Gameplay is great. It's a bit more arcade than Project cars but I like this way. The cars feel and handle very good. You wont have you car drifting and going out of control if you push the gas pedal too hard like Pcars. It's alot less punishing when you make a mistake.  I mostly played the carreer mode. It's very addicve as you'll want to make your pilot progress by completing team objectives, face to face challenge and gain experience points that you can spend to upgrade your car by achieving race objective. Unlike the empty and uninteresting Pcars carreer mode this one is great.  The ai seems ok. They wont bump into you unless you make something really unsual. I'm playing at medium difficulty and I'm having alot of fun.  The voice control for strategy, pit options and info on the race is a nice feature. I like it. It's easier to stay focus on the race than trying to manually navigate the menu.  I compared alot to Pcars because this was my favorite racing sim with a wheel. I never played any F1 20xx before.  Overall it's a must buy if you like F1 racing game.",

Graphics are very beautiful and combined with great audio this game can make you feel like you are accualy there driving on the track. Only negative thing that I can say about this game is that in career mode I have encountered lots of AI retires caused by engine failiure, way more that the amount in real f1 season. My final rating for the game is 8.5/10. I would give it 10/10 for the amout of fun I had with it but there are still few things that need improvement that will hopefully be fixed through patches.",

            "review_text": "I'm pretty impressed with it. I generally prefer racing games that fall on the more realistic simulation side of things like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars. (More Assetto Corsa these days). I was a bit worried about how F1 2016 would feel/handle and FFB. I just spent about 40 laps at Melbourne in time trial mode getting a feel for things and once i got FFB and controls setup it feels quite good to me. I was afraid Assetto may have spoiled me with the SF15/F138 they recently released but i think the F1 cars in this game are very good and on par with the Assetto models. I only tried expert mode with all assists off and it seems quite 'realistic' (Well as realistic as i'll ever know.. given i'll never touch one of these cars IRL)  I had some intermittent issues with steering initially... 1st: i had to turn my wheel all the way to get the car to turn at all.. the ratio seemed way off and too slow. found the steering saturation option and bumped it to 75 which seemed to fix that. 2nd: occasionally i'd have an issue where i had zero FFB and the saturation setting above wasnt working.. It seemed to go away after crashing into something. (Using a Fanatec CSW V2) Time will tell if this persists.  I'm not a huge F1 fan but watch with a passive interest. This is my first game from the official F1 series but overall i think this game is very solid. Looking forward to the career options. I dunno if you'd call it a sim or arcade or simcade, but at this point I think the physics are very good and will it will provide a lot of fun and replay-ability.  Graphics look very good and i'm glad to have some unique tracks that i dont have access to from any other games like COTA and Singapore.",

Here are the things I most enjoyed during this short amount of time:  The career mode is what makes it all fun, choose a low-end team and race your way to the top;  Personalize your driver by choosing name, looks, nationality and obviously an Ayrton Senna like helmet;  You can develop the car (R&amp;D) along the practice seasons by completing some goals that will also help you to drive better;  Control your entire career through your laptop;  Beating your teammate is always rewarding;  Get the best out of your car at the start of the race by feeding the throttle and releasing the clutch at the exact moment;  Watch the pre-race and post-race actions.   There are some downsides also:   The AI keeps hammering your rear wing under braking, so annoying;  There is still lots of wheel spin making it too arcade;  After the rain, the track starts to dry slowly and naturally but then hits a turning point where it gets completely dry out of the blue and it is hard to define which strategy to follow.  The FFB could be improved, the loose center is still there when using a G27 for example.

With the roots of the new engine monde behind F1 2015, Codemasters could have just re-implemented the career mode from F1 2014 and make it F1 2015 2. Instead they decided to overhaul the whole Career mode, add a new Time system to the weather system, give more depth with the character creation, improving some aspects of F1 2015...etc  The R&amp;D system, which is the biggest change of the game, seems to be the one who anger a lot of the community, but it really rely on how you play : you don't have that much time and you want to quickly win ? Rush the R&amp;D and make Haas Great Again. You have tons of time and you want to feel a more realistic competition ? Go slow on the R&amp;D and beat the AI on tracks with skill.  There are still some flows like the AI stacking themselves when some crash happened, or coming to pitstop for dry tyres just before the rain. But overall the game really made a huge step forward and gives a lot of hope from Codemasters, as lot of ideas in the game were given by players who answered a survey or by the forums (like the new Master Difficulty in one of the patches). Without comparing to others games of the series, I would rate it 8/10.",

Everything we asked for; formation lap, safety car, career mode, helmet customization has all been added. But not only have they been added, they've been done correctly and not just 'thrown' in.   Here's my opinion on different parts of the game.  Career Mode: What can I say. I was very excited and eager to start. I was first faced with Character customization, which was simple and yet efficient. Then it was the team selection, Which I'm glad you can choose any team as it makes it more 'personal' rather than being forced your Path.  R&amp;D: As we know it, Research &amp; Development was kind of the weakness in the past years. But this time, it brings a whole new meaning, not only do you improve. Other teams improve and even some don't. But... I honestly think R&amp;D is too easy &amp; too early. In my 1st season with Haas &amp; into the 14th race. Toro Rosso was already 3rd Fastest, Which seemed a little unrealistic. But other than that, it's perfect.  Safety &amp; Virtual Safety Car: Finaly. it's back! F1 2015 felt rushed without the safety car, although the Graphics was massively improved from 2014 and some will even argue they're still the best to this day for CM. With it completely been re-done, it feels much better. Although at times, it doesn't come out when it should and it comes out when it shouldn't. In my 2 seasons I've only had 1 VSC, so other than it being rare. I can't really give feedback other than it worked great when it did happen.  But yeah that's it. The Game is great again. Thanks. ",

I'm using a 360 controller and feel that i can do with the car what i want, and handling feels like it should, given that i have never driven F1 before, the physics seem feasible.  The AI is particularly good, and a vast improvement on anything i've played before. Out brake a rival into a corner for example, and they will give room and try to cut back, rather than just plow into you or back way off like in other games.

The HUB and your race engineer. I feel that to authentisentize (that's a word right?) better to the real life Formula 1, I think each team should have a HUB and an engineer that refects those teams accurately! I.E, a Ferrari engineer who speaks with an Italian accent, a HAAS engineer who is American etc!   The graphics are the best I've seen. I'm ultra settings with a GTX 970 Strix, i5 4460, 16GB RAM. 60 FPS at least for me. AA etc maxxed also So game-engine performance is brilliant.  So who should buy this.

The Career mode is excellent , along with the audio commentary. It is very immersive.  My only criticisms are that in the career mode I think it would have been better to have driver transfers during seasons and different lineups at the start of each year like in real life. The graphics have only slightly improved from F1 2015.  Buy it!!",
