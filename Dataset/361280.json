            "review_text": "Many smaller, simpler games often fail because they have difficulty managing to stay challenging with a relatively simple premise--but this isn't one of those. This is one of those games that have the great combination of 'easy to learn, hard to master' going and manages to keep on your toes.   The idea is simple, drill for oil and sell it. But with that simple premise you still have a lot of things that keep you always challenged:  Do you sell low and not worry about overflow or storage? If you choose to stockpile, you might run out of time and not get to sell the oil at all.   You never know where the oil is, so how much will you invest in exploring for oil? If you don't, you might lose thousands of dollars in oil, but you might also waste thousands of dollars fruitlessly searching for oil that isn't there.   How much money will you save for making important game winning purchases later in the game? (Won't get into that too much because, spoilers). If you save it all, you're going to miss out on important upgrades, but you could lose out on important things later on if you don't have any left.   Best $10 game I've played in a LONG time. Buy it, at the very least it's a great 5-10 hours of fun.",

That's not exactly the game to do it, but it will bring you in the mood for it. ...I suppose every old-day oil magnat had these days.  In your first playthrough (took me about 10h) it's a light hearted simulation. The competition is not that dangerous, and will snatch precious land plots from you, but extend their financial ressources in the process. You will mitigate that and beat them in the long run.   The levels itself play the same and you will develop a routine. Frequent upgrades to your equipment and the environment will ask some adapting of this routine. Mainly you gamble on waiting to sell your oil, hoping that the price will rise before the time is up or your silos full. Managing to get all oil and gas out and quitting early was the biggest achievment for me.  Despite that there is little variation from the first level to the last, I was never bored with the game.  There is an 'expert' mode you unlock after finishing the first campaign, which should be more of a challenge. I might update this review, once I've played it.",

I have to say for the seemingly hundreds of games I've played this was quite a treat. Kudos to the developer, I am very happy with my time spent in your world.

Many similar ones like gold digging and so on storm the internet, but somehow it never gets old (like tower defence games). The fact that you don't need to spend a lot of time with it and just play it between some other tasks makes it a great buy. And the simplicity - of course you need to think of a tactic, but when you get a hang of it you just start making so much money that it's hard to think of how to use it other tham make steam achievements xD.",
