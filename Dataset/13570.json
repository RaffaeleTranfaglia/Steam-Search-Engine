Coming from PSN to PC is like night and day. Using the mouse wheel to control movement speed while crouched? Lightning fast load times and quick saves? Zero lag or framerate issues? Smoother animations and more precise controls? It's like playing a whole new game. Maybe I'll finally be able to ghost every level.  As for the game itself, Hitman Blood Money introduced me to stealth, but Chaos Theory cemented the genre as one of my favorites. This is the best stealth game I've played on any platform, and nothing is more than thrilling than moving through the darkness as Sam Fisher, enemies mere inches away. Fantastic level design makes this is my favorite in the series",

It got everything you want in a game, an awesome Story, really good graphics (especially for 2005) and it just makes fun. You can play it a hundred times and it won't get boring.  Sneaking with Sam Fisher around the world, from Peru to Tokyo, is extremely fun and I can't stop loving this game, with it's awesome lightning, great characters and a cool Soundtrack.  Story:  'In June 2007, tensions are running high between China, North Korea, South Korea and Japan, due to Japan's formation of an Information Self Defense Force (I-SDF). Considering this to be a violation of Article 9 of the post-World War II Constitution, and blaming the I-SDF for information warfare attacks against their countries, Chinese and North Korean forces establish a blockade in the Yellow Sea against Japanese shipping. Because Japan is an ally of the United States, and thus the NSA's Third Echelon, the U.S. Navy dispatches a highly-advanced warship, the USS Clarence E. Walsh (CG-80), to the Yellow Sea with the hopes that China and North Korea will back down at its presence.'  If you are into Stealth Games...what am I saying...even if you're not, try it out. It is one of the best Games ever created. I love Ubisoft Montreal for that. It makes me happy, I love it.  You have to buy it. It is worth every single penny.  ",

The third installment of the franchise improved on its predecesors in countless ways. Its light,shadow and sound mechanics are unmatched to this day.  The game comes from a time where developers actually cared somewhat for the PC market, which can be most visibly seen in the movement speed variation of Sam Fisher, that could be controlled by the scroll wheel. A feature that for some inexplicable reason noone has tried to emulate. Visuals that hold up even today, stealth that is simultaneously unforgiving and fun, varied missions locations and enemies make the experience of playing Chaos Theory one of a kind. And that's all without mentioning the performance of Michael Ironside as Sam Fisher.  Not recommending this game to everyone because most people today are morons who wouldn't know how to play this game today since it doesn't have a built in wallhack, invasive HUD or achievements you can masturbate to.

I like that there is not only a meter to show how visible you are, but also a sound meter that is affected by your movement speed and ambient noises. My proudest achievement in gaming was getting 100% on every level without killing anyone and not being seen at all, leaving no trace.  I don't know if co-op or multiplayer still works, but the co-op missions were great when I played them on the original xbox with my brother back in the day.",

Most of the it gets its job done. -Annoying music -Some bad missions (the first no casualties-mission was pretty awful) -Some dumbed down stuff: when the NPCs are searching for you, they walk the slowest pace possible as if they were scared (in PT they were a lot faster so you didn't want to draw any attention), pistol is dumbed down so shooting light bulbs takes now more luck than skill, no more door roll, also hiding in shadows is now easier than before imo. -Not as interesting missions as the train level from PT. -Story is not worth following -Don't play this game if you get headache easily, the nightvision goggles will ♥♥♥♥ your eyes.  In conclusion it's a very enjoyable stealth game which makes you feel like a ninja as you master the mechanics and equipment. I'd suggest you to play with the hardest mode if you have any experience from the previous games, and also because the AI glitches less that way imo. I couldn't review the multiplayer mode because it's basically dead.",

            "review_text": "Again it's very late to write the review of this game - as it was release for quite a long back.  Still, I am compelled to write the same cause of the game itself. As usual I will be dividing my review in parts. So without any further adieu lets jump into the business here -   Story: The plot is, as with any other 'Splinter Cell' title, is self-untangling. At the beginning player will have a very limited knowledge about the entire plot and that is revealed as the game is progressed. The plot itself may not appeal to the average FPS people, who are looking for Aim-n-Shoot kinda play through. But if you invest enough time and senses into the game - the plot is very apt and con-sized.  Gameplay: The best part of any 'Splinter Cell' title. Yes, though its not an open world environment, still there are more than 1 ways to complete most of the missions. The player will be given ample scope and time and equipments to complete each of the missions as the way they see fit. Players can vary their tactics - they can go complete 'Stealth' and not raise a SINGLE!! alarm to complete mission or they can take a bit more direct approach to solve mattes - using bullets, that is.  The tools are great and fun to use as well - be it a sticky camera or optical fiber or Lock Pic they can make the players life a lot less painful.  Graphics: Now, when we talk about in game graphics - we usually bring out some of the big names of the business but very easily forget about 'Splinter Cell' titles. Even for an old game like Chaos Theory, trust me, the graphics is great. The shadows and the ambient glow from the street/table/wall lamps are just too good. But the best part of all of them are the different vision mode of Sam Fisher's goggles. To me, the 'Night Vision' is one of the best rendered 'night mode' across all the game titles.  AI: The AI is a strong point in this game - specially how they react to a whisper or when they see a body. Some of the guards are as ignorant as ever yet some of they are very suspicious (even of their own breathing). AI bots take some predefined paths or some random one - specially after they are being alerted. Even an open door or torn curtain can raise there suspicion. Be very careful to watch your light and ambient noise meter all the time - and don't hesitate to grab one if needed.  All in all I am really enjoying the game and I would surely recommend anyone who is looking a different breed of the FPS genre.  - Go Covert -",

Chaos Theroy is both over rated and severly dated (Coming from someone who grew up with far older titles I think that says something) and if your wondering if you should buy the game you might notice that all the positive reviews say it's great without explaining why. The story is a Call of Duty esque snore and the stealth is simplistic and boring but I must reluctantly say since there's a lot of freedom in how you deal with enemies (Kill or do not kill) or for how you can screw up it's still a video game (Take that for what you will).  The AI springs between aimbot accuracy, sloth like, and just plain blind and or stupid. Unlike the console versions you can actually see whats going on as the PS2 and original Xbox version suffer from pitch blackness gamma syndrome even with the goggles or turning up your TV's brightness settings all the way. The graphics get the job done in regards to the world but the character models are frankly attrocious and suffer from pre next gen Ubisoft graphics with the enemy models looking especially bad (Barely better than Max Payne's) what with their mouths being green. The character models and blurry badly animated CGI make the game look even older than most PS2 games. Hell for 2005 it wasn't even the best stealth game. I think that title goes to Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistance which was the re release of the 2004 original on weaker hardware that added a free thirdperson camera which is embarrassing considering that this Splinter Cell has better hardware than MGS 3 to work with on the Gamecube and Xbox Original and of course the PC.  The real issue is it's terrible controls and awkward bindings for mouse and keyboard. The console controls were already wonky (And thats coming from someone who's used tank controls, pressure sensitive controls and motion controls.) but here on the PC both options control as if you were drunk. It's controls are harder to understand and get a grip on than any of the Arma titles and yes that extends to Operation Flashpoint/Cold War Assault. You name it and it will probably control better than Chaos Theroy (Middle mouse to aim, shft to jump?). At least you can rebind some of the conrols (The mouse wheel effecting your speed is interesting albiet flawed). If your excuse is 'bad controls incentivise sneaking or avoiding combat' than every stealth game prior or afterwards would like to have a word with you.  It's a mediocre third person shooter disguised as a stealth game with that aspect only just barely being above average and with the latter being primarily in focus. It's voice acting, music, level design, COOP and lack of Uplay are the only thing that salvages it from being total ♥♥♥♥ in my eyes. Even then the COOP is capped at 35 FPS for some bizarre reason and its hard to even get it working. If you like scanning crates and bad spanish accents this is the game for you. If you like stealth try anything else (Might I suggest Hitman: Blood Money or Theif?).  I don't usually do numbered score but I give Splinter Cell: Chaos Theroy a 3/5 or a 4 out of 10.",

None of this was possible :(. I'm just a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that after returning to this game after many years via computer my hopes and dreams of online play were destroyed, more so that none of this information was made available to me on the Steam Store before my purchase. I lost $20.  TLDR; IMO and many other's its the best single player stealth game in existence. However Steam failed to communicate to me that it has no FUNTIONAL online play so f*ck Steam and Ubisoft for ripping me off. And so, because of my saltiness I do not reccomend it.",

Highlights include:  -multiple ways to navigate the levels and accomplish objectives, ranging from equipment selection to the paths you can take. There is a true freedom of choice, even when you find yourself in a forced encounter later in the game.  -high character interactivity: Fisher can walk or crouch walk at different speeds, vault over walls, climb pipes, balance himself between 2 walls, enter airducts, pick up and throw objects, roll, jump, whistle, hack electronics from a distance, use weapons ambidextrously, cut through tent walls, and more. Most of the things you can imagine doing in the situations you find yourself in, you can.  -the shadows still look great today, and there are environmental effects like clothing getting wet when exposed to rain. Most modern games today don't have these.  -realistic interactions with the environment: water conducts electricity, unconscious people die if they're dropped from too high, knocking someone unconscious on water and not carrying him off will cause him to drown, carrying bodies around is taxing for Fisher and slows him down, etc. You feel like you're in a realistic world controlling a person that has physical limits.  -amazing and cool soundtrack that stays varied through the entire game  -robust stealth: enemies are fairly smart and don't have memories that expire in 2 seconds (and doing stupid things like whistling when near them will immediately get them to shooting), stages have many surveillance devices or traps, alarms make enemies more resilient and paranoid, environmental sound and light are always deciding factors for the approach you have to take, your equipment provides help in so many different ways (such as using sticky cameras to scout ahead and even distract guards)  -point system that encourages perfectionist players to play the game with no kills and no detections as it is really supposed to be played, as well as no-kill restrictions on some levels  -great dialogue and banter between Fisher and the other characters paint an interesting and multi-dimensional picture of him as a character. These were not the days when everybody were edgy and angry killing machines; Fisher jokes around with friends and enemies but also shows concern and anger at times, such as when ordered by Lambert to leave plane-wrecked pilots in a site that is soon to be bombed, and even makes political commentary. Grimsdottir is not an action girl but a computer nerd that jokes about her grade school days. Many enemies have their own unique interrogation dialogues (and these were actual interrogations brought on by a display of force, not torture as in Conviction) and quite a few are portrayed sympathetically.  -interesting and fairly complex story that doesn't work in its entirety, but is pretty good otherwise. Also notes to discover and read that reveal small details about the present events in the game's timeline.  -co-op and multiplayer modes that feel completely different from the singleplayer experience. The co-op mode is not just great fun, its storyline also intersects with the singleplayer's. The multiplayer puts heavily armed mercenaries that see the world in first person versus lightly armed but agile and resourceful Splinter Cell-like spies that have a third person camera.  -no regenerating health but limited numbers of health pickups scattered around. In the hardest difficulty detection is frequently synonymous with death.   A must play for anyone interested in the stealth genre, as well as a timeless reminder taht Ubisoft used to be able to make great games.",
