First of all, the camera is attrocious. The 'aiming' function changes the camera view to a 1st person point of view... In a pretty much 2D world... It's not pretty. The music is obnoxious and loud, the sound effects sounds like they have been imported from an old floppy disk.  There's only 1 server and it's located in Europe. Barely any players were actually playing the game at the time of writting this review. 52 players were online, in fact.  Is it fun? Yes, for a little while... But it's clunky and Pay to Win, it's got too many issues, I cannot recommend this game.",
