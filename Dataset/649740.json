    "description": "CRAFT BATTLE SIMULATOR is an awesome multiplayer game. You have to control a ship with the crew and cannons going around destroying other ships. This game is tons of fun to play with friends or even alone as you can single handedly dismantle a fleet if youâ€™re skilled enough.",
