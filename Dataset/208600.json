            "review_text": "A true spiritual successor to old games like Lunar Lander. Yes, there is a learning curve here. One thing that is a bit unfair is a stock lander with no upgrades lacks a stabilizer, if you get the craft rotating in mutiple axis you will have a hell of a time getting it stabilized. As you progress and upgrade the LM you won't have this problem, though of course you will have more experience flying and won't be so fazed by basic flight. Bottom line: when starting out only use yaw/rotate and leave pitch and roll alone. Mission types are fine though they boil down to fly from base X to base/point X and do something. Lost cargo is a little more interesting as you have to use your eyes to locate the target (the beacon is too short ranged to be of too much use in locating the cargo). Some other mission types would be useful, like a photo-mapping mission, where you have to fly a designated strip of territory taking images as you go along.   The actual feeling of flight is superb. The Hills map in particular has a very authentic Lunar Highlands feel to it. Others less so. Canyons is challenging but the verticle exageration makes it look a little unbelievable. Mars is also a challenge but after the 'purity' of Lunar flying is a bit frustrating.   As far as this game being too difficult, well, I disagree. If you watch the basic tutorials you should be fine, esp if you obey the basic rule of 'no pitch/roll w/o a stabilizer'. If you want difficult, try Eagle Lander 3D which is a hardcore LM sim, no game, no missiles, no HUD, just the DSKY and a scribed pattern on the LM window to guide you and historical Apollo scenarios.   For a niche title an impressive level of support. After the initial release we saw release of Oculus Rift support and then multiplayer, and continuing support into 2015. The developer has demonstrated maturity and staying power by supporting this very excellent sim/game.",

Thanks to Sean Edwards for his indefatigable efforts on this project - that some (myself included) - had thought was shelved.  The addition of the Vive element creates very immersive experience and adds a greater essence of situation awareness - I had recently played a little on this previously using TrackIR, which was still very enjoyable.  I'm looking forward to playing this a lot more. This will be one of my go-to games that I typically use to 'wow' my mates who haven't tried VR gaming before. ",

            "review_text": "Lunar Flight is a very enjoyable game that can be both relaxing and challenging. It comes with a unique flight model that provides a new experience even for accustomed flight / space simmers, yet is easy enough to learn if you are completely new to this genre. You only need to remember to pay close attention to the important flight properties such as trajectory vector and velocity which you have to bring down manually only by yourself as there is no atmosphere (except for Mars, but the atmospheric braking effect is very subtle anyways), and fuel that is realistically consumed even by minor attitude adjustments, as every spacecraft movement and rotation is done using thrusters. Another big difference compared to the usual flight model you're probably used to is that you also need to account for spinning which isn't gonna centre on it's own, but there are upgradable stabilisers that make it easier.  The music style is fitting and unobtrusive, and together with the background comms chatter creates a strangely soothing atmosphere. Visuals are nicely done, the models are very detailed and textures have a very high resolution that should look great even on screens bigger than FullHD. Although I absolutely refused to use a 2D cockpit in any flight simulator I ever played, I didn't have any problem with it here, as it's very nicely done both on the functionality and usability side and also because it's mostly resembling the Apollo Lunar Module cockpit. Despite the small windows and tiny forward-facing screen, landing isn't difficult at all thanks to the very cleverly designed nav monitors. It can also be easily switched to a clean HUD with toggleable GUI screens, quickly configurable by buttons; or to a 3D cockpit.  My play time should tell roughly how long it takes to complete the game, including all the single player achievements, without playing MP at all (for a reference I'm experienced in several flight sims and have a good HOTAS controller). If you want to play multiplayer, remember to ask your friends to get this game aswell, as there are usually no servers at all (which may change after the big update). But I believe you could get other players online if you asked at the discussions section and planned a meeting. You're definitely gonna need a joystick with at least one POV hat (preferably 8-way) to control the very needed lateral thrusters, or an adequate gamepad such as the X360 which the 3D cockpit includes a matching model for (soon to be replaced with a X52 Pro, I guess).  All in all, I would recommend Lunar Flight to every space nerd who isn't afraid to try something new!",

The physics of your vehicle are brilliantly made so that it is a challenge to fly, but an extremely satisfying challenge. You don't have to use all of the thrusters to start with which makes things a bit easier, but as you get better you can start to use of the thrusters to get places a bit quicker (resulting in the occasional crash when you get cocky!).  Just great and fun to play!",

Once you figure out the somewhat involved method to take off, traverse to the next checkpoint and land safely then you will start getting lost for hours building up experience on the lunar maps. After that, you upgrade your craft and attempt more complicated travel maneuvers involving axis rotation that reduce fuel use and speeds up mission times.   While many VR games are more fun standing up, this game improves with sitting down and taking your time. Outside of multiplayer combat which I have not done, there's little need for twitch style gameplay.
