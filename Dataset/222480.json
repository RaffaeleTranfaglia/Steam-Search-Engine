            "review_text": "CAMPAIGN REVIEW ONLY:  Resident Evil: Revelations (RE:R) is a spin-off from the numbered RE game, since numbered RE's have become more + more blockbuster-esque + action-esque. Revelations takes some steps to bring the RE series a bit closer to its survival-horror roots, which long-time fans of RE series are going to appreciate. Also, RE:R keeps some of the things that were found in RE5 (i.e. you will often have an AI companion with you + KB-mouse controls were drastically improved) + RE6 (the game will have you playing from different agents' perspective).   While RE's plot is typical RE stuff, if you've played any of the previous RE's, it's still enjoyable, ridiculous, quite over-the-top + hammy. Agents from different organizations are involved in a pair or so of ships that have a Virus on them - and the agents are here to clean-up the mess. With twists + turns in the story + plot, never is there a dull moment, even despite the dialogue + writing never ever really taking-off, staying quite serviceable.  RE:R delivers a much more solid gameplay experience than RE6, never feeling like you will be replaying the same exact levels + boss fights numerous times that you did on another campaign. RE6 had tons of major highs + some major lows, while RE:R never ever does that at all - from start-to-finish, RE:R is, for the most part, is excellent. Unlike RE5+6, expect to constantly run out of ammo and be switching weapons - often bringing back the survival-horror feel that had been dwindling since RE5. Controls feel very similar to RE5+6 PC, in terms of the actual controls - so, you're fine with how those controlled with the KB-mouse, expect more of that. For me, it was best to turn-off Mouse Acceleration in the Options - to make the mouse actually move more properly - otherwise, the mouse didn't control correctly.   When assets + backtracking get re-used, it is done in a way where something is twisted into a different way entirely - which was one of the biggest problems with RE6. RE:R's biggest problem is actually in its graphics quality, since its environments really show that this was a port from a mobile platform - with often some blurry environments, bland environments &amp; not-detailed areas showing up on-screen. On the other hand - characters + enemy models look really good, showing that those are of a much higher + better quality.   The game rarely dropped belong 60 frames per seconds on its highest settings, playing smoothly most of the time. There were a few stutters and framerate drops - which, oddly enough, were when going from area-to-area in one of the hubs, when nothing of much was happening, when waiting to move to the next area. When it mattered, during combat - most of the time, 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB of GeForce GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit).   If you found RE6 disappointing for whatever reasons - and certainly many did, while I found it to be a gem, despite its numerous flaws - make sure to check out RE:R. RE:R is a return to the greatness that came from RE4 + also takes some of the elements of RE5+6 that were worthwhile. Certainly, RE:R is an improvement over in RE6 in terms of overall consistentcy + brings back some of the survival-horror elements that were missing in a majority of RE6. After 16 hours of playing, RE:R proves that graphics ain't always everything, when the overall gameplay is consistently fantastic.  Final Grade = B+.  ADDITIONAL NOTES On RE Series -&gt; RE4,5,6 + Rev: Keep in mind, I have yet to play RE1-3, believe it or not. RE4 PC (Non-HD Edition) might've been the greatest RE game that I've played so far, despite it being a not-so-good PC port (in terms of PC controls for the KB-mouse).  RE5 was a really good game-experience + major improvement in making a great PC version for a RE game.  RE6 is just a flawed-gem of a game.  RE:R fits in as being the best actual RE game that I've played since actually RE4.",

            "review_text": "The game is pretty long, offers some challenge and extras to make you replay it, but it get's fairly repetitive at certain points of the story even on a single walkthrough. You get to play as multiple characters throught the game, although they mostly play the same. The story not too deep, yet difficult to understand at times (might be easier for people familiar with other Resi games), but the ending is fairly satisfying, even though it leaves an obvious lead-in for the Revelations 2. There are many returning characters from older RESI games, but there are some interesting new ones, too.  The game itself is rather a shooter than an actual (survival) horror and I doesn't contain usuall Resi-type zombies, but rather strange sea-animal hybrids. Most of the bosses lack charisma and boss fights generally are heavily based around finding a tactic and using it over and over again. The scenery lacks variety at times (a major part of the story takes place on a ship), but brings something new to the Resi series on the other hand.  There are multiple minigames / sub-mechanics to bring some variety into the gameplay. I'll mention scanning for fingerprints and hidden items, hacking mini-game, arcade-style railway shooter, weapon upgrades and augmentations. There ARE quick-time events in this game, but they're not too frequent or annoying in any way. The controls overall work faily well on PC with Mouse &amp; Keyboard.  As far as I know, there is no co-op mode for the campaign, but there is a Raid Mode for multiplayer, with unlockable equipment and skillpoints.  After finishing the campaign, I can say I enjoyed the game, even though I've hated it at some points and wanted it to end already. There were some nice plot twists I liked, there were some plot twists I didn't really understand. Just don't expect a survival horror and rather expect an action shooter with long cutscenes.",

In my opinion the original REmake on Gamecube, and Resident Evil 2 have been the best entries in the franchise. How does Revelations compare? The gameplay is perfected and very smooth with responsive controls. The visual presentation is nice for a port from a handheld device, the accompaning music is good although hard to hear at times. The story can be convoluted however, a fault of most modern games it seems. Having just started into the raid mode, this game delivers plenty of replayable. Highly reccomended and the best Resident Evil game since 4 no doubt.",

            "review_text": "My personal relationship with the world-famous/infamous Resident Evil series has been a long and sometimes treacherous one. The very first Resident Evil on the PlayStation 1 was nothing less than, well, a 'revelation' to me when I first discovered it. Having spent years prior basically disinterested in video games in favour of more 'respectable' art/entertainment forms such as films, a funny thing happened on the way to the grave and I found myself no longer very 'scared' by horror movies any more...a shame, since it has arguably been my single favourite of all genres since, well, at least my mid-teens or so. Then I discovered that it was possible for a VIDEO GAME to have much the same effect, only perhaps more so...for in spite of the questionable graphics and clunky movement, it was officially now ME essaying the role of the lead protagonist in a horror story. And that was a very scary proposition indeed! The first time I discovered that giant shark in the mansion's basement...man, that was an epic moment...and the Resident Evil series was of course destined to become all the MORE epic, in time. Though not necessarily in a GOOD way...    Resident Evil 2 took things to a SLIGHTLY more action-packed and, yes, 'epic' level, but still managed to unquestionably maintain the horror credentials of its predecessor. Resident Evil 3...well, it was still mostly favouring the fear over the fight, but with the first advent of a firearm-wielding monster, things were starting to veer just the teensiest, tiniest bit downhill. Code Veronica thankfully steered things back toward a more staunchly horror-orientated direction shortly thereafter...but then of course came Resident Evil 4 (let's just ignore the Survivor/Dead Aim/Outbreak/etc games for the purposes of this review, since they honestly don't exist in the minds of most RE fans). Yes, just when all seemed lost if the series were to indeed continue in the direction it was mostly heading in, RE4 managed to reinvigorate the waning faith of many a fan, not so much by taking the series in a less action-y direction, but by downright REINVENTING the gameplay in a way which better SUITED the increased amount of enemies and firepower and what-have-you. And it managed to do so without compromising that all-important 'horror factor' TOO much.     Which brings us to Resident Evil 5...sigh. I mean, it wasn't that bad...at least until the utterly ridiculous rock-punching (!) climax set in a volcanic landscape, at which point those little hints of manga and anime which the series had harboured for so long took true hold and ♥♥♥♥ all over anything even vaguely resembling logic or atmosphere. Its myriad sins seem pale in comparison, however, to part 6, which - from as much as I have been able to bear to play of it so far - appears to be a final declaration that the games which helped spawn a series of by-and-largely moronic MIlla Jovavich action movies were now SUBSERVIENT to said movie series, and it was officially a 'horror' series no more. Thankfully, however, the good people at Capcom saw fit shortly BEFORE this atrocity to give birth to a side-series which would better retain the 'survival horror' flavour of the early games...    Resident Evil Revelations, please step forward for evaluation.    It's been described as 'Resident Evil 4.5', and it can certainly lay claim to that title story-wise. So what about...GAMEPLAY-wise? Well...pretty much, yeah. I'll admit I wasn't too impressed early on, finding myself essentially confused by all the episodic jumping back and forth between different characters in different places and what-not...which only served, incidentally, to compromise one of the single most important contributing factors to the tension generated in a successful 'survival horror' game, namely that of ammo and/or healing conservation (that is to say, when you only have to make what few items you possess last until the end of one or two chapters, a good deal of this tension inevitably abates). BUT...after a while the focus falls at least predominantly on the characters trapped out at sea, and it's in these segments that Revelations manages to capture some of that old-school 'isolation horror' charm.    To some degree it's almost like the RE1 mansion set on a boat (well, three boats, but who's counting), with a bit of Tomb Raider-inspired swimming and butt-centric visuals - this is still aimed at young males, after all - to fill it all out. But mostly, I gotta say...it's pretty good. Not a TOTAL return to form - the AI is certainly about as ♥♥♥♥ as such things can get, including one bit where monsters were literally either walking or jumping straight past not ONE but TWO NPCs to get to my player-controlled character! - but it's about the best we can hope for for now, one suspects. Though Revelations 2, horror of horrors, actually looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing SILENT HILL game in the screenshots! So maybe there really is hope for this franchise after all. It's pretty much like the film industry these days: When in doubt, REBOOT. It worked for the Batman movies, and it can work for the Resident Evil games. We'll just have to wait and see, though, won't we?   Verdict: 9/10.    (And speaking of Batman...you know that a video game series has been going on just a LITTLE TOO LONG when an otherwise perfectly straight 'rookie government agent' character is designed with hair which makes him look like THE JOKER. What, Leon's hair in RE4 wasn't over-stylish or impractical ENOUGH for you people?! Saints preserve us...)",

The graphics / FMV are lush in places but show there 3DS origins in places, the controls are tight (as far as an RE game is concerned) and the most importantly the gameplay is nice.  The main reason the gameplay is good is because of the even pacing between item finding / scaning, light puzzling and exploration mixed in with the combat. Also you 'WILL' have to watch the ammo as you'd expect in a true survival horror and the best thing is the main setting is spot on, the ship is very reminiscent of RE1's mansion even in puzzle / interaction elements and the light backtracking required to unlock a weapon or open that room previously locked by a symboled key, love it, feels like a true RE game in 3d clothing for me, keep on this route Capcom!

            "review_text": "This is probably the 'best' Resident Evil (on the PC at least) so far. It takes all the strenghtes in atmosphere and storytelling of the first three entries and combines it with a control scheme that acutally makes sense. This game is a great throwback to the original RE 1. Despite the many differences and improvements, it still has countless stylistic references to the original and it 'feels' a lot more like RE 1 than RE 4 - 6 did. Gameplay is very solid (with a controller), difficulty is challenging but not too stressfull and the pacing is very well done.   On top of that, a very nice action mode is added for short burst of monster hunting.   Having played all PSX and PC RE games, I never really liked the first three REs due to the completely unusable controls. RE:R fixes those. I also liked the 'actionized' RE sequels (including 6, which is nice, but only for fans willing to accept change). Effectively, RE:R combines the controls of RE 5 with the strength of the RE 1 - 3 story and atmosphere. All in all, you can see that a lot of very smart design choices have been made in regards of the game, keeping frustration to a minimum.   But, all said and done. This is still a Resident Evil game. That means a a completely bonkers (but not bad) plot, a lot of narm and very unique character design. You either like it or not. If you can live with that, RE:R is a great entry into the series for players who haven't played any RE yet. For fans of the series it is a must play.",

            "review_text": "After beating Resident Evil Revelations on all difficulty levels, spending more than 100 hours in Raid Mode and beating almost all stages (Ghost Ship, why you are so hard?) I think I earned myself a right to write this review.  For the starters I want to say that I'm big fan of Resident Evil franchise. I remember how scared I was as kid playing first Resident Evil game on Playstation console. I had tons of fun and scary jumps and even after so many years old Resident Evil games can scare me to death. I saw fall down of Resident Evil games when the sixth main entry in franchise was released yet I still remained a fan of it. It's part of my life, and even with so many terrible routes it had taken, nothing will change that. So this review might be kind of biased, full of comparisons to other Resident Evil games, if you want a review that will be made from normal gamer and not life for fan of series, please stop reading it. Thank you.  When for the first time I heard that Resident Evil game is coming out only on Nintendo 3DS I was disappointed. 'RE game on portable consoles? Why would they skip big consoles and PC? There must be something fishy going around... yup, another bad game in series!'. I truly regret saying those things. Resident Evil Revelations made it on PC later than infamous Resident Evil 6. To be honest, I didn't expected much. Some action game, maybe again full of QTEs but since it's Resident Evil game I will try my best do enjoy it. Well, I didn't needed to try much because Resident Evil Revelations is one big surprise.  Prologue made me really into this game. It's mix of old Resident Evil formula and the new one. There is still action but much more less of it than in Resident Evil 5 and 6. For the first time after so long I felt like game in this franchise have something more - yup, this magical atmosphere of horror! Even without tanky controls, limited field of view and zombies, there is a Resident Evil game that can be enjoyed even by fans of older RE titles. It's not too scary, there aren't many jump scares but it's filled with atmosphere of insecurity. R(esident)E(evil)velations is game which made me think that Capcom can do a great job if they wants to.  I was happy to see Jill once again as main character. There is also Chris and few new faces. I will skip the story's part because all of it you can read on Steam - it's full of twists anyway. Hope Capcom will continue it because they way it ended... yeah, there SHOULD be a sequel.  New B.O.W. - Ooze, is my least favorite of Bio Organic Weapons. Those really lack in everything when compared to Hunters or Lickers. Tho I liked mutated Rachel design, she is really creepy. Big ship as the main stage was also to my like. Graphic and music are good but there wasn't anything worth mentioning. Maybe Jill's lower back of body...  So moving from the 'general' things, there is this Raid Mode. It's like a mixed Mercenaries mode from 4/5/6 and from Resident Evil 3. You don't need to kill enemies ASAP and makes your score big. You simply moves from point A to B and killing things on your way. With every completed stage you get exp, more powerful weapons, parts and some unlockables - next stages and alternative costumes for this mode. Amazing things is that after 2 years there are still events going on  residentevil.net  for it. If you will ever want to beat most hard stage in REvelations then you will need ultra rare weapons and parts they are giving for event participants or powerful friend.  While I'm writing this review I'm sure that I have forgot about something. Well, maybe I will add this something when I will remember it.  Resident Evil Revelations is a game which finally can please fans of older RE games. Playing through story on hardest difficult mode will makes you feel good old times once again, when every bullet in the magazine was really important and once enemies got you, there was no mercy. It would be awesome to be able to play story mode in cooperation but it's good you can play at least with your friends on Raid Mode. You can see that REvelation is experiment product and it was received well. Hope it will make Capcom think more about how next Resident Evil main game should be like.",

            "review_text": "Resident Evil Revelations is actually a good game. i personally got really surprised when i played its demo and actually got scared by one of the creatures but that's temporary. the main fear you gonna feel in that is not dying because when you die (and on the hardest difficulty you gonna die alot) you go back kinda a lot and that's annoying.   Graphics - i'd give something around 7/10 considering the time it came out (2013) and not 2016 even tho that would be unfair. the graphics are good for its time also considering that is a port from a 3DS game so.   Controls - they are great. i play with a joystick but even with mouse and keyboard they can be really comfortable. on the mouse i'd sorta of recommend to turn the sensibility down and the mouse acceleration off because it can be a bit too much for some people including me  Story - well. meh seriously. i mean the story is good but at least didn't catch me till the part i played. i hope this changes i really do but for now imo is meh at least in that point. what kinda of made me play this game was Jill valentine because i'm a huge fan of her as a character.   Gameplay - Is very resident evil 6 tbh. is pretty much action with some darker parts which i didn't really feel fear on  CONCLUSSION   If you want a good modern Resident Evil Experience. this game is for sure worth a shot in my opinion. it is entertaining if you are looking for that. However if you are expecting horror. no. just no. go and get one of the remasters of Resident evil 1 or 0 (or wait for the remake of resident evil 2) because this one is not for you",

            "review_text": "For a game that was ported from the 3DS &amp; was made after RE6 this game is surprisingly good. Not great, but good.   PROS  -Solid Controls &amp; Gameplay -Decent Survivor Horror Elements -Better Companion System -Metroidvania-like Exploration -Weapon Upgrades -Online Multiplayer Modes -Decent Graphics (IMO)   CONS  -Stale Level Design -Scanning is kind of pointless -Too much Action Elements -Not enough Horror Elements -Takes itself too seriously -Stale Character Development -Companions are Still Pretty Useless   STORY   The Story revolves around a cruise ship being hijacked by zombies &amp; a town that was destroyed in similar style of Racoon City. You play Primarily as Jill &amp; switch between other characters in flash back segments. Most of the flash back segments revolve around Action &amp; Fast Paced Shooting while the ship segments are more based on Survival Horror in the style of RE4. While not as good as RE4 or previous renditions it still does a decent job at the scares every now and then.   FEATURES   This game is a port of the handheld versions, so don't expect anything amazing. It is an amazing game on the handheld, as I have been playing that version as well. I do think that some things were lost when ported to the PC but that's mostly a small gripe.  The game's graphics are alright. Not amazing but they aren't terrible either. It's sort of a combination of RE4 &amp; RE5 style of graphics. They don't mesh out well but it's not really displeasing to look at. There are no super astounding shading or lighting effects, though. I actually think some lighting effects were done better on the 3DS than in this PC port. The FMV Cutscenes are really good looking though. It makes me wish the whole game looked like that because they are so good looking.  I haven't gotten too far into the game, I think. I'm about halfway into the fourth chapter, but the one complaint I have is the enemy variation. It's mostly the same enemy, reskinned with new attacks &amp; flesh weaponry. There's one with arm maces, one with arm blades, one with an arm crossbow, etc. The first huge annoyance I've suffered with this game was the first real boss fight. A big bullet sponge with instant kill attacks surrounded by tough enemies that keep respawning. There is no real tension or fear in this fight, just blatant annoyance forcing you to place one or two shots then keep running &amp; repeat. It would have been a lot better if they just made the boss tougher &amp; didn't have the annoying enemy respawns. More annoying in this version though is the first Rifle that you find in the 3DS version before the boss fight seems to have been moved in this version, but the ammo is still there. Why bother moving a gun if you're not gonna replace the ammo with ones I need? That's just stupid.  Then there's RAID mode! It's basically a mode that allows online multiplayer against the zombies, but zombies are more varied in size &amp; difficulty. There are small quick ones, large lumbering slow ones, &amp; of course, raid bosses. This is basically what it sounds like. A run &amp; gun collectathon for items &amp; equipment. You have to play through the Main Campaign to unlock more levels of Raid Mode. Raid Mode also has a solo mode but is much harder since it doesn't make enemies weaker. It's balanced enough for both single &amp; multiplayer, but you need proper leveled guns in order to complete a level. Don't bother going into a level 7 mission with level 1 guns. You will fail &amp; run out of bullets prematurely due to lack of damage being dealt.  You also have a scanner in the Campaign, which serves as a collectathon device. You use it to find hidden items, ammo &amp; hand prints. You also need to scan enemies in order to recieve more healing items. I don't know why they did it this way. You also recieve less 'Scan Points' if you scan the same enemy constantly or scan them after they die. So, if you need healing items you need to scan them while they're alive to increase the point gain.   It's kind of like Metroid Prime, except not as well done. You don't get any enemy lore or hints on how to beat them easier when you scan. It just serves as a heal item generator &amp; invisible ammo finder. Honestly, I think it was kind of a pointless addition. I get it is supposed to be a 'Risk &amp; Reward' system for recieving healing items, but I'd much rather just have an extra herb or two put in a room with enemies than being forced to leave myself open to attack so I can scan them to get a healing item that I'm probably gonna have to use right away now because I was attacked while scanning them.  You also get to upgrade weapons with mods. Mods are also earned in raid mode &amp; give a variety of bonuses such as increased fire rate, damage, &amp; ammo capacity. You find mods scattered throughout the levels hidden in safes or just in the scenery. Keep an eye out for anything useful like this, especially ammo bags. They increase the max amount you can carry.  Another improvement is the Companion System. No longer are you forced to babysit, but there's also a lack of a co-op through the Campaign mode &amp; companions are still relatively useless. They don't need ammo, they don't need healing, but they don't really serve a purpose. They fire maybe one shot every few seconds, usually missing, &amp; mobs don't bother attacking them. So, the only reason the companions exist is for the story itself &amp; maybe as an introduction to them for Raid mode. Also, they tend to stand around in an area while you do all the work somewhere else. It's a better system than RE5's terrible companion who if dies you fail the mission &amp; basically forced you to play on easy or with online co-op, but it's still not a very good system in general.  The level design leaves a bit to be desired. You're on a huge cruise ship, but most of the time it feels like you're in a huge mansion. The game allows you to explore it freely to an extent, as some areas are cut off until you get a specific key through the story progression but those keys often lead to extra rooms filled with goodies like ammo or upgrades. And trust me, you need all the ammo you can get in this game because it is pretty scarce. I found myself completely out of ammo after the first boss fight &amp; had to run from enemies &amp; knife them. Good luck fighting some more annoying enemies without any ammo.    OVERALL   I'd say this game is actually better than I thought it would be. It's not great, not ground breaking in any way &amp; doesn't do anything that other Resident Evil or other games haven't done already but it's not bad at all. It does take itself too seriously at times. There's no witty banter between characters &amp; not really much dialog inbetween cutscenes or mission directive but it's still a decent game worthy of picking up on a good enough sale. It's also worth picking up on the N3DS if you have one.",

Storytelling is episodic and gameplay is what you would expect from any other resident evil game with a twist of action, you get to play as many different characters on many different missions folding into eachother to tell this decent and very interesting Resident Evil story.   Theres even a 'Raid Mode' that you can unlock by playing the entire 8 to 10 hour campaign. Raid Mode will have you run through familiar terrain killing water zombies with large health bars for rank, bonuses, enemy spoils, BP and EXP. You can play with a friend or test yourself. I would say this is the equivelant of Zombies in COD.  I give this game a 7/10 for its decent story and familiar gameplay with the addition of Raid Mode and New Game+.

Basically, from what I've read and watched on the internet, this goes more back to its roots in the first RE series, where it's supposed to be survival horror. The thing is, is that the survial element is in, but not the horror; I've played games like Slender, Dead Space, and Alan Wake, and sorry to those who like RE, there is NO horror element found here. Just the frustrating survival element that's more irrate than survival.  Pros: The game looks really nice; graphics, textures, modles, the works. Everything looks nextgen.  Cons: Aside from what I've listed at the top, that's pretty much it. There is nothing good here. The story is dry, and boring (seriously, first 5 minutes in the game I was watching a cutscene, I was like 'I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥, SKIP'.), the characters are as planned as the story, and the voice acting was subpar at most.  Gameplay: Now like I said, I never played the first RE titles, just RE5, which I loved. But in accordance to that, it feels like I'm not some bad ♥♥♥ agent, but more like someone saving every single bullet I come accross, which is what most combat is like; you're not killing the zeds, you're running from them. Because heaven forbid you come accross a hallway blocked by zeds, and you can't shoot your way out, you have to ♥♥♥♥ing knife them. If not, you have to run and dodge them. The dodge system is simlar to Alan Wake's in that you have to time you're enemies attack to get out of the way. This would be good, except that it's the same button as the 180 degree turn. If you don't time it perfectly, which I suck btw at stuff like this, you'll turn and face the wrong way and eat ♥♥♥♥. The enemies vary their attacks to a quick jab, to a haymaker type punch; hard to time this ♥♥♥♥, but then again, that's just me. They also done away with the life bar; basically, three hits and you're dead.   I preferred more an action based game, not...what ever this is.

You can try to put lipstick on a pig all you want, this game is decidedly medicore. The old tank like controls for RE aren't the least bit compelling without a decent atmosphere to help it along. The optimization attempt during the conversion from a portable platform (Nintendo 3DS) to PC is laughably substandard. It looks like middle-gen PS2 game at best.   I realize that plot and dialogue (Yay for Jessica's 'sweet ♥♥♥!') have never been the priority for any RE games, but in Revelations, it's comically absurd and don't get me started and the laughably bad character designs. The gameplay and level design are just so bland. Again, this was ported from a portable platform and Capcom did little to hide it. The limitations show at all times.  I get where Capcom was trying to go with this in trying to satisfy RE fans, but this feels more like a mockery than fan service. This game probably should have remained on portables unless Capcom was willing to port this to the PC correctly.",

I have played it for ten hours and I am bored now. I have no motivation even to finish it to see what the story is. I will most likely drag myself through to the end though.  It started OK though. I liked the enemies a lot, because they were properly freaky; weird things that look like they can not see. However it soon became apparent there was a nasty stuttery bug. Every ten seconds the RER freezes for half-a-second, to a second, and it happens right through the game. No fix for it online. (Only a fix for it in RER2.)  Secondly, the graphics are weak for a 2012 release. They would have been average in 2006. There is not one 'stop to look at the graphics moment' ever. Not only are the textures poor, but there is not one image of anything worth looking at. Regardless of graphics detail. Everything is just average.  Initially though I was loving it. The game moved on quite quickly, because I was not getting stuck much, or dying over and over. I put aside my negative feelings and played. However as time went on I realised the entire map was just being re-used, endlessly. In other words it should be called Resident Evil Backtracking. It's a maze too.  By about 7 hours play I was bored and I was hoping it was going to end soon. Then I was hoping it would end now. At ten hours I thought I had beaten the last boss - great. Nope, there was a filler in, which took me back to a previously used map, and had me slowly moving around it.   Pap pap pap goes the pistol. The gun that you always avoid in games. They make you use it lots. Really there is nothing more to latch onto, to remain interested.  The good points are some of the enemies, the atmosphere intially, and the fact you don't die too often.",

Thankfully this could be fixed by the 'Widescreen Fixer' application.  Beyond that what you have here is a very stripped down Resident Evil experience. While it has some control refinements over, say, RE4, its been vastly improved upon by it's sequel, Revelations 2. I say jump to that game and just watch summary videos of this one, if you must. There's absolutely no one online here anyway, so the raid mode is a bust. Its my opinion that the franchise hasn't had a plot worth following past RE3, but even if you disagree, I think anyone can tell this is shaped up to be an afterthought from the core series. I wouldn't pay more than a few bucks for this.  They did their best with the PC port, in that the videos are HD quality, and the textures, frame rate, models, etc are all as good as one could hope coming from the 3DS.

I am a big Resident Evil fan, although I must admit I favor the classic style of RE(1-3, CV, Remake, 0) to the newer ones (4,5, 6). However, despite that I still am capable of liking the new style of RE games because RE 4 is one of my favorite games of all time.   Revelations, I feel tries to mix the two together somewhat. Certain points of the game where you play as Jill, mostly the earlier chapters in the game, you get a sense of classic RE elements (minus tank controls in favor of the over the shoulder style) such as finding keys for certain doors, 'puzzles', tight corridors and dodging. Ect. However its very dumbed down in a way, and the 'puzzles' I speak of are all the same puzzle basically. I appreciate it nontheless, but sadly after midwayish into the game, it mostly loses this type of gameplay it felt like and favored a more linear style.   At other times the game has these boring shooting/'action' sessions that just drag on sometimes. It seems anytime you're not playing as Jill, the game is just simply lackluster and generic. Sessions where you shoot what seems like a million hunters can drag on at times. (Despite all episode 'parts' being pretty short in all honesty') They aren't fun at all.   I played on normal difficulty and it wasn't that hard of a game to me in all honesty. Lots of ammo, health, ect ect. However they do add harder difficulties which is also appreciated.   A positive thing that comes to mind, is a couple of the 'bosses' in this game I found to be pretty creepy and scary. Which is sort of odd for Resident Evil, as most of the time the bosses come across as 'scary, but mostly threatining' rather than having a super 'Creepy' aspect to them. 2 bosses in particular I feel were pretty creepy, and they did a good job to set the tone with them. Other than those two bosses, the game really isn't that scary and honestly there are a few, but not a whole lot of jump scares surprisingly.   Overall, the game was worth the playthrough for certain chapters, but some were just lackluster. This game is very average to play on PC. Now as this game was originally a 3DS game though, not bad for a 3DS game from 2012. Overall I would 5.5/10. So I recondmend only if you're into the RE series.",

The fact that the HD version came out after the sixth installment is what makes it seem better than it actually is, because frankly anything is better than Resident Evil 6,  The setting is appropriate for a horror game, having been explored previously in the series with Resident Evil Gaiden and Resident Evil Dead Aim. One cannot criticize this story without doing so for the other games in the series because it's just as silly as the previous games, albeit without any of the charming character of Resident Evil 1 or 4 (both directed by Shinji Mikami, coincidentally).  It's a shame that they had to complicate such a simple story by going back and forth in time making the player control a variety of characters, most of them unecessary, a consequence of Capcom's decision to incorporate co-op or AI partner all the time. What ends up happening is that you have lots of names, throwaway characters and a breaking of pace as a result of playing out irrelevant events in the story (playing as Chris in a boat to show him boarding the cruise ship for instance).  The gameplay is a step forward from Resident Evil 5, and a more sober affair than the mess that is Resident Evil 6's combat system. You move and shoot/stab and can occasionally stun an enemy to perform a high powered physical attack, which is satisfying. Less so are some of the enemies with instant death kills, which are a little cheap, but it's nothing new for the series. The gameplay does become tiring though, because the enemies are designed as bullet sponges and are very repetitive. That's not to say the zombies in the previous games are not, but they were shorter experiences as well. Thankfully, the quick time events from RE4 and RE5 take a break in the game, being relegated to escaping an enemy's grasp and turning valves.  Being originally a 3DS game, some of the geometry and facial expressions do look a bit basic, and some of the textures are not up to PS3/360/PC standards, but it's not a bad looking game, it looks on par with early generation graphics. It's certainly well optimized and runs better than Resident Evil 4 Ultimate, which is mind boggling.  The difficulty of the game is balanced, but with some spikes that detract from the TV series approach and pace of it, namely in the boss battles that can be quite infuriating in the first tries. The Infernal difficulty mode is different from RE5's Professional mode but just as silly. Instead of overpowered attackers, the enemies become even bigger bullet sponges, turning the game into a brick wall, though it softens as one progresses and gets better gear. It's a far cry from the challenging but fair Real Survival Mode of the 2002 remake, it's just pulling the bars to make it as unbalanced as it can be. To add to the longevity is the Raid Mode, which is a worse time waster than Mercenaries because it features levelling and each level takes way longer to complete, and the difficulty ramps up to where you need to grind quite a bit through the ship you're already sick of traversing and the enemies you're already sick of fighting from the campaign.  It's a better game than what came after, and does many things better than Resident Evil 5, but it lacks character and importance in the overall series. For a game that's called Revelations, removing it from the story arch does no difference at all and makes it an entry that can fade to obscurity.",

The logic to the game is like that of an that of the Expendables movie. Don't get me wrong howerver. I like the Expendables but this game tries to take itself to seriously by being 'survival horror'. The game had me scared at first but that quickly wore off as the story got more and more absurd . The gameplay is mediocre at best and is harmed by the fact that it was once a 3DS game. Environments and enimies are repeated way to often thoughout and the game and gameplay is slowed down with lazy and blunt progresson blocks. That prevent the player from advancing and artificially lengthens the game. The real only positives I can give are the breaking up of gameplay into segments with diferent characters stories and other events. The other positive is Jill Valentine's great ♥♥♥. =P   Clickbait/10",

It was nice to see that they used the scanner thingy to make you look scan all corners looking for hidden items. Raid mode basically lets you replay the story levels, except you just have to rush through killing everything in your path and scoring points to level up. Nevertheless an enjoyable mode.  So all in all this is a pretty enjoyable game, just don't expect an amazing story and get ready for some awful dialogue. But the best part about this game is probably Jill's butt, so buy it for the booty.",

However the price USD49.99 for the game would be kinda high, I would suggest buying it during promotion period for a cheaper price as I dont think it would be valuable for a price like that. Resident Evil 6 that has 4 campaigns and more contents only costed USD39.99. (Of course it wasn't better than REE).

However, as a fan of the RE, I still pre-purchased it before the day it was released. Thank god, I felt really satisfied by the first time I played the game. The atmosphere it created in the story mode was similar to the one in the old RE , suddenly, it reminded me of the day I play RE 3 with my best friend in Primary school....Tears really burst out at that moment.....The story of this RER is also good and reasonable, it perfectly complements the blank between RE4 and RE5, so we can know about the origin of the anti-Bioterrorism organinzation BSAA. Although this game's story mode is awsome, it still has some shortages. It doesn't inherit the Gun-carrying system from the RE5 and I take that as a great pity. Because it will make the game more realistic when the characters carry the gun they don't use on their back. It feels weird when i see the characters grap their gun from the air.

That being said, this game has it's drawbacks. It was designed for a handheld, and thus it feels like some of the events are a little campy or basic because of the limitations of the hardware. On top of that, the campaign felt like it just kept trailing you on. The story isn't anything to write home about, it's about as well written as a soap oprea, which is standard for Resident Evil.  The campaign felt like it would be a bit better to explore it with a friend. The enviornments were well done, but sometimes you backtracked through areas multiple times. Ammo was either way too pleantiful or not pleantiful enough, and I never found the rifle on my first playthrough.

The game itself was surprisingly decent. I had a whole lot of fun with it and a little piece of advice, the game plays way better with the Keyboard + Mouse scheme (a word of advice though, disable the mouse acceleration though!). With the XB360 gamepad, the aiming was all jerky and you end up missing so many shots.  As for the game itself, it was so much superior to the pathetic Resident Evil 6 which in my opinion was one of the worse RE game ever made. But this one, RE: Revelations, redeemed itself well enough in its atmosphere setting, the gameplay mechanics, voice acting and even the music department.  To make it short, this is the game RE6 should have been but wasn't unfortunately!  For a ported game, the only big noticeable CON would be the graphical and visual side of the game.  PROS:  +Ghost ship horror atmosphere. +Decent campaign length. +Neat characters models (well modelized, especialy Jill's Azz!). +'Auto-sufficient' A.I. (partner manage itself so no need to run at him/her to heal). +Nice soundtrack. +Replay value with the Raid Mode or if you seek achievements completion.  CONS: -Awful textures. -Weak controls with XB360 gamepad. -Messy story. -Weak A.I. but helpful at times as it brings the enemies to itself. -Limited enemy variety (same monsters that you see all game long). -No chapter replay option in the main campaign. -You cannot run... like, what the hell is that? -No puzzles. -This is no 'survival horror' game like we used to play on the early RE games and keeps the game into the 'action horror shooter' mode.   RECOMMENDATION: Decent port to say the least! If you're a Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy this game for sure! If you're a new comer, you may want to play earlier titles since you'll be really lost in this game, story speaking!  PS. The extra DLC doesn't add much to the gameplay. If you can skip it, do so! It is not really worth it in my opinion!  RATING: 7.5 / 10",

With 1-2 to players, the heroes trek through levels and fight off against foes with set levels, and extra buffs (ie. stronger attacks, take less damage, etc.) You will level up, unlocking more weapons, mods, and upgrades for yourself.

I found myself feeling nostalgic when I met the immortal zombie and was reminded of Lisa Trevor from RE1, it came off as a nod/wink to older fans (at least to me). Honestly this is a step in the right direction for the franchise, I would recommend getting it while its on sale.",

Raid mode is the only thing that is coop and it plays through the exact same levels as the single player just with the story stripped out and more enemies tossed in. But in order to play Raid mode in the fullest, you have to complete the single player - both players.... Normally I would be fine with that, but not all my friends have the time to play the single player and just want to play coop.   Besides that as my major complaint, the game is pretty good. I think RE6 is a better buy for coop though. This game has RPG elements that add a lot of replay value. Your character levels up as you progress in Raid mode. Even as you level up, the stages will level with you keeping the challenge all the way up to level 50. If you enjoy coop, zombies that really are not zombies, and RPG games, grab this. Just be aware if you want to play coop, you have to beat the campaign first.",

I see myself as a Resident Evil fan, so it is not like I'm hating this series or it's makers, just this one particular game out of the whole series is the worst in my opinion.  If you wanna buy it, first download it from torrents and see for yourself if you can enjoy it's gameplay, [they have changed a lot in my taste] and then buy an original copy. I haven't done that, and shhhhame on me for not doing so. They even didn't bother in making a good PC port, just ripped it from whatever console it originaly has been made for and put on PCs to get more money from players. Damn you Capcom",

            "review_text": "I don't have much play time on the PC version, but I did play through this entire game on my 3DS and played a large portion of the online before the HD version was released. Capcom, THIS is a Resident Evil game done right. To be fair though, I didn't mind RE6, or even ORC for that matter, but I'm probably in the minority here. Anyway, all the stuff that a fan of classic resident evil wants is here: excellent pacing, horrific tension, limited supplies (kind of) and all the cheesy dialogue the writers at Capcom could shove in here. I say kind of limited supplies, because you're given a scanner-gun very early on that allows you to scan enemies to create Green Herbs. The way it works though, is that if an enemy is already dead and you go to scan them, you'll get a minimal amount of points towards your herbage. If you scan a still-living enemy you'll get a load more points. You can also use the scanner to find handprints (RE games always have collectibles and, uh, this is it?) and secret pick-ups.  The gameplay is pretty much the same from RE4, but it's obviously a little bit more up to date. It feels familiar but fresh. The game also allows you to choose between aiming in first, or third person. I played with the first person aim and loved it. Give it a shot if you haven't, it's a whole different experience. The story was pretty solid, for a fairly cheesy one. And I personally enjoyed all the nods/references to Dante Alighieri's Divina Comedia which I myself have read and very much enjoyed. However, that mission with the 2 random dudes that hold absolutely no weight whatsoever in the story? Kinda felt like padding, and it takes away from the almost perfect pacing of the game. I didn't mind switching between multiple protagonists, but those 2 goons were just, well, goons. The game also has a co-op mode that I had put a handful of hours into. It's fun with strangers but even more fun with friends. It feels very different from the single player in the sense that enemies now have a health-bar, and power levels. If you've ever played Borderlands you'll get the grasp of it very quickly. There are tons of different guns to collect, including super rare/unique weapons. You can also modify your weapons with a plethora of different parts in single player and in Co-op. Definitely pick up this game if you're an old fan of the series, but if you're new and looking for a solid entry point, go with RE4. And if you're interested in playing RE4 and aren't a graphics nazi, I highly recommend the Wii version. Best controls of all the versions I've played.",

For a decent sale price pick the game up if your a fan but Co-op mode isn't a run through of the Campagin which is boring and flat.

The whole point of the game: You looked into the camera, found ammunition with the help of this camera. If there is an enemy - analyzed the enemy, received a cent for receiving the medications, shot the enemy. The end.   Your A. I. partner in single player, on the level of boots with eyes. Help absolutely no, infinite ammo, invulnerability and a long response to opponents.   The story is really boring. The developers apparently tried to make the twists and turns and an intricate storyline, but in the end, decided to just suck it up.   The level design is terrible. It does not return to the atmosphere of the first 4 parts and not trying to hold in tension. Monotonous locations in which it is possible to predict who and where will come out. The soundtrack sucked. Again, not attached to insecurity, loneliness and despair.  Boss battles are just ridiculous. 'We'll just do the soundtrack, which we think will sound epic and players will love it.'   Speaking of enemies. Who am I fighting? Why are my enemies this shellfish-the inbetweeners, some fatties with bone circular saws, similar to large polyps? Secure shell lizard men with eviscerated entrails? What the hell? Where are the good old zombies? Where mutated animals? Where biological weapons is terrifies, not make to spit at the screen in disgust?   This stupid new camera. How it detects the ammo? Why it does not display information about the weaknesses of the opponent? Where is my inventory? Instead, the bottomless pockets adds three weapons and ammo for 700-800 rounds? It's all very 'complicated' game. System Dodge nightmare. It works from time to time. Alteration hand-to-hand combat, also makes a note of idiocy in the game. Why do I have to hold the button? What do my characters while I hold the button? Accumulate power for hitting? Click 'X' at a time when your scale superkick filled... if before, I could shoot obvious weak point, for example in the knee and was able to finish his melee attack. Now, I need to harrass him, shoot him all the limbs and only then, will I be able to finish it... Like, a melee attack was done to save bullets, and not vice versa?  Mode 'RAID' is just the height of idiocy. If used, the mode 'Mercenaries' contributed to the rivalry between friends, the interest to obtain the best results alone, tense fights against crowds of enemies and mini bosses, the current 'RAID' is boring, uninteresting continuation of a corridor shooter we've seen in the storyline. Stupid sweep locations, search medals the experience and attempt not to die of boredom releasing 4-5 clips at the enemy a couple levels higher than you.  So what we have, or rather do NOT HAVE this miscarriage of the series Resident evil?  Storyline. Boring, monotonous and quickly.   Atmosphere. At first it seems interesting, but the absence of a coherent soundtrack, boring level design, stupid enemies, disappointedly forced to cover his face with his hand.  Gameplay . It seems to be okay and that operation converted under the keyboard and almost does not feel the port from the console, but the modified system of unarmed combat, Dodge irritate.   Artificial intelligence. It simply does not exist for a partner in a single game, and for the opponents.  And what do we have?   A bunch of suits, for which the developers require money for a DLC.  My assessment of the game 2 of 10. Thank Cthulhu, I didn't buy Pak with costumes. The game is not worth the money, but if you bought the full pack... Then congratulations, you have been fooled",

But Resident Evil Revelations was the first one I managed to play through its end.   Dividing story into chapters keeps the dynamic flow. And even though the story isn't anything special seeing it from different perspectives and timelines creates the illusion which makes it less dull and fun to watch. Despite the fact that majority of the game takes place at one ship, I had hard time remember where I want to come back, the map (basically location layout) in these situations isn't very helpful.  Everything is plentyful, ammo, herbs, grenades. I believe the transition towards more action oriented experience happend with Resident Evil 5, so no big surprise here. Weapons aren't very fun to use and some of them are basically useless (sniper rifle?). And while the ship chapters have some atmosphere it's immidietly killed with goofy intermezzos with Keith and Quint.   The biggest positive is probably that's really good port unlike Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD. I hadn't encountered anything annoying or uncomfortable.   It is OK game, it won't offend you but it won't blow you off either.",
