            "review_text": "Excellent game with high replayability. One of my all time favorites. Still, I'll be honest and list the flaws. First, the level editor is nowhere near as intuitive as Neverwinter Nights, but given that these days a prepackaged editor is rare enough as is, I suppose I shouldn't complain. Awakenings is buggy as hell and Witch Hunt is far too short, although I rather liked Ariane and Finn as companions. The 'hard choice' at the end of Origins feels contrived to me, although I can't really get into why without spoilers. For what it's worth, I highly recommend the Dragon Age Redesigned and Improved Atmosphere mods. Also, there is a mod avaliable to skip the Fade. You'll probably want to install that after the first playthrough.   Still an excellent game, and you should buy it before Dragon Age Inquisition comes out. From what I've heard, you'll also probably want to skip DA2.",

            "review_text": "Dragon Age origins was No 1 and the best .... an absolutely brilliant game!  Six character backgrounds to choose to start with and all could be played through for the whole game. Several vastly different endings depending on choices made through the game. Fantastic and witty dialogue with all your companions that you were able to take with you on your adventure. Interactions between the companions that you had with you at random event places. Love scenes with characters that you had started to have a relationship with .... which needed to be be done slowly and well over a long time being aware of three way jealousies and confrontations with other companions.... Brilliantly worked out!   Massive Boss battles ... an AI system where you could set up how your companions would automatically react when certain conditions are met. Tough battles that you needed to be strategic about to survive... with a combination of four possible followers fighting with you and needing all the skills of magic, rogue and fighter to make it past all areas.  DA Origins had an expansion called Awakening to which you could take a save file from Origins to take you into it ... and you needed to as the enemies in Awakening were at that level and a new game started at awakening started with the same gear you would have had in Origins. So anyone wanting to battle level 30 enemies with a rusty dagger and a robe.... good luck.   The Awakening was a good addition a couple of your companions made the trip and could join you if you did all the right things. Certainly it is a smaller game than origins and a different one. But a worthy addition using the same game structure and similar dialogue ... although not as good as origins.  The Dragon Age 2 game actually doesn't really have anything to do with the first. Some of the lore is the same ... and from some of the decisions you made in DA O will be represented in some vague background stories. The dialogue was tweaked further but is became convoluted ... but none of the characters really felt like someone I could relate to.  DA 2 had three chapters I completed the first and after 5 -6 tries eventually defeated the massive boss battle in the deep roads against the ARW (Ancient Rock Wraith) This battle was immense!   For that the resulting Treasure was a major Disappointment!!!! I had played as a mage up to that point and the robe in the treasure wasn't much different than anything previously. The only character who had decent armor was the dwarf (narrator of the game when cut scenes happened) who's Armor leveled as he did ... so you would think this dwarf was the protagonist. Then you supposedly won a massive income from your trip into the deep roads such that you bought a house for your self and your companions ... (that I didn't care about) but had no money left, to even buy potions.   The only part of DA 2 that I did like was the combat! How they had you fight numerous enemies and the way spells and melee attacks worked was great. But hopeless story and characters that I couldn't care about .... and nothing to do with DA Origins at all very disappointing.",

            "review_text": "I originally owned this on a console, so really my time with this game is close to 1000 hours I would think. After all that time, I have 3 conclusions:  1. Mages are OP, whether as NPCs, teammates, or your own character (probably most so as your own character)...but isn't that what magic is supposed to be?  2. Swooping is bad.  3. This is one of the best RPGs of all time. The writing, characters, gameplay, pacing, customization...everything, is just top notch. This is BioWare at its finest. Plus, after all this time and so many playthroughs, I still get surprised by funny banter between party members I had previously never really paired up before, such as this gem from my last playthru:    Shale: So here is a question for the painted elf...  Zevran: Painted elf? Oh, that's me! I do like that.  Shale: Am I to understand correctly that the painted elf is a 'crow'?  Zevran: Not literally, but... yes. I am a Crow.  Shale: As in a bird.  Zevran: Is there another sort?  Shale: So the painted elf assaults helpless statuary with its feces?  Zevran: If given sufficient cause, why not?  Shale: That is outrageous! The painted elf will stay away from me. Or else.  Zevran: (Sighs) I get a lot of that.    +Epic story with rich lore. +Awesome characters all around. +Multiple origins and endings keep things interesting with a new playthrough. +So much replayability +Requires actual strategy to your team building to not get massacred at key points. +Unlike so many other RPGs today, you actually do start to feel stronger and more heroic as the game progresses, but it still stays challenging.  +Awakening expansion is nearly as good as the main game  -General BioWare RPG gripe: it's always pretty lame how you so easily get wrapped up into awkward, immersion breaking conversations because of how the romance system works. Namely, unless you're mean to--or outright ignore--a romanceable party member, they're going to fall in love with you. -Minor gripe: wish there was a sell junk button in the PC version (but I'm sure there is a mod for that). -No griffons.  Even if the combat style is not quite your thing, you would be remiss to skip such an expertly-crafted game.",

            "review_text": "So in 2009, Bioware decided to return to its roots of making RPGs in the vein of Baldur's Gate with Dragon Age: Origins. What resulted is a very engaging and thrilling tale of a band of misfits that come together to defeat the evil Darkspawn and their leader, the Archdemon. I wholeheartedly can recommend it.  The story of Dragon Age is a pretty good one, with a good mix of political intrigue and dark fantasy themes. There is some really expansive lore in this game available for you to read in the codex, which would take you hours to read. I assure you, however, that reading all of it is worth it.  The party members are all unique characters, and well-written. Some would say a few are weaker than others as far as being interesting (looking at you, Sten), but they all have decent backstories and are really fun to hear banter between each other. That's another thing; the party banter is hilarious and worth stopping to listen to.  The combat in this game is beyond thrilling. You can pause combat at any time to issue orders to your four-member party, and after unpausing they will act out the order. You can play the game either in third-person or an isometric view. I prefer the isometric for tactical reasons and for that classic Baldur's Gate/Planescape feel. You can also set up tactics for your party members so that they will use certain items/abilities when a condition is met. This can get as in-depth as you like, and its one of the coolest features of the game in my humble opinion.  Graphically, the game doesn't look too bad for how old it is already, but there are texture mods to spice it up, if you're interested. Be aware, however, that this could cause stuterring due to the game engine not really liking textures being TOO large. Otherwise, the graphics are servicable, but nothing to write home about. I don't really care about them, but its up to you to decide whether or not they bother you.  tl;dr Dragon Age: Origins is a return to form for Bioware RPGs and a great 100-or-so-hour romp for RPG nerds like myself. Buy it if you want to experience one of the better games to come out in recent years. Its worth it. Good story, good characters, great game.",

            "review_text": "Dragon Age was my first real experience with a computer game. I saw someone else playing it and wanted to give it a go. I ended up buying a PS3 and the game on console and played it through from start to finish twice (that's over 200 hours of playtime right there). Starting an Origins game is a bit of commitment, often I lose track of what I was planning for a character if I stop playing them for a while, so I start over. Rinse and repeat.  At the time I can genuinely say that this game changed my life. How it holds up now is a bit harder to say for sure. I find the combat slow (which was great when I had never played a combat game before) and in fact the whole game is a bit on the slow side by today's standards, but if you can get past older graphics and a slow pace, I recommend giving it a go. Especially, when you can buy the whole lot on sale for so little.  It has romance, humour, friendship, betrayal and so much more. The lore of the Dragon Age universe is deep and there is plenty to read if you're interested in a world with a lot of depth. The main story arc remains the same no matter what you do - for the most part - but you can surely mess with a lot of people's lives along the way, including your own followers. Will they find happiness? Love? A horrible death? Sometimes they will even break  your  heart.  Also, there are 6 totally different starts to the game depending largely on race and class. If you find starting the game as a human noble a bit boring, try being a circle mage or a dwarven commoner or dwarven royalty or a city elf or a dalish elf. Each start is different. You will find yourself in a different location with a different tragedy establishing who you are. A few hours in all the stories converge to the main story arc, but you will never forget where you came from and where it placed you in the world. No amount of 'this is your backstory' can have the impact of experiencing it.   Even better is that you can import your save game into DA2 or use the Dragon Age Keep to recreate (or rewrite) your story for Inquisition and the choices you made will change both of those games in many small ways! You can have a continuous history over all three games. It's a beautiful thing.  As for the content packs, some have more in them than others. One of my favourites is The Darkspawn Chronicles. Have you ever wondered how the final battle of a game would go if you were playing as the enemy? It was awful, having to defeat my own beloved companions in the final battle, but also really interesting. There were cutscenes and all. I may have even cried a little.  Awakenings starts to move more into the style of Dragon Age 2 and introduces a very important character or two. It's a fairly substantial bit of extra content, maybe 20 hours from memory?  All the way back then, I would have given the game 9.9 out of 10, now... it's still a great game if you can get into it, a classic even, but it's dated. Of course it is.  If you have never tried a combat game before, but want to start playing combat games? You couldn't get a much easier introduction as you can pause combat (in all the DA games) and apply tactics - or just catch your breath. Difficulty can be ramped up if you want a challenge or right down if you want a cakewalk.   Made me think, made me laugh, broke my heart, changed my life.   On PC there are also plenty of modding options, Nexus mods has over 2000 files. I never really modded Origins due to playing it primarily on console, but I like the idea.",

And yet, this game is captivating. My first run i completed playing all the time, sitting there til late (or early, looking at it other way) hours, unable to leave Ferelden and telling myself 'wow, just one more quest, and then talk with that character, and...'. And now i have completed the main story around 6 times, plus a couple of runs of awakening and other extensions. Had just as much fun every time.  Having both a captivating plot and good gameplay, DAO is a good choice for both people who are story oriented and gameplay oriented. If you arent very good at games (like me), easy setting is there for you and you can complete the game fairly easy. If you are up for a challenge, you have harder settings too.  What is important for me in Origins are characters. They feel so alive and make you feel you are a part of the game. Even side characters or villains are interesting and captivating. At first i didnt expect to love so many characters, but there i am, hoping more of them would be romanceable...  Customization of your character is rather well too, although it could be better. Nothing you cant fix with mods - theres plenty of them, whatever you may need.  Graphics are obviously slighly outdated, though personally i prefer them more than the wow-so-hd graphics in newest games, but thats just my preference. Locations are nice to look at, though.  The best part is probably how much your choices change the game - maybe not exactly all of them turn it around, but i think that many small remarks showing how much changes depending who you play or what you have done are nicer. Not to say that there arent many important decisions - you can decide fate of your companions, more or less, decide who is going to be crowned and many other things that are probably spoilers.   tl;dr: give DAO a shot. There is a reason why DA games got popular.",

            "review_text": "This is the perfect game for anyone who likes tactical games as well as in-depth RPGs and especially for those who like romances and of course, especially for someone who like all three.   The battles allow you to pause and give all of your party members orders, such as telling them to move to a certain position on the field or to use a certain skill in battle. Among other things, you can also place traps and use poisons or other items to exploit certain weaknesses. At first, combat may be a little difficult with getting used to the controls and such but it then gets a little easier, to the point you can play without pausing but be warned - the difficulty does go up again soon afterwards, there are many battles you won't win without pausing and thinking about how your party should be reacting to the situation. * You can also set automated tactics for each party member, including your own character, for when you're not controlling them.  This is the type of game that actually gets you interested in the lore around it - I know I personally have issues getting into the lore in a lot of games, but it just kind of sucked me in. The world feels so complete that you'll want to learn everything you can. As far as RPG goes, you play a silent protagonist of your choice (several different options, such as a run away bride or a nobleman) and make decisions that will impact your entire game, as well as Dragon Age 2 if you choose to play that as well. There are three or four main endings but keep in mind they are all of a similar premise so do not expect something like one of the alternate Silent Hill endings with aliens.  The characters are extremely engaging and varied in personality. They even react uniquely to each other - some hating or liking others. You get to see these reactions either in the form of banter while traveling, as an aside when you're having a conversation with another character in public(wandering) or even with certain character combinations in scenes. It is also possible to somewhat shape their personalities to the extent of continuing to be who they are or becoming 'stronger' socially.  As far as romance goes, you'll have three choices per character. Two opposite gender characters and one same sex, with only one of the opposite gender characters changing per your gender, so that's two male and one female for a female character and two female and one male for a male character. Each of these romances are quite deep and you see significant character development, possible more-so of three of the four though. The main two gender-locked romances will affect the story the most if you continue them to the end of the game. One thing to note, is that the romances suffer from sex as a sort of finale, and only the two main gender-locked relationships will continue story-wise afterwards. The other two do not end, but do not have anymore significant scenes.  Overall, a fantastic game that'll keep you entertained for days. I've done two complete playthroughs so far and am going to get all the achievements and then play a few more playthroughs - totally not tired of this game! Each playthrough is interesting and generally unique.",

I would say one of my favourite games ever. At first you choose between 3 races - humans, elfs, dwarves and then between 3 classes. Afterwards you get to pick an origin. The six various origins make you start the game at various places and this adds to the roleplay element. Eventually all origin stories continue into the main story at Ostagar, but even after that your origin affects how NPCs react to your character. The main campaign has that epic quest feeling to it and I cannot say much without spoiling. The main premise is a darkspawn invasion led by the archdemon and you are the last hope to stop it. On your way you will pick up companions and solve various side quests ... or you won't, it's your choice. Either way there is a huge amount of content here that will get you playing for many many many hours. That is even expanded upon by the expansion Awakening, DLC Golems of Amgarrak and DLC Witch Hunt ... all of these can share 1 character that you import from the main campaign. The mod support is really really good in this game. It is easy to get into and even I made a mod and helped on some others. This support is a bit worse in DA2 and basically non-existant in DA:Inquisition. And that is a shame because mod support is one of the things that keeps games alive very long and bolsters the fandom around the game itself. The graphics are not as pretty as newer DA games but it still has a certain old RPG charm. And mods can fix a lot of the character models in the game or adjust the look to your liking. EA involvement was already visible here with 2 DLC missions and a DLC companion on game release. Despite that, the DLC feel fun for the most part. I could go on about every campaign and mission available here but it is too much and all you REALLY need to know is that the majority of it is fun and worth playing if you are into RPG games.

The story is phenomenal to say the least, the characters are some of the deepest, well-thought figures in any game I've ever played, and the RPG element allows the player direct decisions on nearly every aspect of the game. When 'epic, fantasy RPG' comes to mind, DA:O is truly the elite in it's class. The Ultimate Edition is no exception, great price for value.  I'm a long time console player with probably several hundred hours and atleast 5 playthroughs, but I have yet to complete my first playthrough of the game and all the DLC on the PC yet and already have 80+ hours logged. You heard correctly; 80+ hours on one character and I've only completed the base game, Warden's Peak, Stone Prisoner, and Golem's of Amgarrak. I have yet to complete Awakening, Witch Hunt, Leliana's Song, and Darkspawn Invasion. I expect the total hours to be 120+ on one character by the time I have done everything the Ultimate Edition has to offer. Easily one of the best values for dollar per hour spent.  The combat may be the only draw-back to the game. Strategy-wise, it's extremely in-depth and requires much preparation on higher difficulties. Veteran MMO players will feel right at home. However the visuals are lacking (keeping in mind the date of release) and the whole system isn't very 'exhilarating', though you'll feel the occasional rush during a boss fight. The combat serves its purpose and doesn't really throw any curves; it doesn't add much noteworthy additions to the game, but it certainly does not detract from the piece.  The vanilla game is stellar in itself, but the incorporation of the DA Updater allows easy organization of mods. Mods I've found especially good include textures, re-skins, graphics, combat AI, and combat tactics.  Overall, one of the best modern RPG's in existence. Give it a shot if you haven't, you won't regret it.  10/10",

The combat system is strategic and challenging and playing the PC version means you can easily control the flow of battle with the zoomed out view, allowing you to better plan out your attacks and makes for a more satisfying experience than it's console counterpart. The character customisation is extensive and choosing the origin story really feels as though your character is fleshed out but don't expect too much from the origin story later in game as it only affects minor aspects of the dialogue and unique encounter for each origin.

Dragon Age Awakening was practically a sequel (a short one, but a lot of stand alone games are around the same length).  I hate to compare it to Mass Effect, but I am going to anyway. One thing I noticed on my DA play through was I didn't love the characters the same way I loved the ME characters. I didn't make sure I did all the companion quests, etc and didn't even really feel compelled to romance any of the companions. So in a way for me, the story wasn't as character driven as Mass Effect, if that makes sense, but I still found myself enjoying the overall story arc, combat and world.  The combat took some getting used to. At first I didn't like the pausing mechanic, but I found later as some of the fights got more complicated in terms of positioning ranged players or having a companion change tactics it made it way more fun. The tactics menu was also an awesome idea. Most of the time I went with the default tactics, but found myself slightly modifying them as I went further into the game. Basically the pausing mechanic and being able to change tactics really added to the game in a big way, setting it apart from other action RPGs.  I plan on playing DA2 soon, but I don't own it on Steam unfortunately.",

I remember having problems when originally trying to play the game in 2009 and for some reason it's worse with modern day (2014) hardware.  That aside, DA is a classic. A quick history: BioWare originally gained fame by creating isometric tactical RPGs in the Dungeons and Dragons (Forgotten Realms) setting. I never looked this up, but my guess is that some suit at Hasbro wasn't able to continue that relationship with BioWare (and ultimately Electronic Arts) and so they created their own setting to create a franchise around at or around which became the Dragon Age universe.  In contrast to the High Fantasy themes of Forgotten Realms, the campaign setting of Dragon Age is more Low Fantasy or Dark Fantasy. Magic is to be feared, the mood is dark and gritty, you are surrounded by despair and (to some degree) magic items are a little rare. Also in contrast to any D&amp;D setting, characters do not seem to have direct relationships with gods (or Gods) and do not attain magical powers (i.e. healing) from them. In other words, there are healing schools in magic and no clerics.  Differences in the campaign aside, DA is EXACTLY what you would expect from a BioWare game. You have exactly the same viewpoint and controls as seen in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter. Interactions with NPCs and companions is exactly as you would see in Mass Effect (which is the natural extension of the previously mentioned games).  Lots of replay value is inherent with the different starting areas, different ways in which to approach quests and companions and multiple side quests. However, not NEARLY as much open endness within the world if you are to compare to a Bethesda, Elder Scrolls game. Multiple mods exist to enhance the game as well (check Nexus Mods)  DA is a classic RPG. Whether you like it or not, however, depends on your style of RPG. Obviously it's a single player game. It's not a JRPG. It's not as open as Elder Scrolls. Tactics are of moderate importance within encounters. Lots of scripted (voice acted) dialogue with NPCs with 'some' variation, but in the end moderately rail-roaded.",

Gameplay is great, good stat system with nice equipment amd upgrades etc.   It's really just a great game, getting into the story is effortless.  Plain awesome game. Well worth me buying it on sale. I recommend it to all my friends!  Cons:  You can't jump. But who needs to anyways...",

As the main character, you get to pick your race (human, dwarf, or elf), completely customize your appearence and skill set, and choose between several origin stories (hence the name of the game) for your character. Based on what you choose, NPC's have different reactions towards you. You can also recruit many companions throughout your travels, each packaged with their own backstory and personal quests. The voice acting in the game is pretty amazing. Each companion and major plot line character has a voice that is unique to them and easily recognizable.  Gameplay is great as well. While on easier difficulties, you can take whoever you want with you, click on an enemy, and easily win, it is far more complex on higher difficulties. The game uses a tactics system that makes your companions use their abilities to react to certain conditions. On a high difficulty, it is necessary to balance out your companions abilities and tactics to ensure that you will be ready for even the strongest of enemies. If you don't have good balance or don't plan your battles, you will likely be easily destroyed.  As far as graphics go, I will admit that this game isn't the best looking (but hey, it's five years old now, so it's pretty easy to overlook, and the other aspects of the game more than make up for it). However, Bioware has made this game easily moddable so there are many mods out there that can completely transform this game. I don't even know how many I have installed, but it's a lot!   Overall, this game is just a fantastic RPG with decent graphics, great story, unique characters, amazing voice acting, complex gameplay, and an amazing modding community.

Not only does it look and control better, but there are a ton of awesome mods you can install to improve the game or just add more content. The conversation system is great and really engaging. The story is pretty interesting and theres a ton of lore around it. And the battle system is a good mix between real time action and micromanagement. You can choose to play tactically by pausing the action and planning your attack or you can just run in hacking and slashing.   I could go on for days about how great this game is but honestly If you like RPG games with a lot of loot, a challenge and a great story then you'll love Origins.",

You find companions (like any other Bioware game) and save the world (like any other Bioware game).  The story is intricate and rich because of the numerous options when choosing your origin. You could be a noble dwarf or a city elf or human mage or something like four other options. It's dense in content. While none of the origins are similar, ultimately, your player character is recruited by the Grey Wardens to help fight the upcoming blight and save Ferelden. In your quest, you learn about the blight, what causes, what an archdemon is. You uncover corruption, slay traitors and kill monsters that affect your story. And the numerous choices in the game will certainly affect the story and outcome.  The graphics are pretty good. The most notable aspects being the characters' faces and clothing. What was noticably bland were the textures on most of the environment. It seemed like half the environment had smeared textures. The animation was good though, when running or walking. Even talking, the mouth and lip animation were really close to what was being said.  Uh, yeah. Fantastic game.  9.6/10",

(Well the steam release at least, i'm not going to bother looking up the official release date) And I still play this game... a lot. Despite Dragon Age: Origins spawning 2 sequels, I always find myself coming back to this one. The textures are bad, run speed is slow, combat takes a while to get engaging but this game is irrefutably the best game in the franchise. Gameplay wise it's extremely polish, allowing for multiple builds and adding new depths of difficulty. Every build has advantages and disadvantages, forcing players to think about where their next skill point should be placed. Dialogue is skippable and the choices are clear and concise, making it easy to judge what an NPC's reaction will be to your choice! However this RPG doesn't use a patronizing dialogue wheel that shows you pictures and says, 'This is the NICE option, This is the FUNNY option, This is the MEAN option, This is the option to kill yourself', No, this game knows you're too smart for that and says, 'Here's the choices as to what your character will say, NOW ROLEPLAY', Which is an EXTREMELY welcome change from the all too common 'Choose your prick' gameplay style. - *cough* Dragon age 2 *cough* - Story wise it's engaging , constantly forcing the warden to make critical choices that will ultimately affect the ending. Graphics wise it's not the BEST, it could be way better, but graphics never really mattered to me in the long run, and the UI looks really good. The characters and their animation can get comically bad sometimes, but it never gets ugly- *cough cough* Dragon Age 2 *Unconvincing cough* - and the charcter creator is a lot of fun. (I like making characters, don't judge my life choices, you're not my REAL mom!xD) All in all, Dragon age: Origins is a great game, well worth your time and money.",

But every games has it's faults, the battle and fighting system is very slow paced and boring to take part in (this is something that the second installment fixed) and some classes mainly the mage, dual weapon rouge and/or warrior are quite unbalnced, this is as with a dual weapon user can breeze through a massive amount of eneimies with ease, but the mage will struggle with it's lack of health and resistances (unless you are some sort of god). This is especially clear in the early parts of the game such as the tower of magi where going solo through it can really f**k you up, I myself have become infuriated at the amount of damage (or lack of) a single mage will put out when going through the game, whereas the npc's such as a well equiped zevran and alistair can melt eneimes, and in this alistair will also take zero damage being a tank. This is most apparent with the dlc of DAO as the OP equipment you recieve from it give characters like alistair and zevran a huge powerstrike. (first detailed review plz no hate). Overall a good introduction to the game, where combat lacks story flourishes, the oppisite for DA2, but then brought to a balance of both aspects in the third game DA Inqusition.",

Tip: mages are the best characters to play with, you avoid the frustration of chasing after enemies.  Unlike some other Bioware games [yes, Mass Effect], here it's possible to skip dialouges and cutscenes. Praise the lord for some developers with a good sense of HCI.   The most prominent aspect of this game is the Lore. One way or the other, you'll get hooked with it, it has an incredible amount of details which are given in tiny pieces. It is up to you to reconstruct the truth from dozens of tales, sometime mixing myth with truth and lies. Though you would most likely need to play to the next two games as well too.

            "review_text": "Hi guys, I didn't play this game when it was released, and it clearly was a mistake. This is a classic RPG in every way, and a title any fan of this genre will love.  One particular thing that cought my attention is the incredibly smooth load times between scenes, there are no wait times like there are in other titles (for example Pillars of Eternity), in Dragon Age the engine and the maps load at light speed, which is great to not feel like you are wasting time going from one place to another.  Additionally I'd like to comment some things I would have loved to know beforehand, things I wish others have told me before starting my adventure.  1) First of all, if you have ANY doubt when picking a class. PICK MAGE. It is the most powerful and versatile class by a large margin. Specially considering they can also wear full plate armor with the Arcane Warrior spec. I went through the whole game with two mages in my party (cause I picked rogue as main following some random online advice) and that limited my party choices greatly. Don't get me wrong, rogue was fun, but it is not in the same league as Mage, no other class is.  2) I have read you need to use all party members to play the game properly, that is false. You can do whatever you want and complete the game without issues. You can use the same four characters the whole game or switch between them. You party members will level up automatically if not used (one level lower than your main character).  3) I was hoarding gems the whole game cause I was supposed to use them in the final stages, that was completely unnecessary. I forgot using them and completed the game anyways, so I could have sold all the gems and profit to get better equipment sooner. So it is your choice, but you can do whatever you want and will not be penalized by that decission.  4) I've also read stealing is useless, that is false. What it is, is BORING, but stealing will provide you with a HUGE amount of resources, potions and money. So if you don't mind doing it, you will benefit from it to the point of not needing to purchase a single potion in the entire game.  5) There is no level cap, but I ended the game at level 22. I'm quite thorough tough, so other people might end in a lower level. Plan you skills accordingly but in general you will be able to complete the spec of your choosing.  6) It took me 76 hours of play time to complete the game, not including the expansions, just DAO Ultimate Edition.  Hopefully this will help you make choices in the early game and enjoy the game as it deserves.  This is a great game, can't wait to start Dragon Age II.",

Some might find it ok, or be able to overlook how annoying the whole thing is, especially the targeting. So all in all, I will not recommend this game.  EDIT: Ok, so after a weekend with nothing better to do, I decided to give this game another try, and through nothing but sheer force of will, I actually managed to get used to the horrible, horrible combat mechanics. Sort of. And, truth be told, it was rather entertaining. The world, characters and story as a whole is compelling and well-crafted, definitely living up to my expectations on those fronts. I still wouldn't flat out recommend this game for anyone though; the only circumstance I can imagine it being worth buying, is if you're in it for the story and only that; the combat is still just terrible.",

I have attempted to play through this game 4 times using different classes and builds and it is just too painful to sit through--I actually physically destroyed my first copy in anger. Kept coming back because I heard great things and desperately wanted to like it!  I'll try to break down the game's various qualities as follows:  Story: solid, with some original twists on common themes. Dialog: witty. Atmosphere: way too over-wrought; the grittiness felt tremendously forced and over-the-top. Combat: terrible, terrible, terrible. There are hit detection glitches... In this non-action RPG... That should tell you a LOT. The AI pre-sets are some of the worst in any game unless you spend all of the side characters' skill points in adding more slots--in which case they are barely usable. While you are better off just taking direct control, turn after turn, as frequently as possible, this makes every encounter take a ridiculously long time. Balance: virtually none. Bosses that are easily cleared in one attempt, with random encounters that can crowd-control and wipe your party with literally (and I mean literally not figuratively) nothing you can do about it. Optional encounters with no way to beat them at the time you can potentially discover them. Outrageous disparities in the viability of different weapon styles, skill trees, and attributes. Enemies that level with you, becoming almost exponentially more powerful, while you're still using most of the same gear as you were 4-5 levels ago, and because (insert build here) gets only odd, fringe abilities during that time you haven't obtained any worthwhile combat tricks to keep pace. Character development: mechanically, feels like a poor knock-off of Obsidian's influcence system as seen in KOTOR2 and others. Can be rewarding when it isn't an exercise in Ogre Battle-esque micromanagement. Graphics: good for the time the game was made. Voice acting: decent to great (seems to be a big quality variance here too). Fun factor: zero. I didn't even like the game before it got into Ninja Gaiden levels of frustrating--it was just too clunky, not terribly engaging, and I only felt a marginal need to continue because Allistair is fun to listen to when he bickers with every NPC known to man. Replay value: well, I'd have to have finished this one the first time to call it 'replay'...  I'm not saying this game has no good qualities. I am saying that the negatives vastly outweigh the positives, for anyone that isn't so invested in the story/world setting/characters/game's faux 'maturity factor' that they can overlook them. I cannot overlook failures this catastrophic on a technical level. Sorry (not sorry!), just can't.  When compared to KOTOR, Neverwinter Nights, Jade Empire, or just about anything Black Isle or early Obsidian, this game is really disappointing. Then when put into further perspective by the DA sequels, the debacle that is SWTOR, and the many missteps that Mass Effect made toward the end of the trilogy, I can't help but speculate that BioWare's best years are long, long behind them.",

Lost a big fight, a companion and the start of the next side quest encounter because of a combination of crashes and the fact that it did not autosave when I returned to party camp (aka your home base).   Second, the game's organization and your companions imply that every quest line is open and scales to your character. They don't. While many quests can happen in any order, the core missions have a pretty strict linearity. I had to start the game because I could not complete a quest and get the specialization I was planning to build the character around.  If you can tolerate those problems, then try it.

It is actually quite hard to summarize all the things that this game excells at. It has a great plotline, setting, character interaction, dialogue and sense of adventure. You get drawn into this epic story which actually makes you feel somewhat important and not just a errand boy. The game constantly throws challenges, tough moral choices and options at you. Each decision impacts the game and future outcome. Your companions and the world might react differently to your choices which makes it all feel more immersive and interactive. Furthermore there is so much high quality content in this game to keep you occupied for a long time.  The possibilities seem almost endless at times and this further enhances the replayability to a ridiculous degree. You can customize your character and origin to a great extend, hence the name of the game. Your origins greatly impacts how you are perceived and treated in this game by other characters.  The combat itself might not be for everyone, it's a pausable real-time rpg system where you use various abilities of your party members to overcome enemies. It can feel quite slow paced and uninvolved at times. Although it really opens up when you have rogues and mages in your party which feel far more tactical. Tactics are actually required to a great degree because this game can be tough as nails, it's a challenging experience.  The only downside of this game might be limited loot and equipment that you can obtain. It's quite boring and there is not much choice in that regard. I spent half of the game using the same gear, this could have been improved with a bit more variety. Also sometimes the character animations and dialogues look a bit awkward, but that's a very superficial issue.  Overall you cannot go wrong with this game once you get used to the combat system and the somewhat slow start, you get so much value for such a small price.",

Strange thing to say of a AAA game, perhaps, yet despite its success DA has been often dismissed as 'too classic' and 'dated' in its gameplay and story... but this is missing the point.  Because Dragon Age's  true brilliance  lies in its  writing .   The universe and main story are quite predictable High Fantasy: all was well in the world, elves hunting and dwarves mining and humans farming... but an ancient evil resurfaces, and starts creating corrupted monsters that pillage and taint the land. The lore is not going to blow your mind, yet the relationship between races and civilisations is well rounded, and steers clear of worn archetypes.  While very strategic, and deeply enjoyable, the game's combat is also very traditional, mages-rogues-and-warriors, real-time with a suspended-time strategy overlay, without a lot of innovations. This is actually a good thing, as its mechanics are quick to learn and master, letting you focus on the actual combat. The set of abilities and spells, if less than original, is well balanced and satifying to use. And if some encouters are puprosefully unforgiving, I have never been stuck on unwinnable battles, or have needed to replay a particular battle countless times in order to win.  The universe is deeply detailed, and while not evolving in an open world, the number and variety of quests, encounters and fights will keep you engaged. The main story arc, while a bit telegraphed, is still quite serviceable and fits well into the lore. But you will be more engaged by the secondary quests anyway, which is where the variety of locales, characters and their interaction shines.  To date, no other game has made me care so deeply about its characters. While minor characters are sometimes not too fleshed out, for lack of interactions with the player, primary and secondary characters, and their stories, have received some of the best, most subtle and colorful writing I have seen in a video game. Hatred, love, disdain, humor and passion, changes of mind and of heart between characters (player included) lead to dialogue that always feels appropriate, original, and touching. Romance is here not a gimmick, but a major driving force of the player's emotional involvement.  Because, when Leliana sings for you... you will probably shed a tear.",

A school year, destroyed. My grades, horrific. My social life? Abysmal. But did I beat the Golems of Amgarrak DLC on hard? You bet your nerdy ♥♥♥ I did. Did I create 6+ characters for the sole purpose of exploring the world of Thedas and discovering the different viewpoints and prejudices of characters? Oh sweet Maker, did I. Did I murder a noble's son for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my cousin in my origin story? I killed him and his posse. Like dogs, Shianni.  In short, this game is good. You get into this game. You create your character lovingly (or not so lovingly, I'm looking at you Typhoid Tabris, you modded-out train wreck). One of the only drawbacks I've found is the fact that there aren't as many dragons as you might think with a game that has dragon in the title.   Several friends of mine complained about the combat system (I didn't...until I switched to Skyrim and out of habit pressed the space bar to pause combat and ended up jumping and getting mauled. You don't get to pause combat to look at a situation tactically in Skyrim. You do in Dragon Age). It isn't that hard once you get the hang of it. I mean, aside from the friendly fire option. I can't tell you the sheer amount of times I've set stupid tactics for my warden, gone to control Alistair, and then gotten bombarded in the face with a fire bomb because my warden saw 3+ enemies and bombed herself, the enemy, Alistair, and whatever party member was unfortunate enough to be in range. I mean, you could also just leave the tactics of your party alone and focus on your Warden, but where's the fun in that? (Actually, do that. There's less of a chance of getting a surprise firebomb to the face)  The game is a tad bit long, but ultimately worth it. There are several endings you can get, which is pretty bomb. The dog doesn't die, which is REALLY bomb. I mean, really, how many movies have you seen where the dog karks it and that ruins your entire experience? BE THE DOG. BITE A DRAGON IN THE ♥♥♥. DO IT.  You can choose to romance a companion or you can choose to focus on plot, whatever you prefer. There's also an option as a lady mage to flirt with a templar in your origin story and make him so flustered he runs away from you in full plate. Ah, yes, gold. And then you have the option of romancing that awkward disaster in Dragon Age: Inquisition, which has my friend in fits about how she's more attracted to a pixelated noodle-haired ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than any man she meets in her everyday life. This is the danger you run with Bioware romances. Be warned. Even if I didn't warn HER because misery loves company and I needed to see her life devastated by this series.  The world of Thedas is huge. It's engrossing. You get hilarious conversations about how a certain character was raised by flying dogs from the Anderfels and how another character tried to ride on the sails of a windmill once. It didn't go well. She also once was a tea server in a brothel (the tea was complimentary). But really, play this. Have fun with it. Be a hero. Be an assbutt. Do whatever, just so long as you save Thedas in the end.  And, well, I still have no clue what 'asschabs' are, but that's hardly stopping me.",

As another reviewer recently stated it's a stronger game than recent post-EA BW or the ongoing Bethesda failure to recognize that free-roaming worlds are way more effort than they're worth if you can't keep decisions consequential and interesting. Not that a whole heck of a lot of newer (and some older) gamers out there seem to be bothered by that but for the more discriminating RPG-player, this is one of the good ones that definitely earns its place among classic Interplay and Bioware while still feeling like thoroughly modern game in terms of graphics/UI design, etc... I couldn't be bothered with Fallout 4 personally. This has been occupying my game-time.  Story is quite good. I love the element where you're basically taking one for the fantasy world team. Background stories are a fraction of the content but all are interesting and most involve an element of revenge which was very smart and deeply satisfying in many cases.  Best dog in a western RPG. He powers up by whizzing on trees and other landmarks in a given area. He can find random crap for you. He tackles mages and chews on them. And he does it all with only two pieces of gear. I always name him Spooky.  All the warrior build options are interesting to explore, which is not always the case in FRPGs. Rogues and mages are of course, awesome. I've already rolled a dozen characters and taken at least 6 of them haflway through the game.  Back and forth dialog between companions was on par with classic Fallout 1/2 attention to detail in the dialog. They actually made heavy use of writers. What a concept.  You can be a rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ working your way to the same goal that a paragon of virtue and justice would and it does have gameworld/finale impact in terms of who's left standing to actually help you out in the end.  Issues:  Lol @ rogue/warrior dual-wielder OP. You might want to try that one last or be disappointed by most other options. Seriously, it's pretty much day/night in terms of how much faster the game moves and how much easier the fights get even before you get to the faster attacks mode. You don't need defenses when you pretty much murder everything in seconds. Mages are also stupid-strong.  It's a touch glitchy. I've had the occasonal crash to desktop and I'm definitely noticing a memory leak of some sort when switching characters or when running an all-day-long game marathon. Restarting when switching or every few hours isn't such a horrible price to pay though. Definitely save frequently.",

I played this game sideways (did everything from easter eggs to beating the game) but for finding the full set of anchant elf armor, all combo on magic, lore entries and completing the game with 2 of the class race combo options. So you might believe me when I say, ' The game isn't worth 30 bucks. On sale for half price it is'.  They reworked the game which removed or changed some of the fights in the game. Guess they tried to rebalance it or make it easier. This equals a few less levels for you. When I did Awakenning with my dwarf theif it was pretty much a breeze. So maybe that's why they changed the game. From what little I played they didn't change the story which would've made this game worth squot.",

I currently have an elven mage and a noble 2h based warrior. I love how each story is different.   If you like games where you can choose what to level up, and you can create characters to have the skills/talens/spells you want then this is the type of game for you. The graphics aren't the best in the world but for the time frame it originally came out they are absolutely gorgeious.   My only gripe is my Raptr account for whatever reason won't document the hours played like Steam does. I may try a dwarven rogue or something next haven't quite decided. I also hear the storyline for an elven servant/whatever class you want is really awesome.  I love how different races react to the main characters race, and how dialogues are totally dependent on who you have in your party. A lot of times I will save the game and do sections 2-3 times just to see what people say different or make sure I didn't forget anything. There are even sometimes when like you have a chance for a 'rare item' so you may need to load/save until you get it anyway.  The DLC's is what mkaes this game even better, Shale, the rock golem is probably one of the best characters I have thus far. My main fighting party I am working with is:  -Leliana (DPS Rogue with dual wields - duncan gear at the moment )  -Aedan (2h character, using Callen armor/working on getting the dragon plate series )  -Morrigan (I know this wasn't her original style but I like to lure using Shale so I then throw a lot of firepower with Morrigan afterwards works almost every time! I am also working on raising her constituion/dexterity now that I have her magic/willpower at a reasonable amount for fights )  -Shale - the rock golem he's my tank/and lurer not much else to say about him he just rocks overall...no pun attended haha..  I haven't tried out using traps/potions yet on characters ( of course besides the health/lyrium stuff )   But yes I would reccomend this game without a doubt to any of my friends.",

            "review_text": "Dragon Age: Origins/Awakening is a very story driven game with a lot of voice acting and dialogue set in a medieval/lord of the rings fantasy (type) role play setting. The choices you make as the story goes along impacts the end of the game. Certain choices that a player will be forced to make could result from a party member leaving the group or if it's a bad enough decision with their morals, could even force you to have to kill the character. I'd rate about 40% of the game is dialogue and 60% is exploring/combat. Even while you are exploring there is dialogue going on in the background with party members showing whether they like one another, questioning each other views and motivations or just poking fun at each other. The player also has the option to talk to any of the party members at any time while questing or at cities which will open up a lot of side quests while improving or destroying the relationship with them depending on the choices the player makes with dialogue. To help with this, as you level you are able to put points into a skill called persuade and an attribute stat called cunning to give extra options to either pump more information from party members/NPCs.  The game has a ton of side quests which can add a lot of hours to content. Some of the side quests are obvious, things that you'll find while just generally walking along while others are more obscure, causing you to look every nook and cranny. Obscure as in some do not even show as clickable objects while looking around.  Tactics, programmable attacks for other characters in your group. You have the choice of pausing the game and micromanging each of the characters attacks or going to a general tactics screen and set how each character responds to combat, whether for the character to heal himself or another when he gets to a certain health percentage, to using a stun if the enemy is about to do a certain attack or to just attack the nearest visible target.   Combat was really fun playing as a mage. You sacrifice a lot of health and defense but you get a lot of options to either do gobs of area effect damage, heal and support your team or being a disabler type that can turn a 20 foot ogre throwing small mountains at you into a kitten. With the right spell combinations, enemies will have the time of their life trying to get at you. Only bad thing is that if you go full on area effect damager, friendly fire is an issue with melee type enemies since your group's melee and theirs will always charge each other, I've killed off my entire group before so there is a bit of planning involved. Awakening adds a few more specialties like Battlemage and Warden that allow you to cast area effects without damage party members but at the cost of being in melee range of enemies.  The bad parts of the game with my playthru were that certain spell combinations casted by myself while at the same time the enemy casting at me would crash the game. Also, the game is broken down in zones and in between the 10-12th zone load I could expect a crash as it would take longer and longer after each load. Concering tactics, I don't agree with it's design that tactics should be limited to skill attributes, it heavily hampers the character's growth on what should honestly be an interface function, not a character development function. At the very beginning, you have about 5 different things that you can set teammates to do and to get more you will have to invest their skill points specifically into tactics to open up more programmable attacks/buffs; else, you'll have to frequently pause the game and micromanage their abilities. Doing so though does not allow you to put points that would allow the character to have a tradeskill, be able to steal or with the expansion, have better life/mana/regen.  Overall, I liked the game and am thinking of doing another play thru. The plot was very well done and I had the choice to breeze thru content quickly if I wasn't in the mood for all the extra dialogue as some of the dialogue is optional.",

Graphics looked amazing if turned to max, but on lower end computers, the visuals fail to grasp on the same level, but at not too steep a drop. Graphics - 9/10.    Music is very good. It gives the sense of a wonderful adventure with timing of specific kind of intervals being anounced properly by a musical backdrop. The battle music will give away suprise encounters though. Good for those who like to use it to their advantage, but bad for those who like a suprise to be, well... suprising. Music - 8/10.   The amount of choices one can make for each character can differ greatly. Replay - High.    The controls are just where they should be and easy to pick up and/or be reconfigured to the player's wishes. Controls - 10/10.  The A.I. is where this game really lacked. The enemies were all too predictable. Charge at the tank. Take tank down and charge next strongest player. The enemy rarely ever strays from this besides one small darkspawn trying to flank. If you want this game to be a challenge, turn up the difficulty. The PC A.I. had better set perimeters but still felt clunky. The ability to set their battle chains of command were an improvement but they still felt like they had no idea on how to react. A.I. - 5/10.   Overall, I would place this game at a 8/10.    P.S. If you enjoyed this game try Baldurs Gate. Do not try Dragon Age 2. It only brings disappointment. You have been warned.",

I'd say the only gripes I have with this game are that the characters sometimes move a bit clunky, and there are a few glitches; some gamebreaking! However, if you can get past these few faults, Dragon Age: Origins is an excellent game, especially for the 30$ price-point, in which it also comes with a bonus campaign, and a few DLC areas and missions!

I only have about 10 hours on it so far but I can see easily a hundred more, if not even more than that. The concept is fantastic, the world is gritty, dark, and well written, and the character backstories are fantastic. I started as three different races and classes, Human rogue noble, Elf mage, and Dwarf warrior noble, and so far I can't pick a favorite. The origin stories are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. Now, on to combat. Warrior combat feels visceral and satisfying. Using a two-handed weapon power attack knocks enemies flying back with a satisfying 'crunch', and there is enough animation diversity to give things a really weighty feel. Rogue combat is a little less satisfying. Arrows make a nice 'thunk' sound when they hit, but backstabs are both disappointing and not very useful. There is one canned animation that plays over and over again, and enemies frequently turn to face you, allowing only a few backstabs before they lock onto your player character. This allows nice shenanigans with two rogues, but it's still a little annoying. Mage combat is by far the least satisfying of the three in terms of visuals. While the spell diversity is acceptable, I would have like to have a few more powers really showcasing the power of magic. Projectiles speed lazily towards their targets, reminiscent of the Oblivion Jello-Fireballs. Diversity is nice though, and with points invested in the buff tree I feel really in control of the game. Voice acting is for the most part fantastic, although I tend to get thrown out of the immersion when I hear the more distinctive voices (used for some major characters) used by regular NPCs. I'm shocked at the quality of the PC voice however. The lines spouted out sound as though the equipment used to record them was of noticeably lower quality than the others. I enjoy the visceral nature of combat, but it's a little immersion breaking to have the characters splattered with blood constantly. I wish the NPCs would at least notice; if you're talking to a little boy while covered in blood, it might be a little scary for the kid. In addition, a blood mage destroys his phylactery, then uses his blood to fuel his magic, leaving his opponents covered in it: 'Now we can't find him, as we don't have any of his blood!' WUT. All in all, a fantastic experience. Buy the freaking game. It's usually $5 during a major sale.",

The depth of conversation options, how they effect encounters and the game itself, have always been one of my favorite parts of these games.   Dragon Age Origins is alike the games mentioned above in the aspects of dialogue and is one reason why I enjoyed it so much.   However it is also intertwined with one of the things I hate most about the game: the frequent crashes. There's nothing like going through an important piece of dialogue making numerous choices only to have the game crash in the fight that ensues.   While I am still looking into why the game crashes so much, I have a library of close to 60 games and this is the only title in my collection that I have any issues with. In a 4 hour session the game will crash anywhere from 1-3 times, I have 'gotten lucky' a few sessions and had zero issues. It is still frustrating to make progress, only to have to go over a conversation and handful of fights.   The issues with crashing almost made me not want to recommend the game. But for 7.50$ during the steam sale, I have to suggest you purchase this title. I can easily see myself putting 100+ hours into this game in the future.   If it weren't for the issues, I would easily recommend the game for it's full price of 30$.",

First rule of these games is gameplay before graphics, so let me say that Dragon Age has basically the same system as any D&amp;D related RPGs. It is not complicated if you play other games such as Star Wars: Knights of the old republic, on which I have spent the better part of 200 hours on the original xbox. If you are looking for these qualifications go for this game.",

            "review_text": "Dragon Age is truly an exceptional fantasy RPG series that sets a very high standard with its first installment, Origins. Origins has a fluid storyline, a great deal of customization, and can appeal to gamers that like tactical strikes as well as those who prefer fluid combat (merely change your difficulty setting for one experience or the other). The game is partially open-world, rarely reuses scenery, and features fantastic voice acting, great characterization, the option to build significant relationships with companions, and a stunning soundtrack. The graphics are good for 2009, but pale in comparison to certain other RPG series (e.g. TES: Skyrim). Nevertheless, the game is easily modded, allowing both the nit-picky immersion player and the mod-happy player to customize their visual and game mechanic experience. (The DAO Nexus mod community is still active 5 years after the game's initial release.)  The Ultimate Edition contains all DLCs for DAO, as well as what could be considered Dragon Age 1.5, Awakening. Awakening allows the player to create a new character or to import their character from DAO and explore additional areas of Ferelden and well as further the DA storyline. Although DAO is primarily bug/glitch free, Awakening still has several bugs that Bioware failed to patch, so I recommend saving regularly in case you have to reload an area or questline. Despite this, however, Awakening continues Origins' compelling and engaging storyline and gameplay.  DAO is definitely a game worth playing once. Or again and again as most fans of the series do. As one would expect for a title like 'Origins', you can start the game in a number of unique ways, continously have different playthroughs, make many different decisions, and later import those decisions into Awakening and/or Dragon Age 2 to see the consequences of such actions (like fans of Bioware's Mass Effect series may be familiar with).  Additionally, Dragon Age: Inquistition will be released later this year (Fall 2014), so it's a great time to get into this series with a new installment on the way.",

It is a long game for certain, I would guess 40 hours or longer, one one character. But with 3 classes, 3 specializations each, and 3 races each with usually 2 backgrounds there is a lot of replayability, because a mage will play far differently than a warrior. In addition there are major moral choices and sidings throughout, in preperation for the final battle as you seek to call on the signers of an ancient treaty you will face a dilemma in each situation. Do you (*SPOILERS*) instruct the werewolves to kill of the elvish? Or do you help the keeper end the curse he himself made by killing the werewolves? To gain the victor and potentially lose a companion. (*SPOILER END*) Each branch of quests across the continent are highly emotional and the characters themselves are highly believeable. I do love this game, but there is one part I dont like at all. In fact thats why I havent played in so long. It is the Fade. The dreamworld, where a demon places your whole party in a dream and you must use transformation to navigate the maze as a mouse, fire demon or spirit to free them with a confusing verbal slap to get them to muster themselves. It takes a couple hours, and in my opinion is not much fun.   But that is one minor part of one minor storyline that is otherwise brilliant (Mages revolt against their templars with bloodmagic, but Demons take their chance and break free, overwelming the tower as an army of abominations.) If you enjoyed Baldurs Gate, this combat system is the same. If you enjoy a good story, this game has them. If you love RPGs, classic and non, this is a must.",

            "review_text": "Dragon Age is must have for any RPG fans. Even in 2014 the graphics are still quite up to date if you ask me and the gameplay isn't all that hard to master. Dragon Age requires you to sit down for several hours and explore, talk to companions or strangers, travel the land and ofcourse slay the occasional dragon now and then. What I found suprising about this game is the depth of the characters that you meet troughout the game. The choices that you make (some of them are qutie difficult to make I might add) could have a strong effect on certain characters. Now that we start about choices.. choices.. CHOICES! The game is full of them, right from the very beginning. What will you be? A Mage? Warrior? Rogue? That doesn't even cover the class system, each class gets 4 specializations that can heavily impact the way that you can play. Even without the specializations there's plenty of different stlyes that you can use. For example as a Warrior you can go with; Sword and Shield, Duel-Wield, Two-Handed or Ranged. Each of these 4 different styles offer a different kind of gameplay. To get back on topic, the choices that you make not only impact your companions but they can also alter the world. One of the most important aspects of the game is the Combat System. Personally I just played on the easiest mode, rushed trough enemies without a proper strategy and let my companions sort themselves out. However, if you decide to play on a higher difficulty level you will need to pause the game and think of a proper way to deal with the enemies ahead.  So for those who like real time combat and for those who prefer to take their time and see a strategy work out fine, you'll both be happy with this game. I strongy recommend Dragon Age to people who play games such as The Witcher and The Elder Scrolls. I enjoyed evry minute I put into this game and I get the feeling I'll be playing it for a long time to come.",

Combat is both difficult and rewarding, with freindly fire for spells and almost every encounter with the capabilty to go south fast if strategy is ignored.

The characters and story are still as wonderful and endearing as ever. The graphics are feeling a bit dated - but keep in mind - this game released in 2009, so there are bound to be odd moments. Though, even for its time, I recall that it did hit a spot in Uncanny Valley. That being said, I don;t feel this series was ever well-known for its graphics - just its story and its emphasis on the choices the player makes.  Gameplay is pretty straight-forward for your typicaly high fantasy RPG. Definitely encouragement to do multiple playthroughs, which frankly I've found annoying in most games but not so much this one.  Definitely a game you can get lost in, and this is a great edition to do just that - if not just for the fact that it comes with all of the DLC, as well as the expansion for its game.",

When I started playing I discovered a unique and well-created world with engrossing, unique storylines, open-ended quests that could be done in any order (or in a specific order if you wanted a particular outcome, an easy to manage combat design, and, I save the best for last - the relationships.   Gradually growing closer to your companions is so much more realistic than stomping through exotic locations filled with hostile enemies with complete strangers at your side. Having your choices affect how your companions react to you, to each other and how your choices positively or negatively affect so many other aspects of the game is just a brilliant concept.   Character leveling gives you points to spend in various talent trees that are entirely up to you depending on how you prefer to play - you're not forced into any particular style of party. However, I do reccommend reading up some as it will reveal a lot of plot points, relationship issues and other random things you could miss out on if you don't have at least certain levels of some of the skills/talents.   It reminds a lot me of when I played old school D&amp;D.  While the world is not as open as, say, Skyrim, it is still enough to keep you occupied for hours on end. For the RPGer who is looking for a new twist on an old genre - Dragon Age will not disappoint.",

It's essentially a hybrid of the style of gameplay of Neverwinter Nights 1 and Star Wars Nights of the Old Republic. While I enjoy those games, it can be a chore to plug through them. Dragon Age's combat is less interesting. I found combat breaks down into either auto-attacking or stunning. The more you can stun your enemies, the more powerful you are. This cycle of cutting down mobs is repetitive. Run into a room, aggro the mobs, stun stun stun, win. This is disappointing because of the number of unique character backstories that are available. I can tell that I won't have ambition to replay the game for this reason. This is just my opinion, but I recommend that you take a good look at the game before deciding if its for you.  Despite that, I was very engaged by this game. The story and characters are superb, just as you would expect from a Bioware title. I was propelled from the start to progress in the epic story. Your character feels as if he/she has substantial presence and impact in the world. Very much like Mass Effect in that regard. The game is also enormous, with many branching paths that each take hours to complete. You'll have plenty of content to enjoy. I would say this is Bioware's least polished recent game. I had several bugs and noticed multiple areas of poor or uninspired texturing. There is also frequent reuse of interior environments, such as dungeons and castles. I would have appreciated more visual diversity but given the already enormous 24GB size, I can understand why the developers needed to be conservative.  Overall its another strong title from Bioware, and is a fine reminder of their catalogue of older games.",

I believe this is one of the first games which started the revolution to turn Videogames into something greater. The Gameplay is fun, never boring, with almost perfect statistics calculations, allowing the player a deep character customization. To level up is hard, but never boring, so that once you get a new upgrade, you feel excited to test the new strategy you can do. Through the in-combat pause strategy becomes fundamental, making every battle different, and exciting the player into making the perfect strategy, with his own style.  But as I said this game is more then mere gameplay.  It allows a deep role-play. The player can choose between several races, and origins, so to become the character he wants to.   But above all, the immersion. The story is deep, set in a living world, with its problems and its beauties, and it is in this world that the player will have to act, making important choises that will affect the future, sometimes choises so hard that the player is forced to think deeply about what is right and what evil, and even to grow. Even the world is profoundly inspired. It is not the usual fantasy, but . As great fantasy works of art, such as the Lord Of The Rings, it is deep, profound. I actually don't know how to describe this, but try to understand what I mean. In it we see the horrors of the life, despair and death, but in all this darkness, we even see beauty: heroes, great men and women, devoted to greatness and beauty. All of this affects the heart, which is perhaps the aim of the art. Altough the nature of the art is one of the most debated issues. As the player walks in the world, choosing his companions he knows them deeply, up to become attacched to them. The locations and even the artistic style is inspired.  This is a game, a World, made with passion and love, as few artistic works nowadays. Played 128 hours. Sorry for the mistakes with english, but I wanted the more people to be able to read this.",

As a huge political intrigue/story nut, this game is my jam. I love how I'm talking to people just as much as I'm fighting. That being said, if you're the kind of person who skips through dialogue to get to the action, then you'll absolutely hate this game.   Even though the old Icewind Dale games were already considered old by the time I played them, I still got a whiff of nostalgia from this game, not a surprise considering that Bioware also made the Baldur's Gate series, and I loved how it mixed old strategy game tropes with some new, flashy ideas of it's own. Just made me really happy running around the world in tactical mode, remembering all of those times when I would force my friend (who owned the game) to run around in Icewind Dale II with me, having absolutely no idea what we were doing and generally making fools of ourselves. But those were good memories, so I can't complain.  Picked this game up in a sale, and glad I did (I was a little nervous that I wouldn't like it), but I now realize that if I'd known how awesome this game is I would've paid the full price without even thinking twice.

He looked fine in the character creator, but when I bring into the world and start comparing him to the character models I realise that he looks like he's come right out of The Planet of the Apes. I also created a Dalish Elf character. I had learnt my lesson. Don't fiddle too much with the character creator. This one looks good. But, oh wait, Dalish Elves all have facial tattoos. But not my character. Now how I have to play like someone with their own rules. Someone stubborn, and doesn't care for tradition to justify this lack of tatooness. Needless to say she is a racist. But she doesn't have a quirky portrait picture so she can't be any of these things because clearly she isn't a 'Character'. I think the reason I have never gotten on too well with proper RPG's is becoming very apparent. Good stuff.  Edit: I would probably get some hate from hardcore Dragon Age fans or even A Song of Ice and Fire fans but it really does have that Game of Thrones feel. I really do love that. I am fairly well researched on games. Certainly good series', and yet I hadn't given DA a go. I guess I got scared off by the acclaim of the second game. As an icredibly large fan of Mass Effect, and someone who really has developed a love affair with Bioware, I'll be continuing over on Origin.  Edit Edit: A big negative from this game is that it suffers a severe case of Bethesda Syndrome. If you don't save regularly it really makes you pay for it. I dislike that a lot, although, I don't believe it's anything new for Bioware. The first Mass Effect did it a lot too.  Edit Edit Edit: Seriously though!!! It's a big problem!",

Most of the games I'd played seemed to be overly complicated for complication's sake, but with Dragon Age, situations can get hairy, but if you take your time and have a little bit of forethought, you'll be rewarded. That's one of my favorite parts, besides the writing, depth of characters, story and vocal performance, I enjoy the most, the many different ways you can go about solving a problem. Each fight, you can be totally hands on, sit back and let your dps/tank/healer do their thing, or a combination of both. And I think that's part of the reason this game has been around and popular for so long, you can replay it with different classes and make different choices, something Bioware is excellent at. Your best value is to get this ultimate edition, because of how much is thrown in. The Awakening DLC is huge and a necessary bridge to Dragon Age II and Inquisition that fleshes out the world of Thedas that much more. Definitely give this game a shot, if you have the chance.",

And the Origins and story branching add tons of role-play replayability. Honestly it feels like the best paced game in the franchise so far.  Gameplay wise, tactical is great in this game. It feels natural on keyboard and confrontations are varied enough to keep things interesting. If you're on controller, or just don't like tactical play, I'd recommend keeping the game on a lower difficulty as some of the confrontations can get a bit tedious otherwise. Exploration is solid, though some event triggers are eternally bugged. I enjoy the class and skill system, even if it can be frustrating going through useless skills to get higher up ones.   Honestly all of its flaws, aside from game crashing and missed triggers, feel like part of the game's charm.

There is a coherent storyline, with outcomes strongly contingent on in-game decisions. 2. Basic combat is fairly easy to master. 3. The characters are distinctive in temperament and ability, frequently amusing, and their reactions and behaviour are relevant to outcomes. 4. The game is fairly easy to mod, mostly through the DAO Modmanager, available on Nexus. 5. Commitment to one path of character specialization or another gives higher returns than attempting a generalist playstyle. 6. Replayability is pretty good, though ultimately you are still stuck with the linear narrative.  Cons: 1. Even by the standards of its release date the sets and artistry are nothing spectacular. 2. If you have my lazy playstyle, navigating the tactics menu (which is a powerful game tool and make battles flow smoothly) is difficult, tedious, and irritating. Failure to do so makes combat a process of pause, issue orders, unpause, assess, pause, issue new orders, repeat. 3. By the late game, the quests have become repetitious, and yet must be completed to advance the narrative. 4. As a linear (as opposed to open world) game, you must go to all lengths to acquire every scrap of loot and experience in order to acquire the best equipment and defeat the top adversaries.",

Modding DAO is definitely a bit of work, but once I had all I wanted tweaked, the game was so immersive for me that there's no set of game characters I remember more fondly and was one of the few games I've completed start to finish repeatedly plus the DLC.  I still resist the notion of DAO being the 'spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate,' but after being a huge BG fan, then a huge NWN fan, this fit right in afterward despite it dropping DnD as a basis for the game mechanics (and Forgotten Realms as a setting, alas). DAO borrows from a lot of genre for inspiration- can take you through horror scenes to adventure encounters to tavern brawls to war scenes out of 'Braveheart' to completely tactical encounters where you're using every fraction of a second to pull through.  DA fans tend to guffaw at DAO's 'origin story' experience as 'just a tutorial,' but that's DAO's most endearing, immersive element for me, the initial investment in your character and his/her motivations that makes the rest of the game so worth exploring to the fullest with them. And not just the initial part but how things have changed when you return to the same origin location after becoming a Gray Warden (esp. the dwarf origins.) You will have a very unique experience with whatever race/background you choose, and the writers were very creative about how they introduce you to the DA lore and gameworld. It's the synergy between the attention to detail paid to your own character's story AND to the unfolding of the overall lore that's the biggest draw for me. Despite them dropping the ball in DA2 and DAI in terms of creative investment in your own character's story, the DAverse is by far the most interesting, engaging, and at times thought-provoking game setting I've encountered in any game regardless of genre or type.  If I had to criticize DAO I'd say the combat mechanics haven't aged that well. Like DnD it uses RNG in your to-hit chances (no dodge rolls or FPS aiming) which is fine really (XCOM uses it well), but the way it was implemented there is a lot of running in and watching your attack animation do diddlysquat while you get clobbered... at least until later in the game. So if anything don't prepare for a very robust combat system, even though the ability to control your full party is far better in DAO than DAI... The clunky combat is the primary reason I can't get into DAO any more, but that's not to say the combat's not enjoyable, esp. if you're new to the game anyway.  It's an old-style RPG- no spoken lines by your protagonist (though plenty of snarky, poignant, etc. lines to choose from), paused combat, less sophisticated cutscenes- but with a decidedly more mature narrative- both due to 'mature' content and to a more sophisticated social outlook. And it works. Well. It's a great example of a very intelligent, creative dev team that worked the frickin frack out of limited game resources to turn out something exceptional. ",
