It had a good storyline that will give you a few laughs. It did have a few problems but nothing that breaks the game.   Pros 1. Good mechanics. ( it runs smoothly and the hit boxes work properly.) 2. A good Adult themed story 3. Good replayabilty (especially for Achievement hunters.)  Cons 1. the game is not long Story playtime wise. It is only $11.69 so its worth the price. I just wish it had more. But You will have alot more gametime if you hunt for achievements, play arcade mode, and play for 4 stars to prove your global might.  2. At the time I played this game there was no way to turn off aim assist.  ---------------------------------  If you do end up buying or playing it go into the control options and change the arrow keys to WASD, It really helps out to get the fastest response without having to take your crosshair off of a target.

            "review_text": "Blue Estate is the game Rambo should have been in the first place.  In Blue Estate you play as two characters Tony Luciano and Clarence. Tony is the son of a mob boss and Clarence is a mercenary who is hired by Tony's father. The main story is simple Tony is a hotshot mobster and picks a war with a local gang, but after he goes too far and loses his fathers favorite horse named Blue Estate he flees the country to wait for things to calm down and this is where Clarence comes in to clean up Tony's mess.  The game is a on rails shooter so you know that there's gonna be some limitations in the gameplay, but this game tries some new things like adding mini games within the actual story levels which aren't that special. The change from doing headshots, to remembering the numbers on enemies then shooting them in the order of numbers and other type of games.  Graphically the game isn't that great. It looks alright for the most part, but most of the textures and models in the game are low res.   The game is also really comedic and has a ton of references to movies which I found great.   The game is also kind of short it falls under the 3 hour mark, but it has an arcade mode which could give you another few hours of gameplay.  I didn't encounter a single issue while playing this game and if you have a good rig you shouldn't have a problem running this game.  But I did however dislike a few things about this game. For example the game is really easy for the most part. I didn't try the hardest difficulty, but I could imagine it's a lot harder.   Also the game get's boring really fast as the game doesn't change up the formula it get's boring to play the same type of levels over and over again, just changing the environments and the enemy types doesn't help.  In the end I can say that Blue Estate is a decent game and if you can get it on a sale I can safely say it's a must pick up. It's raunchy and it's fun.  Final Rating: 7/10  Pros: + Funny  + Decent Gameplay  Cons: - Get's boring really fast  - Short   ",

Arcade mode is probably the most fun, if you're looking for a quick fix.  I played the campaign using a mouse and keyboard, but I felt like something was missing. An on-rail shooter doesn't require light guns to be fun, but I think it would bring the experience to that arcade level.   I recommend this game if you were a fan of just about any on-rails shooter from the 90's. Think Lethal Enforcers with hints of racism and better graphics.  8/10 - TL;DR: Short campaign, big fun.",

            "review_text": "Blue Estate is a solid exemplar of the near-dead Rail Shooter genre. While it features all it needs to, it doesn't make an effort to add anything too innovative to the genre.  One of the game's first victims is political correctness. The game's writing is sexist, racist and full of outdated stereotypes. If you have an issue with this, consider yourself warned. If not, you are in for a great ride. Although the humour can be a bit hit-and-miss at times. The game also rarely gives you more time between jokes than you need to shoot the enemies, which can feel a bit irritating and shoe-horned in. The lines are delivered by fitting voice actors who all do a great job at bringing the characters to life. Anyway, the general quality is pretty impressive for the price tag.  The game sports two modes in three difficulties. The Story mode is rather short with up to three hours maximum and can be played either solo or in local Co-Op with shared life bar. Finishing one of the seven missions will unlock the Arcade variant of the level, in which you race against the clock, prolonging the countdown with kills while raking up highscores. After around 5 hours you should have seen everything there is. Which leaves you either going after the various achievements or competing on the leaderboards if you want more.  If you are looking for some quick mindless fun, don't look any further. Especially if the game is on discount. But if you are looking for some meaty experience with a deep epic story, you won't find it here.",

            "review_text": "What do a bizarre mafia triad, a missing horse, and two protagonists with a penchant for wanton violence all have in common? They’re all featured in Blue Estate, a rail shooter based on a novel by Viktor Kalvachev. This is one of those games where you know from the very beginning what the rest of the game is going to be like. Blue Estate features loads of shooting, a story that doesn’t take itself too seriously, more shooting, some quick time events, mini games, and a bunch of crazy boss fights.   Gameplay is pretty smooth for an on-rails shooter and getting headshots (or nut shots) consistently with the mouse isn’t particularly difficult, especially with the warning circle system giving you an idea of which targets should have the highest priority. Occasionally you have to tap an arrow key to match on-screen gestures for actions such as picking up items, knocking back projectiles, or various other actions. Hitting the key immediately as it comes up will give you a “speed freak” bonus which is essential to getting higher scores and rankings. Getting hit isn’t too big of an issue unless you really screw up and determined players will be able to keep alive long enough until the next health pickup.   There’s not much to complain about with this game unless you’re not a fan of the humor or have really bad reflexes. I did find myself fighting the double right click weapons switch in the final level because there were so many things going on at once but it was an easy beast to tame. I also felt this would have been a game better experienced on a big screen TV with a light gun setup but for what it’s worth I still had fun using the mouse (it just didn’t feel “natural”).  An important point to note about Blue Estate is that it’s geared more towards completionists and doesn’t have a very long story. If you’re not that kind of player, you may want to wait until the game goes on sale so you can really get your money’s worth, as the average playthrough from start to finish is around 3-4 hours tops. For all you achievement hunters though, this is a game you definitely shouldn’t pass up. ",

Almost each level adds something new to the gameplay, like misty cemetery where you have to shoot at barely visible targets or slippery floor making falling enemies not an easy target as you would think. More than enough to not get bored even after several replays. Except for dialogues, there are lots of them and they quickly become very annoying. Luckily they can be fast forwarded and turned off.  The major flaw of the game is that it has total of 6 levels. And while each level lasts around of 20 minutes, the game feels short. Not enough ways of euthanizing your enemies also should be mentioned. It's not that much of a con, but the game is so good in all other aspects that this feels out of place.",

While you are doing this your 1st person characters moves automatically (thats why rail shooter) and tells a story. Is it fun? Astonishingly yes. Writing this I finished the 1st playthrought in about 3 hours and must say: The game is worth the 3,89 euro I paid for it. I would consider more than 5 euro too much, however. Great game to distract you for a limited time from whatever you consider distraction worthy. Also great game if you want to try the genre rail shooter.",

It's a great game for people who like simple shooters and had fun in the arcade with those gun games that are like this. The story is great, nice diffrent weapons that you can have thought out missions and just all out funny. If you like comedy, and shooting things, then buy this and have fun. Sexy Ladies too. ;)",
