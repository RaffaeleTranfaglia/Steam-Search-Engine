            "review_text": "Ergh... What? Translations aren't even checked, and it's just like they took the mobile version and deleted the prices, for example, to unlock some stage it says something like 'gather xxx stars or buy it for . ' Not sure how the mobile version was, I mean if you could buy currency or something like that, but having to gather gems grinding stages shouldn't be a thing on TDs. Very basic, feels like a weird copy of a great tower defense like Kingdom Rush. If you played it already, don't take this as a way to calm your hunger for similar TDs. However, the price is alright on sale, if you don't have high expectations and you are new to this genre, maybe you should give it a try.",

            "review_text": "Well-balanced and somewhat challenging tower defense in a fantasy setting.  Randomly-dropped gems are used as the in-game currency for various upgrades yet can be freely distributed (aka 're-specced') at any time in-between maps, ensuring that most levels can be completed with the right spec. Completing a map without a perfect score will still yield gems, so they're relatively easy to come buy. In addition, gems can be spent to unlock strategic tower positions. Gems spent in this way are non-refundable, as such I tended to avoid buying these unlocks. Tip: after completing the final level on Hard, refund all gems before entering Heroic Mode and spend freely on tower unlocks in the three Heroic levels, as the store bonuses will no longer apply.  Maps can be completed on Hard before playing on Easy or Normal, however this does not count towards having completed the lower-difficulty missions. I chose to play each map at least three times: Easy -&gt; Normal -&gt; Hard and found that some missions were balanced perfectly to reflect their difficulty levels, with most being relatively straight-forward, while the most challenging required some lateral thinking. The ability to pause at any point and buy/sell towers provides an additional strategic layer for more difficult maps. Heroic Mode is best left until after completing all Standard Mode maps.  - Skinny from the Fat B*stard  (curator link) ",

I can now FULLY recommended Royal Defense to all Tower Defense junkies! Gems now drop plentiful and there are 4 difficulty settings for every map of the three campaigns! KUDOS DEVS!!!  My full review pending play through! Just know this game has some of the best maps I have played in a TD game! It's fun, has a great selection of towers, upgrades and enemies to slaughter!  Thank you again to the dev's for listening and fixing the problems so fast. Sorry for any missed Mac OS X sales, but the game was simply unplayable before the fixes! Thanks again! :-)",
