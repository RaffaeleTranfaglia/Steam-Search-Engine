            "review_text": "I don't usually go for these types of exploration wanderfest games. I gave this one an honest try, partly because the atmosphere drew me in, and partly because I like the dev. There's no direction and the story is borderline incoherent, but I found the adventure engaging throughout. It commits itself fully to this lunacy. At times I had to go on a bit of a pixel hunt, trying to find the next trigger to move the... plot? ...forward, and when I had, I didn't really understand what I had done.   The entire time I felt like there was some crucial piece I was missing to really understand what was happening. I have been frustrated by this experience in other games in the past, but I decided to roll with it here, choosing to believe that this was the way I was supposed to engage with the dream world. Just like the standard RPG screens don't have significance to the game's progress, so many of the things you encounter don't seem to matter for your win state. Can you have a different party member join you? can you actually collect white ash or whatever and cure those red mask guys? I don't know. There's got to be something to do to get ending A (I got B), but hell if I can figure that out.   All I know for sure is that the music kicks ♥♥♥, and I gathered a respectable collection of carved wooden bellybuttons. In the end, isn't that better than knowledge?",
