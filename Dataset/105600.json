Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft. When I tried to figure out what was better, I made a list. Hopefully, I can do this right:  Exploration   Terraria    2d side-scrolling   Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 38)   You can find loot and ore, without even going underground   Minecraft    3d world   Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 61)   You can find loot, and bars or metal above ground as well (Minecraft Wins)   Spelunking(Mining/Underground Exploration)   Terraria    13 ores, plus an additional 4 ores once in hardmode   Generated caves, as well as, other aspects of underground like Abandoned mineshafts, houses, temples, etc.   You can dig straight down to hell!   Minecraft    7 ores   Generated Caves, Ravines, Mineshafts, 3 Strongholds, and Monster Spawners   You can grind for obsidian, make a portal, and set it on fire to go to hell!  (Terrria Wins)  Crafting(Not including Weapons/Armor)   Terraria    Using around 38 crafting stations(including Honey,Lava, and Water) You can craft anything   If you don't know what an item requires, you can ask the Guide Npc for help(See Npc)   In layman's terms, you can make blocks, walls, potions, accesories, tools, torches, boss spawners(See fighting), dyes, grapple hooks, and pets, and decorations(including pots, beds, etc.)   Minecraft    Using 2 interfaces, a player can craft some stuff they want to(being forced to grind for the rest)   If you don't know how to arrange the items on a grid, you can look it up on the wiki!   In layman's terms, you can make blocks, crafting stations, torches, tools, and decorations( including pots, and beds)  (Terraria Wins)  Fighting   Terraria    There are 392 enemies in Terraria, including the bosses   There are 18 bosses in Terraria.(The celestial towers were each counted separetly)   You can make 15 sets of weapons and armor from the ores aforementioned. Allowing any play style.    There are guns, bows, staves, swords, sythes, summoner staves, magic guns, yoyos, spears, chain weapons, and tomes.   Minecraft    There are 12 enemies in minecraft, including the bosses.   There are 2 bosses in Minecraft   You can make 4 sets of armor, with 1 of them being leather and not metal.   You can make a bow, and 5 swords  (Terraria Wins)  Npc's   Terraria    There are 22 Npc's in Terraria, 19 of which will move in, if you build them a house   You can sell or buy from npc's and many attack enemies that are in the vicinity   Minecraft    There is 1 npc in minecraft(just getting reskinned a bunch to look like more)    You can exchange goods in very 1 sided trades(You're gettin swindled!)

            "review_text": "Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the 'crafting' genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).",

I shall explain the difference between Minecraft and Terraria (edit: terraria is better) Exploration- Minecraft- 3D world, practically limitless, several biomes, intresting underground areas. Terraria- 2D world, you can control the size, several biomes, deeper underground areas. Underground hosts greater and cooler enemies, treasures, cave systems, etc. Building- Minecraft- Limited supply of blocks, blocks take up lots of space, the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily. Terraria- Hundreds and hundreds of blocks, blocks stack into higher quantities (M=64, T=999), blocks are easier to get. Combat- Minecraft- 3 bosses, 5 swords, and a bow. 5 types of armor. Not much variety for pvp, it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon. Terraria- 29 bosses, Swords ranging from shortswords to nyan-cat projectile swords, ranged weapons, magic, summoner weapons, etc. Pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability. So Terraria has more good points then bad, when compared to MInecraft. So there. Shut up about this game being a rip off, you Minecraft-F-N-A-F-fanboys-who-will-rise-to-protect-'the-best-games-of-all-time'.",

            "review_text": " Introduction:  Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with elements of action, mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell. With the choice to build, mine, fish, explore, fight and ride unicorns, how you play the game is really up to you.   Pros:  -Customisable characters with cloud support.  -Dozens of weapons, armour, equipment, tools and consumables to choose from. -Various mounts and pets to choose from. -Multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants, resource and behaviour. -Over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers. -Interesting NPCs who appreciate your horrible houses. -More than one way to play the game (such as fishing, mining and dying). -Hundreds of craft-able items and dozens of blocks.   Cons:  -Very time-consuming (although some see this as a good thing).   Overall:  Terraria is not a rip-off of Minecraft, but is actually a phenomenal game packed with fun and a lot of content. It is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend. Even after beating the final boss, there are still lots to explore, discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game. I personally rate this game a 9/10. :)",

To have an honest review here, Terraria is pretty boring when you first play it. Right? I'm sure everyone would agree with that one. BUT, as you play it more, it starts to get more addicting to you because you realize the wide variety of opportunities you can do inside the game. MEANING, you can do things like spawn more than 1 boss and fight them all at the same time, (The bosses are pretty beast btw) you can get a lot more loot (Swords, spears, yo-yo's, summoners, magic, guns!?) and even build really nice buildings to show off! You can also change the color of your character with different dyes for your armor. The dyes aren't just normal colors though, most of them have very unique mixtures that can make your armor look VERY impressive (around 30 unique and exclusive dyes, not just generic plain colors.) I myself have spent the first 2 weeks on this game ONLY. (Fitting in about...100 hours those weeks) so it's pretty obvious that to ME it was such an amazing game, with so much amazing loot and bosses. And there's a lot more where that came from. The game also has an excellent soundtrack, the music gets even better the farther you get in the game. Anyway, thanks for reading the review, hopefully maybe I changed your mind about the game, (If I didn't it's completely fine.) but I strongly recommend it. Just remember, you will not regret buying this game if you AT LEAST make it into hardmode.   Honest Rating: 9.5/10",

It is not Minecraft 2D!  Terraria is a sandbox, crafting based, metroidvania, rpg, surviving, exploration game. You actually have to do something, a sort of 'campaign'.  It's not only about surviving, because there isn't a hunger system, you could just build a small house and stay there forever. You want to be the best, you want to rule the world, you want to thrive. This is all about crafting and gather resources. The last one isn't easy, there are mobs waiting for you in caverns. The world is finite, and filled with danger. It is split in 2 parts (pre-mode and hardmode), both fun, different and with lots of things to do, to craft and to kill.  Content: This game is now 5 years old! The developers are still updating the game with huge, FREE content patches, they never made us pay for a DLC, never once.  PROS + Vast amount of stuff, items, weapons, ores and enemies (near 3800 different items if I'm not mistaken) + Amazingly balanced difficulty (you can do everything individually, no friends needed) + Fun, hell yeah + Multiplayer, bring your friends, if you have any + Repeatability - I've started over again more times than I should + Sandbox - It really is sandbox + Addictive + Free massive content updates!

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

This game has one of the best developers and the most awesome community, positive people and... well, if you get this game you'll see it yourself. Updates happen really often and all of them are really awesome.  In Terraria you start of with barely any items and you have to progress into the game and make your way to the last boss, but it doesn't end there! Even when you defeat every event, invasion, boss, enemies, it is still not over. The game offers many challenges, you can come up with some of them yourself 'cause why not? When you're bored you can invite some of your friends and do the challenges together, you can choose to have a permanent char or a hardcore one, when you die the char is gone, there will always be a challenge for you.  So if you've been playing for a while like me, the game still has stuff to offer you. You can build many awesome buildings, farm cool, rare and good lookin' items and show them off to your friends, make different characters with different loadouts and well... let's say you'll always have stuff to do. And! Even if you get bored from all of this, people make many different mods which you can install and experience new mobs, weapons, bosses, events and such, so you can never say that you fully defeated the game, there will always be stuff to do for you :) Enjoy the game.",

After a couple years and much patching, Terraria has gone from a game with promise to a game with fully realized potential. It features an in-depth, extensive crafting system that allows for both cosmetic and practical items. No resources you gather are useless - you can make something out of nearly anything.   Combat is challenging and very fun. A variety of weapons - both crafted and dropped by enemies- allows for every combat playstyle. Yoyos? No problem. Swords? Sure. Boomerangs? You got it. Spells? Duh. The armor and weapons that you progressively acquire really give you a good sense of achievement as you continue on through the game.  Although I have found myself getting frustrated and rage quitting on some nights, the difficulty of the game only makes it more addicting. I just keep finding myself being pulled back into the game despite dying several times in one night (depending on the activity I'm trying to participate in).   Boss fights are fun and diverse, and the bosses all have really neat visual designs. Building structures is a source of never-ending entertainment, and many different styles of building tiles are available. The tools that are available later on in the game really add a nice touch.",

            "review_text": "THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER AND IT ALSO HAS BUNNIES ---------------- I wrote the above review for Terraria years ago, but since it's my favorite game, I think it's time I write a proper review that hopefully does it a little more justice.  There's a lot I can say about Terraria. It's not only my favorite game, but a game that's very special to me on a personal level for a lot of reasons. I've spent many happy hours playing this game, goofing off and laughing with the person I'm playing with. I listen to the soundtracks (first one at least) regularly. I got a tattoo from this game to symbolize my love for it (well, also my love for bunnies because it's a bunny from the game, but my love for the game is part of the meaning). It's a fantastic game and I love it a lot.  It's hard to describe exactly what kind of game Terraria is. It's a 2D platformer, but it's open world. It's a sandbox game, but it has RPG elements. It's an adventure game, but it's also a survival game. It's many things rolled into one spectacular experience.  There's something for (almost) everyone in Terraria. Like exploring? Go exploring. Like combat? Plenty of things to fight. Like crafting? Gather materials and craft away. Like building? You can make some incredible structures in this game.  There is no real lore to the game. There are no set parameters for what to do or how to play. You spawn with crude tools, and the rest is up to you. There is a distinct progression - some biomes are more difficult than others and most people make it their goal to constantly upgrade their gear to progress through them - but even that is optional, and if you choose to do it, how you do it is completely in your hands.  A nice thing about Terraria is that the game can be tailored to your preferences in a number of ways. For difficulty, there's the 'normal' mode, Softcore, Mediumcore in which you drop all your items when you die and have to go retrieve them (lest they disappear), and for those who want a real challenge, there's Hardcore mode with permadeth. You can also choose if you want a small, medium, or large map to explore and build in. Characters aren't tied to worlds either - any character can go to any world you make. Play across multiple worlds if you want to.  The amount of content in this game is ridiculous too. As of the time I'm writing this (April 2015), there are 2835 items in the game. That's a lot. There are 401 different enemies and 13 (regular) bosses, with several others that spawn during the optional combat events that can be triggered by the player in game. There are many biomes providing a vast range of environments also, in addition to unique enemies and loot. There's even another update coming, tentatively scheduled for June of this year, that will contain hundreds of new items and much more.  Although I have no experience with any of this, there are many external tools that can alter your playing experience. There are mods if you want to change up the content of the game, map viewers and editors if you want to check out your whole world or change something about it, even inventory editors if you just don't feel like searching for, farming, or crafting that particular item (the inventory editor does come in handy if you want to make a world just for building but don't want to actually explore and work for the materials).  Since your worlds are randomly generated and the loot and items always vary, the game has a ton of replay value. You have the freedom to do anything you want when you play, then to start up a new world/character and play that one however you want too. Due to the random nature of everything, after hundreds of hours I have never tired of this game, and almost all those hundreds of hours were  before  the big update a year and a half ago that added 1000+ items.  This game also has wonderful drop-in/drop-out multiplayer. I have played all but a few (&lt;10) of my hundreds of hours with someone, and it is exponentially more fun to have a friend to build, fight, and explore with. It does make things easier, however, since there are two of you to gather materials and fight. A couple things about multiplayer I will say though - One, since this game allows you to have so much control over what you do and how you play, multiplayer might not be for you if you think you'll butt heads with someone else over how to do things. I have not encountered this myself, but I imagine it would be difficult to play with someone who has an entirely different vision of how to play than you. Secondly, there is a lot of potential for griefing in this game. People can steal your stuff, blow up your structures, all sorts of crap, so be careful of who you play with (I only play with my boyfriend, for instance). Wouldn't want someone in multiplayer to screw you over.  As for the look and feel of the game itself, the environments and enemies are colorful and vibrant, with beautifully done pixel art. The original soundtrack, composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly, is fully instrumented (not just chiptune or electronic), and the songs fit their individual situations (there are unique songs for different biomes, bosses, weather events, etc.) perfectly. There are two soundtracks, the original and the one for the giant update from October of 2013,  that can be purchased  [re-logic.bandcamp.com]  (or whatever) if you enjoy the music.  All in all, this game gets a 10/10 from me. The varied and vast content paired with all the freedom it gives you to do what you want, in addition to the beautiful visuals and music, all come together to create a fun, unique experience that could provide nearly anyone with hours of entertainment. After hundreds of hours and countless fun and special memories of playing myself, I have not grown sick of this game in the slightest and I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't either.  Sidenote: Terraria is also available on Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, 3DS, and Android. The console version and Android version each have unique content. I have not played the console version, but the Android version is great (note: not as much content as the PC version!) and I highly recommend that too if you like Terraria. Much easier on a tablet than a phone though.",

LOOONG VERSION. So what is terraria exactly? terraria i would say is a 2D version of minecraft in which you mine blocs, use blocks and build blocks just for the sake of the sandbox elements. Inf act drawing a paralelle line you would see many overlapping elements between this supposed minecraft clone and terraria itself but ultimately it is all bonkers and i would call you an idiot because terraria /=/ minecraft.   Essentially where minecraft fail to deliver healthy optimization and incredibly boring end game [ENDER DRAGON HAHA] but decides to mix it up with lots and lots of tools terraia in its early days goes differently. I played the version several years ago where you just survive and kill some bosses but going back in now i realize many new things has been put in place.  1. Graphics They slighly overhauled the graphics between years ago but essentially it is all 2D flat pixel retro ♥♥♥♥♥. With particle effects. Those particle effects made it rather tolerateable but lets not nitpick shall we? Look at the video and screenshots and that is what you will get.  2. Sound Stellar and does its job well. Zombies growl, sword swings, slime gulches and human produce inhuman level of groaning upon taking damage which leads us to reexamine our own lives and dashing any hopes of surviving in this fantasy world with our pitiful mor---- whoops went off track there but anyways the sound is awesome. Or average. cant make up my mind.  3.GAMEPLAY Gosh, in between the armor crafting, furniture making, boss fighting and even fishing, cant believe they added fishing. The game is a monstrosity of elements mashed together to form some bizarre form of sadistic satisfying level of fun and engineering level worth of headscrather in terms on how you ♥♥♥♥ing build that floating scout prison room. There's mining, crafting, killing and more building but ignore this section since this game essentially have ♥♥♥♥ load worth of things to do.  4.CO-OP..... With murder. This game by itself is stupidly boring but add in 1 clueless friend who knows nothing about the game and lets just say its incredibly fun, you have the standard pvp options but you can ♥♥♥♥ing choose your own colour. ducking amazing but if killing is not your thing you can always join forces t build that tower of doom for killing other online hopeless chap. In the end its all about the killing.  END ♥♥♥♥ me i was bored, i might add some more when my head clears up but essentially read the TL;DR on why i think youre an idiot for not owning this incredible game.

I've restarted my terraria save countless times over and I have never found an end to the joy I get it. Terraria offers it's own unique and thrilling experience the further you get into the game, whether it's spamming shurikens and knives at bosses, to picking away at ore pockets in the caverns and even just going about your stroll over to the oceon.  Recently, I got playing this game again with a friend of mine, early on they kept asking 'when's the fun part?'.  Once we actually had semi-decent gear, she finally said 'Oh yea, this part's pretty fun'. Long story short, keeping new friends to the game is a struggle but rewarding, best times are on expert mode where you can start ♥♥♥♥♥ing about who gets what and framing ♥♥♥♥ on each other. With the updates that game with this game such as the chaotic madness of 1.3, they've brought so much more to treat yourself with, and makes all the effort and time much more rewarding.  How about the sountrack? There isn't a single decibel that i could complain about, it adds to the ambience and atomsphere of every level making the game even harder to leave. I took a look at the achievments and the percentage of people who've earnt them and I feel that not enough people are reaching these exciting components of the late game. People either than out of time or interest in the game and move on. I can definately assue you that the game is worth every single penny.",

            "review_text": "This game is super fun and will give you a ♥♥♥♥ ton of hours of game play. With the never ending updates and mods that comes out there will always be something new to discover. You can play alone or with friends and still enjoy it just at much. The survival, sandbox and crafting is perfectly combined. Enemies are hard until you get better gear. And you will always have a hard time against your next boss. The game is paced perfectly, because of this you won’t get tiered from playing it too much. It might be a bit hard to find out how things work without googling. But it makes the game still fun to play. It’s not too much grinding after thing, maybe I just got lucky with everything.  You never feel like there is nothing to do. There is always something cool to build or a boss that you need to kill. The cool thing is you can build your own boss arenas where you can build defensive walls and traps. With the statues and some wiring you can build some really cool and creative stuff. And mods even add more to that. You have the chance to build fully automatic machines that can farm things for you. The further into the game you get the more diverse the armours and weapons get. So if you want to be a wizard you can get your magic gear and if you want to be a warrior you can build the tanker gear. In the beginning there is less of this which makes the game easier to understand and you will have something new to learn while you get into the late game.  With every update adding a lot of hours of new content you always want more. There is no stopping the need for more. It’s like an addiction. The game is very cheap and every update is completely free which is why the developers are very loved by the community. The game got released in 2011 and still get very big updates. Something I used to get really annoyed at in the past was the lack of endgame weapons for each class. The summoner really didn’t have any good end game weapon. The best weapon was a melee weapon, it had the highest DPS. But all of this is fixed with the latest update giving all 4 different classes their own type of end game weapon, and not only 1 for every class. E.g. there are 3 different melee end game weapons. They have different effects and use but usually the same DPS depending on how you use them and what gear you have. The developers really take in feedback from the community and mould the game after it. If you have tips for future updates just leave them in the forum and someone from the development team will probably read it. This really makes this game great. If there is something that does not work after an update the fix is probably going to be out in just a couple of days. ",

            "review_text": "Similar to Minecraft but in a pixelized 2D platformer style. However there are feautures in this game that set both apart, making it not a game competition but instead a player preferrence. Anyway, here's a brief analysis about Terraria:  - You can build a house, a bunker, a hut, a castle, a village, a tower, a base, a farm, a floating island or whatever you have in mind by placing the blocks and the furniture you want. There are so many different blocks that some people even make pixel drawings with them.  - You can gather resources, such as mining for ores, chop wood, harvest hay, pick plants (and yet you can make a farm of them), catch critters, and even fishing.  - You can smelt, mix or craft new items (materials, gear, weapons, potions, acessories, objects, blocks, food, furniture, etc) based on the resources you've gathered or even from other materials. You can also paint blocks/walls or dye your equipment. You literally have thousands of different items.  - There are many different types of weapons: swords, axes, hammers, pickaxes, spears, flails, yoyos, boomerangs, bows, guns, crossbows, throwables, wands, spell tomes, summoning weapons, and few others. These weapons are distincted by dealing melee, ranged or magic damage.  - You can ride through minecarts, summon pets and ride mounts.  - There are hundreds of different enemies, most of them are located in their specific biomes or in a specific weather/day condition, some even drop some specific rare items (some are even essential for crafting). There are also bosses that appear only in specific biomes.  - There are some events that might catch you by surprise. It may happen enemy invasions (like a goblin army or even aliens) or invasions based on odd moon phases (like Blood Moon or Solar Eclipse). NPCs (villagers) will get different behaviours based on the day/night cycle or lunar phases (like a NPC selling certain items during a certain part of the day or female NPCs speaking agressively during Blood Moon).  - With the proper accessories, you can fly and/or double-jump in action.  (note that there is no Creative mode nor Spectator mode in Terraria, however it has a Camera Mode)  - Biomes are not that static as it seems. Some can expand on the dirt/mud, some can even corrupt other biomes to become part of their own (via dirt, stone and even sand) and spawn unwanted enemies while making impossible for your NPCs to live in (which is one of the many challenges in this game, some players tend to extinct these kind of biomes to preserve other biomes or their villages).  - There are a certain type of difficuly settings that you can put when making a character (softcore, mediumcore or hardcore aka permadeath) or generating a map (you can set it to Expert mode where it alters enemy stats, drops, loot, spawns, buffs, death penalizations, etc). However, after defeating a boss called 'Wall of Flesh', you'll enter on what will be called as 'Hardmode'. From this point on many new (and yet stronger) enemies will spawn on each biome, new yet more valuable ores will randomly appear, new random events might happen, enemies may drop new items, biomes that tend to corrupt will corrupt faster, you can procceed to new yet stronger bosses, new NPCs (villagers) can be found while current ones can sell new items, and many new items to loot.  - You have the Multiplayer feauture. You can host or join a server via IP address, or you can easily invite/join your friends directly via Steam, which quite fun when fighting bosses. In Multiplayer you can also join a team (red, blue, green, yellow, etc), so you can kill and loot a player from the opposite team or even do a 'Capture the Gem' match.    Overall, I'll give it a  9/10 . Despite not having an infinite map, the whole map itself is very rich when it comes to resources, mobs, caves and loot.",

            "review_text": "TL; DR: I like this game a lot, but the Multiplayer on it, if you have no friends, is trash.  Terraria is a game that, just like Minecraft, is about Survival and Building. The similarities stop there.  While Minecraft is focused on Building (Being 3D), Terraria is mostly about the Survival and Discovery, which translates, in-game, to Explore, Get Materials and Progress.  I recommend not using a Guide (Asides from the in-game 'Guide' NPC), unless you really cannot advance. If you must, search 'Terraria Wiki' on google, and read away.  It has building as well, some more options than MC offers, including a wider selection of blocks and colors as well. Only things that ruin it, for me, are the lack of NPCs (For huge houses/cities) and the finite world (Get Starbound, if you want to build rather than survive, albeit they are adding hunger next update). The game is flawless, as long as you don't use the Cloud...  --Not Affecting GAME Review--  As for the community, it's trash, consisting of the Item Trinity, which are people who give items (Usually End-game, therefore ruining the Discovery aspect), which I call 'Item Givers', a certain world containing every item in the game (Also destroying 'Discovery'), which I call 'Item Worlds' and those servers with the equivalent of MC's '/give' command, ruining the Discovery and Exploration aspects; I call those 'Item Servers'.  Basically, if you want Discovery to be at it's max, avoid the 'Item Trinity' (Item Giver, Item World and Item Server).  ...It's also overrun by kiddies who can't even type correctly, let alone play.",

There really is not much to say about this game as it is really straight forward, but I'll give it a shot.  I would like to start off by saying I have played a limited amount of time with this game and I have limited knowledge of it, so please understand this as you read my review. The first positive thing is the idea of the game. Someone has gone ahead and made a simpler version of MineCraft at a cheaper price (sort of). But honestly, that's also a negative, great idea, but you ripped it off someone...  Now onto the actual game, it's frustrating that's for sure, in the 1 hour that I played it I made a good underground house (imo) and I was beginning to like it, then in about the period of 5 minutes I died maybe 5-6 times and my house became ridden with creatures. Certainly not the start I was looking for, but fun to deal with. In the next .7 hours it became apparent that I was a 'noob' the amount of crafting recipes and formulas was never ending, and I realised that this was not a simplified MineCraft, but rather a more advanced Minecraft...  There, that's all I learnt from like 1.7 hours of it, do as you please, I sit on the fence.   Overall Rating: 7/10 ",

Everything is just wonderful in this game: the soundtrack, the bosses, the building, just about everything builds onto each other in order to create something special. You could even grab a buddy or two, or even 5 or 10, and just have a blast playing the game together, exploring your completely new world.

I was going to play a modded terraria, but sadly my Graphic Card broke when I play dota so I cant play terraria. I don know why its broke.  My opinion, the gameplay are great, the mechanic, the graphic are nice, even the music too, Planterra OST is my favorite. What i'm dissapoint is, the mecha boss does'nt have a new mechanic in expert mode, and other boss like golem does'nt have it too. and re-logic should add more throwing weapon, like an upgraded shuriken, such as explosive shuriken, bouncy shuriken, ETC.  I give this game rating 9 out of 10  if the mechanical boss have new mechanic in expert mode, I give the game 10  I recomend you to buy this game if you like a sandbox, action, and other.

You cannot claim inspiration as copying, especially when there is so little the same. it is a game that requires some patience, but a variety of enemies, weapons and armourm all better than the last and some even with special unique properties can make it worth it.  The building is simple, and npc's are fairly easy to aquire, with some tasks that have to be met so that they don't all just jump in your house.  The biomes are all unique, and the day night cycle drives a nice contrast between frolicking in a field and slaughtering zombies and giant eyes.  If you look at the negative reviews, quite a few seem to say 'reached the end game and got bored' and yet most of those people haven't even played for 10 hours, let allone used a variety of ranged, melee and magic. Speaking of it, the 3 damage types allow for your own style, a tanky melee fighter that gets up close to enemies, an extremely damaging ranger, who is balanced out by lower defense and a need to buy ammo, or a squishy mage that deals huge bursts of damage before waiting for mana.  There are over 10 tiers of gear, the first view being a bit boring I will admit, but once you kill the deadly Wall of Flesh, you get into hardmode, and THIS is where it gets really fun. The enemies are more unique and harder, there are souped up versions of previous bosses, with their own new wys to murder you face, and the gear gets much better. There are also 2 variants to most gear, and which you will get changes in each world.  Now I played at least 500 hours in singleplayer, and even minecraft, which was my main game for ~3 years hasn't racked up that kind. Then one day it was on sale, and my friends got it. I now have 700+ hours!  Multiplayer is easy and quick, though you must be careful of people with twinked items (or a friend that has an obsession with dynamite...) ANYWAY This game is amazing, and I haven't even covered all the good areas!  The building is nice, with MANY blocks and background walls to use, and if you do it right you can make it so monsters don't spawn in your fancy new wooden house.  More good things I am too lazy to type!  This game may not be your cup of tea, mostly if you are not one for these sandbox games without much of a storyline, but if you are I strongly reccommend it!  9/10, only reason it is not 10/10 is because NOTHING is perfect.",

In Terraria you can't get mods, but you can do alot more than in the vanilla Minecraft. You can fight bosses and even get more than just... material? WAY more classic mobs like zombies and stuff, also you can select between classes, of course not where you create a game but when you are in lategame you can select between archer, mage and meele. It won't help you out if you are a mage with archer armor. Anyway, now to the graphics : As you may have noticed, this game looks simliar to Minecraft, since both are pixelated games I need to admit I like the look of Terraria more. What really russles my jimmies in these Reviews are people that compare Minecraft and Terraria. Anyways I would say the graphics are good, it would be really disgusting (depends HOW it would be) if it would be 3D and HD. As I said there are boss fight's, more mobs and the thing I like at the most is that there are events &amp; special armor/items. This game is a clear 9.5/10 I guess. Should buy it! By the way, I like playing warrior, archer and then mage in this order, because it gets really hard if you start with the mage. You could really get confused if you would start with mage since there are different weapons and potions. This was the postive thing, still I'm gonna stay at 9.5/10. The negative thing is : ---",

If you take it for what it attempts to be, it is absolutely a near masterpiece; not on the same level as design paragons such as Team Fortress 2, but, all things considered, there is no game quite like Terraria.  Fire and foremost, Terraria's most major strength is how its combat plays out. It's clear that Redigit had one goal in mind when creating this game: To allow the player to have as much fun as possible, limitations and logic disregarded. Every single weapon, armor, and accessory in this game is unique in its own way. Terraria strays from the ever-too-common (and, to be frank, rather boring) path of a linear upgrade of tools based on mining materials and crafting new items from them in a way singular to the genre. With so many various ways of dishing out pain and making your own character hardier, faster, more agile, or more powerful, combined with the ability to switch between any weapon instantaneously, it's no wonder that Terraria's combat is so enjoyable. As a result of these things, we have a game that's fast-paced with a surprisingly high amount of thought and skill able to be invested into it. When it really comess down to it, though, Terraria's best (and most challenging) combat-related quirk has to be its wonderful bosses. Remember when you first fought the Wall of Flesh? Jumping and flying backwards desperately, avoiding lasers and firing your own as leeches leapt from the ground, practically biting at your feet? THAT... is the type of thing you can expect from Terraria's bosses. It practically plays like an action movie. On a Small world, one could easily cover half or more of the map fighting just a single one of the hardmode bosses, with every little bit of it being intense and action-packed. These guys certainly keep you on your feet, and, if you want to be victorious, you'll have to make the proper preparations... both mental and physical. The bosses are no pushovers.  Terraria's other major strong point is in how the game itself is designed. In fact, one could say that this point in particular has clearly had a lot more thought invested in it from the developers, but, as far as the player is concerned, the combat plays much more into enjoyability. Anyway, if you take a step back and reflect on both the minor and major details... the progression of the game, the extent to which it has been fleshed out... you'll find that there's quite a lot to love. I've garnered quite a bit of respect for the Terraria developers on this notion alone. For example, think about how your character grows and develops; both movement and combat capabilities. You start off the game slow and weak, with little means to maneuver around enemies or caves. As such, you're forced to be careful with how you dig, tackle enemies, and explore the many underground caverns of your world. You won't be able to jump very high, so you have to make do with parkouring blocks or using wood platforms to get back up. Not much later into the game, you'll probably get your first bit of rope. With this new and fascinating tool, your caving has been simplified somewhat, at least vertically; by placing climable ropes, getting in and out of your mine will be much easier and safer. To save explanation time, later, you get things like the Hermes boots, rocket boots, cloud in a bottle, etc., all of which change the way you can move around your world. Not only that, but this ties back into combat as well; changing how the player character can move affects their possible strategies and fighting fitness as well. It results in a strange sort of 'progression' based entirely on gear alone that stands out among other types of progression. In terms of how the enemies and environments need to adapt to this, the developers totally accounted for it.  That's not all, of course. A good example of a small detail would be how the biome and wall backgrounds are designed. The layering and method/style in which they are drawn creates a feeling of 3D-ness in a completely 2D game, which is something to be commended. The one place where this game may be lacking is in replayability, although you could probably make an argument for that, too. Although there are many ways to play through the game, thanks to the sheer number of ways you can acquire useful items and the various distinct areas the game has to offer, a character is certainly a bit of a time investment. Getting to endgame could easily take several days, which is really more a good thing than bad. However, this means that, once the game has revealed all its tricks, there is really no value in playing it through the exact same way twice.  I think I've said enough. Overall, Terraria wins out against its competitors, Minecraft included, by keeping a focused concept and having some of the most amazing game design possible. If you've come for the combat, do it. For $9.99, you can own and play indefinitely one of the greatest games ever made, in my opinion. Don't even wait for a sale; ten dollars isn't a lot. Terraria is more than worth it, and you're only hurting yourself by putting off playing it.",

The combat is simple, but is still great, especially since there are tons of weapons with different effects in the game. I mentioned bosses, and there are tons of them, and they are not easy to beat. But that's what most gamers want these days right? A challenge?  The level, and items are randomly generated, so it is always a different experience when you start over. You always get different loot, and there are tons of loot in the game.  The music, is okay, suitable, and changes depending on where you are and what you're doing, but needs more variants. Nonetheless good.  Overall it's great. I'm not sure if 100 hours is enough to prove that I have the rights to say that or not. Hopefully so.",

It's really funny to mine around with friends, farm things to kill your first boss, to loot the dungeons and so on! The only thing I have to say is that once you did everything in the game it gets reaally boring.

When I say that, I don't mean the usual patch and an extra gun, no, they add hundreds, sometimes thousads of amazing items for you to discover. Pair that with excellent visuals, endless gameplay, fun combat mechanics and a few extras as I will point out below, you end up with a masterpiece that you can play for months.   Likes    Items:  There is a seemingly infinite amount of items in the game. Whether it be ancient swords or modern assult rifles. As well as tons of armor, wearables, cosmetics, building blocks and so it goes. This is one of the things that adds to the replay value. Chances are, you will need to play a thousand hours to legitimately discover everything.   Combat:  Unlike its similar friend, Minecraft, this game is a lot more combat focused. There are tons of enemies, from eskimo zombies to giant green flying pigs. Each with their own unique stats, attacks, traits and drops. On your side, there are tons of weapons, literally every single type, each with a million variations. There is one for every playstyle. Whether you like a traditional combat axe or a powerful rocket launcher. Or perhaps a sword that shoots swords?   Blocks:  You think Minecraft has blocks? Terraria has thousands. There are so many build materials that this game has gone from a 2D platformer to an architectural masterpiece creator. Provided you have the skill, you can really make some beautiful and functional builds, the community hub proves this on a daily basis.   Steam integration:  Althogh some consider this trivial, I love it when a game integrates and takes full advantage of the platform it calls home. You get a lot of achievements, trading cards, emoticons and profile backgrounds, which is a nice way of rewarding your playtime. You can see when your friends are playing and you can join them in seconds. There is multiplayer and servers by the way.   Performance:  Now I have a MacBook Air. I wouldn't call it a potato, but it sure ain't great. But this game runs like a dream on it and you may be thinking 'so what? It's only a 2D pixel game after all?' And althogh that is somewhat right. There is a pretty high level of complexity within the inner workings of this game. But what I'm getting at here, is that anything can run it and anything can store it. Its a quick 200MB download, so you can get it anytime, anywhere, on anything.   Dislikes   idk, its pretty hard if you suck?",

Building in Terraria is incredibly well done, the combat system has a few flaws, but it's very entertaining. But most of all, just the pure gameplay. Can you think of a 2D platformer, where you are raiding a lost jungle temple, where your weapon is a wasp shooting gun, and your grappling hook is slimey. WOW. And this is the start.  The whole battle aspect of the game is very enriching, when paired with the music. You can battle martians with a LAZER MACHINE GUN, kill pirates with a NYAN CAT SWORD, kill a goblin army with a SNOWMAN CANNON, or kill a rain of slime and their king with a SANDGUN.

I would like to redo this while also being able to have a good laugh about the older one, Terraria is basically a 2D action-adventure sandbox video game developed by Re-Logic. The game has over 3000 items in it by itself. Mods can easily expand and break that barrier with mods such as the Exxo Avalon mod, the N Terraria mod, the Tremor mod, the Necro mod, etc. Obviously for a 10 dollar at max game this is a huge ammount of content to recieve for such a good price, every there are a lot of unique and interesting items in the game and many mechanics, weapons, armor, accessories and block types to explore and have fun with. The game also has 15 bosses and 2 events. The overall item balancing is also pretty solid, it does feel that the gameplay has a certain order to it, but it's so well done and interesting that I do tend to forget about it. Overall the game is fun as hell and a really easy time waster. Got back into it after about a year of NOT playing it and played quite literally 30 hours in 4 days (Exxo Avalon mod, I'm also sick so I can get away with that ♥♥♥♥ :D) go buy it.",

Terraria, The biggest sandbox game on steam (21 people on my friends list have it, just as proof), this game is very recommended from me. I've spent about 400+ hours into this game so far just from the past updates. With every update that comes along, me and my friends are always willing to brave this new patch and see what the troll developer Redigit has added this time that will make us 'GAME WHAT THE FIDDLESTICKS'. Terraria is full of funny and original ideas, it's nothing like minecraft if you want to get technical. Without going on to the wiki, you can enjoy and get immersed into the game much deeper without being told and just taking the steps down the road to endgame. Terraria is VERY fun experience with friends, as we've created all new characters, and create maps for more than 10 times, where we go chugging through old challenges that we used to have difficulty with. Terraria in my opinion couldn't get old in a way where the games content is thick enough for anyone with freetime to enjoy in anyway.   THE CREATIVE ASPECT : (8.5/10) Yes, the game brings you with alot of ideas and motivations to build create and prosper a world, but without a freebuild system (Infinite supplies) in the game, it's hard to go try to start to build your great idea, but then run out of supplies to even begin to start building. Have the resources been dried up around your house? This forces you out of the safety radius and you have to obtain these supplies otherways. Chests around have blocks and bars which you can use to craft and build with and make things look beautiful. Giving this 8.5 on creative aspect because there is no freebuild is kind of hard, but yes. Your creation can come to life, with stuff inside there, like NPCs, and actual lights with switchs. You can make a mansion and it feels like your in GOD MOTHERmmmmmmmm HOTEL MARIO LIKE NPCS STOP OPENING THE DOORS   THE CHARACTER CREATION : (9/10) There are many possibilities you have to create a character that looks exactly like you. Now, part of the character creation is a part of the GAME game part of Terraria. You cannot choose your clothes in that menu. Items can be crafted, or found, however to better suit your needs. Tophats can be found during a slaughter of zombies and eyeballs trying to bring down your town or mansion with all their might. The other thing that kind of brings down this part of the game that there are alot of weird and (in my own opinion) unused haircuts that were added in a recent patch. They could've added better cuts, yes. It's not bad that they made these haircuts, they aren't trash but as their not the best thing in the window, you know?   THE GAME ITSELF : (10/10) The game itself is a wonderful masterpiece put together, besides all the collection items and haircuts and such. If you're good enough, you can skip the first boss and go face the next boss. Certain bosses you have to kill to progress so you can unlock the next place. The game doesn't use cheesy jokes either. In the dungeon, Skeletron can only be summoned at night, and The Wall of Flesh unlocks hardmode. There is a bit more but I dont want to fully spoil this for someone who hasn't played through hardmode yet. The platforming in the game is really spot on. Your jumps are wide and you have clear understanding where you're going to land. There is a knockback factor to this, where you have to do a little dodging and juking to avoid and kill the other stuff around you. In the progression part, NPCs are a really big help. The arms dealer sells a weapon that can make you do DRAMATIC difference of damage. The Merchant sells you basic needs and helps you along with housing and such. The dryad can help you remove corruption and crimson. Those are important in Terraria for you need housing to get NPCs, difference in damage is a smart idea to invest in when you're new to the game. if you wanna see skilled, look up Yrimir. He can probably help you go along in your journey.   There's probably alot of mistakes, errors, and other ducks I didn't notice  TLDR Platforming Adventure where it's a combo of somewhat WoW, but also Mario.",

In Terraria, you roam a 2D pixel world freely with many wonders, secrets, hundreds of weapons and items and bosses to defeat! People may compare the game to Minecraft, and call it a clone, but Terraria is a unique game, and not just a Minecraft clone!  The game has alot of colorful biomes to be found, with a unique retro pixel soundtrack, that varies from the eerie music of the corruption, and the happy music of the Hallow. The items in the game vary from building materials for your house, and hundreds of weapons from spells to guns!

And in my opinion, a heck of a lot more fun.  There is fantastic progression of challenges and equipment. Really intense and fun boss fights. Hundreds of interesting and quirky items. Everything from the music, to the animations is just pure excellence.  On top of all these amazing qualities, the developers are some of the most generous devs I've ever seen. Since Terraria was officially released, they have released two massive content patches (1.1 and 1.2) that added more content than most games would include in a full expansion. Content patch 1.3 is around the corner and hints at even more content, all included in the original purchase of the game.  I can't rate this game any higher, it is truly excellent and has so much charm. Definitely pick it up if you are on the fence.",

Definitely, without a doubt, my top favorite of all games, Terraria offers stunning amount of gameplay material for a stunning low price. Though some parts of the game you'll spend grinding, you just can't complain with the ~50 hours you might just spend on 'completing the game', aside from grinding. Huge time consumer, and though I admit not everyone would like it, I feel like the majority of people who don't have this, think this is going to be another minecraft copy. I love both games, but Minecraft just can't compare to this. The content is much, much more. Terraria is more focused on battles, while Minecraft is more focused on building. So perhaps this game is recommended for the fighters, and Minecraft for the builders.. Well, I wouldn't even say so. Terraria offers a large variety of furniture to fill your houses with, loads of blocks, which you can paint (every single one of them) and during that... Finding the resources is a lot more fun as well.  For 9.99, this game is probably the cheapest game if you compare it to the amounts of fun you will have with it. It is worth every penny (which I did not pay, more on that later). Search my name on steamdb, sort by price per hour, look at the best deal.. Yes. For 2 cents per hour, this is the cheapest amount of fun I'll ever have. And the best fun I ever had. Can guarantee, if I had to choose between 1 hour of Terraria or 6 hours of Portal 2 (by that let me also tell you that Portal 2 is my second favorite game) I would have to choose Terraria. Got this game gifted from a friend, I love it, and won't be done for a looong time. Wish I could give that friend a big hug. If you get this gifted, don't wait for a minute. Play it, enjoy it, give your friend a hug, because they just gave you the best gift you could possibly get.  Thinking about getting it yourself? If you have at least 3 friends, I would even recommend the 4-pack. Especially when it's in sale. You'll have tons of more fun with friends, and your friends WILL enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "This game is GREAT, and when I say GREAT, I mean that this game is undoubtedly Game of the Year quality. Everything about Terraria is phenomenal. Ever since I picked up my first wooden pickaxe, I knew I was hooked. Every element of this game just feels so real - from the soil brushing up against your boots, to the crisp Terrarian air rushing through your nose and into your respiratory system, the whole experience is not only enjoyable, but revitalizing.  But the wild landscapes of this masterpiece may be weary, and dangerous aswell! The moment that I built my first shelter I said to myself, 'Adam, the harsh overworld of this undiscovered region are way too much for a young explorer such as yourself. If I value my life, I should never venture in the outdoors again.' and I've kept this vow both in-game and out.  Everything about this game is mind-bogglingly stunning - the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is phenomenal, and the ambient soundtrack brings me back to a simpler, fetal, time, listening to Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 through the walls of my mother's womb.  But enough reminiscing - Although this game has more good points than a quite exceptional Moravian star, I do have but ONE gripe with this game. The sheer imagery that Re-Logic instills into Terraria through their indisputably five-star graphics can be too much for one meer adventurer to handle at some points. During the brief seconds that I do not find myself fending off bats and slimes alike, I find myself at peace among the dark and dank caves, staring deep into the abyssal eyes of my own face reflecting off of the still surface of an untouched pool of water. But as it may seem, peace never lasts, as in my own face I see the disappointed face of my father looking back on my life as a reclusive spelunker in disdain.  My father was a stubborn man; He was the type of man who refused to eat a meal without a drink. He was the type of man who would be too ashamed of himself to visit family for Christmas had he forgot to find a gift for one measly in-law. And most of all, he was the type of man who hated to see his children fail.  Thankfully, the brutality of Terraria doesn't have to be battled by one measly adventurer, and when I am gazing deep into a shallow puddle, battling the inner demons that only I can face, I know I'm in the good hands of a fellow explorer- scratch that - I know I'm in the good hands of a friend. The cooperation of two or more miners is what makes a colony thrive, and this masterpiece emphasizes that endlessly.  Terraria is an amazing bonding experience between a group of friends, and a 10 out of 10 in my book.",

From the music, to the different biomes you can explore, to the bosses, and tons and tons of loot and weapons, this game captivated my attention in every way. The crafting system is built so that you always have a sense of progression and advancement. Rather then levels, your strengths and abilties are decided by the armor tiers you wear, and the weapons you wield. This game has had tons and tons of updates since I first purchased it, and after the developers had called it quits with any future updates, one year later yet another update was released anyways. If you have tons of time on your hands, and want to feel a sense of progression through a world you craft yourself, then definetly pick up this game as it is totally worth it.",

Well, I would have to say that description of the game is completely wrong. This is better than Minecraft (with myself being an active player of the game). The art is simplistically beautiful. Easy-to-use controls. The game starts you off with two choices. You will either go off and cut down about a bajillion trees or dive right into the caves and venture to the depths of the unknown.

            "review_text": "This game is often called a '2d Minecraft,' but it is so, oh so much more than that.   This game takes after games akin to Metroid or Castlevania, a deep 2d action platformer. It has a crafting system that is as simple as 'Get the materials, go to the right place to make whatever it is you want to make, and make it.' It has terrforming akin to Minecraft however, the normal collecting blocks and placing them elsewhere for your structures and whatnot. While that terraforming is important, it's still a minor detail, as the fighting is the real main focus of the game.  The combat is simple to understand: Swing/shoot/cast your weapon and try not to get hit. But the depth that slowly gets introduced as you progress constantly, it makes it very engaging. Elements such as grappling hooks that can pull you across gaps, and wings that allow you to be very acrobatic, circling around enemies are just two of the reasons the combat is so addictive and rewarding.  The music is very fitting, and it doesn't grate the ears, and the sprite graphics are done nicely as well. It is in a classic 16-bit graphical style, and it was a good choice for this game in my not-so-humble opinion.   As far as Multiplayer goes, it is a bit complex, but that is being fixed in the update coming a few days from now. I reccomend this to anyone that wants a pure gaming experience, and with the huge 1.3 update coming in a few days, now is a better time than ever to get invested into Terraria. It is well worth the $10usd price tag, and I hope more of you will see just what makes this game so great for yourselves.  9/10 for this wonderful game that I have many fond memories of.",

Terraria is more than just your 2D rip-off of minecraft, you can not just explore and be creative, but also have fun with fights more than ever it since was on Beta stages to teh release of the game.  You can customize your character with the many colors you desire, haircuts and recently, 4 styles of clothing to choose from. Probably 5. Many options to customize it. Three mores to playa swell, Softcore you only lose half the coisn you had in your previous life, Medium you lose the majority of items you had and coins. And Harcore, it's your usual permadeath, you ♥♥♥♥ up, you dead for good, along with the coins, items you've had. The worlds also have three sizes to choose from how you wanna play, Small, Medium, and Large, if you wanna explore to the fullest.   At first it sounds simple - get dirt/wood to build a house, weapons and tools, seems familiar, doesn't it? Well here it only gets better and to get certain items, some are easier, some get harder. But that's not just it. You get NPC's to help you with gear, your guide being first to give you hints to progress further. And defeating enemies, not only a few can get you items but, they lend you coins to spend. Just make sure to keep making houses for them to live.  You can also get unlucky moments, such as a Blood Moon. At night, you'll take more damage from enemies, similar from Dead Rising series of games, only they're also tougher. But not only you can get items to fight Bosses, there can be random chances too, once you obtained requirements such as weaponry, armor, NPC's, or even more Mana or HP.  Now you must be thinking, once you defeat a certain boss you'll be done with the game early on eh? Jokes on you, kid. That's where this game stops being a joke. It can trigger hardmode, and from there on, your experience gets more interesting, but also, very hard. Oh, and if that's not enough, on the character and world creation screen, there is an Expert mode. Better loot, but risky in double.  You also have events that can happen at random, or if you have the craftable item for it. And they don't ♥♥♥♥ around.  Overall, this game also have quite the soundtrack, from cheerful to evil, scary to badass, and some great pixel-art.  ...wait, you still reading this and have not gotten Terraria? Just do yourself a favor. Buy it. Singleplayer or Multiplayer, you'll not feel regret. This game is dangerously addicting, and can possibly take your whole life.",

When you begin playing you will play for an hour and get bored, But really your not. You get loads of achievements from playing the game and one of my goals was to get all the achievements from the game which will consume alot of hours.  This game has crazy bosses and the creativity is endless. With good ideas you can build houses as big and as weird as you want.  Pros:  Loads of goals Great Achievements With friends can be fun messing around  There is more but to many to carry one  Cons:  It gets easier over time and after playing for more than 100 hours and completining the achievements the game loses potential and gets boring.   All round is a great game for time wasting and also being serious about gaming but it will get boring after 100 hours of gaming.   Hope this review helped.  I give this game a   10/10 for idea and purpose  8/10 for bosses  5/10 for updated content  8/10 for fun  In total i give this game a 9.5/10",

Building your house with new materials and items is so fun, I have a trophy room just to display dead creatures hunt trophies. The idea to slowly build up a village is great. You start a lone person, but can easily start a community full of helpful people, travelling merchants and weirdly placed lighting.

You dig around, build a little shelter, fight a few simple mobs, explore caves and gather different ores( Rarer ores produce better weapons and armor). It changes a lot after that. You start fighting bosses to get armor, you start going to more difficult places to get new tools, you gather resources in increasingly dangerous environments such as the jungle, you find NPC allies along the way and build a shelter for them to live, you delve into the corruption and disturb the evil forces there, meteors fall from the sky, bosses awaken, armies of goblins invade, the occasional red moon makes the enemies particularly irritable and the water turn blood red, you dig down to hell, you defeat your 4th ancient evil boss, and when you think you're done you enter hardmode and the whole world you thought you mastered changes completly.

I will start with a quick review of pros/cons and then move on to explaining a bit more about each. PROS: -Unique bosses. As a result of which is super fun,tense boss battles! -Awesome Adventuring!Always rewarding in the end. -Well designed monsters. -'Procedural' armors, weapons, stuff! -TONS of items! -Lots of biome-themed furniture, for all your building needs! -Expert mode!Enemies having more health/damage, with some of the gaining some new, powerfull abilities!Also greater loot! -Unique loot, nearly forgot about these. CONS: -Only thing i can say that is against the game, is that multiplayer doesn't always work.There is a rare issue which can't be solved, and won't let you join specific. I say can't be solved, however when switching places, (the host going to join the other, and the other who was going to join the previous host is gonna host the game now) can sometimes fix this issue. Yep. A quite rarely occuring multiplayer problem is the ONLY con i can say, pretty much. I rarely encountered this problem through my 750+ hours of gameplay.   Let's get into some details. Though not too much, because im a lazy maggot. All of them is important so lets just start with a random one.  UNIQUE LOOT  Some special enemies, but even common ones, have special loot they rarely drop. This gives a point for building arenas, optimized for fighting those monsters, and also gives you that great 'accomplished!' feeling when you obtain one of these funny/powerfull items. Sometimes it's just a whoopie cushion. Or a plumber's hat. Sometimes it's a ridicolously fast unicorn mount.  WELL DESIGNED BOSSES  Bosses are very challenging in the world of terraria.Some of them will change their form in battle, giving them new abilities.Also very rewarding.They have interesting movement patterns and fighting styles, sure to bring a challenge!As you advanced with bosses, dodging, properly getting ready (gear,potions), and construcion of a proper arena will become very important.As you advanced bosses will become more powerfull, provide a greater challenge.The first time i encountered the first boss.....'Oh hey, i just use my bow that i got here..........Ohh........Right......NEVERMIND!*Starts running away*'  EXPERT MODE  Just when you get used to the game, have developed your own strategies and know what to do next, then you will probably find a good challenge in expert mode.With monsters having more health and more damage the struggle i was talking about becomes even more interesting, challenging.Some monsters will get new abilities.Bossess will also have more special attacks/special moves that they will against you.But don't worry! You will be rewarded with special Expert-Mode only boss loot.These special new items will help you in different, unique ways.  There is a lot more other stuff i could talk about. However i am too lazy to write all of those down here. Also, terraria is all about exploring. fighting monsters, developing strategies against each of them, and a lot of other things.If i would go further into details i would possibly ruin some of the fun.   I hope you find this review usefull! I also hope that i didn't leave too many grammar errors behind.",

The game play is extremely refreshing. There is something about the game play that reminds me of my wonderful times playing Cave Story, and god I love that game. It may be just me, but I can compare Terraria with Cave Story, and that's not a bad thing. Now, the art-style. All of my love, I find it so neat, and very cute!! (slimes!!!) (and countless other wild life I can go around capturing with my bug net which I then proceed to let free &amp; flood my house full of birds and bugs!)   I would like to add that in this game, you build, build, build. If that does not tickle your fancy, then you can wage war on the forces of evil at night, or fight beneath the surface (and even in the sky!) OR if still that does not suit you, then go out and explore your world which is randomly generated each time, so exploring is never a bore as the map is different each and every time! Choose between small, medium, and larger worlds accordingly to your tastes and jump in!  And yet, even more~ you create your character before jumping into the world of Terraria, customize your character and name him/her whatever you'd like and set the difficulty of the game to what you'd like. Softcore is set up in a such a way that if you die, you lose all of your money (which you can still run back to and try to collect), medium, where you lose all money as well as items, and hard core, where your death is permanent! (Perfect for an all-nighter with friends!)  Trying to stay alive is an adventure in this game, even death. Getting back to the loot you dropped when you died is a quest and an adventure in and of itsself. Such is the world of Terrarria.  BUT! You don't have to face the wrath of Terraria alone! Hop in with some friends and start slaying/crafting/building/catching/swimming/drowni- ARHGDR too many things! Too many gerunds!   Setting up a server for you and your friends is easy! The program to create your own server can be found within your Terraria folder. You can also choose to utilize other methods, if you desire. Recently, one of my friends gifted Terraria to a friend who did not have it, so now the three of us are playing &amp; exploring. Not to mention the time where we plunged to our deaths on a rope that was much too short, or that one time where we stepped on a preassure plate and activated a dart trap, and then proceeded to run around like chickens with their heads cut off, setting the trap off, again. (Luckily, none of us died. haha)  I'm such a bad guide/reviewer that I was not able to go through EVERYTHING Terraria has to offer (Just too many things to talk about!). (Did I mention items you equip into your equipment slots show on your character?! OMG!!) but I decided that I have written enough, and because my word-count is probably higher than the word-count in my English class essays. (Maybe... Just... maybe... haha) Hopefully, I have at least enticed you into plunging into this beautiful, yet dangerous world.  (I would like to add that I first bought this game on the console and only recently bought the PC version (YES! I bought the game twice!!), so the hours I have under my belt shown here are very deceiving numbers to my actual hours playing this game. The snails are so cute!!!)  So, I think its high-time you discovered the millions of things I did not go through in my review. We are not born into this world 'all-knowing', we must learn and then apply what we know.   Welcome to the world, Terraria.",

Often described as a poor 2D clone of minecraft, i would say that Terraria does more than enough to stand on it's own two feet. The amount of different materials to build with is staggering and there are hundreds of weapons and items to create as well as dozens of enemies and npc'sto deal with including some uber-tough ones. Another good point is that the game is regularly updated with new stuff being added all the time and will continue to in the future. I should also mention you can explore, create and fight with your friends (or strangers) via multiplayer which adds even more enjoyment and is easy to set up. 9/10 ",

The multiplayer section of the game is easy, requiring only a port-forward to be able to play with your friends. Playing with friends is encouraged, as the gameplay shines resiliently when you are playing with more people, as you can build, destroy, and explore. The game has so many bosses that it could take days of playing to get to the end.  I rate Terraria 9/10, it has provided hours and hours of fun gameplay for me and my friends.

The 'Minecraft clone' stigma might have been unfair from the beginning though. As open-world voxel-based construction games have grown and branched into their own genre, Terraria could be viewed as a pioneer, one of the first games aside from Minecraft to seriously run with the idea.  Terraria, in my viewpoint, is the block-construction game for those who don't find the idea of building with blocks to be the primary draw. Terraria offers a lot of versatility in its construction (especially considering it's all on a 2D plane), a lot more than most other games to date, but it also does something interesting, and offers you a lot of alternatives to block-building, such as hunting monsters, cave and dungeon diving, and fighting bosses. I sometimes compare it to Monster Hunter - the bosses of the game are one of its biggest attractions, and the game's got a solid enough combat system that fighting bosses is usually tense and exciting if you're appropriately geared.  The game rewards construction fans too, though - building homes not just for yourself, but for NPCs that will move into the homes you provide, grants you new services and opportunities, allowing you to further expand your abilities. Finding, rescuing, and housing a Goblin Tinkerer, for instance, is probably the first way you'll gain the ability to fly - something previous games, like Minecraft, would never permit.  Where previous games were focused on survival, and being highly limited in a hostile world, Terraria is focused more on exploration, and guided by the Rule of Cool. A lot of stuff in the game makes no sense, but exists simply because it's cool. For instance, the Minishark - it's one part minigun, and one part shark, and prior to throwing your world into Hardmode difficulty, it's one of the best guns in the game. Grappling hooks and flight capability, rejected as 'gamebreaking' in some other games, are embraced in Terraria (and indeed, many late-game boss fights are built around the assumption that you fly to some degree). Terraria is fast, loose, slick, and fun - not the careful shepherding and management of resources that characterized other members of the genre. Terraria doesn't force you to drop your stuff when you die (unless you choose Mediumcore difficulty), and it doesn't put you in constant danger of the sweet one-of-a-kind gear you make breaking from oveuse.  If being less constrained by resources and yet having robust building options appeals to you, and you're not bothered by a 2D game with sprite graphics, Terraria might be the block-construction game for you.",

My personal rating on it : Graphics : 9.5/10 - I mean for a 2D sandbox the graffics are pretty good though , and for me personally I love 16-bit games but that's just my personal preference. Gameplay : 9.5/10 - You find weapons / stuff , then you get to fight bosses , and besides that you can do a lot of things like exploring , mining , building a house , gearing up ( like farming for items ). Soundtracks : 9/10 - The soundtracks are pretty good. This game is the perfect example you don't need good graphics to enjoy it. Overall it's a pretty fun game to play and stick with it , and if you get bored you can play it with your friends too! The price is resonable for a game that can bring up hours and hours of entertaiment , you can get it at 10 euros ( around 2 euros if it's on sale ).",

There's certainly a lot of things to do, especially if you're a perfectionist, as the environment does involve over time, although it can be prevented for the most part until a certain boss is defeated. Afterwards, the game assumes a whole new depth, as your world becomes several times more dangerous while being much more difficult and tedious to contain, but the rewards come in the form of new, unique items, more challenging bosses and even a new environment to explore.  If you enjoy a challenge, the hard mode bosses will test your limits. If you enjoy building, there are many materials to choose from to create a modest home or a vast castle. If you enjoy mastering the very world, then you can, quite literally, build it the way you want, with enough time and dedication.  All in all, this game is certainly one that has hours of entertainment and has a little something for everyone, since it truly has some unique elements, despite being limited to a two dimensional plane, which actually ends up opening some unique possibilities that similar games simply cannot give without making them broken.",

A quick read on a starter guide or a YouTube video will get you sorted, though. To put it simply, anyone who has told you that Terraria is just 2D Minecraft is a liar. To an outsider looking in, it may seem that way, but let me tell you, if you're willing to take the time and learn the game's mechanics, it has so much more to offer than simply a Minecraft clone minus one dimension.  Terraria, in my opinion, can be best described as a completely open-ended Metroidvania style platformer. You explore the world collecting valuable resources to forge better weapons and armor, and find hidden treasures to improve your character in various ways. Even though it sounds simple in nature, once you dive in, you'll have a hard time getting back out. Gathering the resources required to build your next set of shiny new armor can take a while, but you won't even notice because you'll just be having way too much fun exploring the caves. A one hour play session can easily triple or quadruple because you want to keep exploring to see what kinds of cool stuff you can find. Maybe you'll find a huge gold deposit to finish off your set of gold armor? Maybe you'll find some rare equipment that grants you a double jump, or lets you run super fast, or maybe you'll find some awesome weapon that will allow you to comfortably explore a new region that was previously too tough? The possibilities are endless and since each world you play through is randomly generated, you'll have a slightly different experience each time you run through the game.  Exploring to craft new equipment and find new items is all well and good, but what else is there? Simple: There's the boss fights, which leads to one of the most well-crafted and open ended parts of the game. Most bosses are summoned by meeting certain conditions, like expending an item that summons the boss, talking to a certain NPC, etc. Whether you choose to take on bosses right away for the chance of getting some nice loot earlier than usual, or wait until you're properly prepared, is all up to you. You can even go so far as to take advantage of the game's open world and construct a complex arena to take on the bosses in. The fights themselves are very well done, nice and challenging without feeling cheap. If a boss mops the floor with you, it's all on you; either you could have done a better job dodging and doing damage, or come better prepared with better items or an arena to assist with dodging and damage dealing. Another layer of complexity is added when you consider the different character classes, of which there are four: Fighter, Ranger, Mage, and Summoner. The best part is, you're not locked into a specific class because of an arbitrary choice; instead, you pick your class by equipping armor that grants you buffs and benefits for the class of weapons you want to use. So if you're typically a melee user and a boss or new area is giving you trouble, hang up the sword and shield for a while and get yourself a set of ranger armor and gear.  The world you explore is absolutely packed with content. Even on the smallest world setting, you can spend hours exploring and fighting bosses, and it is entirely open ended. If you feel like digging straight down to the underworld and taking on the Wall of Flesh within the first few minutes of starting a new world, go right around (just don't expect to get far unless you really know what you're doing). Whether you simply want to beat all of the bosses or have other goals like collecting all of the boss masks, acquiring every item or armor set, this game will make sure you have something to sink your time into. This is all without even talking about the game's online multiplayer. The implementation is a bit rough, as you'll have to connect to servers the old school way by inputting the server's IP address, but this still opens up a whole new realm of activities. Even if you're not interested in hopping on servers to meet new players and test your mettle in arenas or even against other players, this game is still a great time with a couple buddies, and the Steam integration means you can easily join your buddy's game without the need for exchanging IP addresses and whatnot.  If this review hasn't convinced you, the dozens of other reviews singing this game's praises should. I absolutely cannot recommend Terraria enough, especially if you're a fan of Metroidvania style games. It's packed with content and is just an awesome time all around. Plus, even if you don't like it, hey, you only paid ten bucks for it (seriously, that price point is insane for what this game offers), and it regularly goes on sale for less than that. What are you doing still reading this review? Go on and play this game already! You won't be disappointed.",

Be willing to lose your stuff in Medium-Core, and don't give up! I love it! If you haven't tried it, you’re missing out. In my opinion it is better that Mine Craft, mostly because it has more weapons. See Edge of Space for a very similar game. If you have Edge of Space, I would TOTALY Recommend this to you.

I always compare this game to others and it always takes the victory with its diversity and combat style. Terraria is truely a one of a kind crafting game that they have been creating more and more of recently. And whenever i have free time I always want to get my friends to hop on a server to defeat a boss or two. The character creation is clumsy in scale but plays a big role since you can live as one character in many of you're worlds having the same inventory. This makes the replayablility less effective but not like it is needed in a game without story. Terraria is a 9/10 from me personally.",

However, this game does come with one very large detraction: Online multiplayer, while do-able, is a royal pain in the butt. It is a lot of fun if you can get it to work, but, unless you're pretty decent with computers, good luck with that. You have to link via IP address and there are all sorts of snags and complexities that, to be honest, I really don't understand. Something about ports, I think, and maybe firewalls. Someone else got it to work for me, since I had no idea what to do to fix it. Suffice to say, it was a pain.  That caveat aside, this is a well constructed game that offers a lot of replay value.

            "review_text": "Introduction Terraria is a game developed by Re-Logic. The dev team are very active with this game, constantly supporting and adding to the experience, they are really great developers.  Gameplay Terraria is a sandox 2D adventure game that focuses mainly on exploration, building and combat. It starts in a procedurally generated world where the player is left with basic items to start the adventure and try to succeed in a very hostile and at times, unforgiving world.  In Terraria you will encounter many different enemy types from little slimes to huge mechanical bosses that are not easy to take down. The player can use melee, ranged or summoner to take out these beasts and the HUGE range of items and item recipes/combinations makes the game highly replayable.  Players house and interact with NPCs in order to progress through the world, with the first NPC being the Guide, whom can be used constantly to reveal all of the item recipes in the game.  Lastly, once you have become good at combat, you can try to become good at building, which adds a whole new element to the game, adding even more hours to your game time. You can build structures high up into the air that take up the whole background, or you can just build a simple lil house to go to sometimes in between fighting bosses, it's completely up to you!  Pros + Endless game time + Awesome weapons/items/enemies + Constant dev support  Cons - No REAL Story (you make your own adventure) - Online Multiplayer is too laggy   Result / Final thoughts For a game so inexpensive that can produce sooooo many hours of gameplay, it is crazy value for money. You won’t be disappointed by Terraria. It is my second most played game of all time (and I'm a Final Fantasy completionist enthusiast) and definitely one of my top 10 games of all time!  -MC ",

This game cannot be recommended highly enough. It looks like Minecraft running on a Super Nintendo, which I personally find charming, and it has more soul than any sandbox game I’ve ever seen. I don’t think it’s ever been more than $9.99, and somehow manages to continue to update years and years after its release, to the point where it has so much content that anyone who didn’t play it from the beginning, and thus experience its grandeur in stages, will probably just go blind. Its creators will undoubtedly spend the rest of their lives desperately trying to live up to its majesty, and while they will inevitably fail to replicate Terraria, it matters not, for they have already earned their place amid the stars for this masterpiece.",

Especially for you Minecraft transplants, you’ll initially find the flat, side-scrolling perspective a bit off-putting after countless hours having been spent in an immersive, 3D environment. Take some time to adjust your lenses, however, and you’ll discover a game that’s both deep and almost endlessly entertaining.  In Terraria, you are plopped into a randomly generated world, your only task is to explore, survive and thrive. Survival isn’t even top of your “to-do list”, as the minor penalty of losing coins upon death is nothing more than a momentary set-back for the most part. The real driving force behind Terraria is its amorous advances of exploration, drawing you in with suggestive displays of pots and vases in surface-level caves, before luring you deeper with promises of heaving chests and rich ores.  There is a wealth of fun to be had with this game, but accessing it can be an insufferable challenge to start out. Without any solid tutorials in-game, your left to wander the world, clueless as to what to do. The guide, a starting NPC, can give you useful tips here-and-there, but without any discernible goal to achieve, it’s hard to see the appeal at first. Building a shelter is a confusing chore, crafting weapons; an alien concept, and survival at night is a daunting task.   Plus, once you’ve mastered single player, you can take your character online, to tackle all the challenges the world has to offer with a few friends; or simply start from scratch and carve a new adventure (boss battles are certainly easier, but never-the-less challenging). For the small price to buy into this title, you’ll get more than your moneys worth in gameplay. (Available to buy through Steam)  Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some Hellstone armour to craft, a Demon Alter to find and an Eater of Worlds to slay.

There's a really good amount of weapons, armor sets and bosses, as well as building blocks and furniture for the more creative people. There are swords, shortswords, spears, spell tomes, crossbows, bows, repeaters, staves, summoning staves, etc. There are armor sets that favor (offensive) magic, guns / (cross)bows / repeaters, melee and summoning as well, so you'll certainly find a set of weapons and armor that suits you.   The artstyle is pretty nice. Even though it's pixelated it's still one of the best looking games in my opinion. It's colorful, cheerful (sometimes...) and it just looks good.  I've never had so much fun with a game that's so cheap. I personally like to play it in multiplayer, but singleplayer is also pretty good.   I recommend it, absolutely.

It was released on May 17, 2009, with a Beta on December 20, 2010. Official releases for iOS and Android are currently in development to be released later in 2011 along with a full version of the game; the Android release will be temporarily exclusive to the Xperia Play. A version of the game for the Xbox 360 with Kinect support is under development by 4J Studios.",

            "review_text": "Terraria is your average run of the mill dungeon crawler where you mine, craft, survive, (sounds like a couple games I know if YOU CATCH MY COLD) and a whole load of other obscure things , like house rather different NPS in your own home or trophies from boss kills and other things! So I really like this game and I am going to go in depth with some of the features of the game and why I like it  The Farming: The farming in this game is just like any other dungeon crawler, but a bit more drawn out. A lot of the drop rates are super low for somewhat uncommon items, it would be understandable for that low of a drop rate for RARE items, but rare items have even lower drop rates. In the end, I always have the time to get the job done and get an item, but it does take a lot of time.  The Plot: Well, there is really no plot, other than the fact that you try to get to hard mode and beat all of the hard mode bosses, which are mainly based off the normal mode bosses, except they are mechanical, WOOW. All though they have as of recently added more bosses, which are indeed way cooler, like the golem and the plantera, the bosses are not that bad. Aside from that, like I said there is no plot, just like most dungeon crawlers and basic survival simulator games.  Customization: In this game there is a decent amount of editing that can be done in game, like make a mansion of epic proportions, edit your characters appearance with cool armor and other vanity items , and have different prefixes of your tools and weapons that can change the way the weapon or tool acts. Customization is not very big in this game although it is pretty good; then again, customization is never really big in dungeon crawlers so there was no need for them to set a new standard for dungeon crawlers.  Well that’s all I really want to say about this game. I love it; it is a great time killer. The price is $9.99, but if you wait around for sales you can get it for $5 or even $2.50 in special a sale (which is when I bought it). It is worth $10 if you are looking for a fun dungeon crawler for you to get sucked into. That is it, thanks for reading. ",

This game lacks a tutorial, but crafting recipes are shown when you have the right materials, and if in dire need, the Guide will most likely help you out (finally). So far, the game has received two major updates, keeping you on your toes even in the late game, which has been vastly improved over the course of the two updates, keeping it fresh for even longer.  The 2D view gives you a great opportunity to look at everything that happens around you due to the zoom level, and makes building that much more rewarding. It is easy to build good looking houses and make them functional as your main base of operations as well.  The combat is rewarding and never feels cheap. Normal monsters fit into a few categories when it comes to AI and patterns, but the game very rarely feels repetitive. The bosses are (mostly) hard (like the rest of the game), and provide a worthy challenge to everybody seeking to kill them and harvest their precious resources so that you can proceed.  Soundtrack is good and fits the game very well. Nothing else to say here.  Playing with your friends is highly recommended as the game might seem empty and boring by yourself, but can turn into something almost magical with your pals.",

So much more than minecraft' Lots of different types of npcs and events.  Lots of different types of areas No real 'end' game.  The world progresses with you. You control how much hallowed is released by how many demon alters you break and etc...   The only real con I can think of is the fact that it's 2-D but I actually find that to be a pro because the '3D' games now a days like Minecraft actually make me sick with all the camera movement.     If you want to play multiplayer you just have to make sure you have a forwarding port open on your computer for Terraria. Then host the world ^_^ It's fun and just an overall great game...  10/10",

You verse Bosses, and get loot directly from them, and use that loot to your advantage. You go mining underground, and the darkness around you really makes you feel uneasy and scared, but that makes you feel more empowered to go on and get all the ores you can! Even after you think you have beaten the game, the game goes into something called 'Hardmode'. New ores and bosses appear and it makes you feel like you just started the game all over again.   Everything is still there; your armour, your house, your tunnels, your loot, but the difference is this; new enemies appear in old biomes that are much harder to kill, new bosses can be summoned with old loot if you held onto it, and you can craft new armor and gear to take on the new bosses. Even after all of that, you can summon an event, as they call it. A bunch of either Halloween or Christmas themed enemies will attack your world, wave by wave, and you can get some serious loot and cash!  After all that, you can go online and look up some servers to play! There are PVP servers, minigame servers, and even some server that replicate single player, but with some friends by your side, and a bunch of plugins and commands to help you out along the way! Some of these servers even make the game harder for you, giving you more of a feeling of a challange!   For a cheap game, this one has really touched my heart in many ways, and I would reccomend for ANYONE who likes action to buy this game immidieatly! Hope you enjoy!

Similarities -In both games you mine for ore, kill monsters for drops, and farm plants. -Both games have tiers of tools. -Both games revolve around the premise of exploring. -Knowing nothing about either of these games creates a steep learning curve for a new player.  Overall Terraria is more of an RPG-Sandbox game and Minecraft is a Survival-Sandbox game. If you enjoy exciting adventures, diverse loot, and epic boss battlles, then I suggest you pick up Terraria.

Or how about only yoyos?   - Pros -  Tons of difficult bosses with well done AI's. Lots and lots of weapons, so many class options. Many different materials to build with, leading to more creativity. Different difficulty options. (Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore, Expert Mode) Multiple different events to farm.  - Cons - There is only one thing that I hate about Terraria. The Corruption/Crimson spread, Even with the Clemtaminator, I can never seem to stop the spread. I have to take at least an hour in real time in order to go around spraying the Clemtaminator all over my world every time I play. I know killing Plantera slows it by 33 percent, but its just not enough.   I think that the spread of the Corruption/Crimson/Hallow should stop (or go back to pre-hardmode spread rate) after you beat the moon lord.",

I have spent much time on this game, and i think every hour, every minute, every second ive spent on it did not go to waste. Singleplayer is good but with friends u can make the game feel like its the only game in the world. The bosses are exciting to defeat and it feels special when you have prepared for the boss and defeated it after all that time. The houses and buildings you can build are amazing, skyscrapers, towers of hell and even meteorites! And the varietys of items and weapons are amazing, each one has its different feel and ability.

Many people compare this to Minecraft as both games have a large portion of the game dedicated to crafting and building, but the two games are very different. Where Minecraft is almost totally focused on the crafting and buidling aspect, Terraria has a larger focus on the platforming and action side of things. There are a huge amount of monsters, bosses and other items in Terraria. From your traditional swords and bows; to magic spells and mystical weapons; to miniguns and flamethrows, to granades and Imp minions. Another great thing about Terraria is the developers continue to update the game with huge content patches. There is another one scheduled to be out next month.  One downside to the game is the multiplayer can be a pain to setup. It is available but it is not integrated to Steam and 3rd party programs are needed to setup dedicated servers. There is rumor this will change on next patch though, which would be great. I give the game 90/100, where 50 is average. Very very good.",

However, if Minecraft lost a dimension, wouldn't it just be Terraria without the bosses, weapons, or enemies?",

I'm not even halfway done with the game and it's already been VERY worth the price. Not to mention there's SO much you can do, and it all feels extremely rewarding. There just seems to be no end to all the gameplay options presented to you, and it's all so much fun.

There are a lot of materials, which can be used to create and build what you want. While you're at it, you can also fight monsters or spawn monster bosses, which drop rare materials.

I made Fujiwara No Mokou from Touhou down to the armor set and it worked.)  -Very, VERY LP-able for Youtube creators. - Incredible preformance even on Windows 8. - Not too hard or easy.  - The devs have an interesting sense of humor.  - Incredible soundtrack.   Cons (these are personal rather than preformance) :  - Some bosses/events require you to be in multiplayer due to the difficulty/intensity.  - Sometimes lag will make you fall to your death or phase into the floor.  - Starting speed is a little too slow, but I feel that's the point.   Things I hope to see in further patches: - Panda pet or mount. - Expansions of certain enemy types. ( Ex. Zombie types, Maybe a few youkai inspired enemies, more Pigrons)  - MAYBE expansions to the backgrounds to add more variety or small details.  ",

It started out when I was playing it on my old iPad, but when I learned the PC had more content and better controls, I put it on my wishlist for Christmas... and fortunately, one of my relatives bought Terraria for me. It was also how I found Steam.  So I started playing Terraria, started exploring and cutting down trees, and building. While I was building, I kept getting mauled by flying fish and demon eyes. I kept playing, and then I was so alarmed to find that an 'evil presence' was watching me. Guess what, Eye of Cthulhu. I didn't think I would make it, but I slain it. I was so happy, and that was when my interest bumped from the typical 'okay' rating to 'I gotta play this all day every day!'  The only people that wouldn't recommend this game are 10-year-olds from the Minecraft fanbase. 'IT'S A CLONE OF MINECRAFT BUT 2DEE'",

While the beginning of the game can be somewhat frustrating, the deeper you go, the more rewarding it gets. The sheer amount of stuff to do and loot to find is impressive, and has kept my interest for longer than almost any other game.   There's really no story or conventional narrative, but there is always some sort of progression, something to work towards. The beauty in this game manifests as the freedom to choose what you want to do at any given moment. Certainly, there are surprises here and there which may catch you unprepared (you WILL die occassionaly), but the satisfaction of taking down each of the game's bosses is so worth it.   Before I bought this game, I watched a couple videos and didn't necessarily think it looked like my cup of tea, and I still don't own any other games like it. But I went off of a friend's recommendation and became addicted almost instantly. Even when it's not on sale (and it seems to go on sale rather often), Terraria is well worth it. The developers have clearly poured lots of love into this game, so even if you are a bit hesitant, give this one a shot.",

All of the mining, smelting, and looting always makes you feel that you're progressing in a sandbox game, which is a difficult task to achieve. It also has a surprisingly good netcode over Steam. However, since the game's pretty loose on how it handles DRM, it's easily exploitable. You can get loot that you weren't even supposed to get untill 500 hours in at 5 minutes (which is why I think Steam Achievements are bogus). Overall, its still a fun game. Definitely reccomend for action-RPG fans and anyone trying to find their quick fix of Minecraft.",

If you look in a chest at ground level, you can find stuff that you will use until end-game, i.e. the item that shows mobs around you that I can't remember the name for. Anyway, I still think Terraria is a great game, but I think if they kept it a little more simple a lot of people would enjoy it much more.",

He creates a wooden long sword to defend himself better. He triumphs over the flying fish. He builds a small house and begins to dig underground until he finds iron, once he reaches the surface he then realizes his life's purpose of building a town complete with trash cans, bath tubs, and sinks. The world he started on has run out of iron, so he travels to another. During his quest for iron to fully furnish each of his NPC's houses he defeats demons, finds mighty loot, destroys jungle beasts, and dyes all of his clothes and equipment. He unleashes the forces of heaven and hell upon the world, yet he continues. Every time it rains he remembers those first flying fish. 10/10 would serve the angler again.",

I figured, though, that since it was getting such good reviews, I might as well try it, and see what happens.  The next day I spent 12 hours on the game.  It immediately became one of my favorite games. The first time I beat the Eye of Cthulhu, I felt like I accomplished something. The first time I beat the Wall of Flesh, I was so happy that I almost forgot I was in the underworld with enemies that could kill me.  And I thik that might be what Minecraft can't just quite give me. In Minecraft, there are 2 bosses: the Ender Dragon and the Wither. But it's not like you get anything from them that will make the game more fun. In Terraria, there are 14 bosses! (18 if you count the solar, stardust, vortex and nebula pillars) And that's just in the computer version. And maybe some of the pre-hardmode bosses don't drop anything in particular, they still drop items to make good armor and such. In Minecraft, the closest to that is the nether star you get from the Wither.  When you beat those 2 bosses, sure you feel kind of happy, but all you really can get is a bunch of EXP and a beacon. And after that, there's really not much more. You could make things with redstone, but a lot of it is difficult to grasp for newer players. There may nt be very much wiring items yet in Terraria, but it's a lot easier to understand, and with the 1.3.1 update coming out, wiring will get more in-depth as well.  A big part of Terraria is the items. According to the Official Terraria Wiki, there are a whopping 3,646 items that can appear in the comouter version of Terraria. Is that not INSANE?? And each item is unique and has it's own purpose. There are tons of interesting weapons, tools and armor which are all fun to use.  My final verdict: I'd give Terraria a 10/10. I love the items, I love the bosses, I love the NPCs, I love the whole atmosphere of the game. I want to see more of it as well. I hope the developers keep creating more bosses and items and gimmicks and jokes and over all, just keep creating a great game.",

Althouh you might spend a few hours on wiki to find out what to do and how to get to where you want to be, you'll eventaully understand the game and have the most fun exploiting game mechanics. Theres also a factor of creativity where you may build whatever phallic object you desire. Build as you please or farm/grind for items as you please by yourself or with friends, there are almost limitless possibilities, especially with the new patch 'coming out', announced in June.",

To those who have yet to defeat the first boss it may seem that way, but when you get well into the game you find that it actually bears more resembalance to Legend of Zelda.  However, it isn't like that either. Quite frankly, this game isn't like anything. Ever. This game is entirely unique. I'm not sure how a block-based 2-D RPG works, but it does and it works well.  It has somethign for EVERYONE, and I mean it. Heck, the game's wiki even boasts this fact.  The truth is, I cannot describe Terraria. It is something which has to be experienced. Any attempt t sum it up will only fall short of the true beauty.  So buy this game. And when i say that, don't buy it and then bum around for an hour before declaring 'IT SUX,' buy it and play it through.  I own Minecraft, Portal 2, Skyrim, TF2 Premium, Civ 5, and many other games.  Minecraft I have around 2,000 hours logged.  Portal 2 I have described as 'The Perfect Game.'  I have actually practically completed Skyrim.  I would say without a moment's hesitation that buying Terraria was the best money I ever spent.",

Terraria is absolutely in my top 5 favorite games of all time, possibly even top 3. I don't have very good internet so I have a hard time getting into multiplayer games and MMO's (Not for lack of trying) leaving me to play lonely single player games. I find it very hard to get into games, even the thing I love most is growing tired. But Terraria, I always come back to Terraria. All my friends disagree and say that once you do everything there's nothing left to do. Well, they're all about 100 hours in (WHICH IS STILL A LOT.) but I'm still kicking at 700+. I remember back in the summer when I had huge groups of friends all playing this game, trading gear, trying to get farther. Sometimes one of us would get some awesome ♥♥♥♥ on expert mode and show it off. I could even do it with my garbage internet, it was like playing a Pokemon game.   After I defeated Moon Lord and got as far as I could on expert mode (Still haven't beaten expert Moon Lord) I decided I was going to collect every item in the entire game and build a museum to display it, and my friends could help me by trading me stuff. I eventually gave up because the game lost my attention, but resumed months later and was greeted to a corrupted map, meaning I had to start my museum all over again. Most people here would quit, but no, I would not. I vowed I would play through the whole game again with a new character on expert ONLY. I would rebuild my museum better than ever before. My friends came back to join me, also playing on expert and it was great fun...again! And now it appears that I'm about to start my fourth wind. It's time to get back in and finish the museum!   TL;DR this game has provided me with so many hours of enjoyment, and I always come back to it. Buy it, and buy it for your friends.",

Terraria forces you to learn what to do and what not to do from experience. This allows you to start your own little adventure throughout your world. I for one, enjoyed to beat the s*** out of the eye of cuthulu with just my bow. The multiplayer mode is very enjoyable since you can either work on defeating all the bosses or engage in pvp matches. Just be sure that your not that one guy fighting with a copper shortsword against a guy with a last prism. The only problem I have with the game is that there isn't much to do after you beat the final boss. Once I did that I felt that the game didn't have much to do left. The lack of replayability and bonus content is a bit sad but can easily be excused if you're a multiplayer person. Overall, Terraria is definitly a game you should try.",

I think it is a great singeplayer experience and worth the money if you are into build up RPG games. People often call it the 2D Minecraft, but it is more than that. It has way more depth than Minecraft and the 2D has a nice flair/touch. The fact that you can do so much at this game makes the game really challenging and you can learn a lot of secret stuff (sometimes the hard way).  Overall, from the scale of 0 to 100 I would give this game a  singleplayer experience of 78 and a  multiplayer experience of 86.  Seriously, this game is worth its price and if you grab your friends it is even more fun.",

I just start playing and enter a pattern of exploration and activities that could keep me entertained for the whole day, if I had that much time. From spelunking, to boss battles, to building, and even fishing, I enjoy everything Terraria has to offer. Terraria has become one of my favorite games to play, and I keep coming back to it.

Terraria is filled with challenges and mysteries. You have to defeat challenging enemies to obtain incredibly rare swords or find rare ores to make that special set of armor or weapon. There's almost always a challenge waiting for you; whether it be a boss, the dungeon, or even being invaded by martians and their flying saucers. I have played over 150 hours on my PC and at least 70 hours on my 360 and I STILL can't get enough of it. Each playthrough is probably about 60-70 hours on average which gives you and idea of how much content in the game. You also get to choose to play how you want to play. Whether that be fighting slimes with a wand that dropped from Santa Claus, shooting arrows out of you're newly crafted bow, or hacking and slashing at a giant eyeball. And these aren't permanent either, it's not like World of Warcraft where you have to stick to one class; You can switch between any of these 'roles' at any given point or you could just mix them all together. As you progress through the game, these choices become clearer. After about 25% of the game you get to really define these roles. These also can create some cool co-op combinations. You could have one of your friends play as an archer and shoot his bow at the enemywhile you charge in and tank the hits, or maybe you both wanna be a mage and cast spells at Snowmen! And with the addition of hosting a multiplayer server through steam makes it incredibly easy to play with your friends or some randoms you met on CSGO. Regardless, this game is absolutely incredible and I recommend it to anybody and everybody! :D",

It is a great game to play with friends or alone, as I have put over 100 hours in just the single player. This game was the first game that I ever had on steam, and I am probably going to be playing another play through of it soon.   Okay now for the real review. This game for some people would not look very good, but fr me, I think it looks very good for the kind of game it is. It has so much replay ability that you will never get bored with it. There is so many bosses to fight, and so many different things to do. Things like getting NPCs by building them houses, making them look nice, and tons of exploration. There is 4 different classes to play, so playing with 4 people is probably the most fun I've had with it, but even playing single player and only focusing on one class adds a new challenge to the game. There is also a mode for the world called 'Expert Mode' and let me tell you, that is hard. It is by far way more difficult than the normal game, and I would only recommend playing if you know what your doing with the game. This game also has a great soundtrack, and you will always be listening to it. In terms of bad things about this game, I'm not sure if I can think of any. If your new to this game and are looking for a survival side scrolling game, this one is very worth the 10$. Other good ones that I have played are Starbound and Dig or Die, and they both were very good. But Terraria for me still tops both of them.",

Terraria is reccomended for one reason: Entertainment. Due from Terraria's major updates, it allows the player to explore new things and discover more adventures. From the several bosses and varity of creatures, it gives the player a chance to face challenges and try to do new things. Terraria is also giving off many biomes or dimensions to let the player explore like the snow, corrupt or crimson, hallow, underworld, floating island, forest, mushroom biome and more other biomes. Mods are also avalible on the Terraria Wiki, allowing the player to gain new things and automaticly explore (instead of waiting for a update).  Another reason why I reccomend this game is the graphics. Although this is a 3rd person and low quality game, it alows any computer (And Phone :D) to play this game. It also gives the player a taste of a unique game style and graphics which are not used commonly.  Another reason why i reccomend this game is Multiplayer, the Terraria gives another gamestyle: To your play with your friends! It is exicting to play with many other people and have different fun on servers with new friends and fool around. You can also explore more and freely and are able to grab more supplies. Though they are a few bugs and glitches on this game, it is reccomended to people (especially with low quality computers or laptops).

Infact, the game has 100x more content than Minecraft so you really can't say that it copied it. About the actual game, I have been playing it for 3 years (happy 3rd birthday Terraria) and still get complete satisfaction out of it. I applaud Re-Logic for all of their hard work and really wish I could thank them personally. They went above and beyond with the updated to the game and really did improve it when I thought it was already good enough. The game's entertainment lasts extremely long. It already has so much content and each update contains a ridiculous amount of hard work. I can't wait to see how big the Lunar Update will be, considering this will be Red's last update. It is supposed to bring the big boss. When I saw Skeletron I was so amazed and thought it was the big boss. But then they brought Wall of Flesh later on in 1.1 and 3 revamped bosses in mech mode. I still enjoy fighting every boss in the game due to their differences. They aren't all similar replicas of eachother. Re-Logic continues to come up with some of the craziest ideas I have ever seen that work out perfectly. Then, there is the music. I feel that Terraria has some of my favorite soundtracks from every game I have ever played/seen. No other game has music like Terraria has. Then there are the graphics. The game is very beautiful and colorful, with a ton of detail put in to the design. Everything looks so polished and fresh while not being realisticly ugly like 90% of other games made nowadays. Of course, all of the adventure and action that is packed in to this game isn't all there is to it. There are so many creative things in this game that you can do. So many oppurtunities for building, with the large amount of blocks and decorative items that there are. Overall, Terraria is worth the cost. I really am surprised it doesn't cost more with the large amount of content there is. Paying 10 dollars for this is such an amazing deal. The gameplay is so extensive and fun even after you have done everything. I highly recommend buying this game, it is highly worth it.",

Terraria is a game that encourages exploration in a very unique way. After discovering how to survive the first night, I set out exploring the many caves and tunnels within the world. I found tons of treasure chest filled with amazing items that changed the way I played the game. Terraria gives the player an amazing sense of advancement and accomplishment as you gather more items. There are so many cool creatures to fight along the way, and bosses really help keep things fresh. Once I defeated the strongest boss, my entire world got 'upgraded' with more powerful monsters and greater challenges. One second I was feeling like an overpowered Terraria god, and next minute I'm barely able to keep myself and my NPCs alive. It was very exciting. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves exploration games, but also loves to see their characters grow with their world.  Be warned however, when you create your character, you can choose between Softcore, Mediumcore, and Hardcore. My first character was Mediumcore, and that means I dropped all my items when I died. This made me upset personally because I hate to lose progress, but the ability to customize your character to your preferred play style was nice to see. I chose to make a new softcore character which means I drop half my gold when I die but I keep my items. Hardcore characters, like the name implies, are unplayable after they die.",

The aspect of adventure in this game is absolutely incredible and the combat is easily the best part about this game. The customisation and upgrade process in this game is quite slow, however it yields great results that are worth the time. I believe that this game should be recommended to any gamer who indie adventure games and gamers who are experts and veterans of Minecraft who want to move on to a game that allows a lot more creativity and more capacity to do things unimaginable.

What's more is that Terraria is so much more fun on PC than Xbox or Playstation! You have dedicated servers to play on so you never feel lonely! Hours of fun and Great for the family!  SinglePlayer:  The SinglePlayer is very fun, the tasks that you need at hand are quite big, and gather ores to the smelt and make yourself withstand any enemy, is a challenge! Most people use duping to get through it quicker but it's not the way to go... The SinglePlayer is a great way to learn the game and experience what it's like to have to face enemies that are much stronger than you, mainly the Zombies and Demon Eyes on Night 1 or 2. The best way to start is to build your house first, on your spawn point, then look for a cave and go mining, resurface when it's day, see below for tips on timing, and then get as many NPC's inside ASAP. Mining goes slowly at first, but the best pickaxe will shred through any ore and block, leaving a easy way to get to Hell. Hell is a place where you should only go once you can defeat most enemies on the surface one hit, maybe 2. Hell is best used with potions that leave you invulnerable against Lava and Enemies, as they are very tough down there. if you end up with a Shadow Key, you can open ANY of the chests and get great loot!   MultiPlayer:  Most servers run off their host's router as many servers cannot afford to run without constant donations. These servers normally reward donators and give lots of benefits to new players, such as free armour and 'Gems' to buy better gear. They also Include a Boss fighting area, on certain servers, that allows you to fight many bosses and keep their loot! This is a great way to make friends and beat bosses in your own world!  Creating your server:  Terraria comes with a free Server setup that you run, select the world, and it will setup, the server allows for many more features like saying in the Console 'time' Will show you the Exact time of the world, and if you want it to be midnight, you can type 'midnight' and it will become midnight! other features are 'motd' for when someone joins, they get a message about the server and what is going on!   Conclusion: Gameplay: 10/10 Great way to waste time and have fun! Story Line: 6/10 Bit slow and not any quests! Fun: 10/10 Spent days on it on my old steam account Worth it? Buy this game now and you will NEVER regret it!!!",

I recieved it as a casual gift and in no time flat i ended up becoming wrapped up in this game. There's no end to content you can explore, and even when you 'beat' the game just before the update, there was still more to be found such as rare mount drops, hard to obtain pets ( Guardian Pet... ) and more ways to challenge yourself. Or, of course, if you were strong enough, to just freely build. The replayability of this game is pretty good too, as each world you generate is unique, and can come as either crimson or corruption ( Of course you can import seeds to of the opposite kind to your world from another one and plant them... ) later joined by the hallow. With the update, even on the lower levels there have been alot of content levels added, and expansion on the tail end of the world game with the space event, and then, for those who are up to and probably barely capable of, expert mode. Then to add on that, while it may be 2-D art, the graphics for this game are still quite nice, especially compared to other games of its type, and, runs smoothly on most computers - giving you the option to adjust the levels if not, as some games of this type don't, or not to the extent this game does.  For those of you who have already played before, as Re-Logic told us, the update log was not complete, and there are some things which may take you by suprise during events or even underground. ;) Make sure to gear up.  TL;DR:  There's lots to do, and the game is fun and quality - you won't get bored unless you deliberately put yourself though like chopping down nothing but trees for an hour.  ( Although why would anyone do that and not explore? )",

I am still thoroughly enjoying it though, and I haven't even tried the multiplayer, which people are saying is even better. It is better than minecraft, in my personal opinion, but it's up to you to decide which one you like more. There is so much exploration to be done and so many dangers to face.  When you start this game you have to find some minerals and wood to make better tools out of and build a house, then you can be off and mining with your brand new equipment. Then you will likely run into a dungeon with a chest and some baddies. Use your weapon to fight said monsters off and claim the treasures in the chest. You'll get lost doing this so much that you will come back home only to find an NPC has spawned in your hose and is selling you eqipment, which you use your money to buy, and then go back to exploring the amazing world around you. Then it gets interesting.",

Despite me looking for the same items since I always play the same 'class', it's still fun to go exploring again and find new things. More than that, the new multiplayer is GREAT! I can finally play with all my friends without downloading some other thing that basically makes me scream internally! Along with the new Expert Mode, it just gives me another reason to scream at my computer because of slimes that do 50 damage and catch me off guard.  There's so much more content that I can't even review it all. All I can say is that it's a great game, the early-game, mid-game, end-game, and post-game are all so much fun. Overall, it's a great game. 10/10, would get slaughtered by my gunzerking friend again.",

Terraria is most commonly compared to the game Minecraft, this in my opinion is fairly correct as Terraria has taken certain influence from Minecraft yet altered it to make Terraria it’s own unique game.   They have retro stylised the game with 2D features. It supports an atmospheric upbeat tempo and feel during the day, and a sinister and dark atmosphere at night. Been able to battle boss enemies makes the game much better as well as harder.  Terraria is huge and vast even with small map, but at the start you may feel overwhelmed especially if this is your first time playing a game of this type. The main two problems, listed below:  - Laggy and somewhat strange enemy lag online sometimes gets me annoyed. - Load time, even with a fast computer deter you from just jumping in, jumping out  Overall i give it a very strong 9.4/10. Masterpiece in the work.",

There's no servers!' of which there are both of. Now, onto the gameplay. You start out with the simplest of tools. A sword, an axe, and a pick. You go around, chop down some trees, and build houses for certian NPC's. You can explore the Corruption, a purple, demon filled wasteland, or the Crimson, a red, blood-and-gore sort of place. Each is filled with unique, challenging enemies, and a seprate boss fight. After defeating one or the other, you may need to take on the Goblin Army. You can challenge yourself in the dungeon, where there is a large quantity of loot, or the Jungle, the overgrown mass of plants and bees. Each place has different, cool loot to dicover. Eventually, you unlock Hardmode, where you are opened up to a new biome, the Hallow, a unicorn and pixie filled dangerous area. You can fight Mechanical versions of the Pre-Hardmode bosses, with new A.I. and attacks. You can make gear with the souls they drop and the Hallowed bars. Then, you head over to the jungle. You will find a lot of new enemies, and a new ore, Clorophyte, that can be made into even stronger armor and weapons. You fight Plantera, a giant 'Overgrown monstrosity of the jungle', and (s)he? will drop a key, which opens the large temple that resides in the jungle. But, you should head back over to the dungeon, where hoards of new enemies can be found, and they drop even better loot then Plantera. You head back to the jungle, fight Golem, the boss of the jungle temple, and head to the ocean. There you can summon the lord of the seas, Duke Fishron. Then you go back to the dungeon, and destrou the mysterious cultists waiting there. From then, you will have to deastroy 4 pillars, Solar, Vortex, Nebula, and Stardust. You can make weapons with the fragments that they drop. Then, theres the Mood Lord. Final boss. Yep. Does this sound like it needs mods??? No. Does this sound at all like Minecraft? No.1",

Fifth, the bosses can be challenging. No hand holding. But the only problem I have with this game is creating servers.

It adds so much more adventure and action into it. Even what I said above, you cannot simply beat Terraria. Every time you think you have beaten it, another opportunity arises. The community is very friendly and helpful. The music is very relaxing or very intense at times when you need it. 1.3 has added acheivements, to do something in your spare time. And much much more pros. There is just too many to list.  Cons: In multiplayer, it can get very laggy during events and boss fights, even with just two people. Some of the bosses require a lot of knowledge to the game to beat without dying. Most people who like Minecraft tend to hate the game for no reason. This is pretty dumb. Some people think its a time waster. And I agree, thats 500 hours of my life im not getting back.  That's all the cons I can think of. Tell me any cons if I left out any.",

There is more stuff in 'Terraria' then 'Minecraft' itself, and normally people cheat in Minecraft using 'Creative Mode' but Terraria doesn't have that and that's what makes it awesome! Yeah there are mods for 'Terraria'to get this so called 'Creative Mode'. And Yes I am also aware of 'Minecraft' having mods of their own but 'Terraria' you have to earn your stuff, but this game however you have to get your stuff legitimately and It may or not be difficult or may be a challenge but at the end of the day It was all worth it achieving what you couldn't have when you begun this never ending adventure of a game.

            "review_text": "One of the best games ever made, there is a reason its the third most played steam game. This game is truly inventive, inspiring, and creative to such a mass extent that this alone would make it a must have game.  The combat is also very creative, and you always have a mass amount of ways to take out enemies, and you will always be discovering new enemies that require new ways to fight it, or are too strong for you. If you were to play for a couple weeks all the time, you will still find bosses that would ultimately destroy you if you summoned them. From the beginning of your playthrough to the end you will have a lot of fun fighting these creative and challenging bosses, that you really need to develope strategies to fight, especially as you get to the harder bosses.  The gameplay is great, you will never find yourself saying 'Now what should I do......' like with most games. In Terraria you will have so much to do to progress, prepare, and just have fun you will never get bored, even after weeks of playing. Even then, once you fight the 'last' boss (which can be very challenging and impossible until you have loads of good gear and weapons) the whole world will be transformed and be added new deadly biomes that slowly spread, along with hundreds of new enemies, weapons, equipment, and bosses, and the world will become hardmode. During gameplay you will be forced to build protective forts, towns, traps, or however you want to build to protect your base, since unlike other games (Minecraft, Castle Miner Z, etc) creatures, and invasions occasionally come to attack you, especially when in hardmode.  The world and game in general is very inspiring with all of the different biomes and things to explore (like hell and the sky with sky islands), the theme of exploration, slaying bosses and invasions, the music, and even npcs make the world extremely interesting. One of the main stuggles of this game is controlling the evil biomes after a certian part of the game, The Hallow, Underground Hallow, and The Undergound Corruption/Crimson come into the world and very slowly spread, there are many ways to hold back, destroy, or purify the biomes and really intinsifies if you decide to ignore the biome and lately figure out that they have taken 25% more of the world.  This is by far my most recommended game for anyone wanting an amazing game that will give them hundreds of hours of fun, creative, and challenging gameplay.  10/10",

The combat mechanics are great too. Also, do your friends a favor and buy them this game, you'll have fun for hundreds of hours together, guaranteed.  Pros: - A LOT of content (items, weapons, decorations, mobs, etc) - Wonderful gameplay - Outstanding pixel art and design, beautiful to look at - Playing it with friends makes it even better - Lots of replay value - Devs have not forgotten about this game and add more content on a regular basis - Very lightweight: you don't need a powerful PC to run this game  Cons: - No useful in-game tutorials for beginners (there is some sort of small 'tutorial' but it doesn't really help at all). You'll have to read many guides and wikis. - Even though you can host a server and have your friends join via Steam, this functionality is still not perfect and causes many issues. Using third-party applications (like Hamachi) or port-forwarding is recommended and, sometimes, necessary. - Lack of some server commands that you'll wish would exist (in the vanilla game). Nothing too important though.  Despite the minor cons, this is a great game you just shouldn't miss. Get it now! If you wait for Steam sales, you'll be able to get it for only $2!

But if you really want to compare it, I would say Terraria is superior since patch 1.2 expand terraria more than 2x the 1.1 does.  The core game mechanic is easy to learn, you would have to spend MANY ( and I say MANY in caps ) hours of grinding for the loot you want since this game have randomly spawn enemies of several types. Which is really good in its own way, make this game much more interesting and give the player wide variety of enemies to fight against.  I have put many hours of my life into this game just to try to beat the very last boss of the game for the first time. And I would say that It was definitely worth it. The bosses are nice and tough ( for solo ) and the game made an extremely great multiplayer experiences. I would not recommend the game for those with over 4 people party since it would take the fun of grinding and fighting boss away from the game since the boss's strength does not scale with the amount of players.  If you get this game during any of the steam sale for 2.5$, it's a bargain and you DEFINITELY should get the pack of 4 just to sent it to those who have yet to experience this game. The wiki is nice for those who have no clue on how this game work since it have no tutorial nor quest, but it compensate that with awesome graphic and design, along with fluid movements and machanics that you wouldn't stop playing for a while.",

More so than any other sandbox game I've played, Terraria finds a perfect balance of digging/mining, exploration, building, and combat. There's no story to speak of, but what the game does have is a remarkable sense of progression, despite that. As you branch out from your starting position, your slowly uncover better materials, allowing you to create better armor and weapons and tools, which allow you to explore a little deeper, uncovering better still materials, so you can continue on your journey. Add into that challenging boss fights that consistently feel difficult-but-worth-it, a graphical style that hits me right in the nostalgia-feels, and platforming controls that actually manage to feel 'right' on a keyboard, and you have the recipe for a perfect game.

Survival games are quite the entertaining sort of video games. Though, if you were to play alone, it doesn't have that much of fun as playing with friends. Building something that's unreasonable and laugh about it. At times, you have to get serious and farm for the items you need in order to beat the next boss. It'll take few weeks (even months) to get the required items, but with a friend or two along the way, this game will never bore me.  Now of course, every games have its own flaw. This game's flaw is the amount of materials you need to farm in order to get the full set of armor/weapon. It's a ridiculous amount for just a broadsword. Might as well just make this game into a farming simulator. But I guess that's the challenge of this game.  Another flaw, I believe, is the randomised boss spawning.   For example, the Twins.   I don't have the defense to survive their attack, nor do I have the damage. I wasn't prepared at all. I hope in the future, there will be requirement(s) for the boss to spawn   (For example, the goblin army requires you to have at least 200 health)  , maybe after you've reached a certain value of defense or damage.    Note: I do notice there's three difficulties (one required to defeat one of the bosses), and the difficulty for the Twins to spawn is only in Hardmode, meaning I could just farm for the armor in Expert mode. But really, the rewards in Hardmode are better than the ones in Expert mode (like, a huge difference between the defense the full set of armor gives). Why bother in Expert mode when you can get better stuff in Hardmode?    Overall, this game brings the excitement of what's coming your way in a new world with a new character. But if you know pretty much everything, there's the wikia page for you to research for all the items you could get your filthy hands on.",

The amount of exploration you can do (primarily underground) is fantastic. You can run into dangerous traps, find epic loot in the strangest of places, explore crazy biomes unlike any other game. You can create housing for NPCs and trade them for some of the best weapons and crafting stations. The accesory system allows for some insane custimization options, while the vanity items slots allow you to have the best armor in the game and looks however you please. The sheer ammount of custimization alone and the options are impeccable.   I recently did an incredibly long run of this game with my cousin. We had trouble at first, even dying at the first boss: the Eye of Cthulhu (although you technically can fight the bosses in whatever order you please). We later got better suplies and, at the point we have gotten, can destroy the Eye with our eyes closed.  Yes, one problem with this game is the lack of a tutorial, but you can just get a friend who knows the ropes or watch a youtube video to learn the basics. You will have to looks up what some items do, but the game explains them pretty well.  The comedy with the NPCs is hilarous, the items can be funny, epic, and just plain silly. The bosses are tough at first, but once you get better items/skill, are fun and easy. Overall this game is unlike any other sandbox survival game out there, blowing Minecraft out of the water.

            "review_text": "5 reasons why Terraria is a solid game.  1) Movement Control - Is perfect in many respects, because when you tell your character what to do, it just does it. Items that affect your jumping/floating/hanging abilities come into play early on, and wings are introduced later. Running, jumping floating, and flying become second nature. This needs to happen because you want your brain focused more on the boss and less on yourself, so that you may attack properly. For the most part movement can involve running a direction, jumping, jumping and shooting up with something else, and then jumping with wings and floating down.  2) Melee/Shooting Control - Is as far as I can tell also perfect. Your ability in this game is determined by how well you move and shoot or attack, and it is reliable for guns. A bit less for certain weapons which can prevent you from turning around while swinging, good or bad. Since you can move almost perfectly forwards and backwards, it is common to fight bosses by running away from them and facing backwards to attack nearly the entire time.  3) Armor progression - For certain characters, the armor you wear is critically important. Your armor goes from minor bonuses early game to amazing class set bonuses late game. The game divides bonuses into roughly 3 classes.  4) Roles -Melee, Magic, and Ranged. Melee is the brawler, not afraid of getting hurt, either healing themselves or just tanking and surviving. Magic uses spells, so the focus is MP and magic attack strength. Shooter gear will earn you movement upgrades and ranged weapon damage. You may mix and match various styles, but your armor will only specialize with a complete set for a specific class/style.  5) Weapons - Are just plain fun to use. Melee weapons go from simple sword swings to 100 mph returning tomahawks. Mixing and matching ammo and guns is a dream come true. The uzi or tactical shotgun with homing bullets. Tactical with explosive for a swarm explosive effect. Megashark with crystal to spam lots and lots of bullets that produce 3 more bullets each. Clockwork assault rifle with high velocity bullets to engage accurately from a distance while flying through the air. Other weapons and tools provide most play customization options. You can manipulate your ammo in your inventory to fire certain bullet patterns. For bosses, I use 10 Ichor bullets to debuff, followed by 40-50 other bullets, then repeat the pattern.  Maybe I'll expand later, but this is all I'd need to know for now. Watch videos. I haven't even touched creating things.",

Sometimes you can be trying to get an item from an enemy with a 1/100 chance of dropping. Except for the fact that you have terrible luck and you are stuck farming for 3 hours trying to get that item, and it can get super boring. Why not make it so you have a 1/100 chance of getting it, but on the 100th kill, it is a guarenteed drop if you did not already recieve it. That way you would never be stuck farming for long periods of time.  That is all I have to say. Please do yourself a favor and get this game right now if you did not already.",

However, if you dont want to challenge bosses, and would rather create an amazing city with all kinds of creative designs, you can!  Thats part of the beauty of Terraria, you can play in any style you want, and you can do almost anything you want. Do you favor ranged combat over melee? Cool, theres an enourmous ammount of armor, weapons, and items with buffs for that. Do want to create an underground bunker city? Awesome! You can do that too.  The possibilities are endless, and if you want to fight tough bosses, there are a ton of them, and you can alter your enviroment to engage them however YOU want to! Do you like to explore? Terraria has a ton of varied, interesting enviroments to explore.

I went in with the same mentality as many other people in the fanbase of 'Oh, it's 2D Minecraft' but thats not entirely true. You stab things, build, explore, and hide when the nasties come out at night but thats really about it. I found it INCREDIBLY slow at first when I was getting myself established but now that i've gotten past that the game really perked up! My first real 'Wow' experience was my first cave which I found to feel more like a dungeon, and before I knew it, it had been 3 hours in that cave and I shut down. One of my original complaints of the game was that when you logged out you were sent to your spawn point, and I originally despised this as I would have to pop out and when I came back I was aaaaaaaaaall the way back at my house, but this aspect grew on me. It gives you kind of a drive to complete the task at hand, 'I need to get this shortcut', 'I need to get to the bottom of this cave'. My only other complaints is that the zoom is kind of wonky and it doesn't really immediatly grab your attention.  8/10 Would reccomend",

You're always trying to improve yourself and your team by building houses for NPC's, getting gear, and progressing in this game's 'story' (if you can even call it a story?).   However this is where the game has its fault. Like everything, there IS an end to this game. Yes, you can continue after you beat all of the bosses, and you can even face bosses over and over, but that's just it. There isn't anything else after that. All you can really do is start over. I've played this game through and through again, even on Expert mode. It's fun, don't get me wrong, but unless you've lost your memory on this game or are completely new to it, you will get bored pretty fast. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but now I just can't.

Things I don't like: A thing I don't like about the bosses are that you have to fight them multiple times to get the things you need. It just ruins it when you feel accomplished that you finally beat the boss you were preparing for, just to realize you have to fight them again because they didn't drop enough to make the things you needed. I especially don't like this about the Moon Lord. It defeats the purpose of the final boss in the game when you have to fight it more than once.  Overall I'd give this game a 7/10 because while I like it, it gets repetitive and boring at times.",

Every world is diffrent and its always a new experience every time you join a new world.

But nevertheless, let us continue.  Terraria has a hugely wide variety. Of what, I hear you ask. EVERYTHING. It has almost limitless types of ores and gems to discover, unlike the... what 6 materials of Minecraft? And it has actually limitless weapons and tools for you to craft and use. There are 15+ bosses and unique characters to defeat and triumph over, all with 5+ unique drops to show off to your friends.   With this and the recent update of achievments, you can prove your triumphs as well as utilize the loot.  The worlds are absolutely massive, but not infinte, which actually makes it really good because when you explore the whole world it gives you a sense of achievment and allows for there to be end of world biomes with some sick loot. It has infinite replay value and the wide variety of materials contributes to impressive and astonishing structures and sculptures.  On a whole, it is 2D Minecraft for non-12 year olds and a great bit of fun for you and all of your friends.",

I have over 300 hours clocked in, about 20 different characters, some where just jokes, like a captain of a ship named Captain Llamasamapop, or my main character with 200 hours on him. I have played enough of the game to say its my most played and probably favorite game. Thats why I recomend this game. This game is amazing, just look at my hours. 300 BIG ONES. This game made me not have a life, and still updating. When I first bought the game in 2013, I played minecraft a good bit, but i could tell the differences in these games. Still, even after beating the final boss about 30-40 times, I still play it, I adventure, I find secrets, create amazing houses, burn annoying guys named Jeff to summon walls of flesh and eyes to murder, I explore, relax, and mess around. Its a game that you can just continuously play, sure it gets boring sometimes, but I always enjoy it. And honestly, after all this time, I will still never realize why people think this game is similar to minecraft. They are way different in their aproaches. Terraria is a 2D pixilated adventure game. Sure it has building and wiring mechanics, but its central idea, its meat, its special sauce, is its combat, while minecraft is a building game, sure it has combat, but its a building game, thats it's sauce. Terraria and Minecraft seem similar in the way its presented, but when it comes to the hot sauce it keeps in its back door room guarded by a dude probably named Tom, they are completely seperate games. Thats why I give it the big thumbs up and recomend this game. 10/10 Would shoot Cthulu again.",

It's always fun to play, and there's always a ton to do. I can't help but keep replaying with new characters since each experience is so enjoyable. With that being said, my two favorite aspects about the game are its music and sound effects, which to me are what give the game its charm. I can't help but hum along with the main theme of the overworld and intently listen to the small sounds that're made when mining with a pickaxe of some sort.  Thankfully the game gives you something to continuously strive for over and over, rather than giving you a bunch of content but no motivator as to why you're playing the game in the first place. There are a multitude of bosses in the game, each as interesting as the last, and of course they become progressively more difficult to beat as you progress throughout the 'storyline' of the game (there's no real story, just a series of events that you have the option to take part in). Grinding is actually one of the most addicting things in the game. For a lot of games grinding is overly-tedious. Terraria makes grinding actually enjoyable, or at least for me. It's really hard not to love the crap out of this game every time I think about it and start it up.   Overall there is so much I could say about this game in terms of its vast amounts of content--including weapons, furniture, biomes, monsters, armor, blocks, etc., but I'd rather just tell you to go buy this game and play it yourself if you haven't already. I haven't written a review for years because I'm lazy, but this game has prompted me to write one.   &lt;3",

A decent dedicated server you can operate to invite your friends to join your client side game or you can always host a game publicly for other guests to join in and play along. This game is actually almost very lag free from what I experience previously. Been playing and hosting this game for a while, not as long compared to other players though but I used to run and mod a dedicated server for others to join to have events and do a lot of things plus there's always a new map every other days in case there's nothing else in this game map.

There's always something for you to do, whether it's fighting a boss, building a castle, or finding all the necessary materials you need to make something. My only criticism is I wish that the multiplayer could continue to be optimized, since I'm currently playing the game on an old laptop. The singleplayer runs well, but multiplayer puts alot of stress on my laptop. The modding community is also very handy for when I feel like adding a little extra to the game. I haven't had much experience with the game since I just recently bought it, so i'm still learning everything. Another thing i'd like to mention is the settings menu. I honestly wish there would be more options added to help boost performance, but I have a feeling someone will come out with a Terraria version of Minecraft's 'Optifine Mod'  Overall, I'd rate this a 8.5/10.",

Start off with a pickaxe, axe,and sword, and make your living, each world is randomly generated, so every adventure is different, in the beginning it's quite hard to get started up, as at night zombies completely overpower you in the beginning, so set up shelter for the first night, or spend the night underground collecting material.  There's softcore, mediumcore, and hardcore, Hardcore will force you to play conservatively, and explore the aspects of the game much more carefully, as once you die as hardcore, your character is deleted. Even with max hp, and best armor I wouldn't randomly travel in hardcore. Game ish hard to explain, need to try it for yourself to see its potential",

            "review_text": "Yes, 2D Minecraft. What most people underestimate is that '2D' changes a lot of things, many of them for the better. It's more combat and world progression focused than Minecraft. You won't need a wiki to run all the way through the game, since there's help in-game for most things, and the NPCs do a good job of clueing you in. I found it fun, fun enough to sink 600+ hours into it and I plan to sink more when it updates again at the end of this month.  I would say the biggest con for me and my friends is that if the players are of very disparate skill levels the experience can be a little frustrating as there are many events within the game that completely change the game world and the difficulty of the enemies you encounter. Top players on a server will end up waiting around, and low players [or even players who like to take their time] will find themselves pressured to take handouts of gear and equipment just so they don't get slaughtered by the new tiers of enemies. The world being finite does also make it hard to find equipment if other players have raided dungeons already. Regardless, still best played multiplayer.  Edit: With the newest update out, better than ever. Fishing now ensures that a lot of pesky items are no longer so pesky, making some must-have items that were previously limited actually renewable. Very handy. I would say the biggest con is that the middle-end game is very grindy, whereas the newest endgame content is considerably less so. You'll notice a sudden shift when the game goes from tediously mining newly generated ores to doing wave-based events to obtain items from enemy drops instead, the latter of which is far more enjoyable. Worth a look now more than ever.   Expert mode is also very rewarding, but frustrating in single player. Expert mode gives every single player a set of boss drops, rather than players having to share or compete over boss drops. If you're gonna play multiplayer, I recommend expert, hard as it is.",

It let's you get some creative feelings of Minecraft, but more of a goal of the 2D platformer.   While there is some unlinear ways to play the game, it's fairly linear.  It has the advantage of being able to do som old-school classic speed-runs.    I didn't like the lack of 'wiring' it has. It feels highly limited when it comes to functional creativity, but cosmetic creativity is pretty-much unhindered. Statues are a cool concept, but I feel they are a bit lacking in *usefulness*.",

You get feeling like 'HAHAHAHA IM THE GREATEST MAN IN TEH WORLD KEELING SUM MONSTERS SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥ WITH MAI MIGHTY SWORD' when you get a overpowered Swords. And armors. And guns. And some wings.  Third: Comparison with Minecraft. Minecraft is a 3D Sandbox game with amazing creative factor. But with a crap weapon system. And the crafting system is confusing (for me). In Minecraft, for example, you can create 'TNT Cannon'.  Terraria is a 2D Sandbox game with amazing loadout system (including weapon). But with good but not as perfect as Minecraft, and simple crafting system. Altrough without recipe list.  So, what is the best? 'That is for you to decide.'  Conclusion: Its addictive.",

While MineCraft focuses on creative thinking and design, Terraria focuses on dungeon-crawling, epic weapons, bosses, and collectables. The game also features a very different relationship between characters you play and the worlds you explore in. Any character you create keeps his or her data concerning their health points, mana, and what they currently have on them, meaning you can transfer things between worlds. You can go to different worlds to collect things! This is an especially great feature if you run out of room on your current world and want to make something more.

With minecraft, you got one type of world (just the normal one, not the two worlds that are later in it) but you got atleast 4 with terraria due to its ore spawn chance and weather or not you get the Corruption or Crimsion. Terraria has its faults though i.e. updates are not often but if that's the main issue for you, the updates most of the time do not come out with game destorying (corrupting saves for example) and new items are added to the game and they do care about the game and want to make sure it works without crashing and and going corrupt so the wait is worth it.

Like, a really long time. There are tons of ways to forge new weapons, nearly infinite ways to build (if you're creative), and just like Minecraft, it's replay value is nearly infinite.  However, there is a down side, at least for me. Once you obtain everything like I have, you start to wonder if you should even be playing anymore. You end up starting a new character, decking him out with end game equipment and throw him into another world just to fight all the bosses again, and get more endgame stuff. On my console version I've even got unobtainable items including all the developer wing, the SDMG and entire chest full of platinum where each stack is nearly 27,000 platinum coins. Did I cheat? No, they were gifts from other people, and the platinum was made by duping, as well as duping other end game stuff to profit off of other people on xbox live.  Oh yeah that's another thing, once you discover these get rich quick schemes, the game kind of ceases to have anything left for it anymore. At that point you've already beat it, and memorized the entire game, as well as every boss and how they fight. For it's price, it's worth the entertainment, and it will keep you occupied for weeks, possibly even months. Go ahead and play, it will keep you distracted for a very long time, and before you know it, you have to file your taxes again.  Hell I'd recommend Terraria on the grounds that it has something a lot of other mainstream games are missing. Color.

You can build villages and NPCs will come and sell you things.  Digging may seem a bit tedious at first, but it gets better as you progress. Also, bring a friend and you're in for a great time.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

But Terraria is far from just a 2D clone of Minecraft focusing more on Adventure and exploration, while also containing the building aspects (And expanding on it!). From day 1 and onward you begin to discover all of the new and exciting things this game has to offer, but not until you get later in the game do you really understand how much content this game contains. There are over a hundred weapons and armor, and even more enemies and bosses. The ammount of content in Terraria can only be defined as 'Incredibly Massive'.  The single-player mode in Terraria is a lot of fun, but when you play with a friend and discover all that Terraria has to offer, the fun and replayablity doubles. If you're going to play Terraria, i highly reccomend to play on Multiplayer. The multiplayer mode of Terraria requires port-forwarding to play with a friend, I haven't set up many servers before, but I can say setting up a server in Terraria is a piece of cake.  The art-style of this game contains stunning 16-bit graphics that are very reminiscent of the Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis. It's beautiful to look at, and if you look closely you may find plenty of details hidden in it's animated sprites.  If you're into awesome 16-bit survival RPG adventures, you should buy Terraria right away. And if you're not, then you should definitely buy Terraria right away, because that would mean you've never played one before.",

We got another new biome, a stubborn boss, more weapons and...well, more everything, really.  Terraria is a somewhat unique game (That has a second game running alongside it instead of a sequel(al?)!) that places you in the wild of a procedurally generated 2D world.

You are always able to find something, weather it be rare minerals and materials, new adventures and bosses, or tactics and strategies to take down mobs...and your friends!  Terraria is easily a great game that, even though the updates aren't constant, they are MASSIVE.

It's cool how theres stuff that spawn in your world that replace other stuff, like I got Iron in my world instead of it's counter-part Lead. Hardmode... so damn cool once you get into it. I haven't defeated any of the mechanical bosses yet, they're just so damn hard. I guess this game isn't really for muiltiplayer with people you don't know, they just ruin your ♥♥♥♥ and grief the world with their hacked items and stuff. I play my muiltiplayer with just my brother, and it's really fun to play with the people you actually know. I'd start up a server on our world and go mining, looking for titanium so we can defeat bosses together. When I start up the server, and I get on the world, it starts to have random lag spikes every 5 minutes, but it gets better atleast. I'm trying to get the Ankn Sheild, but getting the Ankn charm is hard as f***. The items used to craft the charm are hard to get, you'd need to kill a hundered pixies to get one megaphone to craft one of the many items used to craft the charm. I got The Plan and a Obsidian shield and other items, but I still have a loooooonngg way to go to get that shield. Patience! This game takes lots of concentration and patience! uuuugghh i wanna shoormite armouurrrr *whine* meh.  edit: I might add onto this review more.",

            "review_text": "Well, time to write a serious review for Terraria, none of that random crap that doesn't really help someone in their purchase. Firstly I'd like to say anyone with a fixed mindset of this game being a '2D Minecraft' obviously needs to look at Terraria's insanely high rating of 96% positive reviews - This game is good, not some cheap crap made to ride another game's coatails.  Maybe you've read the description of this game which lists only 3 features, or have seen some older reviews for this game and thought - 'This looks like a game that is way overhyped and doesn't have that much content,' well luckily for you, this game isn't the old v1 it was ~5 years ago, no, it is now the glorious v1.3 Might not seem like much to the uninitiated but as you may have seen already I have poured hundreds of hours into Terraria and I have still defintely discovered everything. Terraia has a ****load of stuff to do and merits putting many hours into the game.  The gameplay is nothing hugely advanced and innovating, but the combat is truly fun and the game's use of accessories, weapons and amours allows for multiple classes. Building is simple, and is only on two different planes but the vast range of blocks and walls which are availible leads to a vast potiential of things to build. Progression works well and the best part of the game comes into Hardmode where you begin to fight the more challenging enemies and bosses. Expert Mode provides a  real challenge  is hard as nails. Multiplayer is very fun and works well, but isn't particulary well suited to very large groups or public servers (world gets overcrowded/greifed). The main issue with the gameplay is it can sometimes become tedious. Spelunking for hours to get those rare hardmode minerals or grinding a boss to get a specific drop can be painful, but doesn't generally last long, and there are usually alternative solutions to these issues.  The graphics are again, nothing particulary innovating but still look fairly nice and work quite well (unless you have some wretched hate for pixel graphics) and the music is nice but nothing particulary memorable (unless again you for some reason hate 8-bit style things with a passion). The sounds were a bit loud for me but you do have the option to change the music, sound effects and ambience. You can customize you characters hair, clothing eyes and skin upon creation, and clothing and hair can be changed during the game if you wish to using the Stylist NPC and the dresser furniture item. Dyes are also availible, whihc change the colour of your armour and/or accessories while eqiupped, giving you a wide range of aesthetic customizablity.  The NPCs are a key part of the game, enabling you to purchase a wide range of goods and services. Most NPCs are merchants for a specific type of good, but others also provide special services such as the Goblin Tinkerer, who reforges a accessory's or weapon's prefix to give different stat changes. Also prefixes - these give buffs to weapons and accessories that the base item do not have, this gives even more customizablity for your character. Each NPC is worthwhile and sells useful equipment or materials for a player to use.  To give you a scope of the huge amount of content there are currently 24 bosses in the game, along with 11 minibosses, 9 biomes (10 if you include The Underworld) which have four different layers corresponding to depth. There are over 1000 items in the game and hundreds of enemies. There are 25 different NPCs within the game.  Bottom Line If you're interested, buy it. If you hat grindy games, keep your distance. If you enjoyed Starbound, Edge of Space or Minecraft you'll most likely enjoy this game and with it's price reaching $2.50 on sale and hundreds of hours of content, the game is defintely worth a purchase. If you are unsure of a purchase, maybe look up some gameplay of Terraria, but with it's latest 1.3 update, I, along with thousands of others, can hardly get away from playing this game.  (It has a 96% positive rating, it's a damn good game)",

As an RPG loot loving type of player I found myself quite at home scavenging for resources and enemies to drop rare gear from their corpses. The game plays well, has Co-op, &amp; is a fun experience when played with friends. My only gripe i have with this game is the absence of how to make certain NPC's to spawn into your world, how to craft certain items, and what my next goal is.

If you go by, 'The price of the game is 1$ = 1 hour of fun' then you will be sorely dissapointed to figure out that this game breaks that rule. The game play is a lot of fun, if you like to fight things, bosses, events, pvp, a ton of awesome weapons to wreak havoc and several setups to suit your playstyle. Like to explore? The worlds are expansive, even on small. I have yet to explore an entire world. Like to build? There are hundreds of block types so that the only thing limiting you is what you can collect. Character customization is amazing, vanity armor sets, dyes, the ability to change the appearance of your character ingame. If you like to play with friends theres the new steam servers, but its also really easy to set up a dedicated server using the official items. Over all it has been a very enjoyable 500+ hours, and I will continue to pump hours into it.",

Especially those trophys you can put on a wall. I've played this game for hours, it's really the best of its genre, because you can see the level of dedication that the programmers put into it, besides the gameplay quality there are also many references to real life things in the game like the link(zelda) armor set and the morning wood boss (which is actually a tree, not a d*** as you'd expect). When you think you finished the game, you just find out on the wiki, that this was just the fifth boss, and you didn't even hit the 50% of the game completion.

Or you can slowly upgrade your gear and work your way through the progressively more and more difficult bosses.  Either way it's a rather addictive experience. Terraria has received a huge amount of free updates along the years, and these days the amount of content on offer is pretty staggering. For me personally, the exploration aspect of the game was the most enjoyable part.  It's by no means a perfect game, however. Despite the huge variety of weapons combat itself is a rather shallow affair. This was most noticeable during boss fights, which often felt rather gimmicky. And finally, while hardmode isn't a bad idea in itself, I found the actual implementation more grindy and tedious than fun.  Despite these minor flaws Terraria is still a great game and I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone.  The good: - Addictive gameplay - Huge amount of content - Lots of cool items, NPCs and enemies - Massive procedural maps to explore  The bad: - Hardmode is grindy and rather tedious - Shallow combat - Not a big fan of the boss designs - Lots of obscure mechanics that are really hard to figure out without Wiki/googling",

It's really not that expensive for the content and hours of fun it holds. I've had this game and played it ever since it was 1.1.x. The devs added way more content with each major update, most recently fighting horrifying cultists, space pillars, and the new dreadfull final boss 'The Moon Lord.'   Terraria is a fantastic game that's really similar to Minecraft. There's a bit less to do in terms of creative sandbox (in that there's no creative mode) but there's more story progress related content. Bosses, events, challenges, hell, and fishing! There's so many different enimies that procedurally get harder to fight as you progress through the game. So it's never truly boring unless you're taking your time mining ores or chopping trees.   One of my favorite things about this game is magic. Unlike some sandbox games there are staffs and other magic items you can use to attack enemies and *bend the world to your whim. (Slight exageration but you can use say the dirt staff to modify the world.)* There's multiple class based ways to play that aren't locked on your character in any way. You'll just need to do some farming to get those items. I personally enjoy going a more mage setup but then again I like minions and robes. :)   Who else can argue when its got Multiplayer, an extremely challenging Expert Mode, and small game file size with 8-bit like graphics. It's very much like Minecraft but in a more platformer style with more world progression. There's a reason me and my friends have 700+ hours on this game, and though you might not be as enthralled I'm sure you'll still enjoy it and at least make it to hardmode (where the real fun begins).",

            "review_text": "  Terraria is one of those rare pearls, you can be very fortunate to find in the vast ocean of games. It is charming, fun, challenging, multi-player friendly, immersive and random as hell.  To start of with, you can choose how you want to play the game. If you're the type that just like to build, explore and occationally try a boss, you can choose the easymode and no penalty death options.  If you like me, love a challenge, a rough start, boss fights that makes the sweat run down your forehead, then you can choose hardmode, which not only makes the game extremely challenging, but also super fun.   Talking about the randomness, as you progress in the game, you never know when a solar eclipse, will spawn all the monsters from your nightmares, that will swarm your little village, having you and your NPC's fighting for your lives.   Sometimes a little drone will come flying, show a few colours only to leave again in a mere moment, which result in a huge alien invasion, with UFO deathrays, beamguns, strange aliens jumping, exploding and running.  Maybe the pirates will come around, to try and steal your treasures, with flying ships, cannons, parots and everything else that belongs.  There are tons and tons of items, secrets and stuff to explore in the randomized world, that changes every single time you start a new playthrough. And trust me, if you pick a huge map, you will have HOURS upon HOURS to explore, dig your way down to the pits of hell, if you can manage to get through the desert, snowden, mines, ruins, jungles, oceans, underground shroombiomes etc. The items are so much fun and inventive. Everything from the famous portal gun, to swords shooting rainbows, miniguns, explosives of every kind, mounts to ride, wings to make you fly, the secrets of the sky-islands....  I could literally write so much good about this game. It has given my hundreds of hours and I still have many more to go.  9.5/10",

            "review_text": "Terraria is a great game, just awesome. The game has a sense of progression, the worlds are big, and if what we've heard of Terraria 2 is any indication, the next game will be amazing with infinitely large worlds. Like most exploration crafting games, you begin with the bare essentials to what you need to get going, in this case that's a short sword, a pick axe and an axe. You need to use your pickaxe to mine for soft earth (dirt, mud, sand) and minerals (stone, ore, etc). You use your axe to cut down trees which you need for the wood to create certain things like work benches.  Using these starting resources you craft a shelter and start on your journey down the rabbit hole to see how deep it goes. The game has some basic enemies at first, with the most dangerous enemies coming out either at night during a blood moon or underground. As you fight and kill more enemies they will drop special equipment which will help make you stronger or provide you with a piece to craft a better piece than you already have. I would say that the combat of Terraria makes up for 75% of the gameplay, with the exploration being the other 20% and 5% left for crafting and building. You can't progress the game without fighting, you just can't.   When you reach a certain threshold you will be forcefully invaded by a boss late at night, if you win then you won't be invaded again. If you lose, you will be invaded again .. eventually. When all is said and done, there are up to 5 bosses that you may progress and fight. And then there's one other boss, the Wall of Flesh. Defeating him will take guile and skill, as you will have to do so in the depths of the underworld over top of a river of lava. Defeat him and you win .. and then hard mode begins, and everything I just told you goes out the window.  My suggestion for anyone new and starting out with this game is bring snacks and drinks, because it will be a LONG play through, and you will likely take at least a week to finish all of the content. If you choose to use a walkthrough or a wiki, that's up to you, but I would suggest not doing so.",

            "review_text": "Terraria is a 2D adventure survival game developed by Re-Logic. You explore your world, loot the hell out of it until it's nothing more but a dead husk, and then consume the next world on harder diffiulty. Of course I doubt anyone really cares whether Terraria is an actually good game or not (trust me it is, and I'll get into that). But people are far more concerned as to which one they should buy- Minecraft, Starbound, some tiny indie devs trying to be like Minecraft Starbound or Terraria, and finally Terraria.  My objective here today is to write this review to settle some potential buyer's worries or to just flat out tell them that THIS IS NOT ♥♥♥♥ING MINECRAFT! Terraria is kind of hard to define for me because it can be many different things depending on how you want to play it. For some, it's just a simple PVE game. A side scroller. A PVP game (rarely). A looter. An adventure game. A co-op game, etcetera etcetera.  There are of course limitations to this freedom, but overall this game will give you a mountain of content to chew through. There has to be at least over a thouand different items and armor sets to collect. That isn't even counting the costumes and accesseories to collect as well. So, does it hold a candle to other games like it? Well let me put it this way, it takes Mojang about a year or more while under Microsoft just to throw in a new animal or monster. Meanwhile Terraria invites several different mobs with other additions along with the update if that isn't enough to fix your belly aching.  Though I'm going after little fish, Minecraft lost it's place in the survival genre race years ago. Starbound basically takes the base of Terraria and adds several more layers to it. Granted, it lacks the diverse and crazy loot Terraria has. But if you ever wanted a game about exploration, narrative, and has Terraria's base gameplay, then that's your winner winner chicken dinner.  Terraria has everything it needs to keep itself floating above the ground. But with Starbound fully released it needs to bring out the bigger guns. Right now Terraria has a very empty late game. Once you beat the game, and you craft the strongest weapons and armour, there is absolutely NOTHING you can do with that new gear besides fight the final boss again on a harder difficulty. Not too long ago they released a horde mode event based on the Dungeon Defenders game to remedy this issue. But I have gripes with it (mostly the difference in artstyle with Terraria's and the new mob's competing. They just look out of place).   I can get over the artstyle, but nothing excuses the fact that horde mode (especially at the rate you get Defender Points) is tedious. This isn't end game content that will keep people busy. Which is why I think people are doing the same thing as myself, play Starbound until the next update for Terraria comes. And I really can't blame them. Because the biggest question you shouldn't be asking at the end is not 'Well, now what?'  So which do I think is better? Both Terraria and Starbound have pretty major flaws making both games equals, but neither is better than the other. What do I personally suggest you do? Get either one or both. Both Starbound and Terraria have enough content combined to keep you busy for months. If you still aren't convinced, wait for a sale and try it out yourself.",

Since there are so many different bricks/blocks to build with, the possibilities were just endless!  Then I found another friend who also plays the game, and with his help I got a lot farther in hardmode and finally beat the final boss (Moon Lord), although initially it was quite a struggle.  With the additional content in the newest update, I started playing around 8pm. With a few breaks (mostly to deal with my rabbit), I was playing and playing and the next thing I knew, it was 7am! XD The time just totally flew by without me realizing it.  So for those who are builders, this is a great game to play. For those who like to beat bosses of ever increasing difficulty, there's a lot of that in this game, too! I most definitely recommend it! :D",

There's always something new to explore and see. Randomly generated worlds offer variation while allowing for familiarity with the mechanics as you progress. Your characters can easily move from world to world, without having to even open their last one. You can even have one world that you slowly tear apart to acquire the materials to build your dream home on the second one.  You can create machines, host a capture the gem competition between yourself and a dozen close friends, or battle giant flying skulls with arms, aliens, a wall made of flesh, or spiders bigger than your head. You can make armor out of gold, bone, or mythical metals. You can fly a giant drill that uses lasers to tear up the ground in wide swathes. You can build a city full of merchant's shops and homes for those aforementioned capture the gem friends. You can make giant billboards, a computer, or death traps for when the Blood Moon rises and the zombies come to eat your brains.....  You can dye your hair a literally sparkling purple. You can build a tree for the holidays. You can wear an umbrella on your head or dress like a wood nymph. And so many housing styles - dungeon, wood, ice, marble, the list goes on.

It quickly became has continued to be one of my favourite games of all time.   I've always been a sucker for games where you can shape the world and build fun things like minecraft, so even a 2d creative game like this would pull me in.  Another thing I really appreciate about this game is the combat. Normally I'm not much of a fighter. In fact, I'm pretty terrible at games with a lot of combat. But, for some reason, I really like fighting in Terraria. Maybe it's the 2d style that makes it easier for me, maybe it's just the wide variety of weopons and enemies.   Mostly though, this game just sucks me in to the point where I forget about time. I can play for hours when I'm into it.",

It also included new bosses, and 'expert mode'. So I give the updates a 9.5/10. The updates are good, but they take time to be released.   Now, the building aspect of the game. The building looks pretty good, but can get a bit boring if you want to build something big. So a simple house would be fun! So I give the building 9/10; building something big, like an adventure map, will be boring and take hours to make, but once you've finished it will be fun and worth it!   Now, Multiplayer. Multiplayer can be fun, for a while. if you are building something, it will get boring very quickly, but like I said, it will be worth your time. Despite the fact that this is my favourite game, I didn't really enjoy the online servers. I did like the PVP servers, but they got boring after a while. I give the multiplayer 8/10.  Now the end-game. When I finished the game, I was satisfied! Even after you finish the game, you can still try to get all the items, try all the character modes (softcore, Mediumcore and hardcore). Even after that, you can still finish expert mode. End game: 9/10  Overall I give this game 9.5/10. This is a MUST-BUY for all steam users!",

You start to mine and get small upgrades. Over time, your armor and tools will be powerful enough to fight a boss. You likely fight the eye of Cthulhu first, it being the weakest. You probably die and have to try mulitple times but eventually you defeat the boss. Same goes on with the many other bosses in the game. Once you've beaten the final boss, you kinda win. Of course, however, the game is so addicting that it sucks you in so that you can get all of the achievements. After that, you still play for thousands of hours because the game is simply fun. There is fishing, too. You can have pets, mounts, grappling hooks and a whoopie cushion... yeah. Multiplayer is also supported if you would like to play with your friends. As many as you want, I think. Anyway, great game, would reccomend,  Note: This game is a literal time machine. I played for what felt like 2 hours and instead 7 hours went by.",

Well, terraria, where to begin, how should i tell you what adventures me and my friends went through? It'll go through a simple Pro &amp; Cons schematic, like most reviews. I'll do warn you, walls of text are inbound.   Pro's:  - Loads of content: Terraria has alot of content, from day 1 it was released and now on this day, with probably 3 times as much content as before and probably still increasing with every update. You'll probably be busy with 1 character/world for around 20-80 hours, depending on expertise with Terraria itself.  - Character and worlds aren't linked: So you have a good character, with good gear, but a totally ruined world and want to start a new world, but you want to keep your character's items? Well, no worry, as this game got you covered and let's you carry over all your items your character has on them from world -&gt; world.  - Character customisation: The character customisation is not all the fancy stuff with sliders and stuff. But, you'll have a large choice of haircuts, 3 sets of clothing themes, and you can colour all possible options with 3 primary colour sliders. It's a small thing, but it can make all the difference to a game like Terraria.  - Easy to get into: Terraria is easy to get into. You won't get stuck on what to do as you will always have an array of multiple things to do. Bored of building? Let's go cavemining, go fishing, or even try that boss which you just so happened to get the spawn-item for.  - Great with friends: This game just gets better with the more friends you have on 1 server. The help with bosses, the hijinx about who gets what loot and the question: 'where did all the iron in the chest go?'.  - Has lots of replayability: Bored of 1 world? How about you start another on your own, or with friends. The worlds are always randomly generated and you'll never know what will happen on your playthrough, except ofcourse, the boss battles. Which will stay the same throughout playthroughs.   Cons:  - Not that many, actually!: Terraria had some cons, back in the day, as you would have needed to host a private server before you and your friends could join eachother. But nowadays you can join eachother through steam. Furtheron most bugs got fixed and it's a fluid game overall.  - Endgame is actually the 'END'game: Once at endgame, after defeating all the bosses, best loot, best enchantments... Well, there isn't actually much to do anymore expect brag your character to your friends and continue building in your world. As there isn't that much more progress to be made with your character.    TLDR;  Go get it, now. Or when it is on sale. You certainly won't regret it. It's a great game with almost no negative aspects to it. ",

Fast forward a few months and someone drags me back to minecraft and there, after having experienced terraria's caves with the chests and 'ruins', i felt that the exploration wasn't as rewarding, there was something missing with MC's cave splunking. That's when Terraria started to strike a note with me but that wasn't enough to sell me on it. What really sold me was when i saw 1.3.0.1 patch notes (a friend had gifted me the game a year or so ago) and decided to give the game another spin. And what a hell of a ride, between the new mobs, bosses and invasions i was dying left and right and loving every second of it and the game even made me want to build something besides a whole bunch of commieblocks for me and my NPCs.

Every aspect of the combat and controls are amazing, the world is vast, its inhabitants diverse, and it is flush with different world/environmental mechanics. Enemy difficulty has a wonderful range. Add to that a dedicated developer that has continued to support the game well past its 'prime' with tons of new content, and this is a must buy for any fan of the genre.

And that's for two reasons: There's a huge breadth of things to do, and the game progression is such that starting over with a fresh new character in a new world is *fun*.  There's infinite worlds to explore, a mind-boggling variety of items you can use with different effects (with armor and accessories tending to boost one of four archetypes you can switch between at will), and tons of enemies and bosses (over 20 unique bosses!). You can build elaborate (or simple) houses, towns, arenas, item-farming areas or more. Dress up your character in costume outfits and swap out armor dyes. Summon harmless pets, aggressive minions or helpful mounts. And if you 'win', or get bored of your world, you can just generate an entirely new world and/or start all over! Your new world will probably even have a couple features that didn't generate at all in the first one.  The difficulty starts simple and scales up for a very long time as you progress. Exploration, combat and building are both fun. And best of all, the developer releases huge *free* updates every so often with lots of new content (new bosses, events, areas, entirely new game mechanics like fishing and expert mode). I've seen paid expansion packs with far less content than these guys add for free every six months.",

So as you can see I've been playing a lot of the game lately and even though I've played that much there are still endless posibilities of what I could do next. Beat Plantera, make a bigger house, go mining, etc. And that is why I love the game so much. There is just so much content to explore and so many bosses I haven't beaten yet which is why I think you should buy this game. Just do it, its great! And here is another thing: I started out on games by playing minecraft and i thought it was great until I realized that there isn't much to it. Like only 2 Bosses as of now and only about 4,000 items (9 of them weapons). And Terraria...  Way too many items that I want to count and over 50 weapon types, 13 bosses AND over 80 enemies! (right now there are more) so, Tell me is Minecraft with it's occasional updates or Terraria with few updates but many thing in each of them. you know what now that I've compared it with Minecraft I just want to tell you that Terraria has an outfit OF A CREEPER FROM MINECRAFT. That means that Terraria might be higher than minecraft but if you want to think Minecraft is better I just want you to know that. And don't get me wrong I love Minecraft, but to me Bigger is better, not graphics, just more so now I think I should give Terraria a little more credit and say, I rate Terraria, (One infinity)/2",

They are more optimized; you can attack from far or get close for some melee hits. Many town NPCs will sell you useful items for copper, silver, gold, and platinum coins. The Tavernkeep will sell some things for coins but mostly for defender medals.  Lastly, there are many biomes to explore like the forest, corruption, and the underworld. They have unique enemies and bosses, along with items.  Terraria is worth the money you pay, and there are no in-game purchases. You can also get Terraria on console and mobile, but Steam version is much more optimized. Good luck, Terrarians!",

I best be honest here, I haven't actually played Minecraft - due to   refusal to jump on the bandwagon   or some such ♥♥♥♥. But honestly, it's a good game.  A friend purchased this for me during a sale Steam had a while ago (Review written on 16/12/2014, so not the Winter Sale, whatever was before) and the attitude I approached it with was 'Right, it's one of   those   games. Y'know, crafting games.'  And to be fair, it is. You mine blocks, the those blocks are in the inventory, place them. You can build shelters/structures. You can be really creative, or really minimalist. There's is a learning curve involved.   The memories of being bitten in the ♥♥♥ will haunt me forever  . I've been better, but coming from a background of avoiding Minecraft/associated block-building games altogether, I thought '  Why the hell not?    The download was quick, the music is fitting - but after a while, it does grow tedious. I highly recommend YouTube in the background. The graphics are, well, 2D. The   content   as in - block-building - I can take, because it's 2D, and you get that vibe. I think I can't take Minecraft like I did Terraria because it's 3D, but that's just my opinion.  I highly recommend it, but only using Skype/Teamspeak (if they even do a room or whatever) and a service like Hamachi or Evolve to be able to play and chat with friends. I imagine the single-player grows stale pretty quickly, but you might be into that sort of thing.  If you're more into numbers - 8/10",

There's always something to do, see, create, fix, build, fight or experience. It's truly a transcendent product that spans all interests and genres. There's not much I can say which hasn't already been said. This isn't just Minecraft. It is a very distinct product and everything from how you gather resources to the boss fights to the building is different.  It's not hard to learn. In fact, 10 minutes on YouTube will teach you most everything you need to survive. But there's always the next step, next goal and that's going to take some effort. But if you put forth the effort it will be rewarded.   There are countless reviews that talk about the gameplay, so I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to talk about what appeals to me. The graphics are adorable and the music great. I spent probably 5-10 hours just crafting my own little village and another dozen creating a fort to protect myself against invasions by goblins, monsters and other creatures. I built a massive water tower, a tunnel all the way to the bottom of the world and I flooded hell. I built an underwater glass tunnel through a massive hole that I cleared from corruption. I created a cloud world. I created my own personal pyramid. I created my own stadium to have boss fights in.  It's that combination of creativity and challenge that is so very rare in gaming and Terraria has it in spades. The highest recommendation I can make is simply this: there are exceptionally few games that belong in everyone's collection. They're so rare they can probably be counted on two hands. Games that offer something to everyone and do so well are incredibly rare. Pac Man. Mario. RollerCoaster Tycoon. Games that can appeal to people from 5 years old, hardcore gamers and your grandmother. Terraria belongs on that list and it belongs on yours.  Moreover, years later there are still patches and content enhancements. You simply can't lose buying this one folks.",

At first, it is frustrating to no end when you've only got your copper shortsword and just the bare basics. Once you dig your first hole that goes STRAIGHT DOWN (yes, I said straight down, 'cause this ain't minecraft) and you throw your rope back up to the surface, you're on a roll. It's pretty easy and straightforward after that. Next, the multiplayer in this game is just awesome. You can run with a pretty crap internet connection and host a server with no lag for your friends. This game is at least 10 times better when you're playing with friends. You can collaborate and be more powerful - and be very successful. Just all around amazing. Last time I played this game was November 2012, and now I'm playing it again in January 2014, and I'm totally in love with this game. 10/10 I'm addicted, just as I'm addicted to the Call of Duty franchise.

Full list of pros/cons:  Pros: -Mix and matching classes -Too many bosses -Moonlord battle is ****ing awesome! -Variety of play styles -Isn't generic RPG/Sandbox hybrid #2 -Little guidance -Most computers are capable of running it Cons: -Some weapons are OP, this is especially bad when joining a PvP server  9.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10, not enough potatoes ",

Unlike most games with a construction element, in Terraria you always build with specific purpose. It could be to house a vibrant castle town full of NPC's with names and unique dialogue, it could be to prepare for a boss fight or it could be to create a farm of a specific biome.  Terraria always gives you goals, always rewards you and has a good concept of difficulty. Everything is possible, its just not normally easy.  I love this game.",

Graphics aren't the best, but hey I've grown to love the funky art style.   The first time I loaded in; I had my wiki page on stand-by to cater for my every enquiry...and trust me there will be lots. The learning curve is steep but climbable as you can quickly adapt and learn the different behaviours of the so called 'Mobs' or monsters if you will. The building part of the game is fun and works with ease; come to think of it every part of this game is somehow enjoyable in it's own little way.  The only downside Terraria has is that it may become tedious: Clicking at blocks to dig endless tunnels...Yes, this may seem boring and at times it is and you may feel about holding alt and slaming your angry finger down on f4 but no. The reward is much much better...I managed to build a skyscraper and a village surrounding it by plowing through the 'boring parts'.   Now when I spawn in and see my work, a smile shines on my face...This smile never appears in other games quite as much.  Now this Review is getting long (giggady) &lt;--*sorry I had to* so I'm going to shorten the other sections.   Multiplayer is bloody marvolous! Single Player is Fantastic! Terraria: best side-scrollin' survival? You bet your sweet sorry ♥♥♥ it is...  'IGN 10000000/10000000 would play again'",

But, of course, I'm not one to judge, but this IS a review, so meh.. The way I see this game is not just the bosses, NPC's, and the creativity of it, but mostly how Terraria is put out overall, mostly the story. Since I am a guy that loves anime and RPG's, you'd think that I'd would just hog over just one game and call it a day. Well, no, I have played many other games alike to this one, and especially Starbound. But for this game, it'll hold a special place in my heart because this is how I actually gotten into games in general, and the other fact that I have played this for four years now, it's quite amazing that I have known of it cause of a friend introducing it to me.   When I was first introduced to this game, I thought that it would just be another game alike to my first PC game experience, Minecraft. And even to this day I still love it so ever much. But when I played this game in a first-person view, I was more than captivated to find out this game really does have an opportunity for it in my life, so I continued to play it until my demise.   From what I'm trying to get at is to not just judge this game by its cover, mostly. And there's a difference between trying it and dislike it, or just watching others play it and give up on it. That's mostly all I gotta say for now, and if this review helps you, but you don't have enough money for it, I'll be more than happy to buy the game for you. So thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and I'll see you in my next review, toddles~",

            "review_text": "Honestly this is one of the best games I've played. I've played this on console and mobile, but never on PC until now. The PC version is way better than the console and mobile versions. The console and mobile versions are still stuck on 1.2.4.1 while pc is on 1.3.1.1. The console/mobile exclusives while great do not match the quality of 1.3.1.1 items. Ocram is a failure of a boss. His spawner is very expensive, he's hard to beat, and honestly he should be nerfed. People at RE-logic what were you thinking when importing Terraria on the console and mobile. Don't get me started with the exclusive armor sets, they are very expensive to craft and compared to the buffs and set bonuses they provide I don't think they are worth considering. Even after the 1.2 material requirement reduction of the hallowed armor, the exclusive armors are still very hard to craft and that's even if your world gets blessed with the right ores to craft the armor sets for the exclusive armor sets. If your world gets blessed with a hardmode ore that's not an ingrediant for an armor set for the exclusive armor sets you will have to make a new world and convert it into hardmode, farm Ocram for the exclusive armors or fish for crates. It's literally like you guys at re-logic just slapped in some incomplete ideas when importing terraria on the console and mobile and sticked with that. I've been playing terraria on pc for awhile and I say its way better than on the console and mobile versions. The Lunatic Cultist boss while difficult he isn't broken like ocram. He is very fun to pick with. The lunar events following the Cultist's death is OMG amazing 24/7. It really challenges the player alright with unique enemies with unique abillities and debuffs. The moon lord is wow. This boss is so amazing and awesome. This boss is the real challenge to the player. He looks disfigured, he has eyes in his hands, His brain is exposed, he has an exposed spine and no legs. Re-logic this is a masterpiece of a boss. And of course the drops, don't even ask, cause they are so OP. The items of 1.3.1.1 are awesome. The yoyos, the fragment weapons. The informational accessories, the endgame armors and weapons. The players on console and mobile are really missing out on this. I would recommend this game greatly and to any gamer and especially the pc version. This is my review of Terraria and rant of the Terraria exclusives. Hopefully you enjoyed reading my review of Terraria and maybe consider buying this game for yourself.",

And you can use weapons on mounts!!! :D  Terraria is like a whole new game now.. and i hope it carries on. Great game for how cheap it is!",

But then once I actually started playing the game and taking my time with it, there's a surprising amount of depth into this game. If you're looking for a game with loads of content and a long campaign to keep you busy, look no further than this.  Unlike Minecraft, this game has guns, NPC's that don't all look like Squidward, mobs out the wazoo that are all creative and sometime a really pain in the ♥♥♥ to deal with, much more powerful weapons, the list goes on. It's worth it's bargain bin price tag, especially if you have someone to play it with.  5 McLovin's out of 5",

This game fully uses every part of your pre generated map (It is still randomly generated but it makes the whole map before you play your world) to make you explore every part of your world.  Pros: +Bosses and Dungeons provide for things to do and a guarantee 50+ hours of playing +Crazy amount of items +Armor and wepons all scale well to diffrent times in the game depening on your progress +This game does not cut short on any part of its self, like the potion making etc. is very in depth +Very fun to play with and without friends +Very original and creative +Tons of content +Great price, even better price if it is on sale for 80% off +Good world and player system, they are kept seprate and no player is linked to no world  Cons: -The ♥♥♥♥ing chest system sucks ♥♥♥♥*FIXED -The game most likely will not get more up dates -Can take a lot of time to get started into some real fun -Mining for ore was annoying -Not a lot of cons to put down  SO SHOULD YOU BUY IT !??!?!?!??!

Thow bombs, dig,build,shoot guns,build house for your npcs, plus much much more and you can do it all in this game.",

It starts out a little slow, and with no guidance from friends or videos, it can be a little tedious.    Final Verdict: It can be confusing and slow at the start, but once things get going, it's really fun overall.  My Personal Rating: 8.5/10",

However, the game's multiplayer mode is, I believe, lacking. Once you finish all the in-game quests, have the best weapons, and explore the whole map, you will probably quit. All in all, this game will have you hopelessly addicted for maybe a month or so, but eventually you will likely abandon the game. I would give it a 6/10.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

Many references are made in this game to other games as well that just give you an ah ha moment. The scaling in this game is the one quirk, it is really not an issue though. For example when you first start a world you are fine, you mine ores etc and rank up. Then after defeating the    Wall of Flesh    and entering    Hardmode    you get reKt by everything, but after putting enough time into it your items become so God-like any boss in the game becomes a cake walk.

Well, I'm here to tell the truth, and while there aren't many cons to terraria, the three main things you need to take into consideration:   - Dies out kinda fast when playing alone. A lot of the replayability comes from the fun of playing with another person, trying community maps, etc. May not apply to everyone, but applies to me and my friends so I would take that into consideration if you intend to only play Singleplayer.  - Poor compatibility with new OS versions, frequent break reports every time a new OS version is released.  - Requires guiding from the internet or another player because just like Minecraft or Garry's Mod, it has no intent in helping you whatsoever. May not be a negative if you like that kind of stuff, but it does require commitment and some people don't like it so it's good to take that into consideration.  Just taking this out of my stomach. This is not a negative review per se, I still think Terraria is an amazing game despite these three flaws (look at my playtime!), but this ♥♥♥♥ is seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Oh and By the Way... The game is pretty good as well.",

Not once, nor twice, but thrice was I knocked off to my doom. Later when I came to investigate I saw my castle in ruin. The floor was plastered with bird feces and smelt of racous sex and booze. I was devestated. My 30 minutes of work had been ruined by the Icarus clan. 0/10.    In all honesty though its a pretty good game.

On top of being a super fun game with a really high replayability, it has an extremely large fan base. The developers of the game actually listen to suggestions made by terraria players in general, and make sure to give good progress reports when it comes to spoilers for upcoming updates. I've never had any problems with the game crashing and no issues with FPS fluctuation or lag of any kind, which is surprising considering the fact that I play on a relatively old and slow laptop in general. Whenever I feel burnt out on other games I always put in a few more days worth of gameplay into this game because it never gets stale. In a few years' time when Terraria 2 is released, I'm more than likely going to put hundreds, if not thousands of hours into playing it, guaranteeed.  Overall, I would give this game a 14.5/15.  Would give it a 15/15, but I've been going insane waiting for Terraria 1.3 to come out. The loss of half of a point represents my sanity, but that's more of a personal issue than anything and has nothing to do with the gameplay in the slightest.  Well done Re-Logic.",

However the one drawback i also like to mention is that it can be hard on the start if you wonder to far to different biomes which can limit your exploration.

Each class is very different and you can switch classes whenever you want (If you farm the gear). With different biomes based on what world you get, and different ores for each world, the replayability can last forever. Oh yeah, and you can have your world on either Normal or Expert mode. On Normal... it's Normal, the way it was meant to be played. But on Expert, the Bosses and mobs get harder, smarter, and more Loot-Droppier, along with specific Expert mode items and feature, such as an Extra accessory slot.

Terraria, is very different from minecraft, It has a focus more on fighting and crafting, Minecraft has it's focus on building. Terraria still has amazing building mechanics, and thousands of blocks to choose from. And it has thousands of weapons and armors, and lots of ores to mine.  Complicated or simple? Terraria is both complicated and simple. The crafting is complicated and hard to get used to, but after a few hours, you get used to it. The fighting is quite simple, click to attack, mouse to aim, even though it's simple, the fact that there are so many weapons make it pretty complicated.  Choice or confinement? Terraria gives you a lot of choice, so much choice, that at times, it gets overwhelming. There are so many weapons, so many ores, so many NPC's, so many classes. But after a while it becomes obvious what class fits your playstyle. Terraria also is really big on exploring, the world is big, and there are lots of cool things you can discover.  Who would I recommend this to? People that like options. People that like tons of bosses. People that like a game that lets you set your own pace.  Who do I not recommend this to? Anyone that is not willing to spend an hour to learn the crafting system. Someone who likes short games.  Rating I would give Terraria My rating of 9/10",

The devs have been great at adding content into this game which by the way are FREE patches that come with all sorts of new things to do and craft. I would still recommend this game any day and can't wait for the next patch to come out.  EDIT 2: I nominated this game for being the game I'll always come back to!  First off, I have few hours on the Steam version of Terraria, but I have sunk a lot of hours into the console port and this game is amazing. You start off small with just a few tools. You start to chop down trees and fight off some slimes. Then you can go mining which is where the fun begins. You pick up new materials to build better tools and fight off more enemies and explore the depths of caves and biomes. You can travel east or west for quite a distance (depending on world size) and one of the sides will be a surprise for you, but don't attempt to go in. Break the curse at night is all I will say. Bosses in this game can be hard and you will have to actually get better gear and armor and maybe even set up a special arena.   This game has a ton of content to keep you playing. I would give this game a 8/10 as there could be a few minor improvements (in my opinion) which may even be addressed in a future update.",

Many people like to compare this game to Minecraft, but I feel that this is an incorrect analogy. Terraria very heavily encourages combat, fighting bosses, exploring, and “leveling-up” (done in the form of collecting heart crystals and stars to increase health and mana). There is a metric-ton of things to do, items to craft, etc. in this game. In fact, there is so much stuff that ironically you wind up wondering what to do. Terraria’s greatest weakness is too much content and not enough direction. If you plan to play this game, you should just go ahead and bookmark the wiki, because you’re going to be going there every five-fifteen minutes trying to figure out where to get this component or why this summoning item doesn’t work. But don’t let this discourage you. If you put in the initial time, you will get an incredible amount out of it, especially since its always going on sale for $2.49. It seemed for me that my enjoyment of the game would come in stages. Sometimes I would wake up and all I would want to play was Terraria. Other times, I could let it sit for days without so much as looking at it.  The start is slow, progression sometimes confusing, but ultimately this game is just incredibly fun. If you are interested in this game, I would definitely recommend it, especially if it is on sale.",

I have never played a game with such dedicated and thoughtful developers, who listen to the voices of their fans and have a legitimate relationship with them. So hats off endlessly to the Re-Logic team, who make all of our lives better. Who allow us to ride unicorns looking like a pumpkin whilst rolling a yoyo on the ground ahead. Whose bosses range from an Eldritch Horror to a mechanical Santa. Who allow us to fight a giant robot worm with an army of cute little pirate minions.

I mean, this is probably the most accurate review I've ever written. I feel like the pickaxe will be fine. In terrarria you'd probably have like a silver pickaxe or something. Silver turns black when it tarnishes, so you got to polish your silver before the guests come over. Not in terrarria though, nothing rusts or tarnishes. Also sweet sweet metorite ore. Or what? Yeah, meteorite ore, but you'll need a pretty high level pickaxe to mine that shiz, yo. It's on fire. You'll need some fireproof boots. I don't even play this game. I did make a copper castle though that was pretty much the best with lava moats even seriously it was super awesome. In conclusion, probably the worst game I've ever played where you can make super sweet copper castles and dig down far enough in the ground to retrieve lava for the moat....",

Only downsides:  - Garunteed to rage at least once, as the enemies can be overpowered! - Not much else!  Good fun, try it out :)",

There are around 10 types of arrows in the game. You can collect rare items that are only obtainable from monsters (Like a gun that shoots RAINBOWS. Amazing.) But its not all sunshine and bunnies in this land... Evil spreads from across the land and these places are only known as the corruption (Purple) and the Crimson (Red) You can craft many decorations for your home and can even collect banners and (if you`re lucky enough) a trophy from one of the many bosses that await a challenge. In every world there is a deep dungeon that will test your survival skills. If you get past the guardian you can venture downwards into the depths of the dungeon and find loot. (There is alot of loot in this game... Alot.) If you happen to defeat the tough as hell boss in hell your world will change into hard mode. In this mode new monsters appear and the old ones get stronger. New bosses can be fought and much more loot can be found. Plus there are alot of items you can only get in Hard mode. But once you activate Hard mode the Corruption and the Crimson will spead even faster. But a new biome will spawn. One that is the opposite of the Corruption/Crimson. And is literally sunshine and rainbows.  So... Thats my 'brief' overview of Terraria.  Plus you can make shades. 11/10",

I blew an absurd amount of time on this, and managed to get it on sale...so my opinion is colored by that quite a bit, perhaps.  It's 2D Minecraft: you build a base, explore caverns to get more things for your base, and kill monsters while doing so. Occasionally a boss will show up, which is pretty awesome.  Key points:  The graphics are quite simple: I don't think that's a serious drawback, given the nature of the game.  The crafting mechanic is much better than in Minecraft: you don't have to worry about the specifics of crafting, but rather only that you have the materials and crafting station necessary to craft the thing you want. That said, it's not always true that the thing you need is in the game world you develop, which is a little annoying. It's not a major deal-breaker, though.  I am somewhat sad that your base can be made absolutely impenetrable: enemies cannot break blocks, so unless you're facing a boss, you can just hole up in your house and not worry about monsters invading your house *ever*. It also makes it unreasonable to *want* to build your house out of harder-to-get bricks.   There's also no creative mode. :(  Nonetheless, it's an incredible game: you have quite the expanse of regions to go through, there's a lot of adventure to be had, and it's overall the best bang for your buck you are going to get on Steam.

Terraria has different difficulty settings, so there is no steep curve. The same concepts are re-used throughout the game, so once you master it early on, your focus is set on three things. Building, upgrading, and exploring. The weapon variety is decent enough, that you can choose the weapon (or tool) to defend yourself.  Don't go back to 3D sandboxes after this.",

It's probably my favorite game I've ever played, and has everything you need to keep you hooked for a long time.  I don't think I can think of an element of the game that is bad, from the soundtrack to the art of sprites, mechanics and the wide variety of weapons, armor, equipment, vanity items, building blocks so many you always discover a new one you didn't think existed before. Events, amazing biomes and world generation and exploration, pyramids, caves, undiscovered shrines and floating islands... I'm getting excited just by writing about it.  There is not a single person I wouldn't recommend this game to, specially with the low price and the constant sales it gets.

This game is a very controversial topic because a lot of people think its a ripoff of HINT HINT THAT OTHER REALLY POPULAR BUILDING/BLOCKY GAME. However, I'm not saying that Terraria doesn't have similar features to Minecraft. Yes, you cut trees, yes sand has gravity, yes this game has iron and gold, and yes, there is a Creeper costume. The first part of this review will be a little ranty, I'll just be talking about how Terraria is different from Minecraft.  On the first note, trees are well... a common natrual resource, even in real life there are trees used for building things (WOAH I DIDN't KNOW.) Sand that has gravity, alright, this could be directly inspired by MC, but c'mon, it's just one thing. Third, there being iron and gold is also similar to number one, iron is used for a lot of things in real life. Gold... although both games do have gold, and real life has gold, we don't use it a lot...  Alright, what is Terraria? Terraria is a 2d Block Based RPG. You are placed in a world with yourself and 3 tools, a pickaxe, axe, and a copper shortsword. Using these you must build yourself up and eventually reach endgame. Unlike other games, Terraria has no end, you just might run out of things to do. The game has RPG elements, different style of gameplay, (e.g. the basic classes of Warrior, archer and mage.) There is also a lot of building, but in my opinion if you aren't a pixel artist or some sort of talented architect, there's less excitement in it than for instance, dungeon delving or boss fighting. Terraria has lots and lots of NPCs, of course there's your typical enemy NPC, but there's also friendly NPCs, which serve as special functions. Terraria has a randomly generated world, but it's not infinite. In fact, certain game mechanics would be impossible if it was.   Now, this game also has a multiplayer, which is basically just like the singleplayer but with other people, I've spent probably 95% of my time on multiplayer, for me singleplayer gets boring.  In my opinion, Terraria is a great game, I recommend this.",

We all have Minecraft accounts and that's what got us into PC gaming, as it was the only game we played for a real long time (I don't know what my time in that game would be, but it's probably somewhere above 2,000 hours) and we all agree this feels like a heavily modded version of Minecraft since it's so awesome and has the same feel we get when we play Minecraft, but this game does a better job of teaching us how to play.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...    ...9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    'What's the difference?' How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!    Oh, this is so hard!    Heating, cooling",

I played Minecraft for a few months, but quickly got bored of it. The only time I actually PLAY Minecraft is if I go on a server, but they are not all reliable. Some of them allow you to cuss, and I had to learn that the hard way. Terraria has 14 Bosses, but Minecraft has 3. Terraria has over 50 different sets of armor and swords, but Minecraft has 5. Basically, Terraria is good for looting, fighting, and advancing in game. Minecraft is good for building and sharing with friends. Overall, I like Terraria better. Wait, this is a Terraria review, not a Minecraft review. Moving on!  Here is what this game is about. You start out in a custom world where you have to advance in game and fight to survive. Along the way you find some computer characters to help you advance in game. You build, fight, loot, and survive! This game consists of several bosses and enemies, which is what i like about this game most.  This is a very fun game, but there are a few questionable things about it. First of all, I'm christian, so I don't like all of this stuff about Demons and Voodoo Dolls. I kind of wish they could change that, but it's too late now. Also, some of the bosses are pretty gross, such as the Brain of Cthulu. At least they have a setting for shutting off Blood And Gore. I'd say this game is more for teenagers, not for children.  Besides that, this is a pretty good game. But I wouldn't recommend it for young ones or Christians. If you're neither of those, then BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY!",

Little did he know it would become the worst choice he had ever made in his life. Him and his bestie Jimmeh and Panda started hacking wood like they were slappin their own ♥♥♥♥♥ with lube, harvesting all the ores and making better music than Don Cheadle on a kazoo. The only thing that was stopping them were Michael Jackson looking mother♥♥♥♥ing zombies that would rip their own limbs off and hit them in the ♥♥♥♥ing beans with them, incinterating all hope of inseminating a fine vietnamese girl and creating havoc amongst the community. Once the tombstones were cleared and everyone finished cleaning the rotten ogre ♥♥♥ out of their ani they commuted into the deep unknown region similar to your mother's ♥♥♥♥♥ called the corruption. It was worse than Detroit during black history month, and they had to survive soul eaters similar to that of a Jewish lawyer. Once they deemed the dirty chasms not worth their time, they began to leave. The only thing that stopped them was a shiny anal-bead like ball, covered in worm slime from the mama world eater. They did not know this, and began stroking the bead too hard. Jimmy broke it between his anal sphincter and let the blood flow, but was swiftly killed by a big ♥♥♥ worm. His tiny pee pee lay hard on the ground, and Tyrone and Panda killed the worm using their old ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that had run out of batteries. The next step was killing a GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING EYE THAT TRIES TO ♥♥♥♥ING EAT YOU WHILE THEY JUMPED AROUND THEIR HOUSE AND THEIR RACIST ♥♥♥ NIGGER GUN DEALER WAS KILLED IN THE BASEMENT. After that they naturally went to hell like good Christians and killed satan's bretheren, all the while loving the smell of burning ♥♥♥♥ pubes. Before this they had done funny as ♥♥♥♥ like killed some demented old man and raided his caverns, but that is a whole nother story. When they threw the guide in the lava, he screamed a torturous yell as his dirty tip-giving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ filled with molten rock. A giant wall of living ♥♥♥♥♥♥l wall eroded the rest of the group as they ran, simulating a Japanese hentai, shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazors and tenticular anal sodomy into the group's asses. The only thing keeping them going was the thought of pixies and night negros that would happen in hard mode. So they ♥♥♥♥ed that ♥♥♥♥♥'s day up, then immediately died in hard mode. This happened over and over until they farmed enough crystals and loot to do something, then went home and ♥♥♥♥ed ♥♥♥♥ up. The game then got super boring when we got everything, so we ended up pvping on other servers or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jimmeh until his ♥♥♥♥ bled pure dark red blood cells in a pile, then we quit, but we would always come back for more a few months later, and put over 400 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS INTO A VIDEO GAME WHERE YOU KILL SLIMES AND ♥♥♥♥ING WASTED OUR LIFE PLAYING THIS GOD DAMN GAME. THEN WE ♥♥♥♥ING BOUGHT STARBOUND WHICH IS THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ JUST WITH MORE HENTAI. GOD DAMN!   Overall, anal hentai with ♥♥♥♥♥, 10/goldfish would UPDATE  -Hulk Hogan 1998",

What is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said? I don't know, but I will try, sorry for any possible repetitions:  +Terraria is a Adventure/Sandbox style game, based more around fighting, adventure and loot, instead of building, like in other sandbox games, +Terraria boast a large amount of unique weapons ranging from Ice bows, to Guns that fire explosive bunny rabbits, with large diversity, you can play the game in your own style, no two attempts are the same! +Terraria has a vast vanity system, with all types of items paying refernce to many popular icons,  Terraria is a huge time eater, you can start playing and only stop when light creeps through your curtains and you question yourself, thinking 'Why has there been two sunrises within an hour?' +This large amount of time feels more like an investment rather than a waste, as you feel like every kill, every ore, every drop brings you closer to your ultimate goal of being the best, almost every enemy has it's own unique drop that you can get, so attacking the same enemies never feels dull or drab, especially with the 1.2 random enemy generator, that makes all the common enemies have multiple style and appearances. +Terraria holds many milestones and bosses for the player, beautifully spaced out so that the player will encounter one after the other, but not so close as to overwhelm the player. +NPCS! You can build yourself a merry little town of people who will help you along your journey, each with there own shops that get set up after certain goals have been attained. Giving the player a break to build a village if they tire from slaughter,  Art style, Opinions of art styles vary hevily from person to person, in my opinion I feel terraria makes an excellent job at capturing the 16-bit vibe, with excellent chip-tunes backing up the whole ensemble, making an altogether memorable experince. -While there are many, many things to do in Terraria, if you get stuck on a boss, which you will, it takes a very long time to get into a position where it is possible to defeat it, while I have complimented the progression above, It does have it's flaws, later in the game you will encounter a hard mode, while hard mode on it's own is well built and challenging, the difficulty curve for the bosses is unforgiving, The hard mode bosses are nigh-on impossible in single player with the best gear available at the time, as these bosses can encounter the player at any night after the first in hard mode, the player can be caught heavily off guard and could lose some villagers.  All-in-All I could not recommend Terraria more, this is a solid purchase! I give complete recommendations to buy this if you have even the slightest of interests, you will not be disapointed, especially at the great price point!  ~Clawedcrab☺",

Oh well, anywho, Terraria is a 2D sidescroller with a heavy emphasis on exploration and combat rather than the grinding and repitition of other games in a similar genre. With absurd amounts of content already in the game, and more on the way in the 1.3 update (Of which is now here, and awesome), you wil be playing for quite a while. Albeit it does have both crafting and mining, it is not the 2D Minecraft everyone (Who played Mincraft + was under 12) was screaming it was when Terraria first released into beta (Or was alpha the first public release? if someone could clear that up in the comments, that would be great).  For the MMO players out there, there is a soft-classing system (No actual restrictions), as specialization to a certian weapon type can be benificial. Servers are able to be extremely large, and group play is common.   Combat is non-targeting, so you must aim your shots, with the majority of melee weapons being the exception, most of them swing where you are facing. Very few ranged weapons are hitscan, as most are projectile based with travel time. Guns have no arc of fire, while bows and most throwing weapons do. Grenades are also a thing. Movement is extremely important when fighting, as enemies and bosses do a great deal of damage and knockback. IMO, it's quite fun.  NPCs can also a thing, and will move into homes that you have built for them. Having NPCs allows the purchasing of basic equipment, equipment you can only get from them, construction/destruction/terraforming items, and healing. NPCs also stop enemy spawns near your town.  Overall, it has a great deal of exploration with a focus on combat. I would recommend it to anyone interested in those things, and can tolerate the lack of almost any story whatsoever.",

Talk to him and he'll give you tips on how to play the game. There is somewhat of a goal, you can create multiple houses for people to move in which can benefit you.  Gameplay: Gameplay wise, Terraria plays very similiar to Minecraft, but in 2D. You can craft items, build houses and other things and explore caverns and dungeons. It's very fun.  Graphics: Terraria's graphics remind me of Super Nintendo, with their retro looking style. New gamers might be put off by this, but don't turn the game down because of that.  Music: Terraria's music is well composed, i've enjoyed every piece of music so far the game has played for me. I really liked the snow world music.  Overall, i give the game 9/10.

X' Years ago (2011), I learned that Regedit released another game known today as Terraria. I was hyped and bought this game on the official website. It was everything I thought and more and I was deeply in love with it. I stopped playing for a few years just so I can see it evolve more and more. In 2016, I got this game as an early birthday present and started playing again. Hyped for what this game has become, I played a few hours of single player. The game felt different, and in a bad way. Everything that made it simple and fun now is grindy and complicated. In this 'new' Terraria you basically grind to get better 'toys' Everything seems too complicated and you need a guide for everything. The game isn't beginner friendly and you can become overwhelmed by the amount of things that you should be doing. The game punishes you for being ignorant, and only the wise ones can actually enjoy the game.   I really (really) tried to like this new Terraria, but it never satisfied me like the old version.

The 2d presentation and combat came across as overly simplistic. I found the constant bombardment of hostile monsters to be an annoyance, even though I didn't have any trouble killing them.  Lastly, there wasn't enough explanation as to what I was supposed to do. For example, you've built a 2d house with a tiles to the left, right, and above you. If nothing is walking behind you and you can't move off that single 2d plane, then how would you intuitively know that the house requires a background wall? Especially since monsters can still spawn if the background wall is 'natural' as opposed to placed there by you?  The guide is a joke. His tips are useless and he actually got me killed by opening my door and leaving it open at night, hiding behind me while the monsters that followed him into my house beat me to a pulp. Getting killed by the dude that was supposed to be helping me adjust to the world is what caused me to drop the game.  Just not for me.",

Due to this and the low replay value, the game gets boring fast when all the content is discovered through endless grinding of course, which is probably the reason why the developers decided to add in all the conetnt in it in the first place because its as if they knew it would be the game's only backbone, as evident from the fanbase when they use this trait as their main argument of the game being worthwhile. On other notes the 2d nostalgia-dependent graphics harms the games buidling aspect as you are limited to a side view which gets quite annoying, as for the combat which is heralded as the game's main selling point against minecraft *drumroll*...... is basically just like minecrafts combat system, they both require spamming the attack button to defeat enemies which is again. boring. the only difference really is the gunz and majuks but you still have to spam. But to sum it up its basically zelda/final fantasy turned into a sandbox, which explains why it would have never appealed to me in a artistic sense.

All other ores are paired off so that only one out of each pair will spawn in a world. For pre-hardmode ores, this is determined at world generation; for hardmode ores, this is determined when the first, second, and third Demon Altar or Crimson Altar is destroyed. Within each pair, each member has an equal chance of spawning. Which ores are paired together are shown to the right. Only one of the hard mode ores will spawn, so multiple worlds might be necessary to get a certain ore(Adamantite for Suspicious Looking Skulls).  In all cases, equipment made from replacement ores will be statistically slightly stronger than equivalent equipment made from the original ore.' - Taken from  terraria.wikia.com   I really liked this game up until the devs did this. Basically, the new ore types they introduced to the game weren't simply added to the word generation, which is what I thought, because that would MAKE ♥♥♥♥ING SENSE. Either the original ore will be generated in your world, or the equivalent new ore, but never both. You can have copper or tin, but not both. You can have Adamantite or Titanium, but not both. A lot of items can be crafted by either equivalent ore types, but the items crafted out of the newly added ore types will -always- be better somehow. Even if they're statistically identical, the items made out of the new ore types will still sell for more. Basically in order to craft the best items in the game you'll probably want to generate multiple worlds just for mining. It's possible to obtain an ore type that didn't spawn in your world by using the extractinator, but who wants to do that? This is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

You hate playing with other people?  So i created a character and a world and poped in to start a play session. There was a guy walking around an some pots to my right. Video game insticts kicked in and I started destroying pots and getting stuff. From the moment I started the game there was a slow stream of slimes coming from the left side of the screen that I had to deal with. I press every button to figure out how to get to my inventory before just giving up. Then I hit escape and realize my inventory opens. What the ♥♥♥♥? Why did they think that was a good idea?? It also acts as the options screen as there is a small settings button in the bottom right corner that you probobly wont notice.  So I started looking at all the stuff from the pots when I started thinking, 'What am I supposed to be doing here?' I walked up to the guy that was walking around figuring he was there for a reason. After 5 minutes of fumbling around with him I figured out right click is the interaction button! Come to find out this guy is the tutorial. He has a handful of short messages that I guess are supposed to help you know what to do. Before I could finish reading all his stuff night came and a metric ton of floating eyes and zombies swarmed on me. You do so little damage to them and they kill you very very quickly. The eyes are also very hard to hit. So for about 15 minutes I would spawn, and die over and over until day came.  Then I decided to build a house. A staple for these types of game you would think. And thats when I realized. 'What the hell can you do with a 2d house? ♥♥♥♥ all is the answer to that question. After fighting with the interface to build a simple house I decided to start mining to see what I could get. The sprites are so small compared to you that it becomes frustrating to click all of the tiny crap so you can mine. Not to mention its hard to gauge the depth you are digging for stairs. In minecraft you know to dig 1 down because you can only jump 1 block high. Here however, you have no idea. My stairs ended up looking all deformed and messed up because screw trying to count each little sprite.  I then made a crafting table to try and craft something. I put one down and right click on it an nothing happens. After a while of fumbling about again I realize that you just stand next to it and the recipes show up in the player inventory screen. I just dont understand how people find this game entertaining in the least bit. Maybe they have never heard of minecraft?  After the crafting fun I start digging some more. A slime drops out of nowhere on my head and kills me.  I cant even bother trying this game again. It may get better after a few hundred hours and reading a bunch of guides but who the hell would want to do that? Ill just keep building massive cities and castles and going to the moon and messing with crazy mods in minecraft.",

This game, is hard, long, and to be honest not that fun.  ------------ PROS - Interesting idea - Nice graphics - Ok Multi-Player  ------------ CONS - Hard, i had to spend hours watching guides just to figure out how to survive a night. - Borring i just could not get into it - Hard to do stuff in, its hard to build a sword, or a pick, or craft anything else. ------------------ Conclusion This game, could have been fun, i dident like it, but other might",

I suppose multiplayer is more hectic and livelier, but the single player is very dull. It's a very good time waster, I'll give it that; when waiting for things to happen to me in real life I might play this for a bit, as it certainly distracts you from things, but it's just not something I want to play all the time.  My problem is not the graphics (although pixel based games are oversaturating the market) and it's not the sound (which sounds boring, but gets the job done). It's just the gameplay; Minecraft and this game share a lot of the same problems; HOWEVER, Terraria has way better combat than Minecraft, and it's NPC's are better as well; they have actual pathfinding, unlike Minecraft, in which enemies simply walk in a straight line toward you. Crafting is weird, and I have to say it is better and worse than Minecraft; it tells you what you need for an item from the getgo, but the way you craft seems unweildy (having to press esc and scroll through a very small menu at the bottom left).  All in all, I had more fun with this than Minecraft, but I still didn't have a lot of it. It's probably worth it to every single other person other than me, but it just isn't my thing.

The bosses are cruddy and really easy to fight. The only thing I like is the multiplayer mode, that still get's boring. Even with MODS, this game doesn't amuse me. So what this game have more crafting recipes, it's just pointless stuff. I think this game could have been better if it was 3D , because the fighting stinks in 2D, it's just hit, wait hit, wait hit, wait, dead! At least in Mincraft you have to worry about 3 dimensions. . Switching Softcore to mediumcore doesn't change a thing, it only changes what you drop. I think this game isn't worth ten bucks. Why don't every sad little troll who owns this game get Minecraft? I think their to stubborn to admit that this game is a piece of garbo ( compared to Minecraft) but I do like is the equipment, I'll give them that, it's still limited in 2D.",

            "review_text": "Guys you should listen to this and stop blowing him off. The graphics in this game are high quality compared to the last one. If you are a noob then i suggest getting this game because noobs find this game more fun like a 6/10 man its like when your a little kid and things seem bigger but i mean pros it like when you grow up and things r kindaa smaller so if you want i guess just by advanced warfare if u r good but if u r a noob at pc gaming then just buy this cause it will seem cooler so over all i would give this review a 9/10 and stop blowing him off guys but this game gets boring kinda fast its basiclly a dlc to the original that came out last year so over 9.5/10 buy this game just be careful because when you are playing on line lik this time some guy hacked money out of my pay pal account so i would just download an anti virus so just buy kasperski or super anti spyware but i would actually suggest avast because it works i would probobly give it a 4/10 compared to all of the other anti viruses for pc. One complante i have is that the crafting is not as good as it is in casle miner z. i mean why would it not be as good. in casle miner z you can make many items like guns and shovels and in minecraft you can make jukeboxes and in skyrim you can make Dragon Armor and these factors are not in the binding of isacc which really dissapoints me. Also i cant seem to find the first person mode that was in the last game or maybbe im thinking of another game. idk. well you might be asking what if im not a noob or a pro, what game should i get, well i would suggest getting the dlc for the original and just playing that be my friend free ds is an average gamer and he loves that so i would just get that guys okkk? ok!!!!!!!!! Some of you guys might think that cod ghosts is the game you should get but it isnt. Now i really really love the graphics in this game as Ford F150 4x4 XLT Texas Edition. They show much improvement from the original but they are not as good as the graphics in the original. Most of you will call me stupid but im pretty sure i have a good understanding of what im talking about because i have a assosiates degree in Graphic Desighn from the career halmark college and i have published a few apps on the amazon app store so im pretty sure i know all about graphics. So in conclussion i would stick to the original game for one simple reason. the money. this game is FIFTEEN DOLLARS while the original is only five and goes on sale a lot like it will probobly go on sale this week so i would just stivk that one and buy the dlc and if you get bored you can just get a job and save some money to buy the pre sequal which is only 60$ and it a complely new inovation unlike this crappy game. So all in all i would just abondon the terraria series and move on yall cauese its like almost 2015 and our generation is moving in more futuristic games like Borderlands the Pre Sequal. Im going to tie back to my original point and say that saving your allowence and buying the pre sequal is the best and i would give this idea an 8.5/10 and the game an 8/10. So just remember to play safe and that graphics are not the only thing in a game i mean just look at Battlefied 4. The graphics are not that grate but the game is still pretty cool because it looks nice. Just remember to buy a good anti virus when you play online because of the hackers and common guys Ford F-150 4x4 XLT Texas Edition deserves a little bit more then 3% support so lets help him but this is just a better version of his comment if you have any comment or questions, instagram me @ckasper77788. have a good thanks giving.",

If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!  First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5. So good. Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.  BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.  Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.  But wait; there's more. What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincters were screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.  AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.  I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day. There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.  I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.  Silly woman. All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened. I think she was crying.  Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating. She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left. She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc. Lots of people who generally have limited access to toilets on a given day. I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day. I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.  If you order these, best of luck to you. And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks.  PS: When I ordered these, the warnings and disclaimers and legalese were NOT posted. I'm not a moron. Also, not sure why so many people assume I'm a man. I am a woman. We poop too. Of course, our poop sparkles and smells like a walk in a meadow of wildflowers. Thanks for all the great comments. I've been enjoying reading them and so glad that the horror show I experienced from snacking on these has at least made some people smile.",

Only real negative I can think of is the low res look can make it a bit harder to tell sometimes exactly what you're looking at but the tooltips display kind of negates that and overall the gameplay makes this a really good deal.",

This is what most people would usually think upon seeing the game. However, after being finally convinced by my friends to buy the game I found later that I couldn't get enough. It does mirror Minecraft in a handful of terms of gameplay, but it has its own kinks, gimmicks and charm that seperate it from any other games. I also love how it takes a very interesting spin on various mythologies, with the common pop-culture Zombies to the classic myth of Cthulhu. I have only begun my Terraria adventure, owning the game now for less than a month, and I already need to write a review like this. Trust me, as a huge game skeptic I can honestly say that Terraria is much, much more than 2D Minecraft and definitely worth checking out.",

Terraria is a game that goes at whatever pace the player wants it to go. This does not mean there is no chaos in this game. Upon nightfall zombies will attack you instead of the usual weak enemies that attack during the day upon the surface. When digging deeper underground you will come upon bosses and more powerful enemies, as well as traps that may kill unsuspecting players and deep drops into the abyss ending your life. This game is the perfect blend of hardcore and casual gaming.

Once i got into the game, i really started to enjoy it and now i play it much more often. Why is it better than Minecraft?: -The crafting is so much more better and complex -Ores are a lot rarer to find -There r many different creatures including bosses which u can fight I really enjoy terraria especially about the fact i can create a server and open it to lan-using hamachi i can then play with friends.

I'm never getting rid of this!' right until you find the next best thing, then it starts all over again.  The progression is quite consistant until you get to the extreme late-game. Once you're there, you WILL encounter a couple difficulty spikes that are very disheartening. I almost quick playing when I went up against one of the end game bosses because he was that much harder than the previous portions of the game. There are other parts of the game that are just crazy-grindy. You wil learn to hate chlorophyte (not spelled right) but you need it to stand a chance against the next guys.

Finally, I state it here that this game is so worth your money, and, in my honest opinion, is worth SO much more than a mere $10... Anyone looking to have a game that you can either invest your time into fully, or play for an hour or two then come back later, this game is perfect you... It's actually perfect for everyone! Heck, even little kids will enjoy playing this with their parents and they'll have a great time!",

            "review_text": " Terraria  is a great open-world, sandbox game. I personally enjoy the pethora of things you can do on  Terraria , ranging from building pixel art, leveling up your characters gear wise, or even exploring the world and mining! When  Terraria  first came out, the crowd said things like 'It's a rip-off of  Minecraft !' I say it's more than that. I think  Terraria  utilizes the good points of  Minecraft  and adds so much more.    Overall:   I'd give it a 8/10. There is so much to the game, but there can be more. Unfortunately the main developer of  Terraria  is stopping the updates on his side, but the other developers are going to continue to work on it!    Controls &amp; Handling:   9/10. The controls are great, easy to pick up, but however it's tedious to jump over and over to get over ledges 2 blocks high. They recently changed the motions to allow your character to walk over 1 block differences, but it doesn't change much. Once you get into late game and   you get wings   it doesn't really matter.    Graphics:   8/10. The graphics are supposed to be two dimensional and blocky, but some times there are graphical glitches and what not. There are a lot of different lighting options for you to choose from, but they are miniscule and are hard to notice.    Storyline:   There is no storyline, so I can't grade this. However there is progress through the game, and there are multiple ways to progress such as fishing, mining, or killing. Usually the fastest way is to do all three.    Music:   7/10. The music ranges from peaceful to pressing and it really sets the mood, however it can be really, really repetitive if you've spent nearly 1000 hours in the game, but that would happen to any kind of music.",

            "review_text": "(Please note: This guide was written during Patch 1.2.4; a Patch 1.3 is upcoming)  Terraria is a side-scrolling Retraux game, in which you can do pretty much anything you want.  You're given a pickaxe, an axe, and a shortsword and 'The World is Your Canvas' according to the official slogan. Said slogan is quite accurate; you can take blocks and then place them anywhere you want (there are a few rules, but the game is very generous).  My Ratings for this game:  Graphics: 8.0. The graphics are done in an oldschool 16-bit pixel style. Some people might love this (I do) others might hate it. What it does have, however, is nice bright colors, the items, weapons, terrain, and various artwork is well-done in the style that it was done in, and the game is very realistic about how light behaves.  Sound: 8.0. The game has a good variety of music and in-game sound effects are solid (though I cannot stand the male character's pain noises). There's unique music for most biomes (area types), with the same theme being repeated only for Underworld, Meteorite, and Blood Moon (all three using the same theme, the latter two are somewhat rare).  Story: N/A. There's not really any actual in-game lore or story involved in Terraria. You're dumped on a procedurally-generated world, with meager equipment. The NPCs have little snippets of things they say to you and you find things in the world that allow you to draw your own conclusions. Some people who look for gameplay-heavy games will like this, while others who prefer lots of lore might not. The fact you can fill in the blanks with your own ideas allows you to come up with a story about your own world and your own character, so that could be a plus if you're into that.  Replayability: 9.5. This game highly encourages you to replay it. From the fact you generate procedurally-generated worlds, and the fact that they are still updating the game years later, there are many reasons to start a new character on a new world. Each playthrough is different from the accessories you find to what features your world has, you can always try building a different type of base, you can decide to go magic instead of melee or vice-versa, or perhaps focus on ranged weapons through the playthrough. Always reason to start a new game if you're at the end of your current one. Whenever major updates are released, many new world features are not accessible in previously-made worlds, encouraging you to start yet another world and character.  Gameplay Mechanics: 9.5. The game has very tight controls, your character is very responsive to what you tell it to do, hit detection is very good. The only times I've ever felt that hit detection was off, is when slopes are concerned. Slopes are a somewhat new addition to the game; I wouldn't be surprised if the coming 1.3 update didn't make tweaks to how the game handles sloped surfaces. Otherwise, the gameplay is very solid. I would have to give kudos especially to the attention-to-detail having to do with the liquids which behave very realistically for the most part (liquid graphics are going to get an improvement with the upcoming 1.3 release). Lighting is very well done as well. Some players may find gravity mechanics to be off-putting if they were looking for an ultra-realistic game; gravity does not affect blocks that are 'placed'; you can make things such as houses hovering in midair for example.  Combat Mechanics: 9.0. The game has a robust combat system with a ridiculously varied weapon selection. There are a LOT of weapons in Terraria. Everything from the shortsword you start with, to magic wands, to items that summon minions to fight for you, to laser guns, to machineguns, bows, swords that shoot projectiles, knives you can throw, bombs, rocket launchers, and nearly anything else you could possibly think of -- and more.  Crafting System: 9.0. The game has a very well-tuned crafting system as well! You can make lots of potions that do a large variety of things, anything from combat-oriented things to things that help you build better, to things that help you explore the world better. Whatever you would want to do, there's probably a potion that can help you do it better. Nearly all of your armor is crafted, many weapons can be crafted, building materials and furniture can be crafted, and much more. Crafting is one of the main cornerstones of Terraria. But yet, crafting isn't very grindy and there's no leveling to do. As long as you have the items and the appropriate crafting station (such as anvils for metal objects), you can make the item. No grinding to raise levels required.  Game Balance: 8.0. Overall, the game is mostly balanced well. There are a few fringe examples of things that could use further polish, a couple annoying enemies that I consider to be somewhat overpowered, a few weapons that are probably too powerful for when you get them, some that could be buffed, but these are all minor nitpicks to an otherwise well-done game. The fact that there's an upcoming update means that some of this stuff could very well be fixed soon; the Online Community Forums are very active and the developers are hearing feedback regularly from the players there.  Intuitiveness: 6.0. The game's one flaw, is the lack of early-game help system. The game gives you an NPC right from the start. You can ask this NPC for help but he gives very vague clues as to what you are supposed to actually be doing. He also allows you to show him an item and he will tell you everything that can be crafted from that item (provided what you showed him is a material). Otherwise, the game tells you absolutely nothing. I highly recommend going to the TCF over at  terraria.org  and looking up some guides (shameless plug for my own guide, which you can find there) on how to get started.  Challenge: 7.0. Please note that the developers have announced an upcoming way to tweak challenge in Terraria for Patch 1.3. This was written during 1.2.4. In 1.2.4, the Challenge is somewhere in the middle -- not so easy that you'll breeze through all the bosses on first try, but yet not so ridiculously hard like some of the other NintendoHard games out there. To up the challenge prior to Patch 1.3, you can try turning on MediumCore or Hardcore modes to increase the death penalty, or you can simply choose to use inferior equipment if you are finding things too easy. If things are too hard for you, chances are that you can make it easier with some proper terrain preparation (such as building nice flat places to run around, placing campfires or heart lanterns, making more potions to use, using better accessories, etc). I gave it a 7.0 becuase I felt there could have been another 'challenge mode' but like I said: Patch 1.3 is bringing more challenge options to the game so chances are this will be addressed when that patch arrives.  Multiplayer: 8.0. I've dabbled in this only a bit, but I've heard and read things from other players who say that Terraria's multiplayer works fairly well. Before one of the 1.2 patches, Multiplayer was difficult for some people to host due tohow difficult it was to get the game's client to actually host properly (lots of NAT and port forwarding issues). They have since fixed this, or at least fixed a lot of issues. Prior to the 1.2 patches, I could not host a Terraria game at all despite me attempting to forward the proper ports. It works flawlessly now for me after said patches.  Pricing: 9.0. For $10, this game is a steal already. It frequently goes on sale for $2.49 (and sometimes cheaper!). Even at the original price of $10 I'd highly recommend this game. For $2.49 or $3 or whatever the price is when it is on sale, it is simply a no-brainer if you enjoy sidescrolling games whatsoever. I can't think of any possible reason why someone would Not want to buy this game cheaper than an average lunch.  Overall: 9.0. Great game that I'd recommend to anybody who likes this sort of game.",

            "review_text": "Terraria is a rare gem among the sea of minecraft clones roaming around the internet, it developed a style on its own that its already being cloned too, the Terraria clones.  Even though it clearly takes many aspects from Minecraft, it adapted them to 2D masterfullly and we are presented with the many possible outcomes from our actions. The player feels like he can change the world and explore it on a Metroidvania style, the player needs to dig deep so he gets new abilites to dig even deeper, finding new challenges and ways to create and develop his world, reaching new challenges and new powers on the progress.  - On character management The ways that characters are not tuned to a world is a cool feature, since the player can join PvP or other servers with an already developed character that doesn't need to go through the basics every single time he joins a server. I, myself, have 2 characters, one for single player games, and one for random multiplayer services, though I'd be able to use my single player character on the multiplayer whenever needed.  - On crafting and player creation The crafting system is really good, you have lots of possibilities (not so many as minecraft) among the insurmountable amount of materials waiting to be discovered, players are able to build freely into the world and reach for the skies or under lava if they want to. Buildings never really feel complete since you'll be discovering dozens of ways of expanding and making them better fitting for your game, you can get new types of blocks, mechanic and electrical connections through your building, defensive measures against waves of invading goblins, armor racks, useful NPCs living with you etc.  - On multiplayer Now, for the bad parts, the multiplayer connections are just through direct IP, just like Minecraft and old games like Starcraft and AoE2 you need your friend's IP so you can play with them, there's no features to create servers inside the game's UI, so you need to do it all manually. This is not so bad since a small team can hardly have budged for a network-guy to manage complicated IP distribution and web connections.  - On advanced aged world The game sometimes feels like 'lacking space', if you play in a world for too long, you feel the world dying around you and non-renewable materials get more scarce, with time, you are obligated to build another world and save your stuff on the character so he can rebuild his life in the new world. This bad point can be a little directed to humanity and our future, but still, it makes the game feel limited at some point through your advancement.  as of my final verdict, I would give it 9/10.",

Plus, the characters can go between worlds. You can even have different hairstyles!   The game is pixelatied and 2-Dimensional, but that only adds to the fun. At night zombies and flying eyeballs come out. In the daytime there are forest critters, bugs, and slimes spawn. The list of biomes is: Forest, Desert, Corruption, Ocean, Jungle, occasionally Crimson, Space, Underground, Cavern, Underworld, Spider Cave, Underground Jungle, Glowing Mushroom. The lis of structures is: Lizhard Temple, Jungle Shrine, Dungeon, Desert Temple, Floating Island House, Underground House. I may have missed a few.  One of my favorite aspects is floating islands. You can find them by building skybridges, drinking Gravitation Potions, or flying. You can mine out cloud blocks to make your own floating islands, and there is cool furniture, banners, blocks, and walls in the house that is built on the island. There are always cool items and weapons in the chests there. You can fight harpies in the air and on floating islands, and you can even fight a Wyvern after you beat the Wall of Flesh.

'There's something for everybody' is the best way to describe this game. After the initial grind of setting up a character, which is a maximum two hours for a new player, you're able to do whatever you want.   Do you enjoy building things? Creating castles as tall as the skies? Or maybe you'd prefer a bustling modern city. A dwarven cave dwelling with minecarts as transportation? Heck, you can go above and beyong in this and build ANYTHING you wish! Traps for your friends to fall into, a fortress to protect your loot, a magical floating city high in the clouds, where gravity is low and you can feel the cold air of space itself. Even the depths of Hades aren't safe, if you feel yourself the hardened kind to conquer the dangers deep below.  Or maybe you prefer a game that lets you fight, and test your skills! This game offers that to you, from melee, to magic, to ranged. Any play style is accomodated, with an ample variety of weapons and spells. Burn your foes with fire, cut them to pieces with swords, pierce them into a monster shish-ka-bob with spears, or snipe them from afar with bows and guns. With thousands of items in the game, you can gear up to do what you wish. Maybe you'd even prefer to be a jack of all trades? That's always an option as well! Accessories and armor suits help you improve your statistics and build yourself into the perfect soldier.  You'll never feel alone in Terraria either, with plenty of NPCs to keep you company, though you may find yourself questioning their motives and interests. If you ever find them suspicious, though, there's always the option to kill them, too! After all, you bring them into your world, you're completely capable of taking them out of it! Don't let the power get to your head, however, as there's always something ready to stab you in the back.  This game does it all, and there's nothing I find negative about Terraria. The music is splendid, the items are plentiful, and the action is packed.",

Comparing it to minecraft however, is not something players of these awesome games shouldn't do. both games are unique in their own regard, and I feel minecraft is simply slower paced, and more relaxing.

There are a handful of things that make terraria execptional, and especially fun, while there are a few things that might take away from a perfect 10/10. I give it a 9/10.  Pro's: The game is especially fun for new players who have large amounts of gameplay to explore. Fun for replaying, since some things are only available on seperate maps. Gives you a chance to create lots of awesome things! Houses, castles, and challenges for friends! Multiplayer is awesome!  Cons: Once you played it a really long time, you tend to know what is really good and tend to avoid even farming or looking for some items, since they can be skipped with itnent of getting the better ones. (Makes for less intense gameplay, or rather- less grinding, which was partly the fun of the first few playthroughs). If you can't stand grinding, don't play this, since grinding is a part of the fun! (Spending hours underground is normal, right?) There are soemtimes too many options item wise, and I often find items and think, (Man, if only I had this before....)  Notes: (Spoilers)   I wish there were attribute stats, levels, or something like this. But although these things are not in the original game, there are mods for these.",

Combat is a lot more interesting - mostly because of items. More of an RPG feel, progression-wise. Bosses also make combat less repetitive. The Ender Dragon can't measure up to the Wall of Flesh or Plantera. Building possibilities are restricted because of the 2D, but this makes it easier for people (e.g. me) who are terrible at Minecraft architecture. Mod support isn't nearly as extensive, but it's a more complete game for non-modders. Potentially hundreds of hours worth of gameplay. Highly reccomend.",

When you've got your sword swinging, it plays much like a clunky-er Ghouls n’ Ghosts as you defend yourself from one-eye freaks, and Jell-O-blobs, that lurk about the night you reap their spoils. Those spoils allow you to craft better stuff. Things like armor, weapons, furnishings, tools, etc. Combat remains to be Terraria’s stand-out trait from the competition, giving the player more vibes of action-adventure RPGs than any other genre-heavyweight I’ve played.  It’s no lie this game is systems-heavy, so if you enjoy bouncing between complex systems Terraria has you covered. The joy of this genre is exploring, uncovering secrets, and discovering systems you never expected to exist and as such it’s a disservice to the product to overly explain everything it has to offer. But, what is safe to say, is that the game will constantly surprise you as you delve deeper into what is possible both with building and exploring. Of particular note is your buildings actually serve a purpose to house NPC's, rather than just being yet another abandoned wizard tower in your Minecraft world, and much, much more. Yet, with all this praise, Terraria still has a lump to complain about. Surprisingly enough, it’s not in the control department either. The virtual controls worked perfectly fine for me, after a bit of practice, with little to no hiccups.  Fun as ♥♥♥♥ to play with friends.",

Now this game went over that 10 dollar limit. this game would fit perfect for the 30-60 dollar range because it so fun and theres alot to do. But the best thing about it is the Multiplayer. You really cant have the true feeling of terraria unless you have friends to play with. trust me, There will be teamwork needed for bosses, item searching, collecting, hunting, and mineing Ect. There will also be conflict on the the Loot side of it. because everyone wants that god damn laser gun when there is only one. :P  I would have to say this game is a 10/10   It is a example of a PERFECT game.

Iron Anvil = 5 Iron bars.) These bars add up and are very simple to get.Just gotta go digging!

My opinion is that minecraft dropped the ball in delivering a good adventure game but brought us one of the best building sandbox games to date. But terraria is on a good road in bringing us a good adventure game within a sandbox world. Granted once you found most of the things you can get, then just as minecraft you can either build stuff or start a new character and start over. Which can still be fun in my opion, but for 10 euro's and atleast 20 hours of time to spend its a deal you should not leave lying around and just like minecraft terraria will be getting content update's in the future. So if you liked minecraft but found the survival mode a bit lacking then for god sake check out terraria.",

Combine this with a neat 2-D feel with cute pixel graphics and you have a game you will keep coming back to, even years after its release.  I recommend you play with friends and wait for sale prices, as much as I like this game you can get it REALLY cheap during sales such as Winter sales. Even though I really do enjoy Terraria, $9.99 is still a bit much for me. That's just my opinion however.  I bought this game for around $2-4 and it was definitely worth the price.",

Terraria, in a nutshell, has been compared by many to Minecraft meets Mario, and they're not wrong to make that comparison. While both games have had different origins, playerbases, and different update rates (Minecraft being the most dedicated, while the MASSIVE and thankfully so update for Terraria was more of an afterthought after years of abandonment), they both inherently have that sandboxy voxel feel; the kind you get when playing a game of Legos.  Thankfully, that's where the similarity ends, or else this game would not have been as successful as it is now, and I wouldn't have bothered either getting it or making this review. Where Minecraft has immense modding potential, Terraria has a load of the variety in gameplay that I crave right out of the box. Where Minecraft has just one kind of zombie, Terraria has several variations of the same, including ones I've aptly named the Baldhead, the Slimeface, the Pincushion, and the Raincoat just to name a few. Where Minecraft has several small updates that add various new content that many will love and several will question (1.8 adding banners, sea ruins, and new water mobs, and many questining what purpose banners will provide to the regular sandbox), Terraria's rare updates are immense, massive, and add so much new stuff that it's literally like a whole new game, to coin the term.  Granted, Terraria's not better than Minecraft; both games hold their own with ease. Minecraft is easily moddable, 3D, and has a massive community with many, many, many adventure maps to their name, while Terraria restricts you to a flat horrizontal by vertical plane and its developers sort of gave up on it up until the very latest update, and something tells me we won't be seeing another update anytime in the next year or so. But Terraria is definitely worth the buy, and well worth the price. You'd be having a load of fun playing this game either by yourself or with friends, and that's guaranteed.  Pros:  + 2D sandbox that holds its own + Fun gameplay that while not necessarily innovative definitely holds out on its own + Many great environments both above and below ground to have fun with + The latest update added a TON of new stuff, adding a lot more replayability especially if you played the original  Cons:  - Not as popular as other sandboxes like Minecraft - There isn't a whole lot of modding content or adventure maps - The developers aren't nearly as dedicated, which was why the last update came to us all by surprise  Do I recommend it? Yes I do  -Kerian",

The mechanics of the second from hardest difficulty (which is what I played initially) can be very frustrating in a game that depends so heavily on obtaining difficult items.  If you insist on playing in this mode make many small houses with beds so you can reset your spawn point close to where you are exploring so you can go recover your hours upon hours of game play wrapped up in your items for the inevitable surprise death that makes you lose them all.",

There is armor in the game aswell as weapons: Bows, Swords, Spears, Machine-guns, Sniperrifles, Rocket launchers, and Magic weapons (like Things that richet off walls)  The game is very number based as new weapons will do lower/higher Ratios  It has a Armor system and a Vanty system so you can truly customize your character by putting your favorite Armorover the Armor that is better. You create your character when you start too, Though it is very limited as the game is very pixely. Keep in mind that the game was made by like 4 people.(Don't quote me on that) The game has an normal mode and a hard mode after you kill the final Normal boss I.e The Wall of Flesh* The game Enters hard mode where pretty much everymonster has been modified, Upgraded or replaced with harder enemys.(Including the bosses)  This game has 13 bosses so far and is about to have a 14th one there is 100's of hours here and my only thing I dislike is how the corrupition(Just go look up terraria for this) Spreads in hard mode and covers your Buildings and world like a freaking Ant bed...

Once hard mode starts, the game really picks up in pace and that’s when the fun begins. My only problem is you basic need the games Wiki up at all times.

The NPC's and the money system adds a whole new aspect, and the various kinds of crafting makes this game unique, while the huge amount of different materials in the game, leaves it with a lot more entertainment than the popular 3D-version of this game. This game deserves 8.5/10 stars. The remaining stars are for the lack of originality and the fact that they have stopped patching the game.

            "review_text": "'Ay is jus a chep rip-of miencwarf'  Ha.  Haha.  No.  Terraria is a 2D blocky sandbox game with a randomly generated (but not infinite) world that has lots of stuff in it, you get wood, you mine stone, you make a workbench, you make wood armor and weapons, you mine iron or something else, you make a furnace, you know, your usual thing, but holy crap does this game have more than that.  I'm not going to go too deep into gameplay because it will be pretty obvious as soon as you start the game, but, I'm going to tell you a story about how I first beat The Eye of Cthulu.  It was the middle of the day, I was playing Terraria, alone, having only recently gotten a stronger long-range weapon (A Handgun) some decent armor and a few health upgrades, I was feeling confident in myself, and I hoped that I wouldn't get completely destroyed.  So I grabbed the boss summon thing out of the chest and waited a bit for night to fall...I summoned the Eye of Cthulu.  I was so damn focused, my hands were shaking like crazy due to the twitch-based movements I had to make so I could jump without getting hit, I kept shooting and shooting and shooting, only stopping to heal for a half a second and then continue shooting, the boss was low on health, 40-60 HP remaining, I ran out of ammo, and I had only one potion left, I healed, and went absolutely ballistic, I killed the damn thing with only 10 HP left, I felt like a god.  I went on a online server later and got my ♥♥♥ kicked by dudes with Hardmode gear, 9/10.",

Well it's NOT, yes capital letters NOT.  I've put over threehundred hours in it. The game feels smooth and finished (like any game should feel). The game has a learning curve (and because of insufficient experience in games with steep learning curves I'm gonna say it's average). I spend a lot of time on the wiki to find out what to do next to progress. Sometimes a boss was too hard (or I was too bad who can tell).  This made the game very interesting to me, because bosses are supposed to be hard. The game has found a good balance between difficulty and anxiety (in my opinion). A lot (a ton, a huge amount wichever you perfer) of items are ready to be crafted or collected by you (some require grinding but it has always been worth it for me). In some cases this game can be pretty grindy, I once spend about 30 minutes for one item I needed to craft something. This was not my favourite moment in the game, but the soothing melody in the background pulled me through. Now I mentioned it, The background music is dynamic and always appropriate to the location.  The bosses sometimes have some funny lore which is always a good thing (found on the google/mozilla/opera, yes keep an internet tab open cuz you are goin' to need it). There are about 20 bosses (hmm, twenty felt like more). But since i'm new to the whole review thing, I'm gonna end it here though I feel like I still need to say more. I pretty much finished the game (about three times now). Just two more things to go and I'll be done with it... feels odd though, leaving it. The game kinda... kinda...  CONSUMED MY SOUL...  Just kidding of course, but if this kind of game is even remotely your thing you should really pick it up. It's a steal at it's price. I never really play multiplayer (tried it once and a few times with friends), but it was fun with friends.   Well thanks for reading my review, hope you liked it. (and of course helped you make a decision, that is probably why you red it in the first place.... right?) :)  Have a splendid day, CoreZebra",

I won't spoil too much but first thing you would want to do is give the guide you start off with a shelter so he can be safe. Go mining to get materials for better weapons and items. Make sure you check what the Guide has to say before looking everything up on the internet, he can help you out quite a bit, though sometimes you'd wind up looking info online. the Crafting help is pretty important too for upgrading your gear. It's even better on multiplayer too since the Co op is a blast. It is often comparable to minecraft (It's similar, not the same) it's different enough to be it's own.

Pros: -Awesome creativity and gameplay; -8-bit grapichs that perfectly match the game experience; -Freedom of playstyle, you can play it for fun, do a speedrun or anything you like; and -Never ending fun!  Cons: -Doesn't have a proper 'mod plataform'. But who cares? The game is complete the way it is; -The worlds are becoming too 'small'; and -The moderators are actually 'leaving' the game because of personal affairs or to give other projects more atention like Terraria 2 or Terraria Otherworld.",

There's fun to be had in exploring, and unlocking new items/armors/beating the bosses. But Terraria also suffers from only a limited amount of building options. Sure, you can build a bunch of buildings, but they're all going to be rectangles, squares, and various oblong shapes.  The real pain is the switch from the starting difficulty to 'Hardmode', which happens after a specific boss is defeated. EVERYTHING gets stronger, and monsters WILL kill you, even if you have the best pre-hardmode armor.  Between each boss victory is the grinding of materials and weapons for the next boss, which are only unlocked by beating each prior boss. So there's also a constant grind for new items.  It's fun, but that grind for materials and weapons isn't for everyone.",

The Objetive of the Game its to kill the various bosses (over 20, all different and amazing). For that, you must craft good items and prepare yourself for the danger. There´s a unic and really nice interaction with NPC, who can sell you good stuff for the right price (not like minecraft that they are dumb as ♥♥♥♥)! Their´s lots of weapons (more than 100), lots of armor (more than 50 different types) and two type of modes. The Pre-hardmode and the Hardmode. After killing the boss Wall of Flesh, you enter in the Hardmode! And that´s here the game becomes hard! But not that hard that you will rage and really funny! Awesome game!

Now I felt odd that I had done everything the game had to offer, but after digging deep for a while I found there was more in the world of Terraria than I first expected.  Honestly, after reading reviews and watching the demo video I thought there would be more to this game. It is tagged as an RPG, but I guess most of the story is also something you need to imagine for yourself. Although I wanted more I must admit that it is a good game and it lets you build your own world. I have played for hours and read through a few guides, but I'm still not near completion of this game. When I play it I enjoy it, but if I don't play it for a few days the idea of playing it seems boring. I feel like it is the type of game that you can come back to whenever you like and just do something interesting or build something strange. So, when is the next update?",

It is so good that I can't even describe how awesome it is without writing a friggin' masters thesis on it. I'll try to keep it short and to the point.  Start a character, start a generated world, mine generated ore, find generated treasures, survive whatever the night throws at you, and build build build!  Whenever you seem satisfied with your caharcter and world combination, start over again! One of the BEST features of this game are that you can transfer your character inbetween worlds.. so share your equipment and items between worlds as well.  Bosses are what balance the game. If you can't defeat a certain boss, you cant progress into certain areas and evolve your world any further. Prepare!  For newcomers, it might seem tough and confusing at first, but make a few worlds and play to your liking. Hopefully you can find a Magic Mirror and a few +4 Defense accessory equipment for the first few bosses and goblin army.  Some other notes for newbies: (I know that this doesnt belong here but I'm not going to write a guide) - Play the tutorial! It only lasts 5 minutes or so, and it teaches you some very important aspects, like making proper houses for merchants and other NPC's.  - Harvest Mushrooms and Daybloom Immediately!!! They make important battle potions like Ironskin potion (+8 Defense) and Health regeneration potion.  - Use the Guide (In-game NPC), he's spawns right beside you when you start a new world. You can show him any item and he will show you what it can be crafted with, and crafted for.  - Defeat bosses multiple times. They drop very useful ores and weapons, as well as some fancy vanity equipment.  - Don't rush to 'Hard-Mode.' make it easier to get around your world with either teleporters, super highways, and/or tunnels and elevators with proper landings. Placing campfires and heart lanterns around custom made boss arenas, the jungle, and the dungeon will make it a lot easier when it has morphed into a hell realm.  I could go on and give some more tips, but a lof of Terraria should be about discovery.  It's too bad that looking up a few things online is essential to know everything about the game.  I have a few peeves about Terraria, but they are very minimal and don't change my opinion of the game at all. As I said in my first sentence of all of this, Terraria battles a few other games in my opinion of possibly my favorite game of all time. I recommend it to anyone who has the slighest knack for videogames.  ENJOY!",

            "review_text": "This is a lengthy review, so heads up.   You've probably heard that Terraria is like Minecraft, except it's a little different and it's 2D. If you haven't, there's good reason for people to say that. Terraria is, indeed, not your typical block-based builder. While it DOES share some of their traits - such as the need to mine, smelt, craft, and whatnot - it manages to less emphasis on this and more emphasis on building. It does this with its unique side-scroller perspective (think 2D but with backgrounds).  Terraria has a goal, but not necessarily an 'ultimate goal' or a game-ending objective. That goal is to craft your world to your likings with what you find in it, whether it's the bones from your enemies, golden bricks from the caverns below, or simple wooden houses. Terraria is a mix of Minecraft mechanics and typical RPGs. Speaking of such...  Terraria has some basic RPG elements in it as well. Scattered throughout the world, there are items that increase your basic resources, health and mana, that come in handy when fighting terraria's some 10+ bosses. Additionally, there is the option to craft unique armors, each with their own boons and benefits, and weapons that range from a wooden bow to a minigun made out of shark fins to the legendary sword Excalibur. There are even quests to partake in, which result in helpful rewards.  Then there's the aspect of creating your own little 'civilization.' As you progress in the game, you may find that you require tools or weapons to help you complete your projects. As you build on to your home, NPCs may move in, offering their services to you in exchange for a place to live and a fee (which varies... greatly). Demolitions experts, arms dealers, nurses, steampunkers, and even witch doctors are just some of the NPCs that you may eventually house.  VERDICT: Terraria is a great time killer. If you want to play a game that has a lot of heart, or perhaps you just want to build a tower made out of cactus, fire, and glass without the worries of impending doom, Terraria is just the game for you.  10/10 Would get crushed by a boulder again.",

The other features of Terraria do keep me playing - more ores / tools / weapons / abilities etc, and the different mobs, the achievements, whatever. Its fun, its quirky and definetly deserves a try if you think you'll like it (and even if you dont).  The only problem is the lack of ability, so far, of being able to create adventure map style projects (which Im sure is possible, I just havent seen any great examples) and being able to share these with other people (again probably really easy, I just havent seen it).  Play it. I thought I'd hate it, and I love it.",

As you fight with some random monsters and even RANDOMER bosses, you have only one goal, to free this world from being corrupted by evil. As you can play with friends or just have an adventure by yourself, each time is a new experiment. The game gives freedom like no other, and has much to explore. But if you're finished with one world, no problem, create another one and you will be off on another adventure. I may have been the worst gamer when I have started playing this. But dig deeper, and you will go where no one has gone before.....",

I only bought Terraria because a friend recommended it and I didn't expect to play it much beyond our co-op sessions, but even now I can't stop playing. The gameplay is deceptively simple, under which a surprisingly complex and engaging boss and gear progression system hide. I have found myself making new characters just so I can enjoy that progession again and again. You move from a horribly vulnerable character to an unstoppable killing machine in small increments that make it hard to realize just how powerful you are becoming.  The true beauty of this game is uncovered when playing with friends. Having other people to play with can make those earlier, slower nights much more fun. Getting a group together to build awesome creations or try to speed run the moon lord is endlessly entertaining. PVP is also a great way to pass the time.  It's simple enough where it can entertain people who have little interest or experience in video games whille still being fun for the hardcore gamers. It introduces new mechanics slowly so as to not be overwhelming. Each boss acts as a good skills check, as they are a decent challenge to even those who are adequately geared as the battles do require a good amount of tactic to win. While in the late game raw power can overcome many obstacles, most of the game does require you to play smart. The game also contains a fairly fulfilling potion/alchemy system which can be completely ignored if that's not your play style. The item crafting is exceptionally fun as most items you pick up can be crafted with something else, combining their powers and some items have rather extensive crafting trees that might as well be side quests (I'm looking at you Cell Phone).  It's worth every penny and if you don't have any friends who have it, pick up the 4 pack and gift some copies as it's definitely worth sharing the fun.",

            "review_text": "Too often I see Terraria dismissed as '2D Minecraft'. In fairness, it starts very similarly. You start by chopping down trees (though with an axe. What kind of idiot chops down a tree with their fist?) and building a wooden house to protect yourself from zombies at night. However, Terraria quickly distinguishes itself from Minecraft, mainly due to the gameplay.  Terraria, like Minecraft, is a sandbox adventure game. You collect items to craft new items, and to protect yourself from the monsters roaming the world. Mining plays an important part as well, most ores and enemies are found below the surface of the world. However, while Minecraft is a much more creative focused game, Terraria focuses on the adventure element.  For example, there are 4 main types of weapon in the game: Melee, Ranged, Magic and Summons. Each of these has several different weapons of varying styles. For example, the Ranged class contains both Bows and Guns, as well as a few other unique weapons. Each weapon may have an effect, such as the Molten Fury, a bow that turns your arrows into Flaming Arrows. Want to shoot flaming arrows with other bows? No worries, you can craft Flaming arrows separately. What's more, certain armour sets can boost certain weapon types, and later in the game, you get armour sets with 3 different head pieces to boost different weapons. You can also reforge your weapons and accessories (which are also plentiful in number and variety) for better buffs, or sometimes even combine them to get better weapons or accessories altogether.  But this weapon system would be useless without an array of enemies to fight, and Terraria has them in spades. Throughout the world, there are many biomes, ranging from the simple Forest biome, to the Dungeon, to the Underground Corruption, to Hell itself. Each biome, as well as having it's own blocks and materials, has its own unique set of enemies. Some biomes are tougher than others, such as the Corruption vs the Forest, or Hell vs the Dungeon. And it is all to easy to die. But the game never feels unfair. If you die, it's because you ventured into an area you weren't ready for, or you didn't pay attention to an enemy, or you simply got cocky. And despite constantly upgrading your equipment, there will always be a new set of enemies in the next biome to push you to your limits.  You never feel without direction either. You start with a single NPC - the Guide. He is invaluable to newer plyaers, as not only does he give you advice on what to do next, but also can show you what you can craft with materials, and what you need to craft with it. Crafting is also very simple. When you open up your inventory, your crafing menu also appears alongside it. Your crafting menu shows what you can craft at thie current time. Simply click on an item to craft it. If you need to use a specific crafting station, all you have to do is stand by it, and the additional crafting recipes will appear.  There are other NPCs you can get aside from the Guide, such as a MErchant, and Arms Dealer, a Demolitionist - and those are just the start of many, many NPCs who will come to your base. All you have to do is prepare a room for them, and fulfil their conditions. They're pretty simple, and for the most part you'll just get them by playing the game. For example, to get the Arms Dealer to appear, you first have to find a gun. What's more, the NPCs can sell different things at different times.  That's another thing Terraria has - time and events. Whilst the progression of the day is nothing spectacular, Terraria has a load of random (or triggered) events that can challenge you if you're not prepared. Such things include the Blood Moon, which causes Zombies to be able to break your doors, or the Goblin Invasion - that one speaks for itself. Several of these events have unique drops from enemies, or other effects in the world.  The bosses are also all epic. Even the first one, which you'll likely encounter randomly, is a sight to behold (fans of the game will aprecciate the pun there). They're all a challenge when you first encounter them in a playthrough, and will have to be refought several times if you want those rare drops. Most of the drops from bosses aren't TOO rare though, that would be cruel. And their music... oh their music is sublime!  In fact, all the music is. It's superb, spectacular! It flows seamlessly from one biome to the next, from a calm forest background music to the tense chords of a boss theme. It's all epic.  And all of your work pays off in the creative department. So many blocks, most of which can be fashioned into background walls, and many havig a furiture set. There's wooden, honey, steampunk, cactus, flesh, gothic... the list goes on. You can place mechanisms in your creations too, with the 3-colour wiring system.  This does bring me to some of the negatives though. First up, the wiring system is not as flexible as Minecraft's, and no way to move blocks with mechanisms. You can 'actuate' them, putting into and out of the background, but that's it. You can also teleport NPCs and mobs around using teleporters, but again, not blocks.  It can also be hard to find specific materials sometimes. Even in a small world, where the materials are in lower quantities but higher conecntrations, it can be difficult to find what you need. That's not to mention how you need at least 2 worlds to find all the ores and unique biome materials.  Farming mobs and bosses is also practically required to get rare drops, particularly if you're going for specific classes. For example, the eaarliest Summoner weapon is the Slime staff, which you get by defeating slimes. However, the staff has a drop rate of 1/10000. Even with an AFK farm, it can take up to half an hour to get. And if you have to farm a boss for a rare item, it can get tedious, particularly since you'll have to farm for the materials to get the boss summoning items.  It can also be difficult for a complete beginner to know how to do things and what's dangerous, since aside from the guide's general advice, there are no in-game instructions, and while basic control is simple, things like opening the housing menu are a bit cryptic to newer players.  That being said, the pros WAY outnumber the cons of this game. In fact, several of the cons are going to be removed in the next update, such as being able to select items that you don't want to deposti in chests with the deposit all command, or being able to use items in chest for crafting - or most importantly of all: Steam integration!  My advice is: get this game, play this game, then play it several more times. It may have one less physical dimension than Minecraft, but it's gameplay has several more to make up for it.  ",

If your looking an adventure sandbox game then your gonna love this. However, if your looking for something like Minecraft or Don't Starve then you're gonna be very disappointed. This game cannot be compared to Minecraft because while they look alike they play out very differently. So this is good adventure sandbox but a terrible survival game. It really comes down to preference when it comes to this game.  Update: Replayed this game for a 2nd time and now I love it! It is very enjoyable to play and I enjoy this as much as Minecraft! It fits my play style and I am having a fun time getting gear to kill the destroyer! What I have learned is that you shouldn't go in expecting a Minecraft clone! This game has mods but they are not required for the full experience. I am very exited for 1.3 and have dedicated my week to this game!

You get to create and explore as you dig, fight, build, craft and play online (or alone) as you upgrade your own or other's worlds.  This is how the game starts. Before you even start playing, you have to create your character. There are many styles of hair and you can have a custom color for any part of your body. You start out as a person with nothing but a pickax, short sword, an ax, and the clothes on your back. You begin attempting to survive. It is necessary to begin collecting resources to begin crafting tools and building your shelter. As the game progresses you keep upgrading your pick to get better ores. Eventually you can start building houses for NPCs.  When you complete certain tasks certain NPCs will start moving in to houses you have built. Each one has a different services. For example the Demolitionist would sell explosives and materials needed to make explosives, or the Hair Stylist can change your hair. This can be a pain building their houses within the requirements and waiting for them to come.  There is a second half to the game. This is called hardmode. Hardmode is activated in a world when you defeat (arguably) the hardest boss before hardmode - The Wall of Flesh. This is when new ores spawn into your world. New enemies come to life. The Hallow appears and the dungeon gets new loot. It's almost really like starting the second game.  This game is even more fun is you play it with friends. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a crafting-building-fighting-mining sort of game, which's fun multiplies with friends.  Final Rating: 9.8/10",

It was called a 2D Minecraft, which at the time I felt was pretty accurate, though I've never really gotten into Minecraft. From what I understand now, though, is that while you certainly can build and be creative in both, to amazing ends, Terraria is more adventure focused. You fight enemies and gather bigger and better items to deck your character out. There are boss battles and events to conquer. There have been several MASSIVE, and FREE, updates in the past that have enlarged the content and possibilities within the game, one of which more than doubled the original game. There is also the HUGE 1.3 update scheduled to be coming out soon. Check it out and see for yourself, but be careful because you may just get hooked.",

Now I’ll start my review off with the first time I played, I remember building a box house and I couldn’t work out how to get the NPCs inside the house, Later on I realised there was no walls &amp; no chair, so I added them in and still it wouldn’t let me add NPCs into the home, I ended up getting frustrated and so I left the game and didn’t play for the rest of the day- The end P.S I figured later on the house was too small.  I also remember my first time going onto a server. I was stuck and couldn’t work out how to speak I was trying to ask but I ended up looking on Google, That was the noobest thing I probably ever done…  Me and my friends also put Terraria on the School computers and play it together so we can be entertained during recess and lunch, lol. Just to clarify we don’t hand out terraria to other students as I tell them that I don’t want to rip Re-logic off.  Terraria is a game where the world is your canvas and you can create anything you want, such as Houses, hotels, carrots, mines, tree houses &amp; Whatever you can imagine. Although it is hard to build great stuff it’s still fun exploring, digging and killing some of the plenty of mobs the game provides.  I have heard this game is getting a major update soon and the update will add plenty more exciting things for your 2D character to do.  I do have one downer for the amazing game- When you try to communicate with devs they completely ignore you, now this may be due to the fact that most people are asking for release date. If any of the Terraria Devs see this review please contact as I have serious ideas and things you could add into the game, not peasant &amp; petty ideas and I do not take rejection emotion ever so feel free to turn me down.

Here is how Hally is so far.... Spawned Made wood house but then found HUGE ♥♥♥ TREE, made new house in huge ♥♥♥ tree, Mined for a good part of early game but found loads of ore and loads of loot and collectables like banners and statues. Set up early slime farm, got my super op char in the world to grab one of the 2 magic mirrors i found and i spawned goblin invasion by accident. Killed it off and put 10 gold in chest. Hally came back, Found goblin tinker along with Hermis boots, got emerald hook and spectal boots off the bat. Got better pickaxe and mined astroids, got full astroid armorer, lazer sword, and gun. Waited for eye of cutulu to spawn so i can kill it for demonite ore.  10/10 would play again, this game gives each char a new adventure and experence along with a random world that is special in your own way, i still have a world were the floating island houses were made of silver and gold.",

The game is like most crafters in that you make tools to get to the next tier to tools to get to the next yadda yadda ya, but Terraria focuses more on combat than just hunting for ore. For example every single 'boss' in the game drops special things you either need to move up a tier or just some really cool gear both cosmetic and not. For example you need to kill the boss of the 'evil zone' (there are 2 different ones you get one randomly on world generation) to get the goods needed to smash altars to progress the game. you can also collect throphies and banners as rare drops to show your dominion over the mobs. You can really relax and explore the world, gaining townspeople and making your home look fancy and have a good time for the genrally low price since this is on sale all the time   the negatives  This game is in some ways a 2d knock-off of minecraft which is evident in it's emphasis on gather ores and the like, it's block-based building and the crafting using workbenches however the thing that turns most people i talk to about is the music. the music is very hit and miss, while some love it some find it grating on the ears. Along with all of this some actions in the game are LOUD i had to mute the game because putting down minecart railing was so loud it was playing over my headphones and into my mic across the skype call.

That feature needs to be added.  I want my dude and the Nurse to have little hearts over their heads for a second then have the Nurse squirt out little kid eggs into a basket so I can auction them (the kid eggs) off to worthy lords in other towns, EXCEPT THERE ARE NO OTHER TOWNS! They need to add other towns of NPCs in this game because filling your dungeon... I mean 'castle'... with NPCs is a lot like running a community like I'm the Governer or some ♥♥♥♥....  Oh snap. I just realized I'm the Governer in this game. Except I don't have any zombie heads in a fish tank. I have fish tanks... There are zombies... I wish I could fill a fishtank with zombie heads then sit in a lounge chair drinking bourbon while one of my (zombie) kids plays with her food (a bowl of fingers). Except in this game there is no feature for that, so I think that needs to be added.  There are a few things this game needs in terms of getting up to speed with the whole post modern fiasco we find ourselves in because of right wing conservativism having such an iron grip on our day to day lives...... First off you should be able to get gender reassignment surgury in this game... Feature not yet added... There should also be a safe place where you can go in the game to talk about your feelings without it seeming like the Ice Eskimos are laughing at you. It gets cold in the snow biome, and just having a secure place to vent would be a great way for the developers to express that they are not only interested in their customers, but accomodating to their 21st century ego driven needs.  Not to mention the lizard people. When I was playing this game suddenly lizard people came running out of this hole in the ground like the Dulce Base and I'm suddenly Phil Schnieder but instead of a nine millimeter and a head full of geology information I have a sword made out of meterorites and less than half of all my hearts. In case you're lost this basically means I'm ♥♥♥♥ed unless I get saved by some macho civilian contractor with an assault rifle. That didn't happen. I died, and I lost my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gold and had to go all the way back there to get it. Holy ♥♥♥♥ do I ever feel like the developers specifically knew that would happen because every time I went back to get my gold I would get it, then die again. Eventually I just ALT+F4d my whole afternoon away and went to have breakfast.  so all in all this game is pretty good. i recommend it if you have time to REALLY devote because honestly I walked around with a wooden sword chopping at bugs for about 15 hours before I realized I could build a better sword.  P.S. this is a crafting voxel game.... hope you like material collecting because that's how you lose 282 hours of your life if you're not careful.",

Just remember that there really isn't any particular tutorial or guide/indicator on the amount of content, so you may need to look-up some wiki on the internet. Looking up some online guide shouldn't be particularly a problem as this game is great to be played in non-full screen mode and you can easily keep a browser open next to the game-window. So, what can you do in this game?In Terraria, the emphasis is laid on crafting, terra forming and boss monsters. The re are a lot of items to craft (and spend time to discover). You can alter the landscape rather drastically as the entire world is made up of removable objects and you can fill it in however you want. You can build using a large variety of blocks/furniture. The combat in itself is rather simple, but there are a huge variety of different effects from multiple weapons and their types (spells, swords, grenades etc) and each boss monster has an own attack pattern and several other gimmicks which makes it feel less repetitive. If you are the kind of person who wants to quickly complete the game by killing all boss monsters, then you will probably still spend a day or so to do this, which is great. If you are the kind of person who wants to casually stroll along, play a little bit, build a bit and kill boss monsters whenever you feel bored, you will find yourself spending a lot of hours in this game. There are also random events throughout the game, which either ends up in you fighting large hordes of monsters or allows you to mine special stuff. After spending more than 100 hour in it, I still find myself occasionally coming back to finish a building project I was doing or to do another playthrough through the boss monsters. So yea, its recommended.",

There are so many different items to use to craft with, so many items to craft, and so much to explore. Not only is there a vast ammount of items, but the items themself have such awesome unique abilities on certain ones that really make the game have it's own unique awesomeness. For instance, finding a pair of boots that make you fly into the sky, finding an item that helps you scale walls easier, and armor that regenerates your life quicker.   Not only items, but bosses. There is quiet a good variety of bosses in this game as well. For the first time playing, it's incredible to discover everything that this game has to offer. The reactions to the world as you start to effect it by your actions are also very interesting. Including events that randomly happen, such as goblin army attacks. Terraria literally makes you feel like this is a real living world.  I also like the simple touches, like how you can create your own character, and take it's items anywhere you want. The feel of being able to do all of this in a 2d platforming style is 75% the reason why I love the game the most though.  If you are hesitant at all on this game, don't be. There is literally always something to keep you interested to play. The initial price of 9.99 is purely worth it. If you see the game on sale any lesser, then please do yourself a favor and buy it.",

I only have two complaints;   1) When youre trying to fight the controls arent responsive enough. It might be on purpose but you (maybe just me) simply can't switch weapons fluidly.  Example: I was clearing wall (using a hammer) to see if it kept spiders from getting to you (it, in fact, does not). Got jumped by an enchanted sword and a zombie skeleton. My hammer is like the 4th tier so it isn't even remotely capable of hurting hard mode enemies. Literally spamming 1 for the first couple of seconds to switch to my gun. No go. Perhaps I'm out of ammo, I thought. Start spamming 4 for my sword but I'm still just using the hammer. Maybe I should learn to use the mouse scroll but I feel that when I hit the key that is assigned to a certain tool the game should switch.   2) When you are at base you can be harrassed by enemies. Inventory management is a huge part of this game and it's not a hassle-- when you aren't being attacked. I had based during a goblin invasion after collecting the hell ore (hellstone maybe?) and was preparing to make stuff at base.. but I couldn;'t because these godamned goblin sorcerers teleport to you and shoot you through the wall. Annoying as that is, you can't stop them until you defeat the army. I was the only one at base at the time so I had to deal with them, returning below surface wasn't an option because I had a full inventory that I could not sort due to through the wall harass. I suppose I could quick dump into a chest but at the time none of my chests were empty and I am loathe to mix up chest categories.  regardless, i've spent probably 75% of the last 3 days playing this game and it has been a really fun and incredibly frustrating experience. (frustrating in the way that difficult and slightly unfair games are)  If Terarria even looks remotely appealing to you then you should probably try it.  Oh, synopsis of the game.. mine stuff, kill stuff, collect stuff, craft stuff- do stuff to spawn bosses and whatnot.  **3) Why can't the developers just make it so that you can place blocks as fast as you can run?

There are Pets,and Flying devices,transportation devices and many other ways to travel. And many,MANY more things to do. Now before i say what i think of this game,Terraria is NOT a COPY of MINECRAFT.  I think that Terraria is way better than minecraft,I always enjoyed the fact that there are more items and stuff to do. In minecraft,once you got full diamond tools,it gets boring. In Terraria,when you think you have everything,you kill the wall of flesh and EVERYTHING changes. Terraria,is one of those games that you never get bored of,there is just so much to it. In Terraria there are also MANY updates,with SO MANY new things,like 1.3 is coming,sometime...  So i say that i TOTALLY reccomend this game,its VERY addictive and you never get tired of it.

I adore exploring the world, fighting everything possible and recruiting NPC's to buy and sell things to and from.  Recently ive been playing on a server and its great to log on after some time away from it and see how far your friends have advanced, or what theyve built. It's normally things i'd never have thought of or just something built with one of the hundreds of blocks I've never thought of building with. Coming back to finding a house made of honey you can barely walk through is seriously great. The combat feels balanced to me, although im not great at fighting things. There's a massive amount of weapons for the combat type you want to use. Swords, boomerangs, bows, shuriken, muskets, pistols, staves, books and so many more. My personal favorite is summoning weapons that spawn helpful minions. The boss fights are tough but not unfair and are able to be progressed at your own pace or not at all. This can help you gain more helpful NPC's or better equipment. It's a great idea to look up the wiki on the game if you don't understand something as it can be very complex to summon a boss more than once or to figure out how an NPC spawns. Simply put I've bought this game at least 12 times, although I'd estimate I've actually bought it 20 times and would happily buy it again. A great game and if its on sale its a massive bargain as i consider it cheap at its full price for the amount of time I've put into it.  A definite good buy.",

            "review_text": "Don't let the 'simple' graphics and the obvious catchphrase 'Minecraft in 2D' fool you. Terraria is its very own thing, a genre-blend with a ton of content, and a surprisingly deep and challenging game.  Stranded on an island floating in an endless ocean, you're... well, free to do whatever you like. Terraria is a sandbox game, and no matter what you're looking for, chances are you'll find it here. There's combat, there's loot, there's bosses. There's collectibles and rare items. There's crafting and potion brewing, there's magic and mechanisms. There's pets and hats. There's all that and more.  Par for the course you start as a weak, ill-equipped dude (or lass) with just a few basic tools and the company of a knowledgable 'guide' who spouts advice and also knows every crafting recipe there is. From the very first minute you'll feel the danger of the world, too: Slimes will mercilessly pounce at you, and the first of many deaths will probably happen sooner more than later.  You make the sandbox your own by harvesting blocks, crafting stuff out of those raw materials, and upgrade to a point where you can feel save- a small house maybe or a makeshift shelter to spend the night, where the undead come out. Your first metal bars will see you getting a better weapon, faster tools. Soon the world will be yours for the taking, right? So far, so good, so Minecraft? Yes, a bit.  After a slow start, Terraria quickly shows its true colours though. Combat is a much bigger factor in this game, and the 2D nature makes it simple and enjoyable to fight a hodgepodge of monsters with sword, bow, gun, magic, or any combination. Exploring the finite world will often lead you to another chokepoint where your equipment doesn't cut it and even skill can only get you this far- it's one of those games where your skill is a factor but your stuff is slightly more important. And only exploring will net you new materials- the amount of blocks you can harvest and refine is amazing; if you wish you can create some truly beautiful structures and deck them out with tons of decorative items, all themed and occasionally crazy awesome. Want your furniture made of ice? Sure thing, why not? Or maybe simple wood? Gears, maybe? It's all there.  Still deeper in the game you'll face unique boss monsters. You could stop right here and say, yes, that's enough for me, collecting all these awesome things and building and fighting and all. But it doesn not stop there. If you take on a certain final boss you put your world into a special mode and even more crafting, looting, fighting, exploring options unlock.  And even that is not the end. This game is literally as endless as you want it to be.  --  So, yes. This is a 2D sandbox game that often feels like a MetroidVania game where you're free to (re)build the level yourself and make it as epic as you want. As you make progress you're also able to lure NPC characters into your world by building them shelter- Merchants, a nurse, your ever-faithful guide and more all offer certain services for hard coin. There's a ton of collectibles, from clothes to pets to legendary items. Building a museum to showcase everything would probably take a large world just because there's so frikking much of it. On day you may leave your awesome castle, decked out in the best armour and wielding the best weapons and knowing every nook and cranny of your realm, and THEN you'll find something you had no idea was there.  It's that kind of game.  --  If anything, after the time it's been around, and after two very beefy updates (the 1.3 one hit just a few days ago), Terraria starts to feel extremely manic. There's just so much of everything and while I really dig the 'patchwork' approach some may be put off by seeing traditional fantasy stuff blended with steampunk, magic, and the odd pop culture reference. I mean, you can go out and kill Cthullhu's Brain. With a yo-yo. While wearing a Creeper costume. In an arena made of confetti.  It IS that kind of game, if you want it to be :D",

I think I studied more about my upcoming Skeletron battle than I did for any test in school. So you could imagine the ecstacy I had when I finally defeated him. It was   all   worth it. And the rush of a battle you've been preparing for for several days is unrivaled. Not to mention the creator keeps doubling the content (weapons, armor, bosses, NPC's) about every 6 months, leaving you with an endless pursuit for the newest shiniest loot. On top of that, there are a seeming infinte number of building blocks and craftable decorations so you can craft a home with almost anything you dream of. If you don't mind losing a few dozen hours of your life, and a bit of grinding here and there, this game is definately worth considering.",

You see, my first experience was spoiled because I came in with the expectations and preconceptions of one who had played another-game-which-is-often-compared-to-Terraria for a good deal of time. The blocks here seemed too small. One of the (virtual) dimensions seemed to be lacking. The amount of time it took to hack away dirt walls from a cave nearby my starting point made me nauseated. Then I cried myself to sleep over my loss. I had nightmares of tiny blocks pelting me, and of being unable to build massive structures in five minutes. My sleep was light, and I woke up the next day traumatized, in a mental fog.  Just kidding about the crying myself to sleep part. I don't cry. And the nightmares, too. I'm too cool for them. Also, I'm always that way in the morning before I have my cup of coffee. Coffee is my only friend in the morning.  But I did try and play it a few more times, just to get my dollars' worth on it. Then, the transformation began to happen. I began to despise the simplicity of said 'other game', its lack of technical rigor, and armor made of diamonds. I had been blind to the wonders of living in a two-dimensional world, and the effort required to craft -- truly craft -- a satisfying RPG character. About eighty hours of gameplay later, I've not regretted my decision to purchase this game. My interest in it has only grown stronger.  If you or a loved one has been traumatized by preonceptions about how Terraria should be experienced, please encourage them to press forward. It's not so bad once you get tools that aren't terrible.",

The objective of this game is to keep on egtting bigger nad better gear in order to continue the fight in this world. You create a character and a world, and it can either be softcore (dont lose items if you die), normal-core (lose items if you die, but you can retrieve them back), and hardcore (character gets deleted, but world is still there). You you drop something, it stays there FOREVER until you leave the world. You need to continue fighting in order to advance your weapons and armor and other 'stuff', like aesthitic items for a base or items that you can equip to mke your character look better or get stronger. There are two 'modes': easy mode, and hard mode. The only way to get to hardmode is if you beat the hardest boss on easymode. This will turn your world into a nightmare, as very hard enemies begin spawining, as well as openeing up new ores and materials to further your adventure. It is sort of an RPG because you can be a mage, a fighter, or a ranged person, but you can also build structures like houses, farms, etc..  I recommend buying this game.

The NPCs walk around and providing a nice back drop of activity. Crafting in many dimensions, coupled with switches and the ability to shape the environment brings the sand box alive. Reading the wiki is a must, as there are very few in game clues to indicate what you should do next. However the crafting treadmill in the wiki gives lots of planning options.

The crafting system is super easy but i wish that you could actully see how much you need to craft the item you want to craft instead of having to already have the materials to be able to craft. there are alot of bosses so it will take a while for you to beat the game. the world is huge when in large size and still very big even on small size. its very challenging to play on hard mode which leads to ALOT of hours on your account. the only game breaking glitch i have experienced is whenever i get money its replaces another stack of money wuch is really bad since you need money later on and even in the start.",

If you like fighting bosses and other enemies, Terrearia is packed with hundreds of creatures hostile and friendly including unicorns, skeletons, goblins, snowmen, bats, and all sorts of strange made up creatures such as a 'Derpling'. Terraria has many bosses, each very different and challenging. You can fight with all kinds of weapons and have minions help you! Fly on a U.F.O or glide around on wings to find floating islands guarded by Wyverns(dragons)! Explore a vast dangerous jungle or the fiery depths of the underworld! If it's too much to handle, gather your friends and take on the world of Terraria together! But beware the Crimson and Corruption, pure evil that will take over your world. Build houses for NPCs to move in to help you along the long journey to defeat the Moon Lord and obtain the most powerful weapons and armor in the game. You can fish or sit around playing with Teleportation potions, you could do anything your imagination tells you to do in this wonderful game! When it's time for the holidays, special things happen in Terraria during Halloween and Christmas. This is an absolutely amazing game and I suggest you buy it. The only limit is your imagination.

I don't really know what else to say.  The one point I always bring up when the debate begins about wether Minecraft or Terraria is better, I always say Minecraft simply because of the redstone. Now yes, there are wires in Terraria, but no specific goal apart from traps exists, while in Minecraft I occupy myself with building binary calculators in survival mode. This is very entertaining.

With different playstyles and newly generated worlds each game it boosts massive ammounts of replayability, and now with the implimention of being able to set up a server through steam it's easier than ever to enjoy the game with friends. And if after all of that you remain unconvinced the developers continue to make massive FREE content patches years after the games release, these content patches have made the game so much bigger than it was all those years ago. Honestly I cannot recomend this game enough. And to everyone claiming this game is a rip off of minecraft they are disgustingly uniformed children.",

I only have 40 ish hours on pc because ive completed this game countless times on the console versions. The game had a bit of a rough patch where the developer left it seemingly forever but i was still interested so i found out a massive update was coming out for the game. I was expecting a lot but not as much as we got, more biomes, seemingly hundreds of enemies, weapons, armours, bosses, npcs. This game and the updates by the developer never seem to dissapoint. Ive soaked hundreds of hours into this game all together. The only complaint about it is that it doesnt have steam workshop support but to be quite honest you can replay the game 5 times gathering thousands more items along your journey, with or without friends. Being able to switch your class as you go or just not have a class at all and have a sword on one slot with a magic weapon in the other. The graphics and soundtrack are so beautiful and unique and each weapon post early game does something new and you can play it however you want and with no disadvantage. Still has some bugs and loads more on other platforms but the game on pc is truly something to behold. Would recomend to anyone. If you havent tried this game out yet then where have you been? The game is as good as it gets. I mean, in what other game can you fight off a massive eye ball with a cannon that fires bunnies, as pirates invade you while your village inhabitans just die off one by one?",

New bosses, new events, new items, new features, more awesomeness! My friend has a record of about 380 hours on this game and we kept playing together on a server of his, so I definitely have more than 350 hours spent on this game as well.  Pros: + Beautiful soundtrack. + Nice pixelated 2d graphics. + A lot of cool bosses. + Cool different events, such as the Blood Moon or the Pumpkin Moon and the temporary Christmas event. :D + Lots of different materials to build with. + Awesome decorations. + Different classes: Melee, Ranger (arrows or bullets), Mage, Summoner. Note: You're not stuck with a class or something. You're free of how you want to play. You can, for example, have armor for Melee, but still use magic attacks. + Cool NPCs. + Awesome random features such as fishing. ''wow, fishing... so amazing'' Seriously, it's quite fun. You don't expect what you'll get. I for example got myself a cool red beard. o: + Awesome random items, such as the red beard I got while fishing. + One of the best games to play with friends. :) + No lag at all. - I used the most crappy laptop ever which has about 0-15 fps on Minecraft and crashes when I send a message through Skype. + More amazing ♥♥♥♥ to come!

And some faction npc's like one per type of influnce (you already have two: The Dryad, &amp; the Truffle) maybe have one for the crimson and curruption influnces. traveling warriors would settle and protect the town. and the lunitic occultist should become a npc when defeating the moon lord. and when you wish to rebattle him he'll teleport back and wait for you there. you don't have to do all of that but things like it would bring folks like me more into the game.",

The game's deceptively pleasant background music will catch you off guard and will be echoing in your head at the most inappropriate times. I've happily come to accept it as white noise at this point. As far as the gameplay is concerned it is by far one of the best sandbox games I own. You can choose to collect cool weapons and armor to defeat powerful enemies or focus on crafting new items and terraforming. I actually really enjoy the simplicity of this 2D side-scroller and don't view the lesser graphics as a negative. That being said if you’re looking for cutting edge 4k content this game won't quench your thirst. This game is best played with a few friends that can help you get some of the key items otherwise it takes a bit more grinding. The game can be frustrating at times, but that is part of its charm. Looking for new ways to overcome difficult obstacles is very stimulating and rewarding. Endgame content is scaled appropriately with new updates being added to enrich total content on a regular basis. My only critique is that the developers created some items in the game that only their personal avatars could obtain and even went so far as to ensure your death if your player were to somehow obtain them through non-standard means. Overall, I would give this game a 10/10. I personally love this game and I hope my review convinced you to give it a chance.  -Drake",

However, that is not the objective. Terraria is played in two sections; Pre-Hard Mode and Hardmode. It is important to note that both of these sections are essentially one game.   You start out with nothing, and you have to slowly explore and collect enough good and resources to build a village/castle/glorified hotel for the collection of NPC character that you will amass. These NPC's are useful tools throughout your playtime and shoudl be looked after. Don't worry if they die, a new one will come back.   As you progress through Pre-Hardmode you fight a series of progressivley more difficult bosses untill you are ready to face the Wall of Flesh. Once this is defeated you enter Hardmode where the enemies are toughter, there are more random events and you gain access to the end game material.   =========================================  To wrap up quickly: Terraria allows you to explore, progress, collect, build and kill through as many hours of gameplay as you wish to put in. Made better by multiplayer, either co-op or PvP (optional), each world will be different and can be exactly what you make it.",

This is an amazing game, especially after 1.3 and the support for Mac. I might have only had this game for a year, and wasted a ♥♥♥♥ ton of hours on it because who needs life, but already, I'm in love with this game. And here's reasons why:  -It's a sandbox, so basically your imagination is the limit, and the lack of a 3rd dimension -Unlike Mindraft, or whatever it's called, this game is mostly based on adventure, discovering. And it's pretty much a strong aspect of the game -The music, despite it sounding very bit-like, is amazing. Not a big aspect, but it's great to play a game without an annoying soundtrack.  -The difficulty is just right, whether you're an easy-going gamer or a hardcore gamer And a few other reasons I couldn't add because I'm too lazy  Now, of course, there's flaws:  -The difficulty, even though I said is just right, could use more variety, especially in expert mode -The soundtrack being a DLC is alright, but having it the same price as the game? Seems a bit too much. Sure it's not used that much, but still, maybe tone it down to like, $5 to $7? -The backup, like everyone says, is broken. I find this small, but with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC most people have, it could use more fixes. I'm aware there's a backup program. -The steam intergration, sorry if it's harsh, is ♥♥♥♥. Absolutely ♥♥♥♥. Even if you have great wifi, and a beefy PC, it's still bad. Too many glitches, lags and dropping out randomly. You can use hamachi or other things to host servers, but I find 'steam intergration' useful, and quick, but still, fix it please  Other than its flaws, it's still a fantastic game. Great job Re-Logic, and keep up the great work!",

The Guide was an ♥♥♥, but the kind of ♥♥♥ that knows that he still has a reason for living so you can't kill him. (Until later...) I kind of pretended that everyone who lived in my house had a kind of soap opera drama going on when i was out killing and mining. It was pretty funny.  So when the Guide said that i could summon a powerful monster, i got excited and jumped right in to the fight. I died in less than ten seconds. It was awesome. So i got better gear and later on pwned the boss that killed me earlier. And when i got back home and talked to the guide again, he then said that there was an even more powerful monster i could fight.  Rinse and repeat a bunch of times until now.  The point is, if you're looking for a game that constantly challenges you and kicks your ♥♥♥ until you finally learn what to do and progress, then this is the game for you. And also, i prefer it over minecraft mainly because i can see what is going on around me instead of getting paranoid and looking around everytime i leave my house to go get stuff.",

Terraria on the other hand has more then ten bosses, loads of weapons, Blood Moons, Slime Rain, huge dungeons with chests everywhere. Does Minecraft let you ride a unicorn? Does Minecraft have a rainbow biome? Does Minecraft have a lot? When you strip it down to the bones, this is what Minecraft is: crafting, building, fighting, boss, nether portal, boss. However, this is Terraria: Spawn, spend five minutes running about in confusion, build better weapons, night falls, die, die a lot, go looking for better gear, get better gear, become good at not dying, dig down into hell, kill a wall made of flesh, fight off an goblin army, fight off pirates, shoot bees out of a gun, ride a unicorn, realize that hard mode really is hard, die even more, get even better at surviving, get all achievements.  Comparing Terraria to Minecraft is like comparing a shark to a goldfish, you just don't want the goldfish but sometimes you want a break from the sharks and then the goldfish seems alright.",

It is regularly compared to minecraft which is a game in its own field which Terraria should not be compared to. Infact the backdrop to the majority of the hate this game gets is that its a 'bad 2d version of minecraft'. This is what keeps this game as underrated as it is. I have known many people, myself included who viewed this game as bad and then, once i played it, we realised how good it was.  This game is more like a co-op rpg sandbox game with an enjoyable gameplay, challenging bosses and a ruthless environment where the player must survive. The game gets progressively more insane with bosses that, if your friend told you about them, would seem completely unbelievable. An advanced weapon range, amazing bosses (especially for the graphics resolution used) and an all out challenging experience make for possibly the best sandbox Rpg of its aspect.   Even if you are repulsed by this game, give it a try. I most highly reccomend it.",

I had also been big into MC for years, and I didn't think I would like playing something that looked to me, like a bad 2D MC clone.  I was very wrong about that btw. Terraria is NOT very much like MC at all. Whereas I thought I would not like it mainly bc it was 2D, I did not realize just how much Depth this game has. Once I finally let my son talk me into playing this with him, my enthusiasm soon outstripped his. While he focused on advancing us thru the many stages of the game, preparing us to summon &amp; fight each successive boss and unlocking the next level of content, I focused on exploration and building us a nice base.  My recommendation is if you have friends who play Terraria, ask them to let you join them. This will help get you acclimated to the game and help get you drawn into it. Once you get a feel for the game, you can make your own world and immerse yourself into the adventure-driven progression and then move along at your own pace.  It's a sandbox yes, but it does have many many bosses. Also, when you start playing, you are in the 'Normal' mode, which is actually called 'Pre-Hardmode'. There are 5 or six bosses you can summon to fight or farm for loot, and a final boss called the Wall of Flesh that once you kill it, you enter into the next world phase called Hardmode.  Hardmode unlocks new mobs, bosses, crafting materials, gear and a whole lot more. Normal mode is a vast game in itself. Hardmode is a much bigger game.  You owe it to yourself to get it on sale and try it. It really is a very fun game, and one you can lose yourself in for many many hours.",

This game is what sandbox games should be. There's a beginning, a middle, and an 'end'. Most of the enemies in this game are original and creative. There are bosses that you must defeat to gain access to better weapons and equipment. The game continues to get harder as you get stronger (in a good way, not a 'we'll make the enemies the same level as you so there's an illusion of difficulty' way). The music in this game will be stuck in your head for weeks, up until you're browsing YouTube for remixes and 1-hour loops, and then you'll get those stuck in your head. There's options for whether or not you want to go in balls deep with a character that dies permanently, or one that just drops a certain percentage of currency he or she was carrying. Did I mention character customization? Simple crafting mechanics. Easy structure building. An (optional) smart cursor that predicts what and where you want to pick with an pickaxe or smack with a hammer to make demolishing a thing much more simple and faster. Updates that add in new content such as new bosses, new goals, and new weapons. Interesting NPCs. Fishing. Humor. TONS of references to other games, books, and movies. Tired of being on land? Build a tower to the sky and live in space. Tired of being ontop of the world (literally)? Dig your way down until you find (literally) hell itself. Want to make your house out of clouds? You can do that. Want to make your house out of clouds that are constantly raining? You can do that. Want to re-summon a boss that you really enjoyed fighting? You can do that. Do you like a certain piece of music and wish you could take it around with you? You can do that. Events such as Blood Moons and Martian Invasions will occur spawning tough enemies that threaten not only you but the NPCs that live there. Virusus such as the Crimson or Corruption will try to spead across your world, infecting the land itself turning it to the darkest gray or the thickest of blood....  Cthulhu. AND his brother.

Many game days of mining later I have finally got enough platinum to create a slime crown. I sort out my inventory with that and some suspicious eyes. Am heading off to create a boss arena when a message pops up in the chat: ‘You feel an evil presence watching you. I run to where I want to build it but get confused why he hasn’t spawned yet. ‘The eye of Cthulhu has arrived’.  “Oh crap, oh crap!” I start frantically building the arena but his attacks soon knock me into a pit where he annihilates me. I rush back but he has already de-spawned. I spend the rest of the night and the following day finishing the arena and building a small house underneath so I can spawn there. The arms dealer immediately spawns and decides to make this his house. By this point the day is over and I can no longer spawn the slime king. The next day I spawn him and manage to trap him on the other side of a door making him an easy picking. I then try digging through the wall of the house so I can shoot him from below even when he is jumping. He is on very low health when he glitches under the door frame into the ground and kills me because I can’t get away. Because I destroyed the wall of the house I spawn back at the start point and he de-spawns before I get back.   When it is getting close to night I am very frustrated and start mashing the button to spawn Cthulhu. The night starts and two messages come into the chat. ‘The blood moon has risen’ and then ‘The eye of Cthulhu has arrived’. I manage to defeat him even while dodging zombies and normal demon eyes, quickly grab the loot and sprint back to my base. All the doors are open and on the ground floor my merchant, Frank, is on very low health. It’s hard but I manage to fight off the zombies. I sit back a moment, victorious and watch the rising of a beautiful new morn.  ‘A goblin army is approaching from the West’  “Oh come on!” I try fighting them off but soon Frank is slayed. And the base is getting overrun. I try to draw them away but they only seem to spawn near the original spawn (the same place as my base). I think that I’m getting towards the end and don’t think the forty or so enemies I faced really counts as an army. Then five more come all at once and I realise that was only the first wave. The battle continues all through the day and into the night. I now have to contend with goblins, zombies and low visibility. Finally when I think the waves will never stop coming: ‘The goblin army has been defeated.” I collect all the loot and have doubled my money. I dump it all in a chest and set out on a nice relaxing fishing trip.  10/10 would definitely get trolled by this game again.",

Nothing is impossible, nothing requires you to repeat anything. You are truly alone in a world out to kill you in any way it can. And there is nothing stopping you from turning any tables you find. This is not the developer's story that you have to sit out. This is your story. This is a world you can truly immerse yourself in. If you want to do it, you can do it, given you are strong, fast, clever, and determined enough. There is nothing to wait for, there are no glass ceilings, experience points, or skill caps. There is just you, and the world out to get you. Go and show it what you're made of.  Oh, and there's multiplayer.

When you first start the game, life is tough and things will probably move very slowly especially if you're completely new to the game (or when you start Expert Mode with new characters and completely forgot how to basic) but once you get going you'll plow through events and bosses like nothing. All 3 mech bosses at once? EASY! Soloing the entire Lunar Event, and eventually farming the entire event (ML included) 40+ times with little to no effort? EASY! Restarting in Expert mode with new characters? EASY......somewhat....okay well thats a lie but at some point I'll edit this and say its easy.  -Lots of weapons/tools/armor/accessories etc. of various materials and rarities that can be built, found, or dropped (Laser Drill, Laser Minigun, Phantasm, Terrarian, Nebula Blaze&amp;Arcanum, Solar Flare, Daybreak, and Last Prism just to name a few.) that can be reforged (giving a prefix to an item which can buff or nerf your weapon).  -Quite a few different types of enemies and a few minibosses (Slimes, Zombies, Wyverns, King Slime, Queen Bee).  - FOURTEEN BOSSES  -a few different types of biomes (three of which spread overtime, two are considered evil)  -lots of building materials/decorations etc. (Martian, Cobalt, Mythril, Adamantite, Palladium)  -plenty of things to do, countless hours of fun with your friends. (surviving your first night, building stuff, exploring, fighting bosses, fishing, fishing, fishing, catching butterflies and various critters?)  - Events! Some of these events are things that will happen at random times of day. For example. Blood Moon happens during night time. The Moon is blood red, water turns from blue to red, bunnies turn from adorable little fluf fballs to nasty little devils, increased enemy spawn rates and in some cases blood moon exclusive enemies, enemies can open doors, etc. Blood Moon is the first 'natural' (I call it natural because it happens naturally and can't be triggered) event a player will encounter which happens once a player on the server has over a certain amount of health. A Solar Eclipse is the daytime version of a Blood Moon except a lot tougher this event is natural but can also be triggered (Solar Tablets) and is Hardmode only. Also during Winter/Christmas you get special mobs!  I do want to mention that once you beat the final boss/every boss in game, if you're sticking to one character and one world (chances are you won't be sticking to one character/one world)....you'll be bored out of your mind. You can continue to build megastructures like one of my friends, or go fishing....until you get the achievement for 200 fishing quests....then you're either building megastructures, going on a vacation/retiring, or starting a new life in a new world on a different difficulty. There are some really talented people out there who can make some amazing feats of Terraria engineering (Shoutout to DicemanX's Moon Lord AFK farm map) so if you're into making cool and complex structures, go nuts.",

Sure, you may have heard from folks that it's fun, maybe that it's addictive, that they keep adding content and expanding the game, but it's more than that.  The visual style is on point. They sat down and really nailed a good pixel-art style. Then, they added music. It's great music! This area is, I feel, all too often ignored in games. Not so in Terraria, my friend! And thi si good because you're going to hear this music enough to memorize all of it.  As for the meat of things, the gameplay is pretty solid. The controls are mostly intuitive and it's very easy to dive right in. The setting and story seem to be absent at first and while this sometimes works with other sandbox games, Terraria has taken a really good alternate approach: The Guide. They have given you a guide to get you started on this journey and to whom you can turn if you ever aren't sure what to do next. You are supposed to make use of him. Really, he's a pretty good alternative to wikis and spoiler sites. If you want to be a purist like that, go for it, you are totally able!  Finally, the thing that has kept me coming back is the sheer amount of raw content. They just put out another large update and heaven knows I'm about to generate a new world and start again. There is enough gameplay elements to keep you going through the main 'story' (read: 'sequence of boss monster fights') for dozens of hours. And unlike so many other titles out there, the balance is pretty excellent. The bosses are tough but vastly rewarding. There can be grinding if you need but more than likely you'll find most if not all the resources you need just by exploring the world and discovering new things. If you're a collector or a completionist or a packrat, get yourself some supplies because you'll be here for well over a hundred hours.   And once all that's done there are mechanics for multiplayer games like capture the flag and PvP fights. Not your thing? Don't sweat it. The game will also encourage you to build a beautiful, grand fortress in which to live and house your small nation of NPC's. Heck, if you're really proud of what you've built, put a picture up of it online. There are currently tons of images of outright works of art that people have whipped up. (I myself was/am pretty proud of Candycane Keep.) There's really something here for almost any kind of gamer.  Tl/dr; This game is highly polished, has lots of attention to detail, has tons and tons of content, and is just good enough at balancing challenge and reward to keep you coming back over and over again.",

Nevertheless, I do think this game is very well worth it if you have not picked it up yet. Granted, I have not played much of the more recent updates, so this review could very well be out of date.  Despite the cheap price, there is a fair amount of content in the game, such as varying monsters to hunt down, invasion events, and bosses to kill. As well as plenty of building blocks to give you a chance to build almost anything you want.  The game can be played in multiplayer, but multiplayer is not necessary. A solo player can still find a good amount of enjoyment, even if they are playing alone. Friends would make the game a bit more easier and perhaps more fun.  Combat is basic and easy-to-reasonable for the most part when not taking expert mode into consideration, but that mode is more for more 'experienced' players anyways. Not to mention that since this is a sand boxy game, it gives you options to kill the bosses and monsters in a variety of ways, such as making an arena for the boss so you have more options to move around or making a lava area for some invasions.  I do admit though, there are times in the game where it feels like it has a painfully slow start till you can start killing and mining things at a resonable pace, specifically the first and middle parts of the game after you beaten a certain big boss. The game CAN be pretty grindy at times, especially when RNG is not kind to your character.   It's also a really heavy 'wiki' game. Meaning, you would probably want to look up in a wiki to gather most of the information, such as loot drops from enemies, how to craft a particular item, how to summon a particular boss, how housing mechanics work for npcs, ect. I recommend using the Official Terraria gamepedia wiki for this game. A minor nuisance really.  Another bug bear for me was expert mode, it felt much more grindy than an actual challenge. Maybe this changed with the more recent updates.  All that said, for me the above were not deal breakers, so I would still recommend this game, especially to those that like exploring or are looking for a reasonably priced game.",

To me, the only similarities between the two are the fact that you can mine ore and craft better tools/weapons/armor, and the necessity of building shelter to survive the night.  You start off by creating a character, with the option to select hair styles and clothing styles. After you have your character, you have the option to select a large, medium, or small world. Characters are not bound to a specific world, you can take any character to any world you like. Worlds are randomly generated, with many different biomes such as deserts, forests, sky islands, and even a dungeon biome. There are two special biomes, Corruption and Crimson, only one of which will be generated in a world. These two special biomes will have certain enemies and equipment only found in that particular biome, so you will have to take your character to new worlds to experience everything.  Terraria has a strong progression system, mainly centered around defeating bosses. And there are MANY bosses to fight. There are many npcs you can find and unlock. Every npc will need a house built for them before they offer you thier sevices. You will find yourself needing to upgrade your equipment pretty regulary, by mining/crafting, finding treasure chests, and defeating enemies/bosses. After defeating a certain boss, your world will enter 'Hardmode', which introduces several changes, making it feel almost like starting a new world.  There are literally thousands of different items to collect in game, ranging from weapons and tools, to armor sets, to cosmetic placeables. Four different combat styles are available: Melee, magic, ranged, and summoning, with hundreds of weapons for each. Outside of combat, there is a staggering amount of different building materials to use in creating your own base/town/castle/etc. There is also a wiring system available that can be used to create everything from drawbridges to flashing lights to deadly traps.  Terarria is one of the very few games that (in my opinion) approaches perfection. There are, however a few things I can be critical about. The soundtrack can get a bit repetitive, along with certain sound effects. Drop rates for a few items are a bit ridiculous, but that's only really a problem for completionists. I personally think there's room for improvement with the inventory and crafting systems. Even with these slight flaws, I would give this game a rating of 9.3/10. I seriously can't recommend it enough.",

But this game does so much more than what Minecraft does, it has for an example: + A real combat experience with A LOT of different weapons and styles of combat + Insane variety of enemies to fight + Fair boss fights that can prove challenging at times but never losing their 'fair' component (altho' they will brutally murder any new player who starts up having never played Terraria before) + A VAST world to explore... 'EVERY' single time you generate a new world + Outstanding community tools to learning every nuance of the game + A LOT of variety to create amazing pixel art and structures that are just stunning to look at (no 3D models as everything is 2D but this game proves that you just need to be able to go Left, Right, Up and Down and still create amazing art) + You can set up dedicated servers so you can make it really, really easy to play with friends online but... + ... playing on your own is also exceptionally rewarding albeit with a certain requirement to set up your own goals or else it might be a bit overwhelming + HUGE custimization options both for the world generation, the difficulty and character creation Downsides: - I guess it takes a few minutes to install the game?  Do I recommend this game? I will say this much: If you like survival games where you get to loot, mine, fight, craft or any of these things... you are making yourself a disservice by not owning Terraria already! Stop reading!

(insert baby don't hurt me meme here)  It all started in March 27, 2013. The day I found about Minecraft: The game everybody talked about. So, I research it, and eventually get it. I begin getting mad at my hand-me-down laptop for not launching the game. I eventually went out to Wal-Mart and got a Windows 8 laptop. This is where FNaF comes in, but not now (that game is terrible in my opinion). I went back home and set the computer up, and then buy the game for $27 AGAIN. Download, and then it works and runs great! A few months later, I met my bud Ju1cy Ju1c3. He showed me some Skyrim gameplay, and Just Cause 2. We eventually discussed a game in his library called 'Terraria' Now, I never knew how cool it was until he showed me gameplay. I told him 'Terraria is dumb' And this was a guess. I never had seen gameplay, and eventually we can back to this discussion shortly after I got Castle Crashers, another big thing. I asked if he would show me some gameplay for a few minutes. I researched it later. On Nov. 25, 2015, I bought this game and Garry's Mod, a new big thing. I started up Terraria, and it ran smoothly. Eventually I discovered MULTIPLAYER!! Now this helped tons. We eventually beat all pre-Hardmode bosses and we progressed further in the game from here on. However, there was a little moment we got mad at each other. Coming back to it, it's kinda funny. Ju1cy was trying to kill me, and fell down and received his death. I laughed and eventually he said 'if you laugh house go BOOM' That was when I got the thought of a house that took 7 hours blowing up and being a pile of ashes. And that was avoided. Now that I have the drill mount, it's gone and all that remain are chests. And my dresser. The reason why is because of Crimson. It blew everything up there so my hotel could be safe.  Red, Cenx, D-Town, Loki, and everybody else, I thank your for this game and I feel that this game was meant to be made. It is 2D, yes, but it's better when it's like a throwback to NES and the SNES. I can't wait for Terraria: Otherworld. Take your time on it. Expect me to buy it whenever it's available. This does deserve a Steam Award as this game has hours worth of content and is as awesome as Ocarina of Time (I'm a Zelda nerd). With it's Metacritic score of 83 this game has amazed me by far.  111111111/10",

I personally think that Terraria is far more combat and survival based than Minecraft, sure there is no hunger system, but that's something that actually ruins a lot of fun in Minecraft.  Terraria allows players to embark to completely player-made worlds where obtaining the best gear you can get and fighting the most insane bosses brings that true grind yet fun to the game, it's not a game you can blaze through, you will need time to get to where you want to get in all servers, including your own in single player. There will always be a higher rank you can achieve, there will always be some form of currency that you haven't obtained as much of as you wanted. You might not have the items you want, the bosses you want to fight, or even the right tools to survive, but that's all part of the struggle in Terraria, it challenges you to act fast when encountering an enemy and how to fight them and what is the best equipment to fight them with.   There is a huge and diverse amount of mobs in the game that Minecraft cannot really bring to the table, each with their own fighting strategies and mechanic kits. It is up to you to outsmart the enemy and surprise them with the killing blow and earn your sweet sweet rewards.  How, when and why you fight is completely up to you, you could be running in and out of dungeons, being chased by huge worms underground in the hole you dug, you could be trying to loot some materials, trying to kill a boss for a drop etc.  And just like a lot of RPG games, the drops are RNG, so don't think you'll always get what you want, because this game will challenge you and make the hair of your arms rise until you've gotten out of that dungeon with your measly 10 health.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to try it, it is definitely worth the money and will keep you entertained for years to come.  ~instant classic.",

I started with Minecraft. I played it when it was in alpha. I loved it, and I still love it. But Terraria has stolen me away from it. Terraria has irresistably fun action, especially in the epic boss fights. And there never seems to be a 'best strategy' in the game- no stopping at diamond gear (well, there is no diamond gear, to be honest). Even in the first, easier difficulty half of the game, you've got numerous guns, bows, spears, swords, magic swords, boomerangs, explosives, spells, staves, armors, tools- the list goes on.   And then there's the building. Oh, the building. A bit harder to slide into at first than Minecraft, what with missing a 3rd dimension, but once you get the hang of it, you can build some BEAUTIFUL creations. It's probably one of the most overlooked things in this game, as most people play it just to get through the game and beat all the bosses. But, I want you to go look at some of the pictures of what people build in this game and tell me it doesn't look like something you wish you could do.  And finally, there's the collecting. I'm a completionist, so I've set out to experience every inch of Terraria that I can, and it hasn't failed me thus far. So much to see and collect. For some, you may see a lot of this as grinding. But those fellow completionists, this game is for you.  The enjoyment only multiplies with friends, in every aspect.  For $10, this is a must buy. And if you can't hit that number, the game often goes on sale for a quarter of the price.",

I would say 9.5/10 beings that for 10 dollars this game is so worth it for the amount of hours you can put into this game and still be intrested in this game and there is so much stuff you can make in Terraria to the point where it's like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on so many tools used to craft all of the awesome items in this game. Also I would like to add that there are so many bosses to fight I ain't even joking and all of them when not equipt correctly are extremely hard to fight to the point where you kind of need those items to fight those bosses.

The bosses they added in the latest update are insanely hard to kill alone (minus the Slime King, he's laughably easy), but up to that point the game shouldn't offer insane difficulty unless you dig too deep too early. Starts you off with a sword, a pickaxe, and a hatchet, and you work your way up from there, finishing with a Hamdrax (Hammer/Drill/Axe, all the best tools in one), a flamethrower, a powerful and oversized sword, and the most awesome house ever to exist if you bother to make it. Just don't make it in space, monsters spawn when you're higher than 700 feet that you really won't like. Ruined our space station.  EDIT: They changed the wyvern spawning. Building in space might be safe. In some areas.  EDIT 2: Okay, the Hamdrax isn't even close to being the best thing in the game anymore and the progression will keep you occupied for a couple months of addiction, and then you'll start building things and finding all kinds of building materials and you'll be addicted for a couple more months making your server look fantastical.

            "review_text": "I write this review presuming you've never played it elsewhere, and know nothing about it.  At first glance, not having seen actual gameplay, you can easily be forgiven for being put off a bit by the graphical choices of the game- 2D pixel art is a dime-a-dozen thing in this day and age of photorealistic graphics, made mainly by people who would simply wish to harken to a simpler era of graphics.  I could even forgive you handily for thinking it was just another run-of-the-mill sidescroller from the PR they've released- like Minecraft, this is a game that truly deserves to be played to appreciate fully, which is the mark of any well-crafted game.  The fact of the matter is, even just under three years after its release, there is still not a single true equal to the splendorous open-book journey that is Terraria. The goofy name is fitting- this game has numerous quirks in how things work, and you'll find over time that it's chock-full of references from pop culture and even other games.  My apologies for all the hyphenated phrases, there's a fondness I've had for this game from the moment I played it. It makes that immediate connection with you- paints your situation so clearly in just the first few minutes whether or not you decide to do the tutorial. This is, first and foremost, a sandbox game, but whether you thrive or simply get by will depend entirely on your ability within the game.  The first thing you'll notice is that unless you are ridiculously good at the gameplay mechanics, a better weapon has to be just on the horizon. Inevitable as it may be, everything in this game is randomly generated by an ingeniously-coded world generation engine that will keep you on your toes as you explore.  This is where the game differs heavily from Minecraft, where you can go to ridiculous lengths without ever truly needing to upgrade unless you want the extra goodies- you'll have to fight for your resources here, be it against hostile terrain, enemies, or Mother Nature herself- there are things that go bump in the night, and the more sinister elements of the game will consume a good portion of your world if you don't keep them in check.  Yet again, Minecraft comparisons beg- you don't find that vast an array of weaponry usable there, but in Terraria, you name your poison, and it's quite possibly attainable. Classic chivarous combination of sword and armor? Check. Guns that shoot various types of ammo? Check. Lightsaber-inspired? Check. Magic-using wands and enchanted weaponry? Check. A baseball bat? Maybe on the horizon, but I think you get my point.  Exploration is far more focused than Minecraft. As you have a 2D plane, it would also initially appear more limiting, but the game will remind you time and again why you keep coming back for more- these worlds are absolutely massive (even for just being a 2D plane), and will satiate even the most curious minds for countless hours. Once you have defeated certain key bosses, new mechanics of the game will rear themselves and again threaten to bring you back for ever more difficult fun.  Overall, this game is a wonderful, constantly evolving experience, and I could not recommend it enough for a PC owner happy to dig into their chair and play something worthwhile.",

A Sandbox game with a hint of RPG added to it and a whole lot of action, you go around and mine blocks to make equpiment to get more blocks and stuff from the monsters as you go deeper. Sounds like Minecraft? probably. Is it a different experience? Oh Hell yeah.  Thing I gotta say now is, the best part about Terraria is the fast-paced yet balanced gameplay that makes it so fun. Getting better weapons and armor quickens the gameplay, making every new world a whole new experience. Unlocking new tiers of stuff also gives even more xciting gameplay, and it gets you into the game once you start playing it. Heck you will probably want to make a new world once you pretty much got every item there is in the game.  Next is the content. The developers have made so many diffrent kinds of enemies, enviorments and challanges for the player to explore. Many bosses await, and with the recent updates much more content mas come up. Theres still a little Terraria waiting to be shown, but it's still worth the buy, since its got multiplayer as well, all of this for $10. Go buy it. It's worth it.",

Terraria's graphics are at a level that keep immersion, but allows the game to be ran to older PC, that maybe don't have the graphic capability of newer computers. Terrarias vanilla game content is what truely make this game beyond the rest. Unlike Minecraft, with a interesting, but short vanilla progression, Terraria has hours of vanilla game content. In vanilla terraria, you start in normal mode, which will easily kill the unprotected noob, but a smart player will find their way around the ropes. Also unlike Minecraft, Terraria has several bosses that make progression difficult, but still playable. After killing the Wall of Flesh, which is considered to be the main boss of Terraria, you enter hardmode. Hardmode has new ores, mobs, and area to discover.  Fastest Terraria playthrough: 6:45:00 Fastest Minecraft playthrough:1:27:00 Those are just the basics of the game too, Terraria has so much more than just that, which could easily last you up to 20 hours per playthrough. Maybe more if you truely expand your horizons, you can play for as long as you want. ",

I reckon I put 200 hours in on the original release version, and there was still plenty that could be done.  In 2013, Re-Logic announced that there was to be an update - update 1.2. From that moment on, with no extra charge to the people who had already bought the game, patches came regularly. In game content has been doubled, hundreds more items and variations and possibilities have opened up. New bosses, yadayada ya.   This game is one which should not be missed, nor forgotten.",

            "review_text": "'Minecraft in 2D' is what immediately comes to mind when seeing this game, but after playing for a while you begin to realize that the two are markedly different.  Terraria has a much higher focus on combat. You start off fighting slimes and zombies with wooden tools but quickly discover bosses, rare monsters, and dangerous dungeons. The game becomes progressively more difficult and more interesting. New players will progress at their own pace, but experienced players starting a new world can jump straight to endgame if they choose, or ignore the advancement criteria and remain in early game for a more relaxed experience.  There really isn't much grinding to be had in this game. Character progression is driven by gear rather than arbitrary experience points, and gear is typically crafted with small amounts of very specific materials, meaning it is ultimately driven by exploration rather than staying in one particularly profitable spot for the entire game. Bosses and rare spawns also have rare drops, making it a treat whenever they show up.  Creatively, Terraria is somewhat limited in comparison Minecraft due to having one less dimension, but it makes up for it with its myriad of building blocks in all colors and textures. Furniture from beds to chandeliers to pianos can be crafted out of various types of wood and metal, and you can further customize your living quarters using paint and colored lighting. Hammers can also shape the terrain into slopes and half-steps, allowing for a more natural look.  If 'Minecraft in 2D' sounds appealing to you then this game is definitely worth buying, but be prepared to receive something much more.",

But for some reason (I'm cheap) I've never went ahead and purchased it. The biggest reason probably being that I was afraid to get too addicted.  I didn't have that fear with Terraria and I have no idea why because it IS addictive. I tried the terrible free demo on my phone and was happy to finally play the real game. It's fun, very fun. I didn't catch the bug as bad as someone else who I'd convinced to play with me, but that just means they get all the cool stuff while I'm not online and have it there waiting for me when I'm back. It's fantastic.  Though I've definitely put my time in. It's hard to imagine that only a couple weeks ago I was getting slaughtered by Skeletron when I accidently clicked on the word 'curse' and now I'm summoning Skeletron Prime just for the drops and the giggles.  I actually would complain about the game having TOO MUCH... but that's such a weird thing to complain about. You'll be working towards a weapon or armor for so long and it'll stop being relevant after an hour or two of playing with it. There is just so much stuff that's great for a short period of time or for one specific purpose. It definitely keeps the game interesting, but it's depressing shoving armor in a chest that you love but that no longer makes the grade.  That being said... this game is awesome.

The two-dimensional nature of the game helps with this, bringing it closer to platformers as well.  Like Minecraft, it creates a random world with dungeons and biomes featuring unique material blocks. Unlike Minecraft, Terraria places unique enemies, loot and even some special buildings (akin dungeons) into these worlds, randomly generated, but following certain rules every time. The game has a huge lot of content - be it purely aestethic or actually equipment-wise. Every once in a while you will need to defeat a certain boss to get further in the game, gethering more crafting materials as well as armors and weapons along the way.   The game uses a nice crafting system with similarities to the Monster Hunter series, which finds a perfect way to make you want a certain piece of equipment enough to warrant some grinding for it. The armors also work similar, granting special abilities (mostly passive effects) when full sets are in use. The weaponry is divided in three playstyles: - melee combat uses lower ranged weapon (at the start) with nice damage (swords for example). - ranged combat features guns or rifles to shoot enemies from afar, consuming ammo and mostly hitting only one enemy per bullet  - spellcasters use magic to hit multiple enemies at once; this however requires mana management nad big loads of mana potions later on.  Once the entire world is explored, defeating a certain boss transforms the entire world into a different state, much more difficult to navigate due to new, stronger enemies. This includes additional bosses and equipment, too!  All in all, the game was a very engaging experience for me - you constantly try to improve, gaining new gear or spells to defeat that next boss. With the shiny and flashy, fun to use weapons and some relatively hard events, the game's content can bring new things for a very long time.",

            "review_text": "So a review for Terraria.  Gameplay: Just as games like minecraft you are dropped in to the randomly generated world and the first thing you should do is to build a home. To do this you gather materials. You also gather materials to make all kinds of stuff like weapons, armor, furnature you name it. You start with an axe, a pickaxe and a sword. Enemies do not just show up at night there are silmes and other nastier stuff to fight the further in to the world you go or the deeper you dig.  Enemies: Alot of enemies are very easie to deal with specialy at the start and if you take it slow and gather everything you need before you advance you should have no problems dealing with them. But then you have the bosses. Most of them will be a pain to deal with the first time you meet them but when you learn their attack patterns they are also pretty easie.  NPCs: Throu out the world you will find friendly NPCs that even can move into your hause or hauses you make for them. Most of them are murchants of diffrent kinds but there are other useful NPCs as well. It is also good to know that when you have achived some things NPCs will show up of you have a spare room so always have one just in case.  Co-op: This game will always be most fun with friends, but what game isn't? Personaly I couldn't get it to work and yes I know there are way to fix that but I tried them and it still didn't work for me so do not have any experience with the co-op.  Summery and personal thoughts: So this game is a builder/servival game. It if fun and creative and if you like these kinds of games this is a most buy for you but personaly I do not like them without friends. If you pick this up good luck out there and do not dif to deeply or to greedly you might regret it.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of my personal favorite sandbox games out there, let me explain to you why. Terraria is a 'start fresh - figure out how to play this game' kind of game. Upon making a new character, with the newer updates, you are able to choose from a male or female character, as well as change the hairstyle from near three dozen styles, as well as choose the colors of your clothes. Be warned that not all colors translate perfectly when playing the game, so be warned (hues aren't on point in the character creation screen versus the game, but its a minor detail that should be overlooked because it isn't too important).  The game dumps your character in a world with three simple things; a pickaxe, an axe and a shortsword, and with only these you will be able to reach leaps and bounds in the facets of weaponry, tools, armor, furniture and items. The game has a day and night cycle, so you must quickly make a shelter with the tools you were given before the zombies and demon eyes show up at night. Be warned, the presence of stronger enemies, especially in the beginning of the game, gives the player a sense of urgency to make fortifications before nightfall.   The combat evolves to use more than a shortsword, to spears, flails, magic items and guns. The simple 'stab a zombie with the shortsword' doesn't get old like you would imagine. The combat involves balancing your health with the style of play with the weapon you are equipping, and this all varies with each enemy (of which there are many), so fighting enemies doesn't get boring. Each fight can go different ways - it doesn't pan out the same everytime, which helps with combat replayability.  Crafting is a big part of the game too. You must mine for resources and build newer and stronger tools to advance your ability to make stronger armor and weapons, to survive stronger enemies and fight stronger bosses. The only caveat is there are rare items, that are the pinnacle of weaponry, that drop with a small fixed rate (~0.1% or whatever it is). You will be grinding specific types of mobs to farm these items to get the weapons. This is the only thing I dislike about the game, if you choose to go all the way and get these items, the likelihood you will replay the game is low, because it takes such a long time to get these weapons you will not want to do it all again.  The game was awesome before the newer updates, and has lost a bit of replayability after them, but still a good game.  8.5/10",

Terraria shines when played with friends online and using its player versus player option to have multiple teams struggling for survival and item hunting.

You can also get alot of things in Terraria that are fun like boss trophies or mob banners. You can also get many types of armor and weaponry, from your normal iron armor to molten lava and even an armor made of turtle shells. The weapons can be amazing for example the Crystal Storm or the gun shoved down a sharks mouth, the Mini and Mega sharks.

With different in-game biomes such as the forest, jumple and desert, this game may seem similar in style to the critically acclaimmed Minecraft by Notch and Mojang, but I can promise that you will have a much different experience. Whereas Minecraft is more based around the sandbox style (mining, crafting and building), this game is much more centered around action and exploration. With areas such as the Corruption, the Crimson and the Dungeon, all the way to the fierce Underworld, this game will definitely keep you on your toes as you advance through the gradually more challenging places you can go to. There is a very fun action system in the game that allows you to carry an assortment of different weapons, such as swords, bows and explosives, such as bombs and grenades, and the variety of the enemies is truly stunning. There are multiple types of weapons of one category, as well-swords. for example. have four main types: weaker yet faster shortswords, middle range braodswords, powerful but slow greatswords, and the almighty automatic swords. You can build a variety of different things in Terraria with the use of axes, hammers and oddly, pickaxes. You can chop down wood with an axe and then use it to create homestyle lodges, or you can go further and make a pimping gold brick house, assuming you can gather enough gold ore to make that many blocks to actually build it. The explorationm aspect of this game is one of the best I have seen in a 2-D action game, or any action game for that matter. First off, you have the overworld, which will contain areas such as the desert, forest and winter biomes, but once you start to travel underground, that's when the real feel of the exploration kicks in. There are many layers to the underground areas, such as the ground layer and the stone layer, and each of them have their own specific things about them that change the gameplay dramatically.  All in all, I'd say that if you're looking for a game with lots of exploration and action, you should definitely pick up Terraria.",

While at first the game can seem a little bit daunting and perhaps frustrating, Terraria really begins to open up as you advance. The equation of 'risk = reward' brilliantly stands out, for if you dare to venture down into the caverns and dungeons below the surface, the loot to be discovered is fantastic.  With almost two weeks worth of gameplay put into it, Terraria has unveiled a fantastic adventure for me, which is saying much considering my anticipation for a $10 game was exceedingly low. Now I regret even thinking of such a statement. However, while I can throw hundreds of words of praise at it, there are some flaws, but for what it's worth, they can be easily ignored.  In short, Terraria is worth every cent for people who love to build, adventure, and prove to themselves that they're really a hero in the making.",

It's a mish-mash of sidescrolling platforming, world building, and action adventure with some RPG-like elements tossed in for good measure. The randomly generated worlds you start with give you wilderness, caves to explore, materials to acquire to build more things in the world (like structures and items for your character) flying islands to conquer etc., not to mention tons of loot and treasure for your exploration efforts. You can also connect to a friend manually via IP and play their world (and they can connect to yours), always giving it a persistant feel as you watch it evolve in between your own playtime.

I actually don't think they are right either. There's a lot more depth than an alternate dimension of an existing game.  Terraria has a greater focus on the character, and the gear &amp; loot you collect. Your character is free to move between worlds, joining friends, and roaming across new lands in search of rare chest finds, like the Toy Sled or Lava Charm. You level them up with Mana &amp; Heart Crystals, and ever so slowly become a god.  And that in my opinion, is the greatest part of this game. The sheer power you evolve into. In some games, you get bigger numbers, bigger damage, or some nice little new ability. Terrarias progression is a cliff you bound up. The accessories and weapons you gain continously get better and better, you can feel the difference as you grow. I have rarely had a game that has made me feel so powerful.  Which is good, because make no mistake, this game is hard. Unless you're Yrmrir, you are going to get utterly destroyed. The Zombies and Demon eyes pose a real threat on the first night... by the tme struggling against Eaters of Souls is a fading memory, you're getting incinerated by Diabolists and ransacked by Solar Eclipses.  Terraria offers an almost absurd amount of content, and the combat offers many playstyles. I would heartily reccomend this game to anyone.",

Terraria is well polished in my opinion and updates are somewhat frequent. It's always exhilerating when you can summon a boss and kill it with 7 of your friends. That's also a keen point about this game, friends. It's better when you have someone by your side when you're fighting monsters/bosses, exploring, mining, crafting, or digging a hellevator to the underworld. Down to the point, Terraria is a great game to play alone or with friends. 10/10.",

So, this game is mediocre, you walk around and dig for stuff. For no real reason that I could find other than to pave a road for yourself when you fall into some pit. So, you walk left and right (because it's only 2D, remember?) and do what? That's the question I couldn't find answer to. At times you get attacked by some monsters that come out of nowhere. They come in swarms and they're brainless - even flying ones have single pattern of movement. You gotta fight back. You have a sword, a shovel and an axe. The best option is obvious - you shovel flying ones to death, because sword and axe are useless against them (wut?).  And that's about all there is to this game. I enjoyed oldschool DOS version of Prince of Persia more. Personally, I believe buying it even on a sale was a mistake.",

It's a game that lets you craft your dreamworld of 2D goodness, explore randomized caves, underground places, and other weird places, find treasures that will make people jealous of you (like the Magic Mirror, which my character has now! YEAH!), fight bosses like a BIG DAMN EYE, fight slimes, make bombs, make a mansion, construct minecarts to make easy passage to home, fight demons, make armor, etc...   Terraria is just... it's hard to describe. At first, it seems like this Minecraft clone made in 2D. But as you play more, you realize there's a lot to do in the game. It's just awesome. The game will make you laugh, cry, happy, sad, enraged and all other kinds of emotions. Then when the updates came in, the game was like getting little DLC. And even better, once update 1.2 came in, EVERYBODY was happy because many bugs and glitches were fixed, a lot of content was added and then came 1.2.4 where MINECARTS ARE NOW INCLUDED!

Every world is generated randomly; there is no 'seed system' as some may call it. This meaning that the experience is never exactly the same.   Conclusion: Terraria is worth your time. Sure, games such as Minecraft (which this is not a ripoff of) might boast 3D worlds. But does minecraft have over 750 different mobs to kill, over 1,000 items to collect, and, better yet, UNICORNS?

It can be easily compared to junk jack on ios, but, is, in my opinion, a more comeplete experience. While the ever popular Minecraft features very cubular Nintendo 64 style graphics, Terraria takes on the look of a Super Ninendo game graphically. While minecraft is a more creative oriented experience, Terraria is largely based on survival, with a more vast variety of enemies and craftable weapons, armor, and tools. Terraria also has a complex npc system, involving building houses and having them move in at a certain point in the game. Now while Minecarft has only one boss (the Ender Dragon), Terraria has a larger array of bosses to fight. Terraria also has something called hardmode, which is triggered, per world, by defeating the Wall of Flesh (WOF for short). Hardmode worlds have an even bigger variety of enemies and bosses. Terraria also has alot more craftable items, from furniture to weapons to armor to tools, theres no end to the crafting fun. There is also alot more crafting stations, with the crafting system alot eaiserto use. Its does not involve arranging items of a grid (thank god), so there is no need to remember a recipie. Just click and craft. So is Terraria better than, lets say, a game like MInecraft? Well they are both unique in their own ways. So the verdict: it depends on your own personal preferences. In my opinion, they are just as good as one another, but i wil give Terraria a perfect score. definetly a 100/100, and i hope relogic will keep up the good work.",

Course do note that it would have to be dumbed down for me to understand what to do IE a step by step. And whats up with a map where hell is just covered in lava with no accessible path to get hellstone just lava LAKES not pools you can jump over but an ocean covering everything. And with all the time Ive spent in one world I have no desire to try a new one just for that. game gets a lower rating for that. there should be an easy way to connect. Xbox vs is super easy to connect but not as cool as the pc vs whats so hard about adding an ease of connection to the game?",

One major drawback for me is that this does not support linux. It can be run with relatively low system specs. Mods are available as well. Gameplay is awesome, Terraria has non-stop adventures and boss fights, all of which are entertaining and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the server/multiplayer aspect of the game was spent a bit more time on. I could not figure out how to setup a server and attempting to do so crashed my pc or the game more than a few times. This would be really fun in multiplayer. In conclusion, I would recommend buying this game (especially if you have friends that play) as it is very fun and enjoyable for all ages.

After the confusion phase, I became more comfortable with the game itself and how to play it properly. I think what makes this game better than any other Sandbox game, is that the goal is mainly to defeat all of the bosses, climbing the ladder of difficulty modes. This is a change from Minecraft as the goal is to survive, whereas in Terraria, when you die, you lose nothing. I think this is a great feature as it definitely prevents player rage!   If you do decide to purchase this game, beaware that when you first begin, you won't want to carry on. Don't let this stop you playing!

            "review_text": "No other video game has unleashed my creativity like Minecraft. I've spent countless hours chipping away at blocks, gathering the necessary materials to complete the next masterpiece that would otherwise only occupy my mind's eye. I've also spent just as many hours exploring, spelunking and slashing my way through monsters with bravado. My character – my entire Minecraft world – constantly evolves into whatever I want it to be. I tell my own stories, I write my own destiny and I bring my fantasies to life one brick at a time.   Minecraft stands out not only for the way it inspires me creatively, but also because of its unique aesthetic. Look, I know the visuals look dated and a bit silly, but few games have visuals so endearing and charming. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way either, or else Minecraft's graphics wouldn't be so iconic. Could you take a texture from Gears of War, Halo or Uncharted, put it on a shirt and have players identify it? I doubt it. The looks just work, giving the game a super unique appearance that's memorable, and brings up a bit of nostalgia in me for 8-bit era games.   I love creating in Minecraft, but my gratification is due, at least partially, to the fact that I have to earn everything. Survival Mode generates a random world with nothing to your name, forced to gather resources in order to construct food, shelter and tools. By the time I crafted and installed a wooden door in my first mud hut I felt a sense of ownership . Other games let you buy a home with the money you earn, but none of them really challenge you to forage for the materials and build it yourself. When I look at my home and see every piece of furniture and wall is exactly where I wanted it, I love it all the more or change it at my whim. From the moment my home was built, my mission was clear: tunnel into the earth in order to get whatever I needed to carve out a fortress in my little part of the world.   Creating items in Minecraft is one of the most important actions you do. The problem, though, is the necessary information isn't found in Minecraft. The first time I beat my way through some trees and gathered wood, I had no clue what to do with it. Thankfully, like many Minecraft players, I had a mentor who pointed me to the various online forums, communities and wikis. I have pages that I return to all the time, often tabbing out of the game itself when I can't remember exactly how to craft an item. For many this is just a rite of passage, but mostly it's an obtuse way to handle crafting. I'd love for the recipes to be integrated into the game somehow, even if I had to find them throughout the world. There's not much of a sense of accomplishment in reading a wiki and just following instructions verbatim.   Even after you find a good resource, it still takes a lot of effort to learn everything. The sheer amount of recipes and items you work with in the game is intimidating and time consuming to learn. Many games have poor documentation, but Minecraft has none at all, and what's available isn't easily digestible.   But Minecraft is still more than fun enough to warrant the learning curve. The addiction, though, really begins as you craft items and gain mastery over your surroundings. Suddenly night time, when monsters spawn and take over the unlit portions of the world, isn't as scary. I mean, it's always a bit scary, but having a sword in hand – even a simple, wood one – instills a sense of power. Like a caveman whittling their first spear or stoking their first fire, building simple tools and torches in Minecraft makes me feel safer, like I am the master of my fate because I have the power to create the items that can save me. Beyond safety, crafting creates a whole new set of goals in Minecraft. I crafted items as needed (tools and torches), but eventually I expanded my repertoire to include superfluous pieces. To finish my first stone keep I had to craft stairs and ladders; simply jumping up a simple series of platforms was unbecoming of the king of the land, after all. Crafting slowly became something I did less to survive, and more to complete the next big project I set out for myself. Creating panes of glass didn't really give me an edge in my world, for instance, but it did make the viewport of my scale Star Wars AT-AT look a lot more badass. Crafting even gets more complex if you want it to. You can create tools and buildings or elaborate self-powered rail systems, taking you from the stone age to the 20th century,, and making you feel like the fate of my world lies squarely in my hands. It's exhilarating, and instills a sense of power that I rarely feel in games.   After I secured a plot of land in my world, my intentions during a session with Minecraft changed. Each session became an adventure, wherein I challenged myself to go exploring for the next crucial component parts needed for the next recipe. These self-imposed quests are why I sometimes venture into the Nether, a hellish other world where monsters – who just so happen to drop precious materials – live. Other times I venture into dark caves, donning crafted armor and enchanted weapons so that I can tackle whatever enemies I come across. I don't know what exactly I'll find, or what terrors I'll face, but I do it all in the name of finding precious blocks – and the thrill of the experiencing the unknown.   That thrill, that experience of unplanned and unpredictable adventure, makes every session with Minecraft exhilarating. Sometimes I might end up spending the evening doing mundane activities like farming or hunting for food, but other nights I might end up stumbling upon a gigantic, randomly generated mine that's full of monsters and treasure. Because each world is procedurally created, I never know just what I'll stumble upon next. One day my character may be a simple builder, the next he's a dungeon conquering hero who slays horrors in the dark.   Of course, adventuring is always better with friends, and Minecraft's multiplayer is great fun if you can get it working. It isn't broken or a completely buggy mess, but requires a lot steps to get started compared to most games. If you want to start a game you'll need to download additional software, and go through all kinds of online tutorials to get it working. Players who just want to join a game have to know the server's I.P. address, since there is no server browser built into the game. Still, annoyances and tedium aside, if you have the option to play with others you definitely should; exploring, adventuring and building up epic structures is a lot more fun with friends. Besides, if you're going to spend hours of your life building gigantic monuments, you might as well have someone else to show them to. You can post them in online videos, but it just isn't the same as having your friend right next to you sharing in your accomplishment. Or, even better, having them log on after a period of inactivity to be stunned at the marvels you've built in their absence.   If you're not the type to play with others, and you don't want to earn all your materials, you can always jump into Creative Mode. In this world you're invincible, and have access to every item in the game. It's great if you want to, say, create a gigantic Wampa from Star Wars, but it doesn't give me the same sense of reward or accomplishment I get when playing Survival since I don't have to earn the blocks or fend for my life while doing so. Many blocks take considerable effort to acquire (some even make you journey into monster filled labyrinths), so when I build them in my Survival Mode it's a lot more impressive. Still, it's a fun distraction.     ",

Fast forward 2 years to last week and decided to give it another try... Dear god I wish i put more effort into the initial play. Over the past week I have put 73 hrs into this game. Terraria sucks your time like all games attempt to do and yet not many succeed.  This game is beautiful and frustrating and complex and difficult and creative and imaginative and endless. It is a little difficult to get into due to the lack of tutorial or anything of the like. That being said, once you put the hours in and understand the progression it is well worth the slow beginning.  For anyone who is on the fence... buy it. Buy it and put time into it and it will reward you with hours of fun. For anyone who isnt on the fence... buy it anyway and put the time into it. Terraria is incredible. Enough said right there.",

            "review_text": "Terraria is a game chalk-full of adventure, having followed Redigits previous work I was informed that he was working on a new title through his YouTube channel. I was immediately interested to see that he was making a newer, larger, better game, that was going to have its own steam release in 2011.   I made my Steam account for this game alone. I stuck with it for a long time and played again after every update came out, It quickly sold over 1.6 million copies. To my suprise Redigit gave the news that he was working on a larger update to surpass the legacy of the already classic game. After this there was supposed to be over 1000 items in the game if my memory is right. The update added several changes to the game including colored lighting and a new hard mode that would be activated after defeating a new boss in the game.   Some time after (a year or so I believe) another large update came which added even more content and further expanded upon the ideas that came out with the previous large update along with the news that Redigit would no longer be working on Terraria updates because he was having a child.   He raised his child for a long enough for him to be able to concentrate on work and gave his fans hype as he was working on a large update to finalize terraria with more features and mechanics than ever before. 1.3 was released long after he began it as his time to work with the game was now limited as he had a child to take care of.   Terraria is one of the best selling indie games of all time, at the time of this posting having over 12 million copies sold. The game is well worth the money as the developers work hard and really earned all the money they made, you can really tell how much effort they put into it after playing 50 hours or so. Now we all wait for Terraria other world.  If you have not yet purchased a copy of Terraria I highly reccommend it as it is very easy to get into and is quite simple if you consider yourself to be a noob its well worth the low asking price of $10 but if your tight on money the only thing that waiting for a sale of $7.50, $5, or $2.50 will hinder is the proggress of your creation.",

Though I will say that if you want to buy this game because it's like minecraft, well I'd suggest reading a bit further.   First off Minecraft and Terraria are two completly different games.  Of course they share a crafting system, and a randomly genrated world kind of nature, but how they play and how they are paced are completly different.  Terraria is a 2D game, that is more foucos on dangerous exploring, loot drops, and boss fighting, if not in your 'home base' you will be almost always fighting some form of enemy, day or night. While Minecraft has more 'space' and biomes, it doesn't have the same density as Terraria, and Terraria also benifites from it's slightly planed out spaces.  Minecraft is about building, shaping, and creating structures and places, where terraria is more about adventureing, dungenireering, and the mastery of the land itself. In Terraria your fight is truly againest the world, and you have to scrap out a home fast, dig deep, craft and get stronger or you will die over and over and over again. This is a game more focoused on survial, than just building, though you can do both at the same time.  For new players I'd suggest either going to the wiki first or talking to the in game NPC guide for help, and maybe even doing the turtorl first just incase. First night is hard, but in all honesty the nights to come will be harder.",

While people often compare it to Minecraft, it's more 'Metroidvania', meaning there's emphasis on exploring, backtracking, and bossfighting. Unlike Metroid/Castlevania, you craft your own gear, summon the bosses when you're ready, for the most part, and build your own town in a randomly generated world, which is what draws the comparison to Minecraft.   The only gripes I have with this game are small. Something Minecraft did right was the bed 'mechanic'. You could sleep at night to fast forward to daytime, assuming there were no enemies nearby. Here, beds only serve to set a respawn point. You must wait the full 10 minutes or so 'till daybreak. Considering some events only happen at random nights, it's frustrating having to wait day after day to see it will happen. Another thing is console commands. Some may call it cheating, but for those of us who like experimenting with items or want to relax and build a town, collecting rare materials, making farms, hunting bosses, and so on can be very time consuming. While there are ways to add items to your character, these can be risky. And if there is a legitimate way to do it, I apologize for not having found it.   Overall a great game. The massive updates show just how much love the devs have for it, and for 10 bucks, it's more than worth the nit-picks.",

Graphics: 10/10 Performance: 7/10 (minor crashes from time to time happen, but there is a cloud function which saves progress) Gameplay: 10/10 Community: 10/10 Replayability: Infinite (or as long as you can sit in front of a computer) Sound: 10/10  Final veredict: 9/10",

            "review_text": "This game is an extremely solid choice if you want to get lost in it for a couple days. For those who don't know, this is a 2D, sandbox~based, exploration game. Akin to classic NES - SNES titles mixed in with modern procedurally generated content.  -The combat relies on stat based matchups and positioning, which can make it fun to play against other players, but the AI is quite dumb. That being said, while the AI may lack strategy behind it, they ramp it up with damage, and hordes of enemies to ward off, making it satisfying when you overcome what's thrown at you.  -Item progression is tied directly to combat. The main game revolves around building up your character to be ready for the next fight, and the next tier of items. Honestly, I would have liked it if there wasn't a (literal) wall between you and unlocking the rest of the game. Add to that a frustrating lack of diverging paths to the destination, and it ruins the experience. Luckily, the payoff for completing tasks is almost always rewarding. There is tons of content hidden in this, but it takes a LOT of legwork to get to.  -Exploration takes you from field, to cave, to ice, to jungle, to desert, to hell, and to the sky. While the world itself isn't infinite, there is plenty of stuff in it so there's something new to see. Much of the world is divided by different boss encounters and what kinds of items you have. Certain items deal with enemies from a certain place better than those from another. It's a good balance, but it can be quite evident where the lines sit for where you need to go next.  -The inventory is VERY nice. Simple crafting, and equips make it one of the most well designed things in the game. As with most sandbox games, inventory clutter is an issue, but easily fixed thanks to the trash can slot. Being vain, I would have liked if you had the option to hide armor sets like you could with accessories. It got to be a pain sometimes when I wanted my character (Wii Fit Trainer) to be able to show her hair, or her starter clothes. I am not a fan of how they dealt with hair in this either. All characters with long hair would have their hair invisible when they're wearing a helmet, and then some of the hats are unwearable because the hair you're using just doesn't match it. There are many options to customize though. That's what makes the system great.  Overall, without jumping into spoilers, it is a very good game. I would recommend going to the wiki if you're stuck, but otherwise try to stay clear of it. It is extremely fun to descover new things in this game. Knowing all the end game stuff can ruin your perception of the cool stuff you may get now, and that's no fun.  Would I recommend it? Yes. If you're just a fan of 2D combat, this is a great buy. If you love exploration, then this is your package. It is honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time, despite my nitpicks. I'm sure in later updates they could get fixed.",

Notably with chests, you can name them, and with one click you can quick-stack all extras of items that you have in your inventory, directly into the chests. This makes a HUGE difference as there are well over a thousand items and you used to have to micro-manage it all.  Difficulty is fairly well balanced into the late game, and there's a variety of bosses and other challenges. Although,  Expert mode bosses in multiplayer  (specifically) are a bit insane. Not impossible, but it feels very grindy to ensure your team's survival.  The 'system requirements' on the store page are NOT accurate as of this writing. With the 1.3 update, things can get very tense with lots of objects and collisions on screen, and it doesn't feel very optimized when that happens. One example was during the Pumpkin-Moon event, performance got so bad that I was dying as soon as I spawned, while the screen was practically frozen. I don't have a high-end machine but performance got a lot worse further into the hardmode events and boss fights.  If you want to just have fun outside of the natural adventure mode, there are downloadable worlds that have all the items available. Just Google/YouTube for them.  As of the 1.3 update, a very polished 2D adventure/crafting game that excels with multiplayer and definitely worth the price.",

The brand new 1.3 update has changed the way I play a lot. I may not have a lot of hours on this game but I have done a lot on my friends computers and steam accounts. The only thing I am confused about is that the developers stated that 1.3 will be avaliable to mac and linux users and I have not yet been able to download it and play it. So re-logic when is it that mac support will be available? Anyway the game has thousands of items as the new update I believe has clocked the item count to around 3,000 without including the inchantment thingamajigis (godly, legendary, weak). The game is really well planned out and the new 1.3 update is stable from the amount I have played so far. Thanks re-logic for a great game!",

From exploring underground caverns, to evil dungeons, to the very depths of hell (and walls of bacon), this game never fails to keep you on your toes and begging for more!   Pros: Wonderful progression system based around armor (and later on what type of character you prefer playing. Warrior, Mage, or Archer). An extensive list of different accessories, weapons, and armor that will make any completionist want a manequin of every set in the game. Action packed with over a dozen different bosses and three times that for different monsters. Creative reign over the world's difficulty. On softcore, You drop a portion of your money on death. Mediumcore, You drop everything on death. Hardcore, You die for good. . . but you get to float around your world as a ghost. Now has seasonal 'events' which will change your world around a bit in terms of dropped items, and adds hard mode events as well! The game will always keep you on your toes, and is loads of fun with friends as well as solo.  Cons: While the game keeps you on your toes, it's also hard! It's recommended to play Softcore until you really get the hang of it. NOTE: Some people might like/dislike hard games so this isn't a major con. Will keep new players on the wiki quite a lot. While the game has a guide built in for crafting, he doesn't help too much in terms of direction and how certain mechanics work and where to go. Similarly on how the guide doesn't give much direction, much of someone's errors in the game will be unavoidable just because you won't know how something worked in the first place. I can't tell you how many times I died just running straight into the dungeon at first before 'certain things' were achieved. No built in creative mode for the more buildy type peoples (like me).  ---  Overall, it's a wonderful game. Not to mention the amount of multiplayer pvp game modes and goof offs you could make are endless with how many different weapons &amp; armor (and costumes) there are in the game. If you are into getting ripped apart by derplings, slaying harpies &amp; wyverns with your laser rifle, or just building amazing works of 2D art (as people have), Terraria is for you!",

You can be all four a once, there is just different sets of armor to boost a certain class, so if you want to be summoner focused then get spooky armor or stardust. If ranged, shroomite or vortex etc. There are lots of bosses, and mini-bosses. And by mini-bosses i mean unique and powerful enemies that arent your run-of-the mill zombie,(or in Hardmode,wraith/posessed armor),i.e Wyverns,Medusa etc etc etc. This game (since 1.3) has great multiplayer that is seamless, just go to your friends profile and hit join game, while they're in a multiplayer server thingy. The game when released had tons of content, but every big update 1.1/1.2/1.3 ++++ adds tons of content. It also now has difficulty levels, Normal/Expert, expert buffs bosses, adds new unique 'Expert' items that are dropped from the bosses, i.e shield of cthulu, worm scarf etc etc. Terraria has lots of different ores that are randomly chosen, so you either have iron or lead, cobalt or palladium or mythril or orichalcum etc etc. There are a few biomes like Purity which is basically the normal foresty thing, then snow, crimson, corruption, jungle, desert, and sea, all with (besides purity) corruption/crimson counterparts.

Go down to hell, summon wall of flesh. 'WHAT THE FU-dead.' Gather up all my gear, fight him, hardmode unlocked. 'what mode? hey a unicorn!-dead'  Fast forward again, just picked it back up after... 2ish years? I think...?  ...Fell in love with it all over again. I tend to be a fighter in games and this game delivers on what I enjoy, combat, in a style YOU prefer, and can switch to any type you want on the fly. Swords, bows, guns, yoyos, staffs, boomerangs, miniuons, cannons... so many different things to use!  and NPC's can fight back!? THEY CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES NOW!?!?! Sound the holy chorus! they can fight back a goblin invasion! Seriously everything about the game has just... roof? Do you see a roof? No? it got BLOWN THE **** OFF BY THIS GAME. Castle, huts, cities, characters, painting, accesories, designing, modding, bosses, monsters, dungeons, randomly generated worlds. There is so... so much content.  And now... Expert mode... yes, all the yes. If you thought, you had mastered Terraria, could dominate it's bosses without breaking a sweat and could no longer die? Try this on for size, and cry all over again. Bosses that you could beat with a simple back hand will now pummel you mercilessly. I got killed by an expert mode skeletron while using post-golem equips (hardmode against normal mode boss) on expert mode, with a friend. and friends don't make bosses easier anymore, oh no. The more players in your world, the more health that boss has. Ever see the eye of cthulu with nearly 10k health? When normally he bairly has over 2k? That's when 4 people are on. FOUR PEOPLE. Imagine a whole community!  What can I say, my love for this game has sparked, and now that multiplayer is supported Via steam allowing ME to finally host with my friends, without needing any fancy program to allow me to hold a server on host, the game has more then lit the candle, it god darn lit up my whole castle with ice torches of awesomeness.

And I always find myself coming back to it. Is it worth the 10? I believe so. And it's a steal at sale prices! Oh one thing I almost overlooked that this game kicks Minecraft and Starbound to the curb IMO. Setting up a server for Multiplayer IS SUPER EASY, in compairison to Minecraft and Starbound.

Wasn't as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his.   Our first night wasn't bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.  The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn't too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.  So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no.   I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, 'Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!'   -pls excuse bad inggris.",

            "review_text": "So here's a legit full review.  This game has had STABLE updates(more or less) from day one. and my god, it has come a long frikin way. every update keeps me comin back to it everytime with something new to discover each time. As you have probably noticed i have ♥♥♥♥♥ load of hours logged in this game. To make matters better it now has Steam integrated multiplayer, which for the longest time it didnt have, and made playing with just one or two friends and chore to set up. Now with steam integrated multiplayer its easy as hell!  Lets discuss gameplay and mechanics. At first glance it gives you the impression its just a minecraft clone, but once you actually get into it its actually more of an action platformer with crafting and building mechanics. It also does a good job of never getting boring on you cause there is always something to do in the game, such as bosses, dungeons, nightly events, seasonal events and a plethora of kickass weapons, i couldnt list them all if i wanted to. it controls just how you expect although there isnt any gamepad controls, it doesnt really need it nor would it feel comfortable. The combat is also surprisingly well done, save for pvp of course, and makes boss fights mega intense. all in all, just a fun game to play. Now for level design. The world you generate usually has five or seven biomes each with their underground variants for the first part of the game. Each biome has significant materials, ores, items, enemies, and bosses to accompany them for variety. after you get through the first part (post wall of flesh) you will see more biomes added, new enemies, treasures, new events ,and even more ores to mine. Everything thing gets increased in its own right.  Final Verdict: This game is a must own, if you are the kind of person with a creative side, who likes survival games like minecraft. i can easily give this game a 10/10. true its not a game for everyone, but it is a game you should at least try. and for that price? hell yeah you should buy it. like i've said, there is always something to do.",

Pros: *Can build beautiful things, even with slopes/half-slabs. *It's enjoyable/fun. *It has a lot of different mobs and items, some rare. *Hilariously sad things can happen if you don't pay attention to where you're going. *Plenty of caves to explore. *No durability on items! *'Background' animals that you can (sort of) interact with...... *Doesn't take long to download. *The music is pretty cool. *Quite a few bosses (though more couldn't hurt...). *The jokes and puns hidden in the game. *The graphics/art are easy to look at.  Cons: *Not possible (to my knowledge) to zoom in ingame. *Can't really tell what your character looks like, as the creation screen (and everything else ingame) is tiny. *Sometimes there are more pools than islands... *Tiny worms who like to stalk you for 5 hours and only attack you when you're busy doing other things. *Panic attacks from /the quack/....  I do think that this game is definitely worth getting if you enjoy exploring and building things. I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it, especially after all the updates it's had. Hopefully, there will be many more updates.  8/10",

You may need to check the Terraria wiki for stuff but there is plenty you can do in the game and aiming to get the achievements is a long but very fun journey.  I don't have any problems with this game with the exception of getting started which can be slow but that is not a huge issue as you are getting used to the game and the world you have created. (Besides if you find it a pain everytime you start a world then just give items to the character from a different world.)",

First off it has tons of useful (especially after 1.3) NPCs, a lot of weapons, tools, materials, armor, blocks and BOSSES! I mean this thing is so big that if you could have infinite worlds you could play for your whole life. But it only has small, medium and large worlds but that doesn't mean it's bad. Also you can have characters that can go in all of your single-player worlds and/or multiplayer servers (either with friends via Steam (YASSSS, FINALLY!) or IP adress), with 3 difficulty levels (softcore, mediumcore and hardcore) and 4 world types (normal, expert, with corruption(purple)/crimson(red). It doesn't even need mods, it has a huge pile of end-game content and tons of community made challenges (like speedruns, or special goals (kinda like the pokemon nuzlocke challenge).  In conclusion it's a fun, awesome and (not really)  relaxing  adventure.",

            "review_text": "When you first start Terraria, one thinks 'Oh. This is literally Minecraft, minus a dimension.' and in the beginning, that's pretty much what it is. You scavenge for tools, armor, and weapons in the topsoil, and explore the area around you. Before long, though, nighttime will roll around, and those words spring up on the bottom lefthand corner: 'You feel an evil presence watching you...'.  Before too terribly long, you'll encounter your first boss fight with the Eye of Cthulu, which will start a trend of several intense boss fights, pressing you to go deeper into the world to find bigger and better things to fight. The boss fights are definitely a huge focus of the game, going through the Crimson (or the Corruption, depending on which one spawns in your world) and fighting the Brain of Cthulu, or mining straight to Hell and fighting the Wall of Flesh, but these are just the beginning.  One large perk of this game OVER Minecraft is the fact that your character and your world are completely seperate, meaning that your character can not only bring their armor and equipment to another world, your inventory also carries over, meaning you can bring building materials or items to trade with other players, should the need arise.   If there's anything bad to say about the game, it's the fact that there isn't a Creative mode, and there's really not that much to do post game, save for a few events such as the Frost Moon, and the new Moon Lord content. The good thing is that it takes about 20+ hours of gameplay to run out of bosses, but the game isn't over then. Oh no, the game is FAR from over, as there are hundreds of items to collect, hundreds of equipments to craft, and hundreds of places to discover and destroy. Not to mention that with the additions of the Steam achievements, there're more goals to reach than ever before.  All in all, Terraria is a game to get lost in. Those who don't like grinding for equipment might not enjoy it, but those of us who enjoy exploring a new world and losing hours upon hours of our lives to discovery will find a treasure trove of delight that we haven't experienced since Lego Island and the Minecraft beta.",

            "review_text": "I originally played Terraria when it was first released. I played for about 100 hours back then, collecting most stuff and defeated all the bosses there were at that point. In the meantime this game had (as far as I understand) 2 major updates with small-medium ones in between. The release of 1.3 made me curious and I already invested another 100+ hours in this game since 1.5 weeks.  This game is truly incredible. It merges the snes era with modern elements which create awesome, hilarious and stunning possibilities. The 2D sidescrolling is only amplifying the nostalgic feeling of games like Castlevania, Mario, Mighty Max etc. The combat is nice and solid. Currently there are 4 ''classes'' available you can work towards: The Summoner, Sorcerer, Ranger and Warrior. You simply focus on the pieces of gear and weapon to focus on a class. You might as well make a hybrid character and mix it up a little up to your taste.  Crafting is deep. Like ''Adele rolling in the deep'' deep. There are so incredibly many items which brings me to the one and only complaint: It are simply TOO many items. This causes your inventory to fill up rather quickly (auto loot is always on) and you either have to take a trip back to your base or start deleting useless items every 15 minutes or so. The only way to get this in order is to create chests, label said chests and start sorting. Once you have quite a collection of items you can simply click autostack items you already have in the chests, Before you arrive at that point it's quite the time investment to sort all important items.  The adventuring is just magnificent. 15 big bosses and various small bosses and a plethora of mobs await you. There are events like a Pirate invation, Goblin invation, Halloween event, slime event etc. which all cause unique mobs and bosses to spawn. Deal with them by smashing them, shooting them, burning them or create traps to lure them in and let your crafty traps do all the work for you. There is so much variety in this game, it's just amazing.  The friendly colours and looks when you stumble upon this game are deceiving. The game can become pretty hard and really extreme on Expert Mode. There is plenty of challenge to be had. This game is worth it.",

Currently I am just review the multiplayer because i have never have gone all the way to end game alone.  + You cant put this game down because you always want to be ahead of your friends, an example is the whole game is a race for the next tier of items and ever time you get a new weapon or set of armor you are overwhelmed with accomplishment.  + I cant get enough of how much content is in this game, just look at my hours you can spend hours using an inventory editor and just see what ever item in the game does or fighing as many bosses as once. It takes a good 75 hours to beat the moon lord for me and every update they manage to squeze in a extra 20 hours of time to end game, I love it.  + There are Three main types of combat and later armor melee, range summoner and magic. Melee has the most defence but has a limited range unless you are using end game items. Range has a high dps and end game armor makes you have a lower chance to be spotted. Summoner has medicore defence but gives you many more minoins to do the owrk for you. Magic sets usually the least defence but the highest dps and unlike melee or magic you use mana as ammo.   + The style very colorful and the music fits the boime or event nicely.  + Building is simple but you still have a massive range of well anything you want to make. I spend more time making basses and boss areas than anyting else in the whole game.  - I have had many issues with the steam integration so I would recomend just port forwarding the game and then hosting the server.  - Many public servers are flooded with people who spawned in the best items in the game only to go around massacring the whole server.  After reading this review I hope you get the idea. Get, This, Game.  ",

Made the mistake of creating the profile, but not adding it to the 'active' box on my router. But once I did it worked like a charm. I ended up setting up the dedicated server on my desktop PC so my whole family can play from their laptops together. plus my brother is an over-the-road trucker so he logs in when he has a hotspot to connect to.

Along with many NPCs with their own traits and items they wish to sell to you. Tons of bosses, and weapons to fight them with. Events where you with be attacked by Pirates, Goblins, Halloween creatures, Christmas creatures, Full Moon events, Blood Moons, and other strange things. Character Creation: There ae many hairstyles, and many colors you can choost from, and many ways to make your character. Also, if your not happy with the hairstyles, make a game, find the Hair Stylist NPC, and ta-da, you have another huge selection of hair styles to try! There are also costume drops around halloween, Clothier NPC, and a Wandering NPC(who may have some vanity stuff). Hundreds, no, millions of weapons to craft, find, and slay monsters with. Many bosses to fight, Skeltron, The Eye, The Brain, The Devourer, The Wall of Flesh, Plantera, Golem, Duke Fisheron, The Twins, The Destroyer, Skeltron Prime(and the Optional 'boss' that one hit kills: Dungeon Guardian). The only limit to building is your imagination. Three world sizes of exploration(small, medium, large). Terraria also, doesn't just stop, once you've got the best weapons, or beat all the bosses. Like stated before, the only limit is your imagination. And if your bored of playing alone, play with friends, or find a community server. Play Capture the Gem, or Team DeathMatch, Every Man for Themselves, etc. I highly recommend Terraria for everyone. ",

It's especially fun to pick up with friends. It appeals more to the explorer than the crafter, however. There's always something to go out and search for or obtain in the game, and I love that feeling. Although you can build awesome, detailed structures in Terraria, it's fairly limited as it's a sidescroller. In the end, your main objectives are to explore and combat against the various bosses in the generated world.   Overall, it's a great game, especially with friends.",

I know it's a platform game, but once you overcome the fact you're playing a 2D Sega looking game, you soon realise it's incredibly addictive and detailed within it's own right. There are tons of weapons, resources, NPCs and secrets to explore. Much like Minecraft, you can let your creativity flow and build using a vast array of blocks you collect.

Though hundreds of items and plenty of mechanics can become confusing, Terraria contains a wonderful tutorial that Don't Starve had. Not hand-holding, not dropping textbooks onto you, and yet requiring trips to the Wiki to find another item you say 'Woah! I need that ASAP!' to. But once you obtain all the items to make a wonderful loadout and the beautiful 2 story home, things can become boring. This dry period only lasts for moments, as Terraria has something Minecraft can never re-create. Things become boring, and you have a wonderful idea: GO TO THE RIGHT. To your left is a jet blue ocean, illuminating with the neon jellyfish and the sun's reflection. You make the bold decision to venture your way past the high busy trees you have seen out your window. You grapple and wall-climb your way across flat flowery fields, dark dingy caves, and sprawling snowy mountains. The adventure never ends, neither does the replay value. In the strange case where exploring and having fun aren't your things, the updates constantly released by the developers add even more reasons to buy Terraria. Minecraft fans may still remain unamused. To them I say, Terraria is Minecraft. Terraria is Minecraft with a few mods and supportive developers (Look back to Notch selling Mojang to Microsoft). I have left many points out because my fingers are hurting from typing this ♥♥♥♥♥y a$$-kissing review, but so be it. I have invested hundreds of hours into Terraria. I hope you, possible customer, will do the same. Looking back, Terraria is 3 words: 2D Magical Minecraft.",

When you start the game you are placed in a world with some trees and maybe some water. There will also be an npc which will give you some tips on what to do. The combat system is very simple from what I've seen just a point and click but don't take my word for it. At night is when things get really hostile.

I don't want to spoil too much of the gameplay but I'll give you all the pros and cons   PROS +very in depth crafting system with no recipes, no memory required +neat graphics +good exploration mechanics +very tough if you like that kind of thing but there are options for people who don't +lots of different world sizes  CONS -simple fighting mechanics? -submenus are confusing at times -not newb friendly (it's still easy to get into though) -character customization is slightly limited",

Even games in completely different genres could learn a lot from Terraria, because it does everything right - things not just applicable to sandbox or crafing games, but all games in general.  For example,   1) Terraria has the perfect depth &amp; pace of progression. Are you tired of playing games where your charater barely changes from the start of the game to the end of the game, or where equipment advancement is just an afterthought? Have no fear! Terraria has many tiers of equipment; each of which is generally necessary to get the next tier. However, advancing &amp; acquiring new gear is certainly no boring grind-fest. There is so much variety in how to acquire ingredients &amp; equipment, the progression is exciting, rewarding, and purposeful.  2) Everything in the game can be obtained in single-player. So although it might be more fun to play with others &amp; showboat your awesomeness, multiplayer is not required to achieve said awesomeness, which is is a real plus to a hermit player such as myself. You can eventually get the Best-in-Slot equipment for your character, and it feels very rewarding to do so, satisfying those with completionist compulsions.  Seriously, if more games could just practice the two things mentioned above, I would be a very happy gamer",

There is so much to see in a world, you probably won't even get to it all.  Another main con is probably the multiplayer Hamachi thing.

I have had this in my library forever but I could never get past the first 30 minutes of game play so It just sat collecting dust. I picked it up this past weekend and had a blast playing ALL weekend with my SO. Don't buy this expecting minecraft the games are really only comparable in their graphics style. This is a combat driven game where as minecraft is more creative driven. Mining and Crafting are a means to create what you want to build in minecraft where mining and crafting are a means to fight bosses in Terraria.",

But to me, terraria is the better game between the two because of how it handles the combat and the amount of things there are to do in the game. In minecraft, you have 6 ores. But in terraria, you have over twenty. And yes, i know the old saying. Quality over quantity. but terraria passes in the quality of its ores too. Minecraft armor looks the same aside from its color. But in terraria, each armor and wepon has its own style for each brand of ore. Not to mention, in terraria there is so much more to do then minecraft. Theres a dungion with a ton of new mobs and items, random events with awesome loot, tons of bosses and so much more. While minecraft has alot to offer, it just pales in compareason to terraria. To me, the only thing minecraft has going for it is the fact that its 3-D. I always believed that if terraria came out first and was marketed a bit better, then it would have the reputation that minecraft has. If you want a survival game that is more combat and exploration based, you play terraria. if you want a survival game that is more building based, you play minecraft. I dont know about you, but i'd pick terraria over minecraft anyday.",

You play as a little pixel man (or woman) who chops down trees, mines, makes armor, AND KILLS THE HUNDREDS OF DEMONS OF HELL, COLLECTING EXPLOSIVE MAGICAL DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS TO MAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD BEND TO YOUR WILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the best parts of this game is that you can play as different classes. You don't get to choose a class in the make a character screen, but there are so many different weapon types and armors to support it that you can really make your own character, instead of everyone using the same gear like in Minecrap.   Using an entire set of the same armor gives you a boost, whether it be health regeneration, defense, or mana points. Your gigantic arsenal of weapons and armor goes to good use, with 14 different bosses to fight, all with unique battles and different loot for you to use. There are also over 100 enemies, which piles on to that amount. Now for specifics.  -Graphics 8/10 You'd expect something lower, but this is the perfect game to have these graphics. With the weapons and bosses... it just works.  -Sound 9/10 Not only does this game have supreme sound effects, but it has fitting music for wherever you are playing too. Music changes depending on time of day, depth, biome or boss battles.  -Price 10/10 $9.99 For all of this? Hell yes! It may seem like another cheap little indie game that you'll waste your money on... but you'd be wrong. I wouldn't be surprised if they got away with selling it for 30 bucks!  -Gameplay 9/10 Amazing gameplay, with loads of ways to play and items to collect. The combat is great too, with accessories and healing items playing a large role. The only problem is that mining takes a long time, but that's a small price to pay.  -Overall 10/10 Outstanding game.

While many people describe Terraria as '2-dimensional Minecraft' it is far more in-depththan that. There is more of an adventure feel to it. Honestly, I like that. It does not please everybody with it's complexity, though. For a simpler game with a similar feel, I recommend Minecraft, another game, but more sanbox-esque. Terraria involves things like bosses, dungeons, and many countless species and subspecies of monsters. This game doesn't have a Pokedex, either, so you can't look up critters in your handbook. The NPCs are fairly simple, meaning they sell, heal, or help, in essence. The way the game plays is fairly exciting, but can be daunting at first. Keep in mind I haven't had quite an entire weeks-worth of of in-game playing. It is very interesting, but I find it a bit harder to mod than Minecraft, and I have trouble without mods. It is very creatively designed, and I have noticed that it has many more places than the standard world, including hell, the skyworld, and more. This combined with it's variety of biomes encourages exploration and discovery. I have fallen in love with this game and would give it a solid 8.5/10 as it is very enjoyable, but daunting to newer players and difficult to mod.",

            "review_text": "Terraria is a 2D adventure sandbox game. There are so many things to do in Terraria, like exploring the underground, fight enemies in the dungeon, fishing, etc. There are so many items in Terraria, and you can craft so many things, like furniture, weapons, armor, potions, etc. You can build your house with almost anything. There are many weapons in the game, not just swords and bows. There are guns, rocket launchers, boomerangs, yo-yos, magical staffs, spell books, lasers and more. If you get the hang of it and would like some challenge, Terraria offers an Expert mode where the bosses will have more HP and do more damage.  I bought Terraria a year ago, I haven't played it much until now. I used to think it was boring, but I later found out that Terraria is an awesome game. The bosses in Terraria are quite challenging, but when you have the proper equipment, it will be easy to defeat them. You can play alone or play with friends in Terraria. Since the new update you can play with your Steam friends very easily. I recommend playing Terraria with a friend because fighting bosses will be a lot easier. The achievements in Terraria are fairly easy to complete. The soundtrack for Terraria is very nice. The Steam Cloud feature is very neat as I wouldn't be worried to lose my progress.  There are events that will happen randomly in Terraria where many monsters will try to attack you in your base which is very annoying most of the time. The corruption/crimson and hallow biomes are really annoying. I can't build peacefuly without worrying my world to be ruined by them, because those biomes will spread throughout the world and will spawn harder mobs too.  Even though the graphics look outdated, the gameplay is truly amazing and will give you hours of fun. I strongly suggest playing Terraria with friends as playing alone will quite difficult. I really recommend this game.",

Well Minecraft may have the 3D that people like these days Terraria has a vast amount of content. Getting all the items may take a few months/years.You really need a mindset for this one. But if I had one thing to complain about it would propably be that there isn't much to do after beatting the game. I know this is the final update and all, but for all the Terraria go'ers out there, If there were a tournament like many RPG's of some sort I think I could play this a lot more.  chow!- Deathcrafter",

Gameplay wise, it is unlike most I have played. Everything, from progression to mechanics, music and house building, is made with all things in mind. The difficulty curve is great, and boss fights and events keep you on the edge of you seat!  In all, terraria is a must have for anyone who likes retro games, action games, adventure games, sandboxes, or anyone not mentioned who could give the the retro graphics a chance (I personaly like the graphics).

The atmosphere is amazing, there's so much creativity and items that you can barely keep track of it all, and there's countless hours of fun to be had playing Terraria.   The gameplay is simple and leaves you wanting the next best set of gear and possibly that rare item you find once in a very great while. I have this game on the PC (Obviously) and the Xbox 360. The combined total of playtime would have to average out to at LEAST 500 or more hours. I absolutely love this game, there's nothing that's really wrong with it.   So in short here's the pro's of buying this game: +Amazing Gameplay +Thousands of items to find/craft +Hundreds of Enemies to fight +Over 10 unique bosses to conquer +Finding items and exploring feels... right.  +Outstanding Soundtrack +$10! Just 10, really. For over 200 hours I think everyone can spare $10.  Now the Con's: -Multiplayer can be laggy at times. -New players aren't taught much. (Is that such a bad thing that we have to figure stuff out for ourselves?)  That's really all there is to it. I've read some of the comments in the negative review section about people saying it's too hard or falling into caves is tedious and unfair, but they didn't even give it a chance. I saw so many reviews with BARELY any hours on the game, I saw two that had 0.5 hours on their playtime. Some people just don't know a good game if it came and slapped them in the face.  I really can't explain the gameplay in much detail, you really just have to experience this for yourself and see how you like it. Give it a chance and you'll see why over 12 million copies were sold of this game.   So if you haven't bought this game yet, stop reading this review and go get it already! What are you waiting for?

I played this game absolutely solo, and my own internal dialog of 'oh yeah, cthulu eye boss? you want to take me on in my own base? let's do this,' was enough story to accompany the crafting, rpg/gear collecting, and map exploration.  building and customizing your base to the aesthetic you desire is fun. building an 'arena' or 'area to fight monsters spawned during events' is also enjoyable. If you find a trap in a dungeon, you can mine it, pick it up, and place it in your arena, wire it to a timer, or a switch, or a pressure plate.   again. I enjoyed the hell out of this game. so many hours of fun for such a low cost (compared to say, dragon age 3).  edit: I made immense use of the gamepedia terraria wiki site. find an item? look it up, see what's up.

My overall rating of this game is a 8.5/10 Even though it has so many hours of gameplay and is nostagic of old 2d Side Scrollers it has alot of grinding to get items fo anykind like trying to get the final armour is hard and calls for alot of grinding of the final boss (Which is Especially hard to fight on your own) &lt;----------- Don't Recomment That Unless you are incredibly op or have a really flawless stratigy (Sorry For any Spelling Errors)",

Smooth controls and graphics, if you read: 'Meh, sh*tty Minecraft copy, this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.' &lt;THIS IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. There are many stuff that differs Terraria from Minecraft. Terraria is realistic, Minecraft is crap, man, you do a sword without hilt, and THROW A ORE INTO A OVEN AND TA-DA! A INGOT. Do Minecraft seems realistic to you? NO. Also, many kids play MC, so this makes tha game poor from decent public.  COMPARATION:ITEMS  Terraria: A f*cking thousand items without counting blocks.  MC: Somewhat 256 items, counting even debug stuff.  GAMEPLAY:  Terraria: Smooth and easy controls, more hotkeys, and stuff.  MC: Even better controls, many, MANY hotkeys, stuff taht help on a 3D world.  GRAPHICS:   Terraria: Heh, pixely graphics, simple stuff, simple but awesome. Detailed blocks, like dirt connecting with stone, colored and happy stuff on the screen, realistic, and AWESOME.  Minecraft: Simpler graphics, but still cool, but in my single opinion, its moody and sad, small color variation, the game's ores are stone with small rocks.  CONTENT:  Terraria: Many ores, tools, weapons, and even troll stuff, more bosses, enemies, and events, THATS why i have a thousand hours of playing this awesome game.  Minecraft: Simple stuff, many decorative blocks, but the thing i most like,on MC is the...  MODS, TEXTURES AND PLUGINS:  Terraria: Freaking hard to put extra stuff on Terraria, they dont even support mods, thats the biggest con on Terraria. Obviously, when you have did almost anything on the game, it gets boring, the solution: DOWNLOAD MODS! But, you cant do this THAT easy with Terraria.  Minecraft: While Terraria SUCKS at this, Minecraft relies, it gets boring sometime, then someone throw on your Skype: BAM! A wild minecraft mod appeared on your message! Minecraft totally supports mod and stuff like this, there is even servers based on modpacks, Technic Launcher is a totally safe launcher that permits you to download modpacks, i dont play MC vanilla by some years, i dont even know what to do anymore.  WORLD:  Terraria: A choice of small, medium and large, many biomes, diferrently from MC, that have only some biomes, Terraria have many, Underground Snow, Sky, Hell, and something like this, but the limitation of world is the crappy part, there should be an infinite option, but this would be very heavy for the RAM, at least a extra large, but no.  MC: The world is basically infinite, nothing more to say, the only thing that it lets me wishing its the lack of biomes,for rest, all ok.   Terraria: 19,5 \\ 20 MC: 16 \\ 20",

DIE fight all the bosses before hard mode mine fight wall of flesh die once then try again complete the battle mine for 3 hours try the next boss get rekt like heck mine for 3 more hours see a uicorn die by a unicorn build and get all the villagers get ultimatly rekt by the pirate/alians beat the first mechanical boss mine for 5 hours fight the others then think your good for more bosses... but your not after about 20 more hours you invite like 3 more friends get the best armor in the game  fight the moon lord beat him with a 5 vs. 1 status retry in expert mode mining takes twice as long finish game and start again.  ________________________________________________________________________________  I say 10/10 for this game, but seriously if you want a good gme for console/PC get Terraria.

Terraria is a sandbox game that has so many items in it! If you thought Minecraft has a lot of items, you've never played Terraria! The game has a lot of different things, and the things are divided into two parts. about 1/3 of them are in pre-hardmode, the rest of them are in hardmode. The game can have different ending objectives based on what the character chooses to do. Some goals are to defeat Waffles (Long story, i'll explain later in the text) and some want to defeat some big end game boss called the moon lord or gollum or something. Some players could care less about the zombies, cursed armor and the bride knocking at their door during a blood moon, they are just trying to figure out how to make a disco ball! The way you play the game varies on what you choose to do! Terarria presents something for everyone! Enjoy the blood and slaughter in GTA? You can choose to try to defeat Waffles! Enjoy building things like in Minecraft? You can try to build giant mansions fit for the best players or you can try to build a sandcastle! Enjoy inventing things and experimenting like in scrap mechanic? You can try to create a trap for monsters, or a challenging obstacle course, or a house that can fit all of the NPC's in one place? The game has something for everyone and i doubt that there isn't something for you!   EXPLINATION TO WAFFLES!!  The boss that sends you to hardmode is the wall of flesh.  Wall of Flesh abbreviated is WOF. Try to say WOF. What did it sound like? (Wawlf) Was does that sound like?

But I don't really want to compare the two since the games really don't have much in common. This game focuses more on items and boss fights rather than crafting and buiding. However there are LOADS off different tiles you can use to build with and lots of different motifs and styles you can build your town with. I HIGHLY recomend you pick this game up. It has hours upon hours of content, awesome weapons, interesting items, unique NPCs, and challenging boss fights. 10 bucks is more than a good deal for such a great game.",

No longer do i feel a great satisfaction after obtaining a more powerful weapon or a faster pickaxe like in days of old. My reasoning is this, you always seem to be acquiring new items to your load out which is great dont get me wrong but it allows you to simply leave out large chunks of the game because there are other ways to do it, easier more fun ways.   Back in the day i used to love the jungle, the mobs, loot and genral feel. The jungle armour seemed like such a rare and great thing to have. It took my ages to get it and it was worth the weight. Now they have effectively knocked down item crafting costs to make the progression faster since there was a few patches after hardmode was added where it took absolutely ages for armour and weapons that would be absolite in 5 minutes. Like any game there is a great sense of achievement getting to the next armour and weapon tier. It is a great feeling but not as great. There's a phrase more is better but i cant help but think they went to far in some aspects.   It might just be me feeling this way but i have seen terraria evolve through many patches each brining new excitement and adventure but i think something changed. Maybe it was the charm, difficulty or the look. Im not going to list why i like the game because i could go on all day and make this review 17 pages long. Its just not the same anymore.",

For example the 'Blood moon' is probably the most basic event and most likely the first one you will see in your experience. During this the ambience goes red and monsters spawn more frequent.

It also has a tendency to make you rage at random chance.   PROS +Bright and colorful, light mood +Simple crafting system +Easy-to-learn mechanics +Walking goldfish +Plenty of options for how to go about everything - building your house and character. +Generally intelligent world generation  +Flying fish +Semi-unique monsters - zombies are overused, but the different types of monsters - above and below ground - definitely keep you on your toes.  +So many things to do and get that you'll often get distracted with other things than what you actually planned to do.  CONS -What you should be doing isn't always clear if you don't do research outside the game -Actual melee weapons become useless for a large portion of the game, instead traded for 'ranged' weapons that do melee damage all the way until the end of the game - boomerangs, flails, yo-yos... Swords become a problem as mobility is more important than durability. You'll spend too much time running away from bosses to be able to use that flaming greatsword you just spent ten minutes gathering the materials for.  -Time consuming. Immensely so. A good majority of the game is spent searching for ores, both in the very early stages of the game and the near-endgame, and you'll spend so little time in the sunlight your character should be snow-white. Preparation for most boss fights, the first time around, will generally consist of you spending half an hour building a room and practically filling it with platforms. -Taking the time to do more than set up a teleporter or pressure plated for your doors is rather pointless with wiring, as most of the traps in the game are either expensive to maintain or are so quickly outclassed by your gear that you waste your time bothering. Though if you're setting up things for a server, they certainly add a bit of fun to the game.  -Once you've beaten the 'final boss' - there really is no such thing as a last boss in a sandbox - it may take you some time to want to play the game again, especially if you do the fight by yourself. The feeling of emptiness after such an epic and frantic encounter, knowing that you've effectively beaten all of the game's challenges, makes it difficult to keep playing beyond that.

There was the massive 1.2 update that was just amazing, and added tons of new content to an already pretty fun game. There was a smaller update that added in great features I never new I wanted.  The gameplay:   The 'infinite' worlds is a very interesting concept. Each world you make you can carry over your inventory. This makes it so, you can get more items by making new worlds and deleting them when you're done, or if the the corruption starts to take over your world, start over and prepare better. You would have the tools to do so.  Another cool note on the world types, is being able to start in a normal and transfer to expert. If you don't want to get thrown straight into an expert world. You can try and beat the game in normal mode, and then after you've completed everything, you transfer all your items to an expert world and try and beat those bosses, and explore the new items. Or if you're up for the challenge, start in an expert world and never take your character to a normal world.  The items are super fun and awesome. Each time I have played I end up with different weapons, and other gear. This makes it a fun experience each time. There are tons of different types of weapons, and weapon tiers, so you can choose different fighting styles. You could try and make it harder by limiting yourself to certain weapon types or banning others. My personal favorite has to be the yo-yos.   TL:DR There are tons of items, weapons, etc. You can take your character from world to world and get new items. 10/10 would recommend. I mean... I am recommending it right now.   PS. Yo-yos are awesome!",

            "review_text": "Ok, where do I start. This game is insanely AMAZING! Heres a short guide, (would recomend buying).  This is if you want help on what to do (expert): When you spawn in, immediatly build a house for the guide. Although not useful, hes a guide wiki for crafting objects. You can try mining, but I'd recomend crafting the wooden long sword over the one you start with. You can try to mine or play it safe and wait to the next day. PROTIP: Dont try to go outside at night time unless well preped, dont open your doors, DONT. Mine until you get enough iron or gold, (or whatever ore, just dont try copper, its useless) Use these bars to make a better sword (pickaxe and axe comes later, stick with copper for now) Oh yeah, craft a wooden hammer. Once you have a better sword go to the desert, Put your money in a chest, you dont want to lose it! Head over to the desert, if your trying no deaths, bring recalls. Your going to most likely run into 'antilions' These demons are evil, if you see one, try to build over it. (it will hit you with sand, sand hurts.) Once you get over, you will probably see a pit and here some ch-ch-ch noises, these are antilion swammers and antilion chargers, AVOID AT ALL COSTS, these guys fly and charge, they're heavy hitters. Build over the pit, for know. Make sure your getting every cactus, once you have enough cactus, get 80 to be safe, go home, recall or run, then craft cactus armor and a cactus pickaxe, the pickaxe is the exact same power as the copper pickaxe, but its better.. trust me. Once you've done that, the only thing you can do is mine and explore, go far underground to find good chest that have accesories (ak Hermes Boots, Cloud in a bottle, etc.) Once you are geared enough, (mabye full tungsten/silver or platinum/gold. Go ahead and fight the eye of cthulu, you need a demon alter, aka the crimson alter, you have to combine 5 lends (craft) to make a spawner, when prepared use the potions you want and click the spawner at night, NOT DAY. After this, he will drop demonite or crimtane. If your lucky, you'll get a shield, 14.49% chance. it's a good weapon doing 30 damage, fight him 2-3 times till you can make demonite set, which includes pickaxe and axe, you will not need a better hammer yet. once you do that, fight the Eater of Worlds or Brain of Cthulu, your only doing this for 1)demonite/crimtane 2)making the metorite land. once you fight him. (it should be easy with full demonite) than you can wait for a metorite to land, this containes metor ore, what a suprise! I'd recommend using bombs to blow up the entire thing, once you've done that, craft a space gun and full demonite armor, space gun is insanely OP with full demonite, do it! Once you've done that, the next step is queen bee, but you dont have to, just fight here, its easy. Finally were at Skeletron, this is soooo easy, just kill him, explore the dungeon blah blah, done! Now, you dig an elevator to hell, hellevator ;3, literally just dig down. So hard. Once you reach hell, find a voodoo doll. Keep that, DONT THROW IT IN THE LAVA! This part may take some time, but its veryusefull, mine alot of hellstone, you want the full set, trust me. Also be making sure to pick up heart crystals! once you've got the full set of hellstone armor, your ready to go to hardmode, make sure you have good potions, like damage buffs and healing regen and other stuff. I would recomend getting alot of wooden planks and placing them across hell, so you dont burn in lava. fight wof, I recommend going for the middle first, dont know why, overall, WoF isnt that hard to beat the 2 eyes will shoot lasers at you, so watch out. once you've beat him. It's off to hardmode, now the real challenge starts ;) Good Luck Guys!",

I just want to say one thing, people who like Minecraft, Roblox and Terraria, don't be upset and fight over the 3. Minecraft is good, Terraria is good too, and so is Roblox. Dont do that please. ReLogic, Mojang and Roblox made these games to entertain not battle against each other. I just want to say that maybe you should make some more drops for certian items to make armor or weapons. Like maybe the bats can drop bat husk and to craft bat vanity set and go with your great bat wings. Just saying, no forcing. Anyway, I hope you like all 3 games and not fight over them.

            "review_text": "So this is a shoutout to both Steam and Terraria. I first played this game on my nephew's account, but quickly bought it for myself because I was at the mercy of his playing schedule, and I wanted MORE! (Thank you for your family sharing system, Steam! It got me to buy another amazing game.) I played for a couple of hours, died MANY times, and realized that this game is NOT 2-D Minecraft, the way many reviews seem to say.  First, content: Minecraft has only a few unique mobs. Terraria has over 100. Minecraft has about a 4-tier weapons crafting system. Terraria has at least 10 tech trees, each with 1-point tiers from ~4 to as much as ~30 damage (I have not discovered every level of every tier, but, for instance, the yo-yo tree (yes, you can kill things with yo-yos!) starts at about 7 damage. The basic wooden yo-yo can later be recrafted into a 30-point yo-yo. This happens in the latter half of the game.  Second, storyline: This is a sandbox game, much like Minecraft. It even has renewable resources like wood (at 4 varieties, each of which creates its own tier of weaponry.) On the other hand, there are summonable bosses, similar to the Ender Dragon, available from fairly early in the game. There is the Eye of Cthulhu, the Eater of Worlds, The Slime King, the Hive Queen... Yeah, that's all I've seen, because the bosses are scaled to their availability in the storyline. In other words, they are HARD when you run into them, but by the time you get to the end of their window of availability, they are no longer impossible. By the way, about that window of availability? Yeah, each early boss has a harder version available from the halfway point in the game.  Third, NPCs: One of the biggest reasons that Terraria is not Minecraft is the emphasis on NPCs. In Minecraft you are very much on your own, and the game is designed so that you can survive that way. In Terraria, the game is balanced around having a collection of NPCs, each with a single special function, that hang out at your house and wait for you to return from adventuring so that they can help you (for a price.) My favorite is one of the easier NPCs to pick up, the Merchant. He sells a miner's hat that emits light and obviates the need for torches, and a sickle, a very cheap HTA (hold to attack) weapon. Everything he offers costs money.  The final major difference between the two games is the economic system. In Minecraft, emeralds are hard to find, and villages to trade them in are even harder. The villages are not designed to be a central part of the gameplay, and therefore the economy is not central either. In Terraria, a major part of the storyline is the need to develop your village's capabilities by attracting NPCs who can do the things you need done. To do this, you must kill enemies for a small amount of coin, explore caves and mine ore as well as loot amphora and chests for important quest items, discover fully-equipped cabins in the middle of the cave systems (and typically loot everything in the cabin, to sell it to your NPCs,)...  Minecraft is a fun, challenging game, no doubt. It has a little bit of playability, but new content must be released frequently to keep player interest. Terraria has so much content that they do not need to add anything, ever - I am hooked for life.",

I never get disapointed from this game. Now for those who think terraria is just a ripoff of minecraft, let me just say its far from a ripoff of minecraft, more techincal, and more action even if it is in 2D, it has a lot of different features, from minecraft which to me makes it not a minecraft ripoff. What is great about this is the lag is kept minimal, so even if you have some laptop thats running windows vista, this has a ok framerate, if you were playing minecraft you would have to get optifine, and all the lag features if you were playing on a laptop. This game can be a bit confusing when you start off, so I would recommend doing some research before you start playing this game, because it will help you a lot a make the game a more fun gameplay experenice because this is very techincal there is over 1000 items in this game.

Cheating makes it so nothing is rewarding in this game.  Now, some people say it makes it no fun to get items from other people. I don't think so. I personally got Meowmere from a friend who had quit earlier and told me I could take whatever I wanted. This made the game a lot more fun! I tried starting over and getting everything the legit way, but after that, I never liked the game until hardmode. I spent 5 hours and all I got is one new sword. My purpose in the game wasn't to beat all the bosses (although I did), it was to get every item. For example, the Laser Machinegun isn't the best weapon in the game, but it's fun to use! Using silly loadouts is half the fun for me. If there's one thing that annoys me, it's how much items and reforges cost in the shop. The one easy way to riches in this game is a farm. Truffle worm farms are great to use, in my opinion.",

I would recommend this game if you are able and willing to memorize where you can get every item, what you need to craft it, how good it is, etc, and there are tons of items, so this might take a while for new players. Terraria is updated very frequently so there are always new items to try, new bosses to beat and new areas to explore. Terraria's features are always well thought-out and always have lots of details. Even though there are pros and cons for this game, you will find yourself being sucked into it and never wanting to stop.

I respect the game for much more than that but too many of my friends have played it for 1 hour and called it bad based on a bunch of spoilers versus their immediate experience.  There NEEDS to be more in-game documentation so that these spoilers dont get through. even some of the crafting items that show up, like the frost moon present shows it on the tooltip. It also shows ectoplasms as a crafting ingredient, which may prompt people to look it up and it just spoils everything too fast.  A game like this shouldn't need to be spoiled so quickly. That's my only real reason for not recommending the game at its current state. I'll change it if they fix this. Hopefully Terraria Otherworld addresses this glaring issue.",

This game although similar to Minecraft, is only similar because it's an open world sandbox game that is procedurely generated and there is a lot of mining and a lot of crafting. But to say this game is cheap is stupid (although it is cheap in price :D) and to say it's a rip-off of Minecraft, although it technically rode off the success of Minecraft when it was first released it has since become a complete game, and it's own entity to rival that of Minecraft, it is not a rip-off, just similar like previously stated.  Now you might be thinking, well that's great an all but what do you think about the game? Simply put, I LOVE IT. It's amazing, and filled to the brim with content and items, enemies, bosses, biomes, blocks, items, powerups, items, potions, items. Oh did I mention it has a LOT of items? Didn't think so, in that case: it has a lot of items. If you like Minecraft PLEASE download this game, if you don't like Minecraft, still give it a try you might find a Diamond in the rough. (And yes the pun was fully intended)  Note to Re-Logic: Thank you so much for this work of art, this is an amazing game. Keep adding awesome stuff to it, and don't play it safe! Remember to experiment with new ideas, and if people don't like it, just change it back. &lt;3  5/5 Stars. Final rating.",

Not to mention the unique loot and items that you can get, including: A Nyan Cat sword of death, a rainbow beam of death, a SPACE DOLPHIN, and more. You can fire galaxies and stars at your enemies, chop them up with swords twice as long as your player, gun them down with a hail of bullets, or run away and let your minions do the work for you. With so many ways to play, Terraria never gets old, with amazing amounts of replayability.

So...Terraria, what can I say about it? You have many options, Building, Fighting, Fishing, Mining, Collecting (and possibly some others.)  The game also has a lot of replayability. Finished the game using whatever weapons you found cool? Stick to certain weapon types. Want a challenge? Expert Mode. Want even more of a challenge? Hardcore.  Also, this game is great with friends, even encouraging it in some aspects. Well, great until someone gets a bit salty for you taking their drops. (I totally don't do that heh...)  Overall though, the game is good, it's a fun sandbox/action game that is great with friends (It is also good solo if you are a sad loser.)    My Rating : 10/10  ",

I bought this game on a whim on Xbox 360 a few years ago, and it was probably the best decision in my life. I had to get it on PC after hearing about the Moon Lord's addition to the game. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. If you're confused about controls, you can check the options, they'll tell you. And most important of all, Terraria is NOT a 2D version of Minecraft; the similarities stop at the ability to mine and build the environment, that's it. Terraria is more geared toward combat and progression, but still gets points for exploration, and you can still build pretty cool things in Terraria as well. The wiring system is far easier to use, and is getting improved soon in an update. The only real issue is once you defeat the last boss and do everything you want to do, the game is essentially over. However, this game is LOADED with content, from all sorts of crazy weapons and enemies to different armors with different abilities, and the game has very high replay value; just make a new character and start all over again! Even not compared to Minecraft, it is still a great game on its own. The $10 is worth it, trust me. If you're thinking about buying this game, then proceed.  EDIT: The wiring system is now improved with 1.3.1, and the game will continue to be updated and improved.",

From the absolutely insane amounts of things to do that all help you, like how simply fishing can get you crates that give you materials, to how farming plants like Dayblooms can help with crafting potions, everything is useful and everything can be done.  Updates 1.2 and 1.3 were some of the biggest updates I've ever seen from a sandbox game, adding many bosses and the Hardmode bosses after Wall of Flesh which was also included in 1.2. Even a semi-small update like the most recent 1.3.1 update which, from what they said, added only wiring stuff but added awesome small stuff like little beehives that spawn bees when knocked down. There is plenty of love shown in this game.  The developers, despite their efforts being moved to Terraria Otherworld, still show plenty of love and care for this game, and continue to see it grow into the wonderful game we have now. From the deepest extent of my heart, I do reccommend this game to anyone who loves sandbox games.   Also, if I hear another person compare this game to Minecraft, I'll skin them alive.

Still now after this game has been out for around 5 years the player still stays strong strong with Tens-of-Thousands of players playing every day! And I think alot can be said about that.  Lets face it, if you don't own Terraria by now you are one of two things; 1) North Korean 2) Brand new to the PC/ Steam scene. Terraria should be on a list of 'Starting PC games'. The reason I say this is because for the price tag on this game, the ammount of content and hours you can get out of it are staggering. With the game often on sale, I can honestly say that if you enjoy it, it will give you the best game time per money spent out of almost any other steam game.  For example if bought this game for £6.99 and at the time of writing this I have 402 hours so with a simple calulation we can work out that I spent 0.02p per hour played. Pointless to know, but I think it demonstrates the value for money quite well! Pick this game up if you are looking for cheap entertainment",

This game was one of the first I ever got wayy back when it first came out. I remember getting annoyed at fighting some bosses (Even though now they seem easy) and even after 350 hours played I seriously can still get frusterated as all f*** on this game. Not in a bad way dont get me wrong. In a way that makes you want to keep going and go that extra mile. This game is rewarding when you work a goal to something and SUPER satisfying after beating bosses or getting a new item. I have sighed and gasped in releif many times at the addictiveness of this game. The gameplay is what people call a 2D minecraft. Thats very insulting! Mincraft cannot compare to the glory of such an amazing game. Even the soundtrack is completely amazing! I'm a person to like rock or metal but wow, the soundtrack in this game just couldnt be any better! I hate to say it but its even better than the Payday 2 soundtracks! Each mode in a world is set for what experience you want in this game. Want to go through casually without a care in the world and see what there is to offer? Normal mode and softcore is good for you! Want a bit of a challenge that will make you cry yourelf to sleep and have to actually have a TON of strategy to beat a simple cave bat? Expert mode! Last not not least, Try some hardcore expert mode. This mode will make you die on the inside everytime you hear that slightly highpitched 'Ouf!' from your character. This mode takes skill to a whole new level that I will forever be to scared to try. This mode will put Dark souls to SHAME. This is possibly one of my most favorite games out there coming out with few major updates but when it happens they add SOOO much more stuff to do! Every time I come back I bring along a friend and get very nostalgic. This game is a must have and seriously should be in everyones library. Thank you Re-logic for making such a well made game! I will certainly be playing much much more in the future.",

I think it's fair to say I'm wronng in that considering my play time and the fact this review is in the positive section (unlike some reviews *cough* almost half the entire negative section *cough*)   I'm not going to talk about my experiences with the game, and defientely am not going to bore anyone with me saying what happened the first time I played (that is saying people will probably not read this, and people who do will get bored half way through it, cause I can get pretty boring). So, i'll just move onto the pros and cons list (like as if that wasnt a cliche or anything).  Pros to Terraria: -Wonderful graphics and beatiful color pallet -Great Soundtrack that fit the tone of all the areas and events (except the snow biome song, not a big fan of it) -Controls feel nice and easy to use, all the original binds are easy to reach (except for mana potions [why J as the quick bind]) -Gameplay is nice and smooth, with a difficulty curve that goes from easy to medium to hard (beginning of game, hardmode, and post-Plantera) -Customization to almost everything (still waiting for dyable weapons Re-Logic)  Now onto the cons: -Barely any instructions before the achievements were made (I personally liked it that way, but others weren't to happy) -Sometimes (during an update) characters would be deleted/ corrupted, and so would worlds -Medusa (yes I know, she was moved into hardmode, but she's still on the cons list)  And that concludes the short cons list (these are things I could find and of course my OPINIONS [some people don't understand opinions for some reason] about the game), so if you are still awake after reading this, than either A. buy the game now, or B. buy it during a steam sale.",

And yeah the Night Time Boss thing is another issue if you keep hitting it down and say it's like 2% of health left and then the sun came up to ruin that experience from all of that hard work.

There are also lots of bosses to fight which each feel special. Worlds are huge, and there are many different environments to discover (15+ as far as I know).   The crafting allows for endless possibilities, and past all of this the game has an expert mode which allows for lots of replayability (monsters are a lot harder, have a lot more abilities, and bosses drop more items).   Multiplayer is also very friendly! You can have maybe a small world for just 2 friends, small for maybe 3-5, and large for 6+ (these are what they fit--you could have 6 in a small world but it would be a tight fit).

OT though; In my opinion you will completly hate it, or you will completly love it, it is a great game with a lot of content, bosses and things to fight and discover, it has a variety of things that one can do, whenever it is to do events, fight bosses, fish or even stand by a campfire and cook a marshmallow, I personally like everything about the game, even though there a lot of games like itself, I think Terraria is very unique with its content, and even its beautiful pixel art style; it is very eye appealing and that's one of the best things I like about Terraria. I love the fact that you can customize your character in anyway you like, choose the exact colour for your hair, shoes, even your eyes, get armor, customize the armors dye in the way you like and you can make yourself look like a complete beast, there is a ton of stuff to do in the game, getting one item can take hours of farming which I believe is really nice, because that just brings the idea of well, the game is not all that easy, it doesn't bore you, it might not always give you what you want and I think that's a great concept.  I think the game is also very greatly optimized, so it is surely nicely playable on older machines too, it has Linux, Windows and Mac support, which I think is a great thing about it too as not much new games (and older obviously) offer that.  I've only gotten 500 hours so far, but I could quite surely make that a 1000 without getting bored of the game.  Like 2D sandbox games with bosses, bunnys, creepers and a plant that would do anything to kill you? Well, there aren't any games like that... Oh wait, there is Terraria, try it out! :)",

Welp, I'll just stick with being a naked werewolf. -Sometimes you may be unlucky and get the corruption/crimson close to your spawn, you must rush to block it once in hard mode. -Building isn't an option. -People may give you OP stuff in multiplayer. If you don't want to get OP stuff now, just throw it away. -Going to hell is the most painful thing.

The game has an incredible amount of support from the devs and thats what makes this game so great. Every once and a while the game will get a major update adding more weapons, blocks, bosses, and so much more and everytime this happens me and my friends hop into a new world and start the adventure all over again. Keep in mind that this game was released in 2011,it still gets updates! The reaplayability here is endless there is just so much great stuff to do.

            "review_text": "(I try to be 100% honest in all my reviews. Enjoy!)  Terraria is an open world survival game that takes the idea of a normal survival game and absolutely perfects it. That is, if you don't mind the lack of 3-D graphics being replaced by side scrolling pixels. In a lot of ways, Terraria gets things right where a lot of games similar to it weren't enough. But at the same time, there is so much to do in Terraria and some of it is seemingly impossible without friends helping you, so you'll want to have some online games for boss battles as well.  The first thing Terraria gets right where lots of other survival games doesn't is the overall appeal. There is actually some structure to how you play the game. You have to know how to build you house to support the funny characters that spawn and will try to live in your house. There is a series of bosses that, if lableled properly, you can see are more powerful than others. Certain pickaxes will only break certain things and run at a certain speed, while certain weapons are more powerful than others. Which brings me to my next point, the WEAPONS.  One of the best things about Terraria is the weaponry. By just a few hours into the game, you can find a cave easily and head down to get some serious loot. (Note: You may not get the BEST weaponry just starting to play the game, I played the Xbox version for quite some time and I had a lot of things.)  The only major problem with Terraria is the boss-fights. I'm not saying they aren't completely awesome, I'm saying that depending on the player's skill level, as I believe mine is kind of low, it may be hard to defeat certain bosses without friends to help you. And even then, if you are having trouble defeating a boss, you have to constantly be finding boss spawners so you keep trying. After a lot of failures, it may seem like a waste to keep using them.  One last thing: I did have some framerate issues when playing the game. It was nothing major, but for about a minute the world would slow-down and I looked like I was in bullet-time. It isn't game crippling, however.  All in all, if you enjoyed a game like Minecraft, Terraria is for you! It definitely outshines most survival games and only dips down by the hardness of boss-fights. (Which may not be that hard for a skilled player, so if you are a skilled player, this game has nothing wrong with it, aside from some framerate issues.)  9/10 Lots of Content Interesting Equipment Possibly Hard Boss Fights Small Framerate Drops  I hope this review helps you make your decision!

The boss also unlocks various new bosses that play a major role in the game. With the new 1.3 comes yo-yos. These yo-yos are very powerful and getting one gives you a major advantage on PC as it follows the movement of your mouse cursor. This game amazes me... just how do these people come up these ideas?

Let me go into it.  In terraria, you design your character, and a map is randomly generated for you. However, the map has a 50% chance of spawning a biome called \\'The Corruption\\' and a 50% chance of spawning a biome called \\'The Crimson\\'. Most new players don\\'t know it yet, but simply by creating a new map, you have already made a unique decision that will permanently change your game forever.  For the people who don\\'t know, Biomes are basically different areas with a theme. Like a desert, a jungle, a snowy area, etc.  When designing your character, you are offered three modes, softcore (drop money on death), mediumcore (drop everything on death), hardcore (permanent death).   Once you enter your world, the place you spawn will be your respawn point permamently, unless you\\'re hardcore, so it\\'s best to build your house near this spawn or even directly on it.  A thing that terraria does well is bosses. There are many bosses to fight.  Another thing terraria does amazingly is content. This review is actually getting hard to write, because there\\'s so much content in this game that I can\\'t even explain it. And I\\'m literally just 46 hours in!  Let me cut it nice and simple:  Get Terraria. It is a good game. Trust me, you will not regret it. It\\'s not your basic platformer, and it has much content.    ",

When you think you beat the game, BOOM, a little thing called hardmode comes in and adds many new items, mobs, and biomes anto your world. 10/10  Got lost in the first few hours of playing because of so much content. 10/10  Multiplayer 9/10  A huge game, but doesn't hog all the memory on your computer! 10/10  Flying foxes 11/10  Doesn't need a good computer to run it. 10/10  LOTS AND LOTS of weapons, tools, armor. 10/10  No limit of how you can build. 10/10  Hundreads of ores you can mine. 10/10  Incredibly fun. 10/10  Customization of character, house, etc. 10/10  CONS: 2D (my opinion)  Hackers. This game has no hacking protection. And servers are overrun with people who are invincable and kill you instantly. One time i was wandering around servers and found a server with chests with an infinate supply of all the items in the game. (Even the items that are still in development) I couldn't stop myself from taking the best items in the game. Including a SDMG, a item still in development. And with enchantments and accessories, it does 100 damage (a lot) and shoots like a freaking laser beam. The average player has about 300 health. Beware of these hacked servers/players. It will ruin this game for you. I still cant get rid of my sdmg no matter how hard i try.  EDIT: The SDMG is no longer in development as of update 1.3  Overall: This game is a masterpiece. Buy it now. An outstanding 20/10 So what are you waiting for? Buy this game and even buy a 4 pack of the game for your friends NOW!",

Terraria is a 2-dimensional adventure game. As you explore your world further, you will find more materials that will allow you to make better armour and weapons. There are hundreds of different enemies, plus around 18 boss monsters. The multiplayer aspect of this game is really fun, because you can open up your own world to your friends (yes, you can invite friends only if you like) even if they are far away. Character customization is really great, with infinite possibilities of how to shape your character. This is a really great game. I would reccomend it to anyone.  Note to parents: There is no gore in this game, though some of the SFX can seem a bit too realistic; If you are worried about strangers in multiplayer mode, it is easy to set up the world so that only friends on Steam are invited; there may be some very small suggestive themes with the NPC (non-player character) dialogue.",

Repeatedly beat the Moonlord with a buddy. A truly terrifying ending boss fight that I absolutely loved.  Bottom line: For $9.99 this game is a steal. I can’t wait for the release of Terraria 2.",

More ores, enemies, pretty pixel graphics, and lovely music to boot.  My one complaint is the crafting menu. Unlike the console version, you're not told what you CAN'T craft in the PC version. It only tells you what you can make if you andrguemenlready have everything you need for the desired item. So you'd need a lot of outside information (wiki and guides) to craft the more advanced items.   Regardless, I still enjoy it. And, like Minecraft, it's a blast with friends. And with the 1.3 update released, it's even better than when I first played it before I took a long break from it. It's like leaving your town that had a nice comic store and you move back to it after a few years and that comic store looks has a bunch more stuff in there including a game room and card game tables.

However, there are things which are for other people as well.  1) 78 different swords, with more special effects as you move up, and 66 other different melee weapons in categories such as yoyos, flails, and spears.  2) 84 different ranged weapons, from categories such as bows, guns, and launchers.  3) 76 different magic weapons, each with different unique effects.  4) 18 other weapons, such as grenades and traps.  5) 65 different armor sets (3 pieces each) which offer unique special bonuses that help for specific builds in the game.  6) 18 different bosses, which go from basic and easy to ones I've never beaten before, along with 10 other events which force you to develop strategies to defeat them easily.  7) A surprisingly deep character customization.  8) An expert mode for you masochists.  9) A multiplayer which is very fun in small amounts (large amounts make loot difficult to split and hard to find- not everybody will get everything they want).  10) However, you can have one character cary over to a different world. Therefore, rather than generating a more world, you can generate a new one, which is very helpful. It means you don't have to go on long adventures to go find some more materials.   Even if you don't seem like you would be a fan of it, and are a more builder type, there is a wiring system you can mess with. You can try to be creative and make new ways to defeat bosses, or combine different armors and weapons to see how they work. It's a fantastic game (my most played game on steam).

You can really make the world your own, even on such a small map (compared to some other pixel-art side-scrollers *cough* *Starbound* *cough*), and there is a hell of a lot to do within it, but the small map and changing landscape keeps you on your toes and makes you appreciate the space you have while giving a lot of goals to work towards. Warding off the Crimson or Corruption becomes a big part of the game, especially after entering hardmode, and then the whole game dynamic changes. It's a very fun experience that's fun over and over. From house-building to raid bosses, it really is endless fun.",

Grinding for new things, killing new enemies, getting new weapons, killing more enemies with said weapons, etc. Also it's a real challenge if you play in expert mode. There's so much replay value with the 4 different classes, 2 world evils, and even more variety! There's no other game that I can play for hours straight and feel so accomplished.

            "review_text": "WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!   *I'm just gonna say right now, Minecraft is garbage compared to this. Now Minecraft is ceratinly a good game, but taking the graphics of an SNES platformer, Minecraft's gameplay, and way more items, you have this game. Lots of combat and bosses in this one as opposed to Minecraft's creation-based gameplay. And unlike Minecraft, you actually have to kill these bosses to progress. Yes, you could go without killing a single boss, but that playstyle won't get you anywhere.  *One of the things about this game are the NPC's. You can get them to move in to houses you build(Enclosed space, door, table, chair, light source, background walls is all you need for a structure to be considered a house). For example, you can get a merchant by collecting 50 silver coins, and you can get a cyborg by killing Plantera (A late-game boss).  *Now, read this paragraph carefully. This game IS NOT for young kids. First off, you can obtain alcoholic drinks. There's blood and minor gore. The first boss you fight is a giant bloody eyeball (Although the graphics don't make it too bad). Heck, not too long after that you fight a giant skull with two skelton arms (With blood involved.) And right as you 'release the ancient spirits of Light and Dark' and change your world forever, THE BOSS IS NOT ONLY HORRIFYING (Even your in-game character gets a 'horrified debuff, though that just prevents you from escaping) IT IS FOUGHT IN HELL ITSELF. YES, YOU CAN DIG DOWN TO HELL. AND THAT BOSS IS SUMMONED WITH A LIVING SACFRIFICE. So yeah, definitely T for Teen (That's about the same as PEGI 12).  * The game has 'Suggestive themes' on its rating by the ESRB, but that's probably the fact that some characters have relationships, and a few item names. It's not much to worry about.  *H.P. Lovecraft references (Eye of Cthulhu, Brain of Cthulhu, True Eye of Cthulhu, and possibly some others). Big win in my opinion.  *In the Steam version I BELIEVE (But am not certain) you can turn off the blood.  *This game is hard. just warning you. Try killing Moon Lord(The 'Final Boss' with anything less than the Beetle Armor and you'll probably regret it)  *NO DLC! Yessssss.  * Epic soundtrack. Like, MEGA MAN good (Well, almost.)  *Lastly, the community. you probably know Minecraft's fanbase is now, unfortunately almost all little kids. That wouldn't be sou bad, but even the '10 year olds'(Yeah, right) act like they are 3. But not in Terraria! The fanbase is really nice and onece a person I know was even given a LEGENDARY(The best modifier for a sword.) Terra Blade(A very good sword by another player(He was 'farming' Terra Blades to get money in-game) for NOTHING! The same person I know went on a server which just gave you an Excalibur(The Terra Blade wasn't out) for joining!   Oh yeah. Choose you playsyle wisely.",

Now now, let's not be fanboys and point out it's flaws. First of all, there's barely any flaws, and that's not good. It won't get better unless something needs to be changed. Second of all, the game has server support, and that means you could get free items from servers, and knowing that you can get free items on your play through can ruin the experience, but then again, if your stuck on a boss or you feel underpowered, you can just get some free items I guess?  The bosses are awesome, and the soundtrack is amazing, especially with the 1.3.4 update with the Dungeon Defenders crossover, but those items are more of the Mechanical Tier. I have played terraria on Mobile, console, and PC. Terraria is a great game with a great community. However, entertainment is a block on the road. It only attracts thousands of views, so if your going to buy it to make videos, don't expect to get a bundle.  There are lots of things to keep you busy, and grinding for, which is not sorta fun, but IT'S WORTH IT OK There's lots of items that can help you, and items that can carry you, like Vampire Knives, Terra blade, and so on forth to Post Golem tier, but the best part is that they're hard to get, but it takes variety.   Terraria is my favorite game, and other people's favorite game. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games and bosses that are hard. 9/10",

It has a tendancy to be very repetative, after skeletron bosses patterns and mechanics seem to repeat, so you need to make your own fun out of what you are given. Building creative and strange structures is what makes it enjoyable for me, and other enjoy things like pvp or just hanging around.",

Well, obviously the game holds a far larger base of content than Minecraft. Things that Terraria has that Minecraft DOESN'T have: Giant flying eyeballs Robot flying eyeballs Halloween/Christmas events Winter events Blood Moons Solar Eclipses variety to zombies giant flying skeleton heads with flying arms giant flying robot skeleton heads with flying arms Slime Variety Hamaxes Drills Pickaxe Axes Jackhammers Giant worms Giant corrupt worms Chainsaws Lasers Aliens Dragons (Minecraft has them too, but Terraria has better dragons/wyverns) Miniguns Guns in general Variety to bows Realistic fishing Quests to follow said fishing Flying Pirate ships Normal pirates that come from said ships Giant flying pumpkins with swords Repeating bows an excalibur Giant robot worms A Slime King Variety to minecarts Rockets Rocket launchers Grenade launchers I lost track, there's far too much stuff.  So, if I had an opinion of a star rating based on the amount of content in the game: Minecraft: 37/100 Terraria: 85/100  *Dont forget that Terraria is 2D and STILL holds more content than minecraft*",

From when Skeletron and the Dungeon were endgame, to now where now   cthulu   is  literally[i/] the final boss, Re-Logic have provided many new updates each more bountiful than the last.  So if you came here because of Starbound, Edge of Space, Minecraft or because of Steam's weird algorithms (I don't blame you) get Terraria, on sale or not. Because even as a long time player, I am still finding new ways to have fun, whether it be with the harder difficulties or the many details and little secrets, as just today I learnt about the secret Master Sword hommage.

Every time I played this game I have been able to play it in a different way, whether it be changing the type of weapons I use, the type of armours I use, the mount I use, etc.. Terraria is a great game to play with freinds and includes a lot of features that can be used if there is another player in the game, for example the wormhole potion that can teleport you to any player on the team you are currently on. The PvP experience is great and the amount of different types of battles you can have with different people are amazing. There are so many things in this game that make it my number one choice for a game, and if I did have to choose any of the games in my library to keep, I would keep Terraria. If I had to rate this game I would seriously give it an 11/10. I have played since it came out and have not stopped playing it.

Often, if you get caught up with too many enemies, you might as well take a break, because everytime you die, you're usually spawned with them. Would make sense if the game spawned you in a completed stucture/house when you died or somewhere relatively safe. And that's just getting started at the beginning.  Personally, I've never expereinced anything that is shown in the videos. That is not to say it's not possible, but I think what they show you is rather advanced level stuff--the game, for the most part, doesn't seem to have near that much action or excitement when you're just getting started. I imagine you'd have to be playing for a really long time, within the same world, to experience any of that.  I do recommend the game though. It's pretty solid even though I've been experiencing some random slow down and cannot figure out what to do about it. Turning down graphics (not the issue), frame skipping, window mode/fullscreen, updating XNA... nothing seems to fix the issue. I don't recall it being an issue before, so it may have come with an update for all I know.  None of this is indicative of what you may experience, so take it all with a grain of salt.",

You start with nothing but a few basic tools and use them to explore a randomly generated world full of juicy, delicious secrets and craft weapons and armor to fight eldritch abominations – all set to an exquisite chiptune soundtrack.   The game does its best to provide variety by giving you several different playstyles to choose from. You can use melee weapons, magic, guns, or minions to strike down your enemies. Build purely utilitarian houses or let your imagination run wild with more building materials than you can shake a stick at. Have a patriarchy or a matriarchy. Do anything you want, really. I read on Kotaku that it's better than Civ 5 with the Brave New World expansion pack.   And I'm not going to compare it to Minecraft. I'm only bringing it up because so many people write Terraria off as a clone. Whether or not it is a clone – and you can make that judgement for yourself – is irrelevant.

When I first started playing they only had a few bosses and once you beat them you were like 'Well ♥♥♥♥...let's do it again.' Now they have so many bosses it's a little difficult to keep track of them. Don't be fooled as well, there is a class system but it is not apparent, you actually start classless and make yourself into a certain specalization. Either way, I am losing my point. Game is good, you should buy now.",

Back then, when a small indie company made a game, they rarely added content to it because the games were complete, Terraria on the other hand got updated throughout the years and it has multiple times the content it had originally.

Terraria makes up for slightly less freedom of control over the world by adding so many different weapons and items to the game that your options for customizing a play style are virtually limitless. A broad spectrum of enemy types and ways to interact with and travel around the world you create makes Terraria stand out among other games of its type.

EoC (Requires 200 heath and at least 3 npc's) I feel is best to at least have Iron/Lead armor before taking him on. The Destroyer of Worlds/Brain of Cuthulu I suggjest Silver/Tungston armor, this boss requisres you to destroy Shadow Orbs/Crimson Orbs 3 times to awaken. Just make sure you are ready to face it. One is a gigantic worm like creature and roughly you need a wepon to stirke multiple times. The other is you guessed it A giganitic brain that flys around shooting out fleash colored blobs. Each are around 8000-16000 health again not very though. This is just an example of what you are looking at while playing this game and these are just the first 2 bosses that one faces in the game.

The game is a kind of 2D Minecraft when it comes to mining, building, and crafting, and a 2D Dark Souls when it comes to monster fights. Basically, almost anything that moves wants to kill you. Terraria has a plethora of items and an extensive crafting system which aid the player in progressing through the game and battling tougher monsters. The player will need to have the best armor, weapons and accessories if they want to stand a chance against bosses, each boss being stronger than its predecessor.   Terraria has excellent 2D pixelated graphics and item designs, accompanied by a good and diverse soundtrack. The maps can be very large and are a miner's dream come true, although exploring can become frustrating due to the frequent monster spawns around the player. In some cases it is necessary to switch the pickaxe with he sword every 5 seconds to deal with a new monster that has spawned nearby and is heading towards the player with the intention to eviscerate them.  I truly recommend this game to anyone that has played  Minecraft  or  Don't Starve  and wants a challenge, as I can assure you this game will give you enough 'opportunities' to die. Mining, exploring, battling, Terraria has them all, and is still being updated with new content, as of the writing of this review. The only reason I am not giving it a full  10  is because of its annoying monster spawn rate, which is especially frustrating while building underground structures. 9/10",

It is quite similar to minecraft in a sense, but, in my opinion it is funnier since there's a lot more one can do and not just mine and search for diamonds over and over again, Terraria shines at its best when being played in multiplayer as it gets harder to manage resources and kill your enemies.

When I first started playing, I'll be honest and say that I knew how a few things worked going in, knew that I needed to make a house, knew I needed to fight 3 bosses.   Lucky to say that within that week, I was thrown out on my ♥♥♥ from that bit I knew and was better off for it. 1.2 and onward made for some of the most fun I've ever had in a game, and I got to discover new stuff all over the place.   Nowadays we're post-Red and while I don't agree with some of the practices (Would have rather had 1 or 2 updates instead of 4, would have made the updates more exciting) and while looking at two sequels , I'd honestly say that I'd be satisfied with the game as it is now.   But then they keep updating, and if theres one thing better than something being great, it's being great and getting better.  Let's hope the future for this game is as bright as it's updates.",

Terraria is a 2D side scrolley game mad by 505 Games for the PC in 2011. The graphics are good - I can run the game with everything turned up, on my Intel HD Graphics 4000, on a Medium World at 30fps. The replayablitily is non existent, there is no real 'End Game' compared to other games. There is a slight one - But this one is not needed to complete the game (it is to defeat all the bosses and to get the best weapons and armour) The Multiplayer for this game is OUTSTANDING! It is near seamless to connect to other people via steam - the one downside to the Multiplayer is if you have bad WIFI you may want to create a small world otherwise the game may not load, crash or lag. This game is harsh to beginners, when it is night, when you start, your basically toast - Unless you have a friend when your both toast.  Thanks for Reading   Potatoman426 - November 2016    P.S. If you are really lazy search up on the internet 'Builder's workshop' - It has every item in terraria, ever! (I take no credit for the map.)",

This kind of fun game should carry a government warning as I've started playing before now on a Friday and the next thing is it is Saturday night and I am struggling to keep my eyes open.   The only thing that really lets down this 2D, minecraft alternative, is the lack of expansions. Sure - it has a great community that produces mods, and there are many hacks out there - but somehow I feel this is all cheating. By now - I feel that a full map should be visible in game. Instead I get a small window or a transparent overlay. Neither of these options have a full-world map or give any indication of how big things are.   The challenge is in figuring out how to reach the next part of the map and how to summon the next boss. There are many tasks to keep you busy. For example, recently I spent 20 hours relocating my base so it was elevated to prevent zombies and other mobs from invading. It worked well but the sheer amount of time and patience needed was enormous. However, this makes me love the game when I am playing it. It is very much a labour of love when playing this game, and the seemingly endless recipes and resource requirements make for the 'just one more hour' mentality. The online wikis and guides make the game easier but there is still so much to do.   Microsoft should have bought this one instead of Mojang's effort. Due to it being undeservedly less well-known than Minecraft, it would most likely have cost less. Instead they've bought a game with a questionable amount of horizontal instead of this game with which there is still so much scope to extend. I can think of at least a dozen possible enhancements to the game - not least of which would be online shards, infinite maps, and more elements to create things from. With any luck, they'll release Terraria 2 one day.",

Terraria is amazing, in my opinion, it beats Minecraft. Not only does Terraria have more to offer, it has less of a toxic community and bad server system like Minecraft. Terraria is 2D and Minecraft is 3D, I know that in Minecraft you can build more pixel art, well, actually, you have more possibilites of pixel arts in Terraria than in Minecraft because of you being able to paint blocks and such things, add effects and all that; in Minecraft it's just block placing and that's it, yet redstone in Minecraft is almost like blood, it functions good and can be used for all sort of things. I will finish my review by saying that Terraria is for everyone, it's not just for people that are young, but for people that look to express themselves through pixels and to have fun with other people, and of course, to explor forever!",

Thinking it must be a problem with the computer, I took the laptop into the computer shop, and had them completely clean out and reinstall my sons computer at a cost of $150, only to discover on getting it home that guess what..... IT STILL WON'T REINSTALL. To say I'm hacked off is an understatement. I pay for games, I expect my kids to be able to play them.

That's probably a good 5% of the game and nothing more. The remaining 95% of the game is a bit of a learning curve, but in an extremely satisfying way. You need to craft items to progress, you need to beat bosses to progress, and once you beat what seems like the final boss, you turn your world into hard mode. You need to beat 5 bosses JUST to get into the heart of the actual game, and that's easily a good 10 hours that have flown by by that point. Once you get hard mode you get more enemies, more loot, more events, more magic, more blocks, MORE BOSSES. I put 100+ hours in JUST trying to beat all the bosses with a friend and we're still learning new things. Throw in new updates every few months and there's always more to come back to.",

            "review_text": "This game isn't too bad with the amount of content available, and for being a game that is over five years old, it's still going strong with updates adding content and patching bugs often enough to keep the game playable. It's come a long ways from the beginning, and while there is no actual story, the progressive system in this game keeps you going from boss to boss, equipment to equipment. There's quite a bit of equipment too, with a variety of weapons to keep playstyle interesting. From summoning, ranged, melee, magic, and even yo-yos, there's something to keep you entertained. With the exploring aspect, it may be a little difficult to begin with, but as you gain more accessories, exploration gets easier. From caves to difficult to navigate terrain, namely the jungle, there's a lot to see. There's also three different map sizes to pick from, so if you want a smaller map, you can. As for all the blocks, equipment, furniture, npcs, wiring, ores, and liquids, there's a variety of things that you can build. The world is completely changeable, some blocks requiring good tools to remove the blocks, the variety of buildings, structures, and whatever you want is available after some clicks... and however long it takes to build. But that doesn't mean you have to build alone. The multiplayer feature in Terraria is simplistic. You can connect with your Steam friends playing just by going through Steam itself. If you wanted, you can also connect via IP address, which is easier than it sounds. You can just keep your game running to allow people to join you through IP, or the game now comes with a simple server file to keep your world up for your friends if they want to keep playing while you're done. The only downside to that is that you have to open a port in your firewall. Even if you don't want to mess with server running yourself, there's plenty of servers out there to mess around on. Just make sure you have a good internet connection. Overall, it's not a bad game. It has replayability, items fit to just about any play style, pretty good multiplayer features, and an adequate building system and enough wiring to satisfy just about anyone more interested in technical aspects of games. If the kind of games you enjoy are more sandbox, equipment gathering, kill everything to progress, and/or building pixel homes and structures, you might enjoy this game. Those that enjoy playing Starbound, Don't Starve, or Edge of Space might enjoy this game if you don't mind a pixel style 2D game. Pros- + Can fit just about any play style with the variety of equipment, accessories, and mounts + Building is fun with the amount of blocks and biomes + Bunch of bosses and events to beat and gain loot + If normal mode is too easy, there's an expert mode with increased difficulty + Pretty good soundtrack + When you get bored, you can mod the game to cater to your experience  Cons- - Can be grindy at times - Multiplayer requires a good internet connection to not be a bad experience - If you're not a fan of 2D pixel sidescrollers, then you won't like this  Overall, I'll say that this game is a 9/10. For the $10 price, just pick this game up if you're interested.",

The multiplayer feature is easy to use and has lead to hours of enjoyment with my friends, testing out the Expert mode which also has its own unique gear for going through.

One, more mining run, one more boss, over and over again. That is this game.     Oh, and also you can become a bee-shooting wizard with jelly Dr. Octopus arms sooooo 10/10   ",

Once you get the basics you can go anywhere. Very easily mapped controls and extremely high skill cap. You can build beautifull things even in this 2d environment. An amazing sandbox game with So much content it takes hours to exprerience it all and so many ways to play. Great price as well. With friends or alone this is one of if not my most favorite game of all time.  ",

Im already waiting on the release of Otherworld, which I hope the Devs keep the passion and care they've poured into this game, ongoing into the next one.
