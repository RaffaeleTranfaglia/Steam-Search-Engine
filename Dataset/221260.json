The general atmosphere of the game is a blend of frenetic happiness with dark undertones, and it conveys that really well.  Otherwise... I mean I get that it's satirising consumer culture, mobile games with micro-transactions, and entertainment addiction... But in the end all you're doing is burning things, collecting coins, and burning more things. You're doing the things you're supposed to be laughing at.  As for the story being told, it never really resolves into anything that makes much sense; instead it's happy to drop hints here and there and pull at your heartstrings without substance.  What little gameplay is there is pretty refined - the burning effects and physics are fun to toy with. I think 'toy' is more fitting for this than 'game.'  Overall, I still recommend it because it's so well put together. And really, I want that soundtrack.",

(Sushi + Pufferfish)  Combinations can create funny effects in your fireplace. Between your burning fun you will get letters from your neighbor and other people. This is meant as story and is kinda interesting if you interprete it correct.  As further you go as crazier the items will be. Burn the universe!!!

            "review_text": "If Little Inferno was content to be merely a game about sticking a variety of different objects into a fireplace and watching them burn until reduced to ash, it would still be recommendable, as it's full of fun and inventive items to play with. However, the game goes beyond it's surface premise, offering up a critique of its very own genre and a potentially thought provoking story set in an often unsettling and sometimes outright scary world.  As the world gets colder and colder, The Tomorrow Corporation releases the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace, which you are a brand new owner of. In order to combat the frigid temperatures outside, you'll spend your days throwing everything from credit cards to televisions to robots (and much, much weirder things) into your fireplace. As you burn, unlocking new items from the 7 different catalogs, you'll interact with others through letters where most of the story is told.  While there are a large amount of items to unlock, and subsequently turn to ash, as well as “Combo” puzzles to solve, most of the focus of Little Inferno is on the setting and story. A story that, whether by authorial intent or not, is often vague and never very upfront with its intentions. This implicit style of storytelling allows the player to glean however much or little from the game as they want. Is the game really just about burning cool stuff? Or is it using an environmental message as a vessel to tell a deeper metaphorical tale? It's really up to you and how far you want dig into the game.  If that idea turns you off, and $10 seems too steep a price to satiate your inner pyromaniac, this may not be the game for you. For everyone else, whether for its impressive fire effects, its haunting soundtrack, or its intriguing story, Little Inferno is a game likely to stick with you well after you finish it.",

I've read that some people were disappointed, claiming that the game felt like it was missing something or lacking, but it's all in the eye of the beholder. I was perfectly pleased and fell in love with it. There's not a lot of challenge to it, if any, but there is a lot of beauty and discovery and fun for the curious who like to experiment. This is not a game for the people who crave constant action or stimulation. If anything, Little Inferno will soothe and calm you. There's something very relaxing about watching the objects burn, and the atmosphere has a very ambient feel despite wondering about the sinister intentions behind your Little Inferno Fireplace that was given to you by a big company, Tomorrow Corporation, that you know very little about. But the premise is that the world around you is freezing, and you have to keep burning things to stay warm and farther more, although it's unspoken, most likely to stay alive.  This game is often described as a 'Fireplace simulator,' but there's a little more to it than that. It has a plot with a few surprises with a twist that left me surprised and emotional. On top of that, watching things burn never grow tiring. In fact, they often burn with pizzazz. There are a lot of unexpected outcomes, from sounds, to special effects, to beautifully colored flames. You'll be excited to burn the next thing to see how it reacts.",

Just like World of Goo, the developers have taken amazingly addictive gameplay in which you throw toys and expired food into a fireplace and burn them to get money and stamps to order more; and threaded an intriguing story into it, almost imperceptibly. They force you to think, not just about what items to burn together to unlock combos, but about why you are doing what you are doing. This game is witty, engaging, satirical, and haunting in a way that creeps up on you. Absolutely brilliant.",

I can tell you from experience that the fire effect is even more beautiful than in real life. They must have Leonardo da Vinci working with them because fire is the most beautiful thing in the world and therefore is almost impossible to replicate. I guess the other stuff looks really good too but it’s impossible to make something look as good as fire. The story is really good. Any story with fire is good but this contains good story unrelated to fire which I thought was impossible. It has some message about the environment and how one day our earth might not be feeling so HOT. If the world gets to hot there might be nothing left to burn down and if it gets to cold there might not be enough heat to burn anything which is the reason we should care about our world.

The game consists of you buying new items from different catalogues and basically ..... burn them and receive more coins than you spent on the item. It can get repetitive at some point but in my case it really doesnt matter because i just continue on playing and playing until i eventually get bored. Here are the pros and cons.  Pros:  - There are no time trials or some sort of score system .. you just burn and burn until you get bored - Alot of items that you can burn. From a picture frame .... to a space shuttle XD. - The story is simple yet amazing and it makes you feel like your in the game because you receive letters from your neighbor and from the weather man that consist of fun and well writen dialogues. - When you finish the story you can still continue burning stuff without any barriers. - It has super meat boy in the form of a cardboard but out ...  - You can burn spam E-mails or even ad pop ups ... - Really trick combos than you can figure out   Cons:  - Some items take more than 2mins to arrive and it only takes about 10sec to burn - 4hr story maybe ?? - letters can be anoyying at a point - When you finish the game you just burn stuff or either do the story over again    In a small paragraph... even tough this game is short it is still one of the very best desgined indie game i ever played and also has a cute story XD so i would recommend this game to any indie lover.  9/10  ",

Never once in the game did it feel like I was just grinding through trying to get the most coins, the levels and objects were very fun to play with and getting all 99 combos was fun as hell.

Item design is excellent -- I love the screams from the school bus -- and the game's gradually unfolding story (told via snailmail letters) keeps you enthralled to the end. Little Inferno lacks the replayability of World of Goo, but it's an excellent experience on its own.",

How exciting.   The game starts to redeem itself in the last couple minutes, where the “gameplay” switches styles completely and the game makes its point, but by then it’s far too late.

The above description is accurate, all you're going to do is burn stuff over and over, and even if I tell you that different things burn differently and some explode or give random effects, the real hook of this game is that as you do, you're very slowly given hints as to some tragedy in the background. To me, that's almost more compelling than the pure gameplay itself. But, for those who don't give a ♥♥♥♥, there's plenty to do in finding combos from a list by burning objects together.

            "review_text": "Although I haven't finished this game yet, I realize from browsing the forums how controversial this game is, so I feel compelled to add my two cents.  If you're looking at this game because you want stunning gameplay, turn back now. If you recognize the simple gameplay and want it because 'LOL BURNING STUFF 10/10' then buy it, but realize you're missing the best part of the game.   The main complaint I see about this game is that it's 'simply burning stuff with no goal, and it gets repetitive.' This is halfway true. Yes, it gets repetitive. But the gameplay is not the main point of the game. Much like To The Moon, you don't play for the gameplay but rather for the story or ambience. If this doesn't suit you, then it's simply not the game for you.   That leads to the other complaint: 'There is no story' or 'The message is dumb and forced.' To this, I have to outright disagree. If you haven't heard this yet, the game is satire for time management games. (Crazy, right? It's not just burning stuff!) To those who think this message is just tacked on at the end (and maybe it is, I haven't actually seen the ending yet), it's actually carefully seeded throughout the game. Take Sugar Plumps for example. She's your slightly annoying neighbor who speaks like a ten year old who's learned how to text and illustrates the type of people who play these games. She bugs you about how much she loves the 'game' but wants some extra (useless) content for it. (Plus, she bugs you to send her items, which kind of reminds me of the stupid Candy Crush feature.) Then there's Miss Nancy, who tells you you're 'doing so well' when you really haven't done anything.   Besides the hidden themes, the developers masterfully created an atmosphere that should grab you right from the title screen. The art style, soundtrack, and allusions to a decaying world outside work together to create a unique feeling of interest. Also, this game was co-developed by Kyle Gabler, maker of World of Goo (if you couldn't tell by the art style). Much like World of Goo, he succeeded in creating that maelstrom of emotions- you're amused by the burning, but perplexed about why you're doing it, intrigued by the underlying story, apalled by the screaming toys, and sometimes outright horrified by *certain* events (no spoilers). Seriously, just watch the trailer. Think about how the music contrasts with the images to make you wonder how you really should be feeling. How many times have you seen that in a game?  But to be honest, the game does get annoying in its criticism-by-imitation. The game makes you wait ridiculously long times to receive your items, or use in-game items to quicken this process (sound familiar?). While this certainly adds to its idea, it makes the game annoying to play through. And honestly, it's way overpriced at normal price, though luckily this is Steam and we get great deals all the time. So if you're thinking about buying it, it really comes down to your personal preferences. If you appreciate games that are unique and sacrifice gameplay for experience, this is definitely worth trying.  My that's a big wall of text, but I had too much to say. I'll update this review when I actually finish the game.",

You wouldn't believe you'd spend so much time doing essentially the same thing for hours. I didn't! Every object is crafted carefully with detail. The art-style and the soundtrack set an atmosphere of dread and mystery while still keeping it lovely. The core mechanic (perhaps the only mechanic), while not being very appealing and tremendously repetitive, doesn't eclipse nor dulls out the other aspecs. Finally I would like to add that the title's greatest strength is in the message it tries to deliver.",

            "review_text": "For the record, I played this for just over an hour and got 4 catalogues in before getting tired of the issue detailed below.  Overall this game just doesn't hold up. While playing it I considered that as a 'free to play' it might be acceptable... but the more I played the more I realized that even then it's a game that's more irritating than fun. I play AdVenture Capitalist and Clicker Heroes and Swarm Warp, and those are all terrific examples of free to play time eating games. The thing about each of them is, I can get involved, or I can walk away and let them run and stuff keeps happening in the background. But this game... this game unfortunately both requires your attention for things to progress, but also has what I feel is a completely unnecessary imposed time limit on its item orders. I'm not sure why that felt like a necessary addition in a game this simple and straightforward.   To begin with the positive, I like the design, it's very nice, and there's an interesting little story development with the neighbor - and this is a case where the game introduces a time-eating element that actually works - the letters reveal very little at a time, but it's not irritating, because you're still getting something out of it (letters, items, mild amusement at the letters - if you've ever watched Tiny Toons, don't be surprised if you find yourself reading her letters in Elmyra Duff's voice). There are also some fun animations with the burnings - I especially liked the marshmallows and the opera singer. And the idea of combinations is fun. Unfortunately all of that was just 'mildly entertaining' and therefore not enough to overcome the rising irritation of waiting to continue playing.  So, the negative: picture sitting at your computer for an hour with several episodes of 'okay, now stare at the screen for 2 minutes', that's what this game is. As someone else pointed out in a positive review, it's not enough time to do something else, but it's enough time to be annoying as you stare at the screen waiting for anywhere between a few seconds and 2 minutes to pass for *each order* so you can burn something else - it gets more annoying the more combos you're looking for, especially with a limit of 4-ish items at once, which can be *slowly* expanded by spending money for more slots. But you can only buy one.... slot....at...a...time. Everything about that just seems like 'we don't feel like our game's long enough to ask for money for it' but honestly the time wasting elements are exactly what make me not recommend this game. Earning slots and new catalogues would both be acceptable, without that added time on each and every package you order (and letter/weather forecast/etc you get).  If this game ever gets rid of the time limit, I would absolutely pick it up again and recommend it as a fun casual game.",

And things don't just burn; some of them move, or spit out other items, or explode, or any number of actions, all powered by a polished physics engine. It really is a joy to play with!  Also, Little Inferno has the same whimsical, borderline-grotesque art style as World of Goo--not to mention the same satirical edge!  Unfortunately, the game is kind of short. You can probably play through it in a day, maybe two. There are various 'combos' to hunt down, but as far as I can tell there isn't much benefit to being completionist; unfortunately again, there are no achievements. Also, after the 'main story' there's an ending sequence that sort of goes on too long. In my opinion, it's just gilding the lily.  Even with its flaws, though, I'm glad someone actually followed their vision and created this crazy thing. There are definitely a few 'WTF?' moments that make it worthwhile! ",

What impresses me so much with this is that the physics of burning stuff is done quite well, and there's something satisfying just watching stuff burn (as there should be) and that alone was fun to play with for a while.  The next level is the combo system, whereby you get some extra perks by burning certain objects together. For the most part, these can be figured out with a bit of thinking, although there's a few of them that I think are not 'good' solutions. Or at least, I think there's more sensible solutions to it. There's 99 combos, and I'd say about 2/3rds can be gotten relatively easily, but the last few can be really tricky.  On the final level, there's a sort of plot-based undercurrent in here that I think is really interesting initially, but ultimately unsatisfying. It is sorta similar to how World of Goo had a similar plot that is introduced very subtly. I really wish that the plot had been a bit more fleshed out, I get hints of a larger message it was meant to lead to, but it feels indecisive about it.  Overall, the game's a fun 4-5 hours and I think there's a good sense of humour to it. There's some forced waiting in the game that I think could've been reduced so that late game was less tedious at points (particularly when trying to figure out combos). That said, unlike World of Goo, there really isn't replay value, unless you enjoy watching the fire. There's nothing to go back and try to earn once you have figured out all the combos so I do think it's important to know that buying this game is buying a 4-5 hour experience and not much more than that.",

Once you buy one, you have to wait X amount of time. The more expensive it is, the longer you have to wait to buy it again. This is annoying when you are trying to figure out a specific combination of items to explode together.   Aside from that, its a pretty fun game and I recommend it.  ",

Beyond that I have also finished the story which is very subtle but has a very deep ending that had me feeling very emotional.  The only flaws so far that I have seen with the game is that there are no options meaning you need to adjust the volume from the volume mixer, however the polish is very evident and because of that it is an incredibly enjoyable game and one that I would recommend to anyone who would like a simple yet neat game which is very relaxing and very fun.",

IF YOU READ ON CERTAIN PARTS OF LITTLE INFERNO MAY BE SPOILED. SPOILER ALERT. Throughout Little Inferno I've had a blast. Only when Sugar Plumps (a background character) seemingly died in a house fire did I first question what I was doing and realise some of it seemed wrong. Later in the story you see Sugar Plumps never died in the fire, she escaped and has lived free for years and years, whilst you've spent your entire life sitting behind your Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace burning stuff. It makes you feel things and question things. THE SPOILERS HAVE STOPPED NOW. Never have I ever played a game this simplistic, yet this emotional. Little Inferno is an amazing and emotional game.

I havent played it in forever but I remember spending a good while on it and did see I have a remarkable 5.7 hours on a game Im shocked I invested so much time on. As someone who has invested over 3,000 hours in TF2, you should be worried that 5.7 hours seems like a lot to me for this game. But here is why I recommend it: I spent 5.7 hours on it and dont regret it. I also got it in a humbe bundle so I didnt invest the 10 bucks on it, but I would say that if you can get it on a good sale it will make a good pass-time. The simple experimenting of combinations is enjoyable enough and the passive story-telling all the while makes the story more... sincere? It just makes the perspective feel more relatable, and there is a satisfaction in discovering the resolution.  If youve played World of Goo, Id say this game is a little less gameplay and a little more story than Goo, which isnt entirely a bad thing. Id never spend 10 bucks on it (I tend to be fairly frugal), but like I said, if youve got a sale (or humble bundle) its pleasant.   All in all, if you don't think youll like something with such unengaging gameplay, youre probably right. If you do, you will. And Im not saying youll only like it if you know youll like it. If youre not sure if it would be a hit or a miss for you, theres a fair chance on the hit.   I almost never write reviews, but I was looking through the reviews of a person who writes really well-written reviews and found his review on this game, not recommending it.

Does tha- Am I a- I'm the cause of this worldwide blaze!? Oh my. It wasn't me, Officer.   Anyway, let's be real. This game is honestly beautiful. I mean, I'm no pyromaniac myself, but the detail is gorgeous, and it's somewhat good for stress relief being able to upload your own images onto things to burn, so you can burn the petty people in your life! It's a somewhat long but short story, depending on how much stuff you like to burn. Otherwise, you ca choose to finish it in multiple playthroughs and enjoy your psychopathic tendencies of arson and such!",

You get mail from your weird neighbor and the weather man and some weird lady. I can't give anything important away so that's all I can really say. When you purchase the game you also get its music in the Music section on steam. The game has a surprising amount of story to it and as you burn things more of the story will come. It's a cool game but you'll go through it relatively quickly I beat the game in 2hrs. So just know that you beat it quickly but you can still burn things at the end of the game if you want. :)",
