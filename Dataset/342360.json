            "review_text": "Train of Afterlife is a very thought provoking VN that explores one of the possibilities of what the afterlife could be like through the form of playing as someone that has lost their memories and finds themselves on a train leading to destinations unknown. Along the way you meet other passengers that are also going on their own journeys of discovery trying to figure out their past lives and who they once were. Even though the entire game takes place within the setting of the train it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game and I replayed it quite a few times.  This is my second time playing a VN from this developer and once again they have created an amazing atmospheric setting that creates the perfect mix of the unknown and curiosity as you try to figure out who you really are, why you can't remember your past and the reasons why you are on the train to start with.  I can definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good story that has wonderful art, music and by the end of it makes you sit back and really think. ",

            "review_text": "I'll admit I like to play visual novels, and I'm always hyped because the characters look neat in one, or I like this other one's style. But if there's no actual interaction, I just can't stay engaged. I hate to admit it, but I've passed up some wonderful VNs because they're.. basically a movie. I'm not a movie person; I get antsy, and outright bored. This VN, though.. Has a ton of interaction. Constantly keeping me engaged, thinking about what's going on.  I love it.  Train of Afterlife starts you off as somebody who has passed away, and no longer has memories of their living moments. You board a train, and meet very real characters throughout the course of it. Real, in the sense, that they're relatable. You feel like you could actually meet these people; they're wonderfully-written.  This game had some of the most profound, thought-provoking things to say, sometimes seemingly out of nowhere. The entire atmosphere of the train can be wonderfully calming, or uncomfortably eerie, and it all depends on you, the player. Not the choices you make as the character, but how you actually interpret it. Things may seem one way or another, and it's all based on your perspective.  With nine endings in total to go through, I'm going to say this: It's not going to make sense after your first playthrough. You will be utterly confused, curious. With plenty of forking paths in conversations, you won't see every possible conversation outcome in one game.   If you're big on the game looking nice art-wise, just take a look through the store's screenshots. You've got nothing to lose. I, personally, am a big fan of it. It matches the game's style of being peaceful or creepy; however you'd like to view it. The music, in general, is very pretty. It fits the scenes well, and more than once I found myself sitting in one area and listening to the track over and over.   Tl;dr This game is beautifully written, engaging, and utterly profound in its own sense. The art is appealing, the music is nice, and it's got tons of replay value. I'd suggest to not look up screenshots outside of the store page, just so you don't spoil anything for yourself if you plan on playing it.",

            "review_text": "Interesting character study and original premise, somewhat hampered by the developers trying to put in as many endings as possible to pad out the game time. While having to replay the game to collect more pieces and figure out the mystery is not a bad idea, it'll make it a lot harder to look past the somewhat clunky interface, the illusion of interactivity and dreary music while retaining an interest in the story if you go through the same bits up to 9 times. At the beginning I was genuinely intrigued, by the end it was a tedious chore and I wanted it over with.I still enjoyed what I got in the end but it was a hard road getting there.  Still, it's unique and thought-provoking enough to at least give it a shot, though waiting for a sale is recommended; one playthough takes an hour even while exploring all text options.",

            "review_text": "Pros: - Atmosphere. Be it calm or horror, Train of Afterlife knows how to evoke it.  - Strong soundtrack and minimalistic, effective artwork - The story, while not exactly the most complex one, is well told. Strikes a good balance between showing and telling.  - Everything ties together in the true ending  Cons: - Repetition. The story doesn’t change a lot in the different playthroughs. - Certain endings are more effective than others.  I would recommend Train of Afterlife for its atmosphere and storytelling. However, if you value length or dislike rereading/skipping, then it may not be for you. Train of Afterlife probably has more in common with experimental short stories than it does with the typical video game.",
