            "review_text": " The sequel, and basically the same game as Amazing Adventures Around the World: The Lost Tomb. Except now you don't get a multiplier from finding objects quickly so it defeats the purpose of finding items in groups so just click any damn item you see once you do. Also, instead of finding the golden scarab per new map, you find 2 gems (either physical or text) per map, and the maps are now different from around the world unlike the tomb setting before. When you play all 20ish maps you've only completed 6 out of 20 levels!? THEN YOU START THE OLD MAPS ALL OVER AGAIN!? That's what made me quit the first game and this one too, the objects don't change in the levels so it gets boring. There's also new mini-games like the classic word search, which you're able to pause the game and still look at the list and the game to find the words without the timer going down... The soundtrack is different and pretty decent, although sometimes it sounds like someone is farting purposely in the game.... Anyways, decent game for when you're bored and love iSpy!  7/10",

            "review_text": "I love hidden object find-it games, but this series by Popcap is terrible.  Popcap have their fair share of fun games, but these are definitely not up there. The music for me is just irritating. It’s painful to listen to, it’s very repetitive and all sounds the same. It’s all in a low tone, and honesty I have to say it barely passes for music. Nor background ambience for that matter. It’s a horrible mixture of both I suppose. I turnt all the settings down so I don’t have to listen to it, but no audio at all makes it even more boring than it already is, so I played my own music in the background. Just to try and make the game a tad bit more bearable.  The gameplay is fairly repetitive, you play the same 5 scenes over and over and over again, and it feels as if it goes on forever. To complete, it’s way too long. Or at least felt that way. It just felt like a chore to complete. I made myself finish it because usually I want to finish games I’ve started before I can move on.(anyone that knows me will know my illogical OCD-tendencies when it comes to my steam library). Like most games, it felt so good to finish, but not in a satisfying way. Where you finish, reflect on the game and feel good about it. In a way that just made me so happy that I would never have to go near this game ever again. If you enjoy hidden object games, don't buy these. There are much better ones you can buy. The 'Midnight Mysteries' and “Samantha Swift” series were good in my opinion. I played through them quite easily. They actually have a story and is a lot more engaging. The time it took me to complete those series of games, was probably the same amount of time I spent dragging myself through this game.",
