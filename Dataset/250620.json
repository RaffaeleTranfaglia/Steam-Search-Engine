What makes it really sad is the fact you see it from the point of view of the child. As you progress more is revealed as to what is happening, and how a childs mind may interperet and try to block out these things. It just goes to show that children really are innocent.  As for price, a bit expensive with little replay value, maybe wait for a sale or bundle if you are unsure on it :)",

The game is extremely short (as of writing this, I have beaten the game, but not even played it long enough for a single card drop), and fairly predictable. Plus, there was no real sense of urgency. It wasn't even until near the very end of the game that I even knew you could get a game over. The atmosphere is more nonsensical than spooky. And the concept of playing as a toddler is lost rather quickly when you're solving puzzles, rather than picking up the toy plane and shoving it in your mouth.  The underlying idea, of trying to piece together what could be a rather mundane occurrence, as seen through the warp of a child that does not understand what's going on, is a highly interesting one. The execution here doesn't quite pull it off.  It doesn't do a terrible job of it, and there's plenty for people to like. I'm just not one of those people.  On a more technical side, the game qualifies for an 'auto fail' for me in that I cannot change the movement controls to arrows. Fortunately, I was able to play the game with an Xbox 360 controller, but being left handed, I cannot use a standard WASD setup. Nor can anyone with a different keyboard layout. Preventing us from rebinding movement controls in game is something that no PC game should do.",

            "review_text": "Is this game good, no, is this game terrible, no, but this game is truly brilliant, every noise and every moment has you looking back to see what was the cause of the noise, it truly is terrifying and yet so immersive, I have yet to see an overused mechanic or protagonist, to be honest, can you name another game where you play as a 2 year old Toddler? I know for sure I can't think of one...  With that said, I found that the audio queues seemed a little too loud, I could here the monster coming from a mile away, the Teddy seemed a little useless to me and only seemed to fit a narrative point of view, voice acting was really good and did not get old and tiresome, the start however seemed to drag a little, especially with the Teddy asking what everything is, he seemed to just stop his dialogue and wait a few seconds before proceeding to talk.  Now with above all taken care of, how are the main mechanics of the game?, they are solid and work really well, you really get the feeling that you are a scared and defenseless Toddler, you clumsely walk through the terrain like a Toddler would and if you run for too long, he loses breath and falls over, the scenery is beautiful, even when it's dark Among The Sleep still manage to make it look stunning, the atmosphere is creepy, with doors creeking, glasses breaking, footsteps lightly walking behind you and the mothers voice in the background all seem to add it's own sense of creepyness, the Monsters scream is terrifying when you least expect it and it has it's quiet points to add to the tension of if and when the monster apears to devour your innocent 2 year old soul, I was scared of every inch of the game, though it may not be the scariest of horrors, but it's the only one that kept me on the edge of my seat right through, you get the feeling of accomplishment, only to realize that you still have to get back and place the piece and continue onwards, however the monster is predictable but not in a way that ruins the experience, I personally don't think the monster is the main experience, the universe is stunning, it's like a gothic picture that has come to life, it's frighteningly beautiful and atmospherically superb.  Now you may ask,  'Is it worth $19.99/£14.99?'  Yes it is, it's a stunning piece of artwork and the devs have truly done a great job with Among The Sleep and it has great potential to further what it already has acheived, with atmospherically stunning visuals and great progression, you are never left thinking that you have seen this before, buy it and see for yourself, I guarentee that you won't be dissapointed at all.  I would personally rate this 9 out 10, there is a few issues here and there, but none that I have found to be game breaking or none that take away from the immersion that Among The Sleep gives you.  I hope this has helped you to choose whether or not this game is worth your time and money and I can't wait to see what Krillbite have to offer in their bright looking future.

            "review_text": "I'm going to review this one a tad prematurely; that is to say, in spite of having only played what I believe constitutes about the first two-thirds of the game (as this is the third - count 'em! - recently-released horror game or DLC I've bought which my three year-old, piece-of-♥♥♥♥ laptop seemingly can't handle, technologically-speaking...thankfully, a new computer is on the horizon). I feel pretty confident in opining, however, that if you like the sound of this game's basic premise - in short, Amnesia-style horror from the perspective of a two-year old toddler - this isn't liable to disappoint. Unless you're one of the 'this game it too short' brigade, in which case you probably should have learned not to buy these sorta games by now, especially at or near full-price.    It's slow to build, and a LOOOOONG time before you encounter any true 'danger' within the game, but when that moment comes in which you realise that, yes, the spooky creatures you've been safely spotting from afar ARE actually interested in moving in for a closer look, it's every bit as legitimately pants-browning as the best horror games you've ever played. What's more, the 'child-like' perspective, while not fully reinventing the wheel, does put quite a different spin on well-worn first-person adventure gaming themes; for example, where other games would require your character to push a crate up against a wall in order to access a high vent, in this one your toddler has to pull a kitchen chair up just to reach a regular-height surburban door handle! Everything feels quite dauntingly HUGE to our diminutive hero, making it feel not unlike Alice trapped in a nightmare Wonderland (one in which she never managed to find the antidote to the shrinking potion)!    It's super-spooky, super-imaginative, has amazingly atmospheric sound design, and your best friend/sole ally is a talking teddy-bear! So what are you waiting for? Unless the answer is 'a better computer', you really don't have any excuse...unless you're a complete wuss, of course. C'mon, are you really so much of a wuss that you're not willing to brave the same horrors as a TWO YEAR-OLD KID?! Teddy's waiting for you...  Verdict: 9/10.",

A couple of times I received those goose bumps; you normally wouldn't say it, but a good thing :) I'm really a satisfied horror addict and must say that I enjoyed all 6 hours long.  I saw that only 32,8% of all players completed the game...  EDIT: wonderful DLC 'Prologue' which worked totally immersive for me. Maybe 'the ending before the beginning' is a bit sad... EDIT2: the giant update with for example 6 new achievements: most of the drawings could be found well enough, searching carefully and for an extended amount of time, but in 1 chapter (I won't mention it), they were hard to find. Especially when taking into account the advised gamma setting (I played on); I liked playing that dark, but f you want to collect all the drawings, the gamma level must be considered too dark sometimes. I wouldn't have spent so much time if I played in a lighter world, which I wouldn't have liked.  PScore: 9/10",

Since you are not so tall, (For being a child.) you have to move things around to climb, walk, and get past. You have the abilities as of a small child, which hold you back at doing things like you would in most horror games. Which makes this game all the more realistic. Though I did encounter a few problems, which I shall list:  - When the 'infinte' drawer goes through the first hole, it hits the box and then gets stuck inside the wall. Making it so it can't move. (Which has been fixed now. Thankfully! ^.^ ) - When I tried to go back to another chapter, the game would crash and I would have to keep trying until It did it without problems. - The game sometimes froze in the menu. In-game, however, I had no issues whatsoever. - At one point, during the part with the second Merry go round, I picked up the bird staue, and it doesnt move. I had to restart from the last checkpoint, which was quite a ways back.  Other than the listed bugs I found, the game is absolutely perfect. Because of the bugs, I give it a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "First off, I want to say that I kind of feel bad giving this game a thumbs down for its review. I wish there was a more dynamic grading scale than yes/no.  That being said, my biggest complaint is that this game essentially puts all of its eggs in one basket. The one point in which this game really excels is its visual effects. This game does an amazing job of not only providing a creepy horror environment, but it also really gives you a feeling of how an imaginative child may picture the world around him. Especially a child with a morbid imagination. It may not be as perturbing as Silent Hill's blood, rust and isolating fog, but the abyss surrounding the playground and the overgrown nature of the library really helps give the player a feeling of uncertainty and vulnerability. In other games the abyss would be viewed as 'I guess they put an invisible wall there, 'cause the objective's over that way.' but this game is in a unique position to utilize the idea of object permanence; even if the comparison wasn't intentional.  Unfortunately, while I could feasibly recommend playing the game simply for the visual experience, the gameplay and storyline are not on the same level of expertise. The gameplay is not really challenging at all. There's no real danger of being seen or anything just as long as you crawl under something. Even if it's a doorway or a table almost as tall as the monster pursuing the player. I had plenty of times where I was standing in a cupboard, inches away from a pursuing monster who, simply, stood in the doorway until he just...disappeared. As immersive as the environment was, it almost got less interesting once the monsters started showing up... As far as the plot is concerned, the whole game pretty much all builds up to the opening of the sealed portal at the end of the game. There's no real plot advancement outside of progressing from one level to the next until right before the door is opened and the (plot twist?) ending is revealed. It...felt like it was SUPPOSED to be a plot twist, but with the child's drawings littering each level it's not too hard to figure out exactly what's happening. [I'll omit mention of the less obvious hints mentioned in later levels for potential spoiler reasons...although idk if it's worth not spoiling given how telegraphed the ending was.]  Overall, my main reason for down voting this game comes down to the price. If it wasn't $20, I would still recommend a purchase for the sake of getting to immerse yourself in the environment (if you're the type of person who can appreciate that stuff). $5 is definitely a reasonable price for this game, but given the lackluster story and...(I apologise in advance) gameplay that will count you AMONG THE SLEEP (ha HAAAAA! Zing!) I'd have to admit that most people would probably find purchasing this game for $20 to be rather disappointing.",

Whilst there are some well done / clever moments and the designer did a great job of making the change of perspective into something that was a little overwhelming and scary, the experience was more of a walking (crawling?) simulator with a rather overblown story.   For a horror, it was more creepy than scary and the 'monsters' were very much more of an irritant that something to fear. This was partly due to the poor AI presenting very little challenge, but also grinding visual and audio effects that made me want to go brew a cuppa whilst I waited for them to pass.  Similarly, puzzles were unchallenging - pretty much 'pull this to free this' and 'move this then jump on it', wrapped up in fetch quests. Not that other horror games don't do unchallenging, but Among the Sleep isn't distracting you with the anticipation of terrifying things happening. There are plenty of pretty bits, some very nice  alice  moments and the aforementioned change of perspective, but it's just not enough. Not at fifteen quid a go.",

It's good and there's a lot to like about the short time you'll spend in this world, but there's also an aftertaste of 'it could have been better' that lingers as the credits roll.   The game design and atmosphere are what really make this a recommended game. I really liked that the controls actually bring life to the idea that you're playing as an infant. Run too long and you fall into a crawl.... the bobbled, bow legged walk. These are all great details that helped immerse me into the world. I actually had an unnerving sense of nostalgia when crawling between coats and dresses in the endless expanses of closets. Remember how big closets used to seem when hiding in them?  I guess my biggest dissapointment was that due to the short amount of time and focus on the game itself, that I really wish I was able to care more about the characters. Maybe that plays into being an infant and not picking up on these things, but it felt like an afterthought. Obviously, Teddy is the only character you really have the chance to connect with and he always felt so artificial that it gave me that 'uncanny valley' uneasiness rather than the feeling of comfort he was supposed to provide the player.   Regardless, this was a well crafted experience and I can't find a reason to tell anyone not to play it. The price tag is pretty steep at the moment. In the end, I always equate it to 'was the experience worth the price of admission' which is completely subjected to my own opinion. In this case, not for me. It's a game I enjoyed, but I won't likely bring it up in conversations or think about it too much after my playthrough.   I am excited to see what the developers do in the future.",

I don't have a problem with this conceit since I have no desire to see these kinds of things but the result here is that there is nothing at stake in the game.

The environments are well-crafted - a surreal mix of mundane, dramatic, and imaginatively fantastic. I spent between 4 and 5 hours exploring the main story and the prologue, and would invite you to do the same.

Perhaps you all saw that Kickstarter video where it seemed like a stealth game with high amounts of interactivity in its environment with a dense sense of climbable objects and places to hide? Well, guess what. It's not.   In fact, nothing is particularly done well here. Any 'horror' done in this game consists of only 10 mins of game time hiding from a swamp monster and a coat. Which was all done better in Penumbra and Amnesia anyway. Because even IN THIS GAME any sense of challenge flies out the window when you even the game over screen and are sent RIGHT BACK to a checkpoint with all progress still in. As in any items you got or objects moved etc. are still in the same place. There's no real puzzles. Not a single moment that sticks out. Everything was already done BETTER in other horror games. Even the innovation of being a two year old child falls flat on its face with terrible execution.  The sound effects are particularly dreadful. The quality ranges from well done to something from a DOS game. You'll get random whistle noises that cut off abruptly. Monster sound effects that sound like they came out of a really bad TMNT cartoon, bottles that sound like bell chimes, and even no sound effects at all! REALLY! You can drop soap and you won't even hear a single thud!  As far as the story goes. It's the bare ♥♥♥♥ing minimum for being 'subtle'. A child is being taken away from a drunk parent? It's not like this was easily foreshadowed by the swamp monster 30 minutes in the game. The characters never develop. The incredibly forgettable teddy bear doesn't have a personality. Yet the game tries its hardest to make you FEEL bad for him later. Which you won't feel anything at all because he was merely around to babysit the player and destroy whatever atmosphere the game had.  The visuals are pretty nice I guess. Each section in the game has its own sense of aesthetics and the scale of being a two year old toddler is well replicated.",

First off, the game has spectacular sound design. There's always something going on in the world and you're kept on your toes at all times. Secondly, Krillbite really nailed the perspective of a child, gameplay wise and design wise. You feel helpless and you really feel like a child in the sick twisted places that the game has to offer. Also the controls are fluid and simple, the way it should be. The negatives are that the puzzles aren't really anything to write home about, with simplistic 'find item and use item' puzzles, that could've been shaken up a bit to make them more interesting and diverse. Another thing is that the game is rather short, with an average playthrough probably taking about 2-2,5 hours to complete. It really leaves you wanting more and with a premise like this, you would've expected a little more from it. Not to mention the ending, which felt rushed and was ultimately very disappointing. The price is a bit hefty for such a short game, so it's up to you to decide whether or not this game is worth your time and investment.

Nothing).   It is still bizarre why I lag only on chapter four whereas any other part of the game plays smoothly and on high res graphics.   This game simply isn't the horror experiance you think it is.   I'm sticking with my 2/10 rating.  Though the concept held so much potential and the graphics not being too shabby; the bugs/lags, disappointing gameplay is what really killed it for me.

Sadly, the game remains an empty shell, lacking variety/difficulty/surprise, and therefore is barely able to excite. Thus, I don't recommend buying this game for the current full price of 15/20/20 £/€/$. If anyone, people who are interested in the setting should wait for a HumbeBundle deal and try their luck.  Just some of my impressions: - the atmosphere is OK but remains severely behind the full potential of the premise - the few scary moments aren't really scary and seem very artificial (and the 'shock' effect is really ugly) - the story can be summed up in a sentence and is nothing special. Nonetheless, towards the end I found myself thinking 'OK I'd like to know what happened now', but the ending is rather disappointing - game mechanics seem promising in the beginning but soon slide into tedium  - very short play-through time of ~2,5h with no replay value whatsoever - experienced a few glitches, clipping and texture errors",

It definitely has some spooky parts, but I wouldn't label it as horror.   PROS: Pretty visuals and a cool sidekick Teddy bear that helps you along the adventure.

First off, you play as a toddler, so your abilities and interactions are extemely limited, as you would expect. This works very well with this horror genre, as it truely does make you feel vulnerable. Also, because you are a toddler, you have a big imagination, and this is how the levels are designed. Sounds good, right? A childs imagination = endless possibilities for level design. However, it feels like the developers are no so experienced in level design, and are better versed in art. The levels are linear and the puzzles are too basic and simple. However, a counter-argument can be made that the puzzles are suppose to be easy because a toddler is suppose to be capable of solving them. Fair enough. The game also feels to be design to appease a broad audience, including the 'casual gamer', so its understandable that the levels are easy and the game short. The graphics are not amazing by any means, and doesn't feel optimized. Maxed out, the game often times dipped below 30 FPS on my GTX 780 rig. Thats completely unexceptable performance for a game of this graphical intergrity. All in all, I felt pretty disappointed in this game...Until the ending.  Without giving out any spoilers, the ending to this game, makes the game. It serves as a reminder that video games are an amazing medium for story telling. The ending had be stunned and a bit choked up, and makes you realize all the tiny details you missed out while playing the game, much like how the movie 'The Sixth Sense' did. The imaginative game is very symbolic and heartfelt.   I highly reccomend this game. For everyone, anyone. Even for those that don't play games often. The simple mechanics and controls makes this very possible.",

I loved this game, but it's far too short, and by that I mean really, really short. I managed to complete it in a measly two hours, and that, sadly is the biggest flaw of this game, considering the price.

I had expected there to be some fighting or kicking ♥♥♥, whichever you prefer, but there weren't any. I wanted there to be epic teddy bear transformations and bedroom weapons, but we can't all have what we want. There was a lot of hiding involved though and bottles. Boy, were there a lot of bottles. There were also jumpscares here and there, but they were okay. If you wanna know how scary it is, think of a really short rollercoaster ride. This game kind of struck me as a combination between Slender and the movie 'Mama'. You'll figure out why once you've tried it out.   The graphics and sounds were nice enough, but the story was something else altogether. Mind you, it was great and different, but it was no fairytale. I was able to put two and two together during the first chapter, but I wasn't able to figure out the whole story until the very end, even if there were lots of clues laid out throughout the game.

Even though I figured out everything by the second painting, I felt it did a good job getting the whole feel across from a young child's perspective.  The game isn't really scary, although it conveys the same sort of childhood 'spookiness' that a dark house and strange sounds bring. That is it's greatest strength, conveying a nightmare from a child's perspective -- full of strange places and monsters. This emersion is then quickly ruined by the addition of the damn teddy bear pulled out of some children's show who you HAVE to take with you and who ruins everything.  It controlls well, looks good, and conveys a feeling of helplessness that a two-year old child would have along with the potential havoc and trouble a two-year old can get into. At least, until the bear opens his stupid mouth again.  I can't state this enough, but the bear ruins the whole experience by talking. Listening to him suffer in the washing machine or trying to hang on to you is one thing; I hated him from the get-go but even I felt bad for him at those points. If they cut out his dialogue and just left him emotion he would have been an excellent companion, but as implemented he screams 'HELLO YOU ARE IN A GAME WITH TALKING BEAR WHO POINTS OUT THE OBVIOUS'.  The game is short, and it would have been a nice bit of art if everyone would learn to shut up. As is, I think some people will enjoy it a lot and ultimately what it does well it does well enough that I can forgive the rest.   This game is NOT for you if: 1. You are immune to childhood fears 2. You want a long game (I've logged 3 hrs and that includes taking the time to write swears in blocks) 3. You want a scary game (unless you are very vulnerable to childhood fears, in which case this is for you) 4. You hate physics puzzles  This game IS for you if: 1. You are vulnerable to childhood fears and like being haunted by them. 2. You enjoyed the demo (despite how badly the bear ruins the experirence) 3. You like 'artistic' game experiences and an interactive way of telling a story.  I'm personally in the middle, and would have recommended this stronger if the bear was mostly mute as well.",

It would be awesome if it had only been a reasonable length. £15 is an aweful lot to spend on maybe 1-2 hrs of a game. If I'd bothered to read other reviews and known about the short length before-hand I wouldn't have bought it right now, I would have saved buying it until I felt flush enough to spend that much on a couple hours fun. But hey-ho, it's done now. It was very effective at creating that eerie vibe, and I'd love to see it on the oculus rift just to see it and experience the game again from that perspective, I'd guess the added immersion could only enhance the experience. All in all Among the Sleep was worth buying just for that experience alone. The game aspect to it is not as developed as I personally would have liked, but the creators have made a game which is worth playing.

            "review_text": "Among the Sleep takes players on a journey through a nightmarish dreamworld concieved by a toddler's imagination, and molded by the disturbing issues he faces in real life. The concept is certainly fresh, but does the game itself hold up under scrutiny?  It's abundantly clear from the start that the developers of Among the Sleep have spent a lot of time carefully constructing the environments in this game. Many of the objects and locations are made up of very authentic-looking artifacts that you might see scattered around a toddler's room in real life. Some of them are used to frightening effect, such as removing the eyes from an otherwise adorable stuffed animal, or making the seemingly innocent drawings of a child take on a far more sinister meaning. All of these conscientious design choices come together quite effectively, and the atmosphere benefits greatly from it.  One of the biggest concerns I had for this game was if it could deliver true horror. The kind of horror that slowly and carefully builds into a suffocating climax of fear. Thankfully, I was not dissapointed. The game doesn't pull any punches, and although it takes some time at the beginning to establish the story, the rest of the game is a non-stop, exhilariting tour into darkness.   Well...for the most part.   The puzzles in the game are never demanding, and they don't really increase in difficulty much. Most of them involve collecting specific items or keys, and taking them to the correct location, which is all too easy considering how linear the game is. It's almost a nitpick, considering how frequently the game excels at building tension and fear through its various assets, but I would have appreciated a bit more complexity and origniality when it came to the actual gameplay.  At the end of the day, the biggest problem I had with this game was its length. Sure, its well-paced. It has great visuals, great voice-acting, great sound design...but if the game can be beaten in 2 hours or less, you're not getting much value for your money. I expect a little more content from a game thats list price is $20. Some might argue that all of that money is well-spent considering how much obvious love and effort was put into this game, and how amazing it turned out to be considering that it was created by a very small indie development team, but in my personal opinion, $20 is still too much to ask for such a short game, with so little replay value.   If you can get it on sale though, Among the Sleep is a very solid horror experience. If you've enjoyed games like Amnesia or Outlast, Among the Sleep will deliver more of the same great storytelling, audio design, and horror you've come to expect from those games, albeit on a much smaller scale.  7.5/10",

If you like games with deep meaning, which keeps you rethinking the ending again and again, well, I can recommend 'Among the Sleep' for you.  Developers literally put you into the child's body and more important: they put you into his mind.

There's a reason I don't play a lot of horror games. But I watched the rest of it on youtube and I gotta say, this game is absolutely genius. So many things to love about it, in terms of both narrative and gameplay. If you've ever been reading and come across something profound and your reaction is 'yes! someone else said it!', you'll have a lot of moments like that during this game if you think through the implications of what you're being shown.  The horror comes in two flavors: gentle suggestion of a threat that causes you to scare yourself via the power of imagination, and actual Slender-esque sequences that will result in a game over. We get the former exclusively for about the first 2/3rds of the game, and it works extremely well although it might wear out it's welcome if the player decides that the game is all bark and no bite. However, after a seemingly arbitrary point you will start dying, and it will seem random and arbitary, which is of course jarring as hell once you're good and tired of the game being harmless. My only issue with this is that you aren't given any indication that this change has happened, and the advice on how to deal with it came 20 or 30 minutes ago. Basically just try not to make noise since that's what usually causes the Groots to spawn, and if they spawn anyway just run.  All-around it's a genius game and I hope it gets some quality imitators. 10/10 would reccomend.",

The game focuses on exploration, puzzles and horror, seen from the perspective of a two year old toddler.  The game starts when the toddler is having his second birthday party at home with his mother when the party is interrupted by someone at the front door.  When the mother walks towards the front door, a man starts talking and a muffled conversation starts. Suddenly the mother raises her voice at the person at the front door.  The toddler is frightened by the angry tone from his mother and the blurred vision will come up, indicating the fear of the toddler. Then the mother returns quickly to the toddler with a present, a teddy bear but she doesn't tell from who the present is.  During the night you are awoken by a strange force that turns over your crib and Teddy is lost. At this point your are completely alone, you must look for help and your adventure starts.  During the game you are most of the time accompanied your teddy bear, Teddy and together you two start searching for comfort. Most of the time you are solving puzzles, navigating through the labyrinth of levels, dodging monsters and collecting memories of you mother to find her back again. When traveling through the dark areas you can hug Teddy who will temporary emit light that helps you navigate. You enter various dark and strange areas such as the interior of your house, expansive closets, the Gingerbread house, tunnels, an abandoned playground, forests, swamps etc.  When you are chased by monsters, you can hear them nearing by the increasing grating sounds and the more becoming blurry vision.  What I really liked about this game is the idea that you play as a two year old toddler but having a more developed brain/mind to solve these puzzles trough these surreal environments. If you like adventure horror games or just want to wander around as a two year old toddler (again), I really recommend this game to you, certainly when it is on sale! ",

All items used throughout the game are related to toys a young child would have - toy keys, shapes to fit inside a shape mold (squares, triangles, etc), among others.  I won't spoil the story, but I'll say it's certainly interesting and the Prologue (free DLC) expands on it, explaining the events before the main game.  Highly recommended.",
