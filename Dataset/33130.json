Three game modes (campaign, survival &amp; timed arenas) provide a small diversion from the obvious repetitive nature of gameplay.   Though dont expect anything but graphics that were acceptable in the 80s. There are no achievements &amp; no multiplayer to keep you playing this. However the game does have a certain base charm. If mowing down hordes with a shed load of weapons while never really getting challenged then this is a decent cheap game. Just dont expect anything too much.",

Alas, it wasn't actually too bad. Curiously, far and away the best piece of game design evident was the 'feedback' you got from killing zombies - a pleasant combination of audible and visual 'splatting' that made for rather satisfying gunplay. The variety of weapons and various other utilities was just wide enough to inject the game with that ever-pleasant feeling of progression we all know and love from Call of Duty, so it was a pretty fun distraction to play here, there and everywhere when I had 20 minutes to brutally murder.  A stellar example of a 7/10 game.",

Your screen will literally turn red from all the zombies you kill. Decent selection of devastating weapons with levelling up features on both your weapons and your character. The graphics are the biggest weakness and the camera angle sucks in certain spots, but the non-stop action keeps you too busy to notice. If this game was co-op, it would be off the hook. Alien Swarm should take some pointers from this game about how to put fun into killing zombies.",

It has smallish RPG elements (As you get points to increase stats that affects in the amount of ammo you can carry, how good you aim, etc), you can upgrade your weapons... and nothing more. Its just bang bang bang until you get to the slightly interesting final boss battle and the end. Not to mention the horrible collision detection and the awfuls (even for a Zombie Game) A.I.  Unless you are looking for some brain-dead (pun intended) fun, Zombie Shooter will be a waste of time and (looking at its current price tag) of money. If you are looking for some shooting, maybe this could be your game. Maybe not.  Got to say that I played the sequel some time ago and kinda of enjoyed it, even though it was the same, just a bit better.",

This started happening to me after I got to level four, which took me more than two hours, so now Steam won't even give me a refund. I tried to explain that the glitch started happening after two hours into it, and now on levels 1, 2, and 3 when I die the game shuts off, but they did not care. This was a huge waste of money.",

I am glad the developers remove those endless horde of enemies concept and put some objectives that can actually be achieved. The freaks finally have an end to them, albeit still damn freaking overwhelming. The sound is just as bad as the Alien shooter series and the music is repetitive. Play this if you are bored and just want to kill something, as it provides about 2 to 3 hours of reasonable fun.",

Survival mode is quite boring, you always get the same weapons and die at the same time when zombies star shooting at you from all directions. Turret mode is even more meaningless having only two weapons - turret itself and mini-nuke. So I recommend the campaign mode, but don't bother with the other two.",
