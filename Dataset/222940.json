            "review_text": "Good evening.  Playing King of Fighters 13 is more enjoyable than eating a grape-flavored popsicle on a scorching 200°F saturday afternoon. If you think I'm joking then try it out for yourself. Once you do, you'll quickly realize the errors of your ways, and that this is one of the best fighting games available.  Let me begin by saying that this fighter is not an easy one to learn. For those who aren't used to playing fighting games, special move inputs can be difficult, combos can be difficult, understanding what is even happening can be difficult. But the reward of learning this game and pulling off super saucy cream dream HD combos is vast and satisfying. It is a feeling that is similar to what we feel when we viciously chew on a crispy strip of bacon. I'm sure you all get what I'm saying.  The cast of characters is FANTASTIC. Most of the great KOF classics like Terry Bogard, K', Iori Yagami, and Ryo Sakazaki return, so long-time SNK fans will be pleased. The visuals are MAGNIFICIENT. They have chosen to stick with the 2-D sprite style which looks ultra sick nasty, and some of the special moves just look crazy godlike. Hitting opponents with the POWAH GEYSAH gives me one of the greatest feelings that a man could pursue. And don't even get me started on the musical greatness that KOF13 features. The characters, visuals, and music are all top-notch godlike, of this I can assure you.  I've played a decent amount of online matches and I am happy to say that it runs great. Even though I suck at this game and got my buttocks kicked in almost all my matches, lag had nothing to do with it and I had a jolly time mashing out attacks. If playing against others isn't your thing, then there are other modes like Time Attack, Survival, Story Mode, Arcade Mode, and color customization that can keep you busy for quite a while.  To conclude, if you aren't familiar with fighting games, then you may want to pass on KOF13. The learning curve is steep and you might quit once you find out that you suck at life. But for fighting game veterans this game is like a sacred treasure trove of award-winning, swedish barnacle balls just waiting to be devoured. Don't pass up on it or you will feel the wrath.  I give King of Fighters 13 a score of 'Back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest Champion'. Thank you for reading this review.",

(TERRY BOGARD FTW) -great fighting system. -possibility of changing one's favorite fighter's colours. -nice story, even though not the best one yet. (Geese saga is still the top one)  in the middle: -might be pretty hard at some points of the arcade. This can be a flaw or a strong point depending on the player (I consider it a strong point, personally). If you're having trouble getting over a certain stage the game offers you to give the CPU a malus or a bonus to your fighters. I found this to be a great idea, this way even new players can complete the story mode or the arcade mode without getting too frustrated.  cons: -I sincerely cannot think of anything.",

Then why do i say it's the ultimate? It's all about the gameplay. If you've ever played any KOF before, you know it's not a friendly game. But if you know how to play it, know the basic combos and the special moves, you can kick ♥♥♥ at any other game, for sure. When i get in the arcades and play SF (any version) i kick massive loads of butt, excepting when the pros come. Guilty gear? piece of cake. UMVC? are you kidding? heck, even in blazblue i've kicked ♥♥♥ with my first coin, and i barely know that game. I've just bought Skullgirls and i kick some ♥♥♥ there too, but not as much as the other games. So think, it's a game that's been refined for 13 times, its fast, has great combos, some of the best 2d art (the best in my opinion) and tunes you up for every other game. Even tekken lol. So, basically it's an unforgiving gameplay, the combos are HARD, but when you do them, specially online, man, you are on the top of the world.",

I miss fighting games that had color edits, like Darkstalkers 3, Capcom VS SNK 2, etc. Good to see a game keeping the tradition alive, even if you have to unlock additional color palettes through gameplay. The King of Fighters has always been one of those footsies based fighters, similar to Street Fighter, but now it has HD cancels which can allow you to extend your combos to get the most off your hit confirms. It's nice that not everything uses your super meter anymore, too.  Pros: HD cancels. Supers are as flashy as ever. Very smoothed 2D sprites. Secret characters to unlock (who else does that anymore?). Those of you with potatoes for computers can easily play this game.  Cons: I honestly can't really think of any, except that not enough people play it.",

This game plays great and feels good to play. A classic fighter series.   My few gripes: 1. It's recommended you use a gamepad or perhaps a stick. When using keyboard (like I do) it's a HUGE pain to rebind keys due to how they set it up (very stupidly. Took me like half an hour to figure it out how to rebind to regular keys instead of their very stupid default button layout) 2. YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK CHARACTERS. Granted there are only 2 to unlock, but this is not smashbros. Unlocking characters in a fighting game is gross. 3. The story is next to incomprehensible. I recommend ignoring it mostly. Story mode is weirdly confusing to navigate.",

I obtained this with a bunch of other games via a Humble Bundle purchase. It wasn't part of the reason I bought the bundle, but I figured I'd at least give every game a fair shot. This game provides 7 Steam Cards for playing it as well, which is nice.  However, grinding out those 7 cards was exceptionally painful. I only become 'passably familiar' with a single character over my entire time playing this game. When I say that, I mean it's difficult even to get past the first few stages in Training!  Now, it is true that this game when I first acquired it wouldn't recognize my controller at all. So, maybe it was insanely difficult to enter combinations due to it not properly supporting it or something along those lines. I can only comment on my experience.  As for the game itself, I quickly grew bored with the poorly-translated dialog which plays at the beginning of almost every fight. There was almost as much button mashing just to skip dialog as there is when playing the game! And despite the fact that they obviously made an effort to translate the game's text, there is absolutely no audio translation... which makes it very difficult to find any appeal for the characters unless you happen to speak the language. I'm assuming it is Japaneese, but that's only because I believe Japan is the largest game producer in Asia, so take that with a grain of salt.  After my compaints in the translation department, you also have the art style. It's obviously an anime-style fighting game. It's even complete with the horribly sexist character models you would come to expect. I remember one of the female characters they clearly put a lot of time into making sure her breasts 'jiggled' as much as possible. Maybe it was done mockingly or something, but all 'personality' of the character comes through in audio... which I couldn't understand!  Honestly, I do feel that there's quite a set of people who might enjoy this game, but it definitely wasn't for me. If there was a 'meh' option, I would choose that instead of 'not recommended,' but I don't have that option.",

I even had a hard time playing story mode after I resorted to cherry tapping tactics.

However, as game, this game is much cooler than the other PC fighting game, it has LOADs of chrachters, all COOL ones. And it has a style of its own, a 2d style, which looks excellent. This game also has a wide fan base, who are devoted to this game. The combo system is very indepth with a huge veraity and complecity of combos for each character, this game requires high skill and experience, and veteran players will own everyone new to the game.  I dont recopmand buying the game but because of the devoted fan base who play with each other trough steam friends i will give it a higher score, since there must something in this game to have such a devoted fan base. 6.5/10",

            "review_text": "KOF games story and functionality wise have often gone in waves. Every game brings a bit of a change up to the table, but collectively there's legs of the journey. One that's often come with an interesting story that waves just a bit sharper than most fighting game tittles of such background. Capcom still can't keep a major story of how Chun Li's father died. And to think SNK use to make this KOF collection of fighters from several of their games once every year.   With the Orochi Saga leg, Nests Saga, and whatever you might call the last stretch of games through KOF 11 where they stoped giving them numbers on years and just sequal numbers, I'm not sure if we're in a SAGA, or just progressing a story that through the tournament that Rugal's children now sponsor, seemingly not being evil, another faction that seems very evil is using it toward their ends in plots that could undo Mankind as we know it. And like Jedah from the ye old DarkStalkers franchise, they seem to be a kind of re occuring evil that can go back and try again until something in a timeline changes.  And the way they do this when all is said in done is smart as they find the best way to deal with a character many don't like that let's them finally leave the franchise, and yet also earns the character perhaps a bit more respect. Leave it to SNK to actually make a story that does some justice, and delivers a damn fine engine worthy of the tradition. It's not without a few flaws, but some of the likes come with tittles that look to recreate what they've been doing a bit.  The Cons:  The move lists are not to the hgiher counts like later in the Saga legs tittles like 98 or 2003 tended to bring, but much of the core moves known to characters are there and many with slight changes on their approaches to how they function.  @#$$ I still miss Terry Bogard's 'Power Dunk' move. I really #$%^ing do.  The Music is decent, but not sure I'd call it the great music styles that SNK got into back in it's earlier years that made you feel the character and situation all the further. It just lacks some of that catchy factor, but it's fitting.  If you're new to the franchise, it tells a story you can hop on right now and find some interest, but the real treat is in for people who do a little back searching into the rich story universe of SNK and how it's connected. Trust me the SNK universe is worth it, which is kind of a PRO if you're willing to do a little research.  BAD AND GOOD.  And finally I'm not sure I dig how the super bar is basically turned into two seperate bars. One is stockable and needed for your super specials, but to pull a NeoMax move, you need the top bar full too, or use that top power bar above the oragne to go into a powered up mode to so the neomax. But if you do you can in theory peform not only a special into a super special, but a Super Special into your NeoMax move. The things you can pull become a massive game changer.  When you pull some heavy hititng stuff in SNK, you know it, and you feel it. Sometimes on the recieving end you feel it a bit much, but otherwise it feels rewarding and creats it's sense of danger. But the multi bars turn it into feeling a bit more cumbersom in requirements than at first most may like.  THE VERY GOODS  Mai is back. Anyone who follows SNK will know what I'm talking about. No Mai no buy as they say.  The flash and flare is there and feels like it bellongs but makes for some good wow moments. In fact the all over 2D fighter package looks good and yet not disorienting.  Controls are good, yet not over the top forgiving. You get what you pull, and when you figure out what you're doing wrong and get it right, you're going to know it and do plenty better as a reward for doing it right, and it will stick with you if you play semi regularly.  Classic Yuri and King clothing malfunctions after special moves are back. Ask a veteran, or beat Yuri or King with a special move and up and you'll understand what I mean. Yes, it's necessairy.  Combos can be impressive, but you work for them, and chances are with the team three on three broken up matches they give you good oppertunity to turn things around, and the combos aren't super over the top to the level you should just put your controller down and die like Marvel vs Capcom 3.  Play Iori in both his forms without extra DLC cost.  A certain someone not only dies, they utterly get undone from the universe, and most of you will applaud how it's done.  The game simply looks as nice as it feels for someone to play, and you can get things done as a newer player or a veteran. With the way the team system works too, you really can pass the controller with a friend if you choose to team up and face the world online or the computer, or even local friends. Sometimes it dosn't need to be a tag match for it to be a good team endeavor.  Unlock colors by simply playing the game to customize the character palates for quite the different looks. Maybe even put yourself in the shoes of one of the many SNK characters you really relate too. There's characters for every kind of fighting fan, make a few your own. WRAP UP  It's a solid game, plenty worth it's 20 dollar price tag these days, and if you'd really like to see how KOF has evolved, the tripple pack here on STEAM basically gives you the total up game play of some of the past high points of the KOF franchise. If you watch a play through of the other years to get some story, then play the wrap up leg tittle for yourself, like playing 98 witch has the best of everything non story wise from 94 to 97, or watch what happens up till the next year available on STEAM and then play that one, it can be a rather rewarding experience. Or hell, hunt down the other tittles and play them if you can. But seriously, at least peek out the story universe of the other tittles and play the leg wrap up tittles so you can feel the story as you come to understand it, even the once hidden characters that were a part of the story unfolding.  With the STEAM tripple pack, you get those wrap up milestones of the series in a good final form, each one a bit different. Who knows, it may inspire you to look back into the depths of SNK and how the connections run deep, and get a piece of the fighting tradition that now and again in ways rivaled Capcom, a company that was very thrilled and supportive of it's fans.  PS: Beware those who hold liniage with the Orochi blood. Baddie characters and characters with just cause alike. Beware the Blood Riot. All part of a story universe you'll learn to respect.",

Pros: Controls are great, characters are balanced, line-up is large and extensive, the art is good.

With 3 basic ways to avoid attacks from your opponent(block, roll, blow back) you will experience very unique situations where the tide of battle can change at any moment. Though many say this is an execution heavy game, I feel it's a lot more forgiving then Street Fighter IV especially when linking normals into super moves. This gives the game a very gradual feel and rewards the player who takes the time to learn the more advanced techniques like HD combos.   While the verdict is still out on the internet connectivity, I've had a chance to play the beta and must say as a player coming from the xbox 360 version, the steam version definitely shows a vast improvement. I played a few matches with someone in Boston(I reside in Georgia) and they were smooth. I also felt like the input was very responsive which is something that was a big issue with the KOF netcode on console ver.  If you enjoy fighting games and have never experienced King of Fighters before I implore you to try XIII.

Start saving up for a PS3 or 360 to play KOFXIV because they did not say anything about a PC release yet. While you wait for the PC release if they even do one you may want to get USFIV and Skullgirls because those games have plenty of players and you may want to pre order Mortal Kombat X and Tekken 7 since those games look way better than this and Skullgirls looks better than this. Sprites are stiff compared to Skullgirls and Blazblue, music is meh compared to KOF94-2000, 2d stages look lifeless compared to Skullgirls and Blazblues, game has ridiculous input windows and inputs in general, and game is dead in the competetive scene since it didn't make it to EVO2K15 anyway. Get USFIV, MKX, DOA5LR, Skullgirls, Tekken 7, or maybe BBCPE if that comes to pc. All the other fighters like Injustice, MK9, Divekick,  BBCT,BBCSE,GGXX#R , and SFIV are outdated,dead and a waste of money.",

Now, while the story may palish in comparison to the Orochi and NESTS arcs, have no fear to purchase this game and play it until exhaustion. KOF XIII probably ranks among the top5 entries in a nearly 20-game top notch fighting saga, which is saying something. What does make KOFXIII rank so high when compared to his peers?  - Graphics: the newly-styled 2d sprite combined with effects makes for what's probably the most beautiful game in the entire KoF series. - Sound: good soundtrack, effects, and voice acting as usual. - Gameplay: now we are talking about the core of the game: fast-paced, skill intensive, rather easy to learn and not so easy to master, variety of characters, balance between them (which is something in a 30+ characters game)...few game can brag about that.  Overall, if you are into fighting games, this one is a must have. While I've only played 10hrs myself, there's enough replay value to keep you entertained for several tenths of hours. It's certainly a game to enjoy.  8/10",
