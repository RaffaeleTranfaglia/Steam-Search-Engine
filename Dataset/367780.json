            "review_text": "I really enjoy this game. being a big fan of retro games, this sparks some interesting takes on that oldschool feel. I like the challenge of timing in Aeros quest. it's a little slow to start, but once you get past the early tutorial levels you'll soon know what it means to be fast or die fast. Also no shortage of precision movement, like with air control. Dodging traps and missiles. powerups arent for the needy either! they are neccessary!  level 20 really had me going, and it begins the metroid style backtracking that really fine tunes your skills in this unforgiving platformer",

The only problem for the game is probably that it gets very addictive but only when you are deep into it. I personally love it and let's not forget that doesn't cost a lot! I rate it 4/5",

            "review_text": "Aero's Quest is one of these titles that the more you play it the more it gets better. The very fist impression might not be the best: everything looks fine but nothing really stands out. When you start playing it seems a very simple and generic platformer until the game starts to kick. The very first zone is just a tutorial and the second zone (a variation of the first forest) brings out more the platformer part rather than the puzzle part. When you get in the 3rd zone instead (the volcano) everything starts to change: you see new obstacles, the levels are not linear anymore and few more puzzles are coming out.  The game is a big 'crescendo' till the 5-6 zone (where I got so far) where puzzles and platforms are mixing in a great way. Aero's Quest is hard, very hard: one of the most challenging games of the year and it is long, very long: 101 levels to play in two different modes. I have to mention the sound: it's awesome! Every zone have its own music and they are all very good. If you pass the first 10 minutes and the first 20 deaths Aero's Quest can be really a big surprise.",

I found this game very addictive, I kind of like these games where you have few puzzles but the platformer side is still dominant (I liked Armed with wings for example). If this game was released in the 16bit era probably could have been a blockbuster. Unfortunately for Aero's Quest we are not anymore in the 90s so only a small niche of people will love it, and I'm part of this niche.  I added this game in the list of my  Top 5 Indie Game of this year .",

You will get some abilities to be able to pass the levels, and will need to take portal's or keys to progress on most of the levels. If you hit any enemy it is a death. The game is pretty easy on lower levels and it's progression is pretty good. It's better to play with a controller for a better character control.",
