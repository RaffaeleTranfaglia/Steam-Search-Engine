            "review_text": "Overall a great game with fun, interesting and rewarding gameplay. But, and here's the crucial part, Barely any replayability. Yea you can customise the towers to look slightly different, but thats it, apart from that you make the same building over and over again.  There's nothing driving you to make your tower the biggest it can be because once youve unlocked everything then all your doing is making money, to make more money.  in conclusion, it's a really fun game the first time you play, maybe even the second time. But after 10+ hours, you're just repeating yourself. Which is a shame because the game really is fun the first time you play.",

But at the moment I have a 15 floor building I have over $55000, and I make $7700 a day, I don't know what to do anymore just expand the tower(I've played up to the Engineer level.). I wouldn't say it get's outright boring, because if you've build a big tower there is allot to (micro) manage. But at the same time it does.   7.5/10 'Keeps you entertained and busy, but for how long?'  Pros: - Building a (complex) tower with the right balance so you make a profit and everyone's happy can be a challenge, especially if you just start the game. - Easy to learn. - You can delete floors in between so you can experiment and design your tower how you like, that's a big thing that makes me coming back and build a (new) tower.  Cons: - Can get kinda repetitive, once you've build a tower that works and you make over $5000 a day, there's not much left to do except keep expanding. Because you can't go broke or fail after that.",

            "review_text": "I'm enjoying this game very much. However, it's not without its flaws. First, some quibbles:  -No outright sandbox mode at this time. If you want to just experiment and play around with some creative ideas, you'll have to play the game regularly and unlock everything gradually.  -Seemingly minimal amount of traffic control. People enter from the left on the street. When you unlock the subway, you can finally get some people entering from the right.  -Time can feel slow. There is a 2x speed but, because money is earned at the beginning of each new day, you may find yourself sitting around and killing time more than you'd like.  -No global utilities indicators. Part of this game involves resource management. However, it can be difficult to realize you're not supplying the needed utilities unless the affected tenant is actually in view or you're inspecting the utilities themselves.  -Seemingly cannot destroy the original construction room, even after building a new one. This means that you are, to a certain extent, stuck with some original resources that are plopped down.  -Overlay uses gradients while everything is based on tiles. This can make it difficult to tell exactly where noise/smell ends, making it safe for tenants that do not like these.  -Constructing utility lines can be tedious, having to do it tile-by-tile from their respective closets. What'd I'd like to see is what was done in SimTower, where clicking on a point auto-builds to that location.  Despite all that, I love this game. It's a nice little chill game for those that remember Sim Tower fondly. Truth be told, I haven't actually cracked open a proper 'New Game' yet. I've primarily been having fun with the included Scenarios, objective-oriented lots where you have to, for example, build a great apartment complex. In addition, the contracts you can agree to provide short-term goals to work toward. If you're somebody like me with not a very expansive or creative imagination, both of these provide you guidance in designing your tower.  The aesthetic is pleasant. I'm not sure how to describe it. It's colorful and detailed, yet flat. It's kind of like watching an old flash cartoon. Beyond that, however, I absolutely love the ability to pick-and-choose what types of units I want in the building. Each broad category of unit can advertise for and retain different kinds of things, allowing you to pick between things such as an Italian or Mexican restaurant. Certain units also allow you to designate what is essentially the wealth level of its occupants, although they will require more services than a basic tenant. ALl of this allows you to have more control over creating a more vibrant environment.  Overall, I'm pleased and I look forward to plunking more hours into this game.  QUICK EDIT: I forgot to mention the modding options. This game, like many others, allows users to create items for the Steam Workshop. It's a neat feature that I hadn't fully expected, and I've already got an idea or two of my own for it. The developers even wrote up a few guides on how to create content for the Workshop and provided assets to assist in getting your idea into the game. It'll be interesting to see what sorts of things people crave for their tower.",

            "review_text": "I haven't written very many reviews but I feel this game deserves one.  All in all, I would say it's a solid Good. The lack of what seems like essential components is a little bit shocking but I would not say it is game breaking.  Pros: -Forgiving yet fun income to cost ratios -Ability to build absoulutely massive towers -Diverse requirments for different businesses and apartment styles -Nice art pieces for lobbies etc.  Cons: -After about 1/3 of the way through a tower, the maintenance and construction workers have a hard time managing the floor space and the limited number that you are allowed means a lot of waiting and micro managing a system that, once upgraded, is suppose to be automated (The ability to hire more would fix this). -Lack of ability to set priorities for construction A.I. (At one point the workers would go all the way to the top of the building, build 1 panel piece, then run all the way to the bottom of the building and build 1 panel piece, then run all the way to the top again. This little snag means you have to really plan what you're building due to A.I. limitations. The ability to hire more may fix this.) -Some of the building features you can stamp and some you have to grab each individual piece. This means a LOT (and I mean a LOT) of scrolling through menus to repeatedly build certain rooms. -The services seem a bit under powered. In my building (150 across above ground and 20 stories high, 180 across below ground to the bottom of the map), I had 2 underground floors dedicated to copy machines, 2 undergound floors dedicated to file storage, 2 underground floors dedicated to couriers, 1 underground floor dedicated to bottled water, 1 dedicated to security, 1 to janitors. and several half floors. And when I say an entire floor I mean as many offices as I could cram into the space. In the end it boils down to about 2-3 offices that require a service per office that provides that service.  Other than that though, the game is awesome. It's fun to get on and just kill some time and in my opinion, it was well worth the $20us I spent on it. Plus, it's good finger exercise.",

You make money. You try to make your tower prettier. Arguably, this is easier to do in this game than SimTower, because you have a few more tools in your box and a few less silly restrictions to work within.  It is a bit shallow. Even on top difficulty, it's fairly easy to maintain a positive cashflow. But honestly, so was SimTower. Once you got to the hotel stage, you were generally good to go. So really the only 'depth' that is missing here is elevator car management, which frankly I always found tedious and do not miss one bit.  I paid $15. I got $15 worth of fun out of it already. I'm still not done with it. Calling that a recommend. If you're on the fence, wait for the inevitible 50% sale.",

At first I thought I'd end up sitting around a lot waiting for the next day to tick over so I could get more cash, however after my building gets started I find I'm actually having to pause the game to take care of everything I want to do.   The only problem I've found is that spending a short time on it isn't possible. On the first day I spent something daft like 4 hours on my first building and ended up in bed a couple of hours late.

            "review_text": "The game is a lot like Sim Tower, though it has good ideas, there is a ton of micromanagement which hinder the overall fun factor; at least for me.  Wiring electricity, phone lines, cable lines, water pipes and gas pipes are all individually done, one-block at a time. So if you make a huge fortress sized building, you need to drag the mouse from one side of the screen, to the next, for one of the five. So let's say you make a forty story extra large sized map filled with a building. You are swiping across the screen 40 times high, 20 times for the basement left to right to cover your entire screen just for electrical. Then you need to do that for phone lines, and cable lines, and water pipes, and gas pipes; if you like your whole building to just have it all, like I do. Extremely tedious, and time consuming.  Next is cleaning the rooms of offices, restaurants and whatever other tenants that do not require janitorial services. You need to individually click each office, and click the little wrench to allow the room to be renovated. Let's say I have 180 offices; I have to click each office, click the little wrench on each office, and then choose to repair... each office... one at a time. There's zero management for this. No simple option to open up that allows this to be done in bulk, or done automatically. Another extremely time consuming task.   Your building starts off with 2 builders that walk around and build. They do the tasks you tell them to do in the order they receive them; besides renting space, when you rent space they do that, then go back to what they were doing. There's no way to make more of these. You can get a management team and it claims once you do that, that they do their job a lot more effeciently; I've yet to see this. I can't imagine a building that is 40 stories high with 20 floors of basemenet, thousands of people in and out per day that has only two people that clean the offices and renovate the rooms, and build the floors when you build them; and put together the offices etc.   As far as management controls; there are none. All you can do is look at some spread sheets that show your financial information, sign up for loans, do a few cash-rewarded quest-like assignments and add property inside your building like nobodies business to unlock the next structure, which requires more and more expectations than the previous.   The game was entertaining but after 2 hours of playtime the micromanagement is far too tedious than enjoyable. The time consumption to keep up with the individual click-style of the game, is ridiculous. Even laying floors down, or creating your building layout is 1-wall at a time. Drag it across the screen to create a floor; again, no quick way to do it. The options in the are minimal at best.   I almost think this game has less options than Sim Tower had. It is extremely basic, and the modding allowed in the gmae is 100% aesthetic; no ways to make the game functionality better, just designing offices or signs or whatever. The game feels very alpha; not release quality at all.   I'll be refunding this. $19.99 is too much to ask for something that feels so basic.",

I ran through 4 towers total, hoping I was missing something in the complexity of how ppl get around in the tower, or how service demands are met and rewards/penalties for how you manage them affect your tower. Unfortunately, there's just not much to this game.  I have played a lot of SimTower. Hundreds of hours easily. Same with SimCity games, Cities Skylines, virtually every Tycoon game ever made. I love sims and management games. And even the worst of them tend to have more 'personality' to the simulation mechanics than this game. There's nothing to care about in the towers I create. There's no reward/penalty for subtle design differences you might choose to make, outside of obviously bad ones. There's just not much fun here.  Fortunately, at least it seems like many of its shortcomings could be overcome with a thoughtful expansion pack that adds depth to the mechanics of a tower beyond a simple checklist of needs. As it is, it's too easy, too shallow, and too impersonal of a sim experience to hold interest for long. Project Highrise feels like it built a solid foundation but for some reason didn't bother to build a superstructure on top of it.",

I wouldn't compare it too closely to Simtower, as this is far less about traffic and more about the relation between different parts of your tower, but that's okay because soon enough you're swamped enough to be grateful that traffic isn't a factor.  What I mean with interdependency is that as your tower grows, you unlock better rooms, but those rooms have more demands of your tower. A lvl 1 office might only require you to power it and you can start small with a nice stack of them plopped down just about anywhere, with maybe a caffeteria as a bonus. A lvl 2 office wants not only power, but dining restaurants, shops, a quiet area and proximity to an elevator. Those dining restaurants, have a list of demands of their own and before you know it, you're figuring out what the optimal placement of all the parts of the sum are. More than Simtower, your skyscraper feels like an organic whole that is complex, bustling and truly your own with the little touches you made.   I don't feel that all the systems lain across this work as well as they could, since things like buzz and influence that unlock things of their own are a bit of a hassle at first, but there's a really solid, likeable game at its core and I'd wholeheartedly reccomend it.",

However, ST didn't go into detail in many aspects of the game, for instance, a restaurant was just that, maybe chinese, maybe italian, but you couldn't choose anything. Well, Project Highrise goes into detail, and quite well. I'm just a beginner right now, but so far I can tell I've spent very well the money.  8/10",

It's long enough ago that I don't quite remember Sim Tower perfectly but while I've been able to continue playing various Civilization sequels over the years there's never been anything to scratch the Sim Tower itch. It is different to Sim Tower as other reviews point out but that's not to say it's not a good game in its own right.   Worth a punt if you like building games and definitely recommend it if you spent many hours playing Sim Tower after school with any fondness.",

It's not too clear visually, some things could be streamlined (like laying pipes, power and gass together toggle?) Also, after about 4 hours I unlocked all buildings, swimming in cash, I could only grind more and more floors to cap the game totally, but that no longer seems like much fun. Not quite sure why I'd just end and start again, as cranking up the difficulty doesn't seem like fun to me.  Still, it's fun. Worth the discounted price, but be aware it can get a bit borring. I'd still give it a 7 out of 10. It is what it aims to be.",
