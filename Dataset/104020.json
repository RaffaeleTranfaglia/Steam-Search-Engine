No special and interesting ideas, no cool/spooky/funny story and nothing that would make you improvise while playing. Gameplay is very forgiving so its good for kids or if you look for easy game.",

            "review_text": "This game is brillant! It's a simple platformer, all you need to do is use 3 keys. Left, right and jump (so space bar or A on a xbox controller). That's it. Simple; yet great! The game is quite challenging, definitely gave me so frustration but the music throughout the entire game is rather calming to an extent. As much as you get frustrated, you never feel like you want to destory the keyboard or controller. You may get very close to thinking that, but the background music just keeps you sane.",

I finished a quarter of them with perfect score, but I don't really see any reason to return to the rest and try to improve. All the same with the bonus levels.   The game itself is pretty decent and the difficulty is quite okay. The physics sometimes behave a little erratically, and/or counterintuitively, but at least the behaviour is consistent, so once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.   Overall, the game is not bad, but I suggest you go and play some Tobe's Vertical Adventure instead.",

This one is more completed and the overall experience worths its price. If you want it to get more difficult, do not content oneself with the original levels.",
