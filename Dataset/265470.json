    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows Vista or higher Processor: 1.5 GHz Dual-Core Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: Intel HD 3000 or equivalent, 1 GB dedicated VRAM Storage: 500 MB available space Sound Card: Anything Additional Notes: Lower specs on GPU may result in lag @ 60 FPS with in-game resolutions beyond 2x windowed. Low quality 30 FPS option is included in-game which may alleviate lag. Lag may occur when livestreaming the game at 60FPS at resolutions beyond 2x windowed, even on powerful computers (if you have streaming issues: we recommend 30FPS in-game and with your recording software). Please note that very rarely, the sound in-game may drop out for a few seconds.",
