            "review_text": "I love total war. I have played since the pixellated Shogun first showed us what turnbased combined with real time strategy was all about. I have fought on medieval battlefields, napoleonic battlefields and many others.  I dont think i have any more playtime on a single gaming series and now to the bad part.   Ever since Napoleon the DLC trend has angered me, i appreciate other series do it aswell but bare with me. I got more content with Darth mod on napoleon then with the DLC packs/game itself. Why would i pay £30 for a brand new game and then two weeks later a DLC comes out? At least be more subtle CA, anyone with half a brain cell can see that the content was ready/very nearly ready when the whole game was released, so know I am expected to shell out another £6 for a few more (very similar) factions that the AI have already been playing as? Basically proving the content was in the game when it was released.   So im prepared to pay a little bit more as i know CA are a small PC only company.............Oh wait they just made Alien Isolation which was also on consoles, got great reviews and most importantly sold really well. So i am now not prepared to pay any more money until CA start to treat us with respect. Furthermore i logon to steam today and low and behold £1.99 for the 'blood and burning' pack. So now i am expected to shell out more of my very hard earned cash to have blood in the game and enhanced fire effects? Could they not be added in a free update like pretty much any other decent PC gaming series? I just recieved alot more content for Men Of War Assault Squad 2 which is made by a very small developer all for free, just to be loyal to the players that bought that game.   Seriously CA I appreciate the cost of game making is astronomical these days and I genuinely am a lot more forgiving then most 15 year olds trolls on the forums/steam but c'mon now you are just taking us all for a ride.   Knowone at CA will probably read this but if you do realise that im not a troll, im a very loyal Total war fan and all im doing is echoing the sentiments of the entire Total War community. As a game itself i reccomend Atilla but as someone possessing common sense i cannot.",

            "review_text": "At first blush, Attila was a little disappointing because its superficially so similar to Rome 2, same army animations etc. However, once you play more than a few turns, this disappears and it is truly a totally different and much, much better game.   There are some questionable design decisions, for example virtually every faction gets similar units (but there is still a wide diversity) eg saxons get pikemen, lancers, and cavalry that are good at attacking other cavalry despite having none of these historically. However there's so much unit choice and such a wide diversity of units (especially when you start recruiting client state/horde units) that they're all fun to play as + I find the combat far more complex. Different factions have different stats, for example Barbarians have high attack but generally lower defence and armour, while with Roman units its the other way around. Roman units get chewed up by barbarians, so you need to play quite tactically with them now and make full use of terrain and your Levis Armaturae and cavalry. Especially appreciated is the (finally!) addition of a 'missile block chance' for all units. This is so good it would be impossible to go back to a time without it, and I have NO idea why it wasn't in Rome 2 (what were they thinking???).  But now to the gameplay. People have complained that all the factions are 'the same' but in truth I really don't see this. Excluding DLC, there are four main playstyles, 'Roman', 'Germanic Barbarian' (eg Suebi, Visigoths), 'Eastern' (Sassanid, Garamantians), and 'Nomadic' (Huns, white huns) etc but each plays very differently, and further playstyle differences are added even between factions depending on their religion (which actually makes a real difference in terms of buildings and effects now), whether they're a horde or not, and differing units. I've completed games on hard as ERE, WRE, Saxons, Sassanids, Garamantians, and White Huns. Horde tribes are a real challenge, since your city travels with you, and I haven't mastered this yet. I found legendary difficulty too awkward because of the pause-delay that gets added to all of your actions from the auto-save, so I play only on hard or very hard.  I'm currently playing the absolute best campaign of my 10 years playing total war (i've played all TWs except the first shogun) as Western Roman Empire on Very Hard. An early decision to hold one province too many (Belgica) rather than falling back to Narbonensis as I usually do, as well as a subsequent (still early) decision to switch to Graeco Roman paganism stretched my empire to the absolute breaking point. I spent until 417AD 'treading water' fighting battle after battle, marching my legions all over hells half acre to put down rebellions, fight off rampaging hordes, et cetera. Along the way I lost my alliance with the ERE and had no other trade allies or client states, so it was tough. It also played out very diffierently to an identical campaign on hard. I didn't get my usual economic buildings built early because I had to spend on troops, so I was behind from the get-go.   After I wearied my foes enough I was able to sign a stack of peace agreements but I was busy for many more years putting down rebellions and spending spare cash (that now wasn't being spent on soldiers) building buildings. Now in 422 AD, I've stabilised my religion, have taxes stably on high (its a net benefit to public order once all the immigrants are gone) and I control all of italia, north africa, hispania, most of france and most of britain with the Varinians as my client state in Scotland. The thing is, even with 12 legions my empire is still stretched to the max as I have hordes through the interior, the franks have 4 provinces and a few stacks near colonia agrippina, i have five or six hun hordes, rugians and another horde faction hanging all around illyria and in my interior, and I have the garamantians (who have 8 regions) on my border in Africa. I have two legions in Britain keeping that pacified, two in gaul, one in hispania, two in Africa, three in north italy/illyria, and my expeditionary legion is sailing towards Aksum under Flavius Stilicho (he just died, now its his son) to keep the ERE happy.   I can't move any of those legions for fear of attack, and now the Gaetulians in Cydamus have launched an attack with three full stacks on my two under-manned (saving $$ on garrison expenses) African legions - there's some tough fights coming up. I'm surprised the garamantians haven't pitched in yet, since they're at war with ERE but mercifully neutral (yellow face) happiness with me. On the same turn, my former clients, the Saxons, seceded and declared war. Unfortunately they helped me wipe the Visigoths out of Greece and Constantinople, and they captured much of the ERE's former territories, so they're quite a threat. Ordinarily I'd get Macedonia (Roman, graeco-roman pagan, religiously tolerant, admires empires, reliable, defensive) to help me sort them out since they're pliable and also control four regions in illyria, but since they're at war with the ERE (which holds virtually all of the middle east except Egypt, having for once wiped out the Sassanids) I can't do that either and I'm likely to be at war with macedon soon also.   Words don't do it justice but its an incredibly engaging campaign. One word of advice if its achievable on harder difficulties (for all campaigns really, not just WRE) is to crank your taxes up to high. Initially it will hurt public order so you should try not to be at war, but you can save yourself up to -18 (or is it 20?) (-9 as WRE) in immigration penalties. Normal taxes give -4 to public order, high taxes give -10. So you spend 6 public order to gain 9 public order as well as a huge increase in income. It's a great idea but I think its a bit too beneficial to the player once you can pull it off.   Whew, that degenerated mostly into my WRE experience but honestly, I don't know if this is the 'best' total war ever as I've had a lot of fun with all of them, but it is really a phenomenal game, is much better than Rome 2, and i feel sets a new high water mark for the series. I downloaded the last roman campaign but only played 3 hours so far (seems fun, loving the later time period and new units) and i have the empires of sand DLC but i haven't finished a campaign with it yet. I tried a couple of starts and the new units definitely make Himyar and Aksum more threatening and the Tanukhids seem like a lot of fun, but I always got stomped early as the Tanukhs. (instead play as ERE and recruit their awesome cavalryt!) . Do recommend.  **EDIT** I have subsequently edited this review after discovering some problems. There are several bugs in the game that are unresolved and are unlikely to be resolved by CA. They're a little devious but can have a very profound effect on gameplay. The first is that a number of traits and retinues appear to have no effect - especially those that give +exp to units. Pankration gloves etc are entirely useless. Also there is an easily reproducible bug where faction members that remarry the wife of another dead faction member will disappear, yet still be available for employment as a general. you can never give them offices etc so eventually they accumulate a huge amount of influence and revolt leading to a separatist conflict. There are other problems in charlemagne such as not being able to recruit archers after researching a certain cavalry tech....these bugs have been around for a long time and aren't going to be fixed. This knocks a lot of the gloss off my review - but I tried going back to Rome 2 today and Attila still beats it by an order of magnitude. Also, the encyclopeia isa piece of ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't load half the time and takes an age to navigate when it does. Its obscure, difficult to use and doesnt make life easier. Some stats like rate of fire should be on the main unit card not encyclopedia.",

            "review_text": "Total War has improved drastically with Attila. While it definitely shares mechanical similarities to Rome 2, it honestly feels like a completely different game. Both games should be played independantly, and for different reasons.  Rome 2 was very much an empire builder where the goal was to get as big as possible, Attila is definitely more of a survival game.  Attila makes many improvements on Rome 2, such as obvious better visuals and improved anti-aliasing. Mechanically it is similar but the Campaign has many improvments including the Family Tree and more diplomacy options. These add to the complexity of the campaign gameplay. Battles are also much harder and have been reworked to be a bit more realistic. Units will route faster but will also return to the fight easier. Fatigue is also much more of an issue.  It has one main flaw, the lack of culture types. The game contains many factions from different parts of the known world, but we're missing Celtic, Slavic and Sarmatian units. Instead all Celts use Nordic units, Slavs use German units and Sarmatians use Hun units. It's a bit jarring and makes me miss the diversity of Rome 2, but I'm sure it'll improve in time with patches and DLC.  Overall, Attila is a fantastic game, but it isn't a replacement for Rome 2. Both games should be played and enjoyed for different reasons.",

Well, I think getting run over is better than Rome 2's release, so obviously it is better. Rome 2 did get fixed up but it took a hell of a long time to get it right. But yes, this is better than Rome 2.  THE GOOD:  In fact, the campaign is absolutely fantastic, it's got the best atmosphere of any total war game I've played, obviously I am likely to edit this review as I sink more hours into the game, so far my first campaign as the Geats (a DLC Viking faction) has been enjoyable, sailing around, plundering wealthy coastal settlements and generally not giving a f*ck (stealing money, send it to strengthen my capital and smoke weed everyday).   However, I dabbled a little bit with the other factions campaigns and there is a so much diversity in the general feel of each group of factions. You can feel playing as the Romans that their days are numbered and it's damage control from the get go, the Sassanids are the new big power and are ready to rise up and become a dominant force and replace the old, frail empires in the west. The barbarian tribes have a fight for survival, scrabbling to hold their lands against the behemoths that are both Roman Empires, but the threat of hordes coming and destroying your lands and your people is ever constant, so you always have a lot to think about. The hordes are well, hordes. You are what keeps the 'civilised' people awake at night, especially as the Huns who can't settle, only loot and raze.   Sieges are an absolute delight as well, the defenders being able to craft barricades in the street really adds another dimension, the fire spreading throughout the city is great to watch, while the defeneders have the strategic advantage behind their walls and barricades, fire weakens their stats and morale, creating a better balance of gameplay. Each main faction looks great as well, this belongs in the bad section but since Im already talking about it I should mention that some of the unplayable barbarian factions are too similar, there's absolutely nothing to distinguish them from each other apart from their faction sigil. However the Roman soldiers look great, a far cry from the glorious looking legionaires you had in Rome 2, these legionaries are much uglier and darker (but in a good way).  The family tree is a welcome return, however it doesn't cast off everything that Rome 2 implemented, taking some of the good things like influence and political occurences. What was a disorganised mess, but a good idea in rome 2 has now been refined to something which is much easier to get to grips with.  THE BAD:  Mainly technical, but the one gameplay flaw I can spot right now is the razing mechanic, while it is a great thing they've put in the game, once you raze a settlement, the land in that province is now classed as 'desolate' and inhospitable. This certainly is an interesting mechanic though I fear that as a campaign progresses there is a danger of too many places becoming 'desolate' and there being not enough towns and cities to take. This is yet to be seen of course but it seems all too likely a problem.  Time between turns is unforgivably long, I've gone and made a nice brew (cuppa tea for you Americans) in the time it takes for turns to finish. Not to mention loading times for battles are huge. Once it gets going, its great, but have a book with you to read between turns, perhaps an encyclopedia on Roman history?   Graphics optimisation is once again, poor. I can run Rome 2 fairly well at medium-high settings but it's very difficult to run this game anything higher than low settings. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if there was an increase in visual quality but it all looks the same as Rome 2, albeit a bit more brown, dark and gritty. For so little difference in visuals yet a huge decrease in performance it really is an irritating situation. Check your specs before going into it to make sure you're able to run it well as on low settings it does look pretty pants.   Technical issues aside, the game has fantastic gameplay mechanics and is a bloody good job by CA.  So far I'd give this an 8/10, great work.",

The new mechanics work great (except possibly that the AI has a tendency to leave half the map a barren wasteland by the end).

My one main gripe is that enemy factions seem to tunnel vision on the player and send large armies to chase the player around the map rather than defend their borders from more immediate threats.

The general feeling of the end of the world is also noteworthy, both because of the scripted events regarding Attila and climate change as well as because the campaign feel chaotic and very fluid with all the razing of towns, the migrating hordes, the uprisings of new factions, the crumbling of the roman empire etc.  I also think that the siege escalation and destructions effects works well.  Historical purists will point some strange units in the rosters there and there (vikings etc), but given the overall lack of information about the time period i feel that most of those are good compromises to flesh out some factions and not too over the top like units in past CA titles...

I was waiting to see some videos and hear the TW communities opinion on Attila and what I have seen and heard has been very positive so I had to buy the game a bit after release. The UI is improved and so much more that I will go into below.  The Family Tree from Shogun 2 is back and it is even better than ever with even more depth. The seiges and battles in general feel more satisfying and with more strategy involved. This here feels like the TW I have come to love over the years and makes me forget about Rome II and my distaste for it.  CA deserves alot of praise for listening to the community for this game, alot of the things that have been improved or added since Rome II was stuff I had seen the community talk about and stuff I had been dissapointed with. It is wonderful to see CA listen to the fans and make a much better game. I don't need anymore hours in this game to know that I enjoy it, we have our Total War back at full strength people!  There is a few issues such as the high requirements for the higher settings and some of the bugs, but overall it is a very good release, especially compared to Rome II on release. If you liked all of the TW games up until Rome II, pick this up ASAP. Even if you liked Rome II, pick this up, for me this is CA on the top of there game and it brings back memories from Shogun 2 and past TW games. Welcome back CA, this is a step in the right direction.",

            "review_text": "This is, in my opinion, one of the best Total War games.  Rome 2 was an utter disappointment. It was perhaps the most expected, most hyped game in the series, yet failed to deliver. It was riddled with bugs, major features were removed or streamlined, and while it had its strengths, the weaknesses far outnumbered them. Attila then essentially took the formula of Rome 2 and hugely improved it. The result is, to me, one of the most well balanced, most entertaining games they have made so far. The graphics are amazing, the ambience, well, they really managed to represent the chaotic, semi-apocalyptic feel that, to the population at the time, is what they must have felt like seeing an empire such as Rome fall, and all the changes that came with it.  The gameplay is really good as well. As mentioned, everything is well balanced, the campaign map, the empire building and its management, the battles and recruiting systems, it all falls into place and is really intuitive once you understand the basics. It's in essence Rome 2's simplified, streamlined gameplay, but with some actual depth and immersion to it, which actually makes it entertaining.  My only real complains about Attila are the number of DLC's which can be quite costly if you intend to buy them all in order to fully experience the game, and the 'fake' difficulty that is seen on their most recent products. For instance, the fact that the roman roster is too weak when compared to their adversaries. How come a legionnaire with full body chainmail, helmet, big sword and shield + all the training and discipline they are known for, can barely hold against a bunch of famished barbarian tribesmen with nothing but regular old clothes and a simple spear and shield? I get that it's to make the 'last stand' feel even more intense but... oh well, fortunately, these and many other similar complaints can be easily solved with a visit to the workshop and a couple clicks.  Speaking of which, another great thing about this game is how moddeable it is. Still no campaign map modding though, which absolutely sucks.  All in all, this is a very good game. Few other games have been so rewarding as how you feel after facing dozens of enemy factions, famine, disorder, disease, civil war, invasions and skirmishes against a dozen more enemies... and surviving the Hunnic doom stacks.. and then you not only save the Western Roman Empire from total collapse, but actually lead it to greater prosperity and power. Or taking one of the barbarian factions that start with just one region and a ragtag bunch of misfits as an army, and lead them to actually dismantling the Roman Empire and estabilishing your own semi-medieval kingdom.  The replayability is immense, even when playing the same factions.  8/10",

There're a lot of mods curretly out to cater the game to your experience, and the DLC, while massively overboard, DOES have a few gems in it ( AOC, Cultures of the sand ) and might be worth considering if you liked it.  IN DEPTH: POSITIVES: + Battles are super fun to play and for the most part, responisve. Units tend to not bug out as often at least. + Historical Battles are nice as well. + Lots of regions to play with overall + Brought back a lot of good things froom Medi2 ( Family tree.. ISH. Though politics are a bit iffy if you're not versed with it ) + Religion has bonuses, and changes some dialogue lines which is a positive thing ( FOR THE SAVER =&gt; FOR THE GODS ) + Horde system is entertaining + Decent enough battle-ai that newer players will have a run for thier money  NEGATIVE - A lot of the factions are merely copy-paste, with a few unique unit differences. - Brought back a lot of what I disliked in Rome 2: The Region system, as well  - To compensate for the average battle-ai, higher difficulties buff the enemy stats tremendously, to the point a tier 1 unit can easily trounce a tier 2 on Legendary consistently - Campaign AI is dumb. They'll spend turns sacking your cities, just waiting for it to rebel instead of actually conquering it. - HUNS. While it IS about Atilla the Hun and his rampage, it's ridiculous how that somehow entitles him to respawning stacks. It's a very game-y mechanic to force you to confront him; While it IS fun the first time, it gets progressively worse later on as enemies start to spam high tier units for practically no cost in order to match up to your empire. - Did I mention Legendary Difficulty missile infantry? Screw them. - UPGRADE SYSTEM: After researching technologies, it is no longer possible to use cheaper units. For marginally better units, you have to pay a higher upkeep cost, meaning a lot of the researching you'll do is economy first, then military later in order to keep up. Upgrading too early will put you in the negatives and bankrupt you. - DIPLOMACY: The AI just plain hates you. For no apparent reason. Getting trade? Good luck. Getting non-aggression packs? See them break it a turn later, or worse, run up to your regions and raid it. Can't even fight them off without getting a penalty. ( There's also a really cheap diplomacy abuse you can exploit overall. )  NEUTRAL = Exploitable AI ( But all Total War has it ) = Maps during sieges vary from fun to play, to excrutiatingly annoying to defend.  = Cavalry is DOMINANT. Impossible to win battles are made easy as hell due to Cavalry Impact damage, where a melee cav can literally obliterate a moving infantry unit then match the survivors in melee = Polished, but feels like what Rome 2 should've been on release. = Reuses a LOT of voices from Rome 2, barring the units spitting out their names.  Over-all, decent entry to the series, but it REALLY could've been better. As a Total War Game, I feel that it's mostly on a lacking side, but as a regular strategy game, it's a nice buy overall.",

            "review_text": "Attila, King of the Huns, Destroyer of Worlds, Child of Gods, he is the one, that will bring war to the lands, conquer, kill and bla bla bla. Okay. I've been a Total War fan since Empire, played every game of series till then and I've been looking forward to the release of Attila, after Rome II being quite enjoyable (after a pretty messed up launch). Does Attila achieve to be better than Rome II, does it bring new mechanics, more unit variety, better AI, or for short: Is it worth buying? The answer is yes.  But now comes the big BUT(T) lol. If you're expecting an all new game you will be a bit disappointed. Attila uses the same engine as Rome II, the interface has been tweaked, but is generally the same, province and city management is mostly the same, agents and army management also. The big changes of the game are mostly to be found in the siege mechanics, new politics system and the new horde-feature. Let me explain these first.  Sieges have been revamped alot. With every turn a settlement is besieged, it now loses a percentage of its 'health' and gets more and more destroyed. This has effects on the siege battle. Walls and gates might be breached, houses burn, the air is filled with thick smoke. Enemy morale gets worse, the more the city is damaged, but your repair costs increase if you decide to conquer the city and keep it. Well, IF. Here comes a new 'fun' feature. You are now able to destroy settlements after conquering them. And I mean completly destroy, all buildings gone, the city removed from the map, all that remains are ruins, you have to rebuild with an army (which is quite expensive). While this adds variety in your war strategies, you will feel how bitter that step is when you fall victim to it yourself. Imagine your capital being back in your homeland, far away from the front. Now an enemy raiding party comes over the seas, attacks your city, you have no army stationed there, and boom, they destroy the entire city with all the highend-buildings that cost you thousands of gold. Fun. This definetly makes you pay more attention to your borders, and makes losses much, much more devastating.  The new politics. First things first. The family tree has returned!.. and it sucks. Yes, unfortunately, the family tree of Attila: Total War is basically just fan service. While Shogun 2 had an excellent family tree, very clear, very useful and fun to manage, the Attila one is just way to complicated. Within a few turns it completly gets out of control, and your family grows to such enormous scales that you don't want to click that faction button anymore. Also the missing ability to zoom out and see your whole family tree makes things much worse. You have to scroll through the tree and will easily lose track of who belongs to who. The reason you get so many new family members is probably the new feature to install a governer to a province, otherwise you can't use edicts. But making one of your family members one prohibits him from leading armies, so always choose wisely who you send to the front and who will watch over your citizens in the meantime. Family members also have many different actions at their disposal, like murdering someone else from the family, increase someones loyalty or your factions popularity. The resource they spend for doing that is called influence. Influence is generated by winning battles as a general or by political measures as a governor. The latter will earn a lot less though, which makes it hard to use them for intrigue. Overall the new politics system feels unfinished. People asked for a family tree, for politcal intrigue and more political interactions in general. CA implemented that, which is nice, but it really seems as if they didn't think it through. So far, nothing beats the clan management from Shogun II.  Lastly, the horde-feature. The Huns, the Visigoths or the Vandals, they are called the Great Migrators. These factions start of as hordes. That means, that they have no controlled settlement at the beginning, and only armies. They have a special stance that allows them to go into camp, where they can build structures for unit creation, food production and wealth. When they capture a settlement, and choose to occupy it, their migration ends, and they are no longer a horde. This feature means, that when a faction loses its last settlement, but still has an army, it becomes a horde too. This is a good addition to the game and fits the theme perfectly. The Huns (who cannot leave horde-status btw) play very different from other factions and this way, the first time in a Total War game, you have two completly different playstyles. Overall a very nice feature.  So. Should you buy the game? Let me just make a quick list, why or why not you should.  Pros: - New horde feature - Good tweaks for the HUD - AI seems a lot more logical - The game is much harder - Very good atmosphere, soundtrack and graphics  Cons: - Unfinished politics system - Overall only small changes from Rome II - Horrible DLC-policy - Still a bit buggy - Feels more like an addon than a whole new game (similar to Napoleon --&gt; Empire)  Just a quick explanation to the con points. CA or Sega, or whoever is responsible has a horrible, horrible DLC-policy. It has been a week since release and the first DLC is out. Price: 8 Euros for 3 new factions. DLCs from Rome II, like the Blood and Gore DLC, that adds blood and gore (who would have thought) does not carry over. The games have the same engine, almost identical fighting animations, why not just give the DLC free to everyone who owned it for Rome II? There are still some bugs in the game, concerning ingame messages, AI and battle calculation. But that will probably get fixed someday.  So, to finally conclude. YES, you should buy the game if you are a fan of Total War, like the new, dark scenario, have no problems with scummy DLC and are willing to spend around 35 Euros for an addon. You should however NOT buy Attila, if you expect a whole new game, are not okay with the DLC policy and are new to the series. If you want to get into Total War, I highly recommend Shogun II !

Splitting your armies via subterfuge and cold/calculating manouvers.   It is also very visually appealing, though it has its rough edges in the performance sector as does every total war game at the start, but it is many times over better than Rome 2 in this regard. Stable and fairly bugless. Even the Co-op is very stable. It is obvious they have learned their lesson from Rome 2.  There are some things that are a bit wonky though, its color scheme on the campaign map while fitting for the mood, can make seeing things on the campaign map a bit of a challenge unless you adjust your brightness/Gamm settings. And battles are more often taking place in rain, snow, and fog than in clear weather.   The politics system is also greatly improved, and the addition of the family tree along with its gameplay is very welcome. Its a complicated TW, so dont expect to instantly pick up everything. One of the best TW games to date, I give it a 9/10.",

Hell yes it does. Where Rome 2 was some sort of monster that ran out of gas and had all its wires cut everydamn day like some band of nutters were following you Attila is stable and the nutters have stopped cutting the wires in car. Attila overall looks like Rome 2 but better. The GUI looks very nice and gives information in a nice fluid way. The combat system is much better since Rome 2 as it seems the Ai has grown walnut size brain and knows how to move 2 large bodys of units so that you have to work out which threat deserves more of your troops. Overall the combat and the ai seems that its stable for now. In closing even though I have only been driving this car around for 4 hours Attila already feels great. So for a score i would say with the amount of time spent with it i would give it a 8/10. Happy Driving everyone.",

It looks pretty much exactly the same (If not the same) as Total War: Rome II, has the same map and the same unit models, yet they charged $60 for it as well as Day 1 dlc factions. Yup, if you count each individual group you can play as a 'faction,' then there were 10 in the base game. Within 3 weeks of the game being released (You saw that right, 3 weeks) they had released 3 different groups and a 'blood &amp; gore' dlc.   The three groups were the Celts, Vikings and Longbeards and each dlc gave 3 more 'factions.' Yup, so in  3 weeks  they increased their roster from the vanilla 10 to 19! That's pretty much double! To add even MORE insult, each faction group is $7.99usd a pop and the blood&amp;gore dlc, which should have been in the game in the first place, was not in the vanilla game because A) they release it as a $2.99 dlc later and B) Get a lower esrb rating.  One could argue that 'Hey, it's a $44.99 usd game.. I can forgive dlc,' and I would agree with you. But, when you release three group dlcs (9 factions) for $7.99 a piece and the blood and gore pack for $2.99  all within three weeks of the game being released  that is unexceptable. You are paying $71.95 usd for a game that should, by all rights, only still be $45 if they hadn't purposefully cut content out.  tl;dr - the game is a money grab. While it is fun enough to play, I would wait for a sale if you are still going to get it due to their inflated prices and dlc spam.",

Many people still remain loyal to the brand but the games are just not fun to play anymore. The TW AI has never been good and the only answer CA can come up with is to allow it to cheat more, which is stupid to be honest. Here's a heads-up CA, The players notice. Maybe if you didn't smack them in the face with it, or better yet, hire someone that can actually create a decent AI so cheating isn't needed. I wonder how many chess programs would be sold if the AI was allowed to conjure up spare queens from thin air. It's just lazy programming. Then to add insult to injury they jump on the DLC bandwagon to squeeze every last morsel of cash out of us. Here's to hoping that the various government trade departments around the world get up to speed and stamp on any company that removes content just so that they can sell it as an extra.

Has some lag issues that aren't found in Rome 2 and its end game is weak as the Horde simply burns everything to the ground leaving a barren, lifeless wasteland. Not overly entertaining after the first grand campaign. As always, the modding community has done a great job fixing the game for CA and Sega.  Attila is good when thought of as $15 Rome 2 DLC but is obviously unacceptable and certainly not recommedable as a stand alone $150 experience.

Over time I started to like it, since it stopped the 'mow through the A.I' type of conquest if only for a time. If you even cared about it, anyway. - The family tree helps this game immensely by actually making you care about your generals. I always have my king/prince in the main army, making me extra careful and therefore almost insuring I don't rush into battle, it's great. - The hordes are basically like the 'no more land' factions from Rome 2 if you took their land they are an army running about, the diffirence lies in that the hordes have their own mobile camp and can also just burn anything in their way (any faction can but the hordes benefit from it). - The politics system is still abit boring and needs more work done on it, I said it was re-worked but I actually prefer Rome 2's 'more casual' system...  One cannot talk about any Total War game without bringing up mods, that's like playing Skyrim on PC without mods. There are currently a few interesting mods in development that are really promising, such as the Medieval Kingdoms or Ancient Empires. Since TW Attila is based at the end of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Medieval times it's a great spot to have both mods. That does not however mean that there haven't been any cool mods yet, Terminus TW - Ageless empires is a good one, although it's been discontinued as well as the Clovis Origin(something) Europae.  All in all, is it fantastic? Not quite. Is it as bad as Rome 2? Not even close. It's a step in the right direction for the TW franchise after Rome 2's step backwards.

You can pick your heir to the throne, change religion if you choose, or feel the need to move all together, you can become a horde until you feel the need to settle again. Only flaws I find is you still cant select a capital like Medieval2, unless your a horde, and too many factions have similar load outs, so if your a german faction, fighting other germans, you know what theyre gonna bring to the fight and how to win, so its almost a hands down battle before its even begun. Maybe if they had inidividual faction units like medieval 2 it would feel more authentic...do yourself a favour stradegy fans an buy this game!",

So this game was a positive review but it has changed over last patch celts. i really love this culture pack but seen the last patch it has been crash after crash after crash after crash after crash after crash after crash after crash after crash...... u get but this is becoming a bit dum i really hope CA can do Warhammer total war is much better than this!

The only thing people are so pi22ed about is the DLC overload which individually go for between $2 and $4 each.  In terms of AI and game mechanics you can tell the developers are trying new things leading up to the release of the obvious new Medieval addition to the series, even the new Warhammer for instance is the developers gearing up for what they are going to do with the new Medieval.  I'm a solid fan of Total War series, I don't actually think I will be getting the Warhammer addition because I don't know how I truly feel about incorporating magic and mysticism into battles with mythological stuff - it just doesn't do it for me. I like the gritty feel Attila delivers, the game requires a high spec computer to really enjoy the epic battle graphics which are awesome on account of little things like settlements actually having visible settlers wondering around and the way settlements can be completely burnt to the ground.  The game is perfect for playing as a barbarian race and raiding rich settlements controlled by the East and West Roman Empires.  When Attila actually begins his conquest it can be a little scary too depending on who you are playing as.  Overall the game has great graphics, awesome mechanics and micro management, it is not as simple as say Shogun 2 which I found to actually be one of the worse Total Wars in my opinion on account of climbable walls and such - people just like playing 'rush' now days and don't value the thought and effort in getting things done in games now days which is depressing because these ADD kids are actually starting to overwhelm the market supply and demand and literally changing games for the worse but whatever - I am getting old and don't really care what the new generation choose to push things towards - Attila was a great addition to the Total War series and I thoroughly enjoyed it and am literally picking and scratching at my skin like a meth head in anticipation for the new Medieval which I am seeing all the hints in both Attila and Warhammer and am sure have read a few things online now.  I know what to expect and pretty sure I know what Total War are doing having played all of their games since the first Rome adaptation.

For example my King's daughter elopped with one of my general's who wasn't very loyal to me. So I striped the general of his men and sent him to Rome to send a message, 'The Jutes are coming'. Of course it was a suicide mission but I allowed him to die honorably with a sword in his hand instead of assasinating him for his disrespect. Seriously though. Fun and unique factions, tough campaign that made me get rid of my normal blitzkrieg styled gameplay and become more tactical, new and fun internal as well as external politics, just an all around great game. Sure it has need of some improvements (do I seriously have to buy blood and gore again!) and not all the changes they made were for the best, but overall I just wanna say to all the haters who haven't even played the game yet.

            "review_text": "This was my first Total War game and probably my favorite just because of all the Total War games, this one, in my opinion, has the most replayability and I really like the time periods they chose. Total War Attila has just the right amount of factions (if you buy the overpriced DLC) and open ended gameplay that makes it much more playable a second time through than other games in the series. A lot of the factions are very interesting like the Roman Empire (both sides), the Huns, the Franks, etc and it's very interesting seeing swords clash between all of these factions. I would highly suggest getting the Age of Charlemagne DLC since that's where I had the most amount of fun, but I can't reccommend the Last Roman DLC since starting a new save is annoying because making Africa submit takes a lot of time. Time that I'd rather spend fighting the Ostrogoths in Italy.  The battles could be better in this game. I find it very enjoyable since at my skill, I feel slightly better than the AI so I still have the enjoyment of winning most of the time while still feeling challenged because I have to stay on my feet. If you're a very experienced Total War player, you may miss the impact of armies colliding like they did in Rome Total War because they have a different engine that makes the armies meld together. It doesn't feel like a very physical battle when you watch the people fight. It's mostly just people jabbing their spears at the air and someone falling down every once in a while. They make you pay for blood too so if you want it to feel like a real battle, you'll need to pay for that. It's better to just focus on the tactics during battles than watch the animations.  The games flaws include the vast amounts of overpriced DLC. Enough said. Also, the one thing that just made the game feel really lazy was that most of the soldier designs look sloppy. The way the soldiers look made the game feel so streamlined like they didn't put any work into it. Even if you pay for DLC, the soldiers still look crappy. Watch the show Vikings and compare it to the Vikings in this game. The vikings in this game look like pajama men, I'm not kidding you. It's so hard to take them seriously. Some factions have very bright clothing too so you could be faced with fighting against yellow pajama men or bright green pajama men. For the most part, if you're a barbarian faction, all the soldiers look the same, they just attached a different colored set of pajamas. Also, in the Age of Charlemagne DLC, they made Charlemagne invincible so he doens't really 'lead men into battle with honor and virtue', he just can't die so he's not risking anything by being there with his men anyways. They should seriously change that since it does take away from the imersion of the game.  Even though this game has a lot of flaws, I still love this game. I'm playing a game as the Lombards on hard for the first time and I do feel genuinly challenged. The Frankish armies are flooding through the Alps and I'm fighting them off, but they just keep coming.",

At the time, I thought this is great. When Rome: Total War cam out, I was blown away. It was pretty new and pretty different. I didn't really play Medieval 2, but I did play Empire, and it was not good at the initial release. CA kind of released Napoleon to redeem themselves after Empire. Shogun 2 is my personal favorite of ALL the Total war games I have probably clocked around 1500 hours on it, and I was completely enthralled. While it kind of annoyed me that they tried to get at least on unit pack out there, I thought hey this is great. I was so excited when Rome 2 was announced, i could not wait.   MAAAAAAAN was it disappointing it took about 20 patches to get what they should have had from the start, which should not have happened. Total War Attila was kind of like Napoleon, To make up for their disaster with Rome 2. I was also extremely excited for Total War Attila to be released, and I would be somewhat disappointed. Most of the problems were with the campaign. You couldn't go 10 turns into the game without looking at the campaign map and seeing that most of WRE settlements had razed. It looked like someone had dropped nuclear warheads on the Balkans. Not to mention the amount of factions would go into hoard mode, and most of the factions doing this weren't even close to the Hunnic hordes so it wasn't even historically accurate. The slavic factions should be panicking, yet it seems they have the largest growing kingdoms that far east.   Rebellions also occur almost at random, and I cant even go a single turn without fighting a god damn town defense battle, which by the way, almost all look the same. ERE campaign rebellions become awfully repetitive, and while it is to be expected with WRE, if they would add more settlement variety that would be most welcome.  Oh man... and then there are the DLC packs. Oh boy, I could go on for HOURS on why half of these DLC are not at all worth getting, and yet I won't. They did useless DLC spams with Empire, Napoleon, Shogun 2, Rome 2, Attila, AND now probably Warhammer. I laughed for like, 10 minutes when I saw the 'Chaos Warriors' pack! Making Chaos warriors a DLC faction is like saying your selling lemonade at a lemonade stand, but instead of the drink, you have printed and photocopied pictures of lemonade and then try to sell it to others. Chaos is like, The best thing about any warhammer game, it is ALWAYS in a good warhammer game, the forces of chaos being literally what is trying to destroy the old world, and yet we have to pay 7.99 to play as the one actual constant in warhammer fantasy. Doing this is seriously not the way to get more customers.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And yet, I still like this game, it is addicting, and I hope anyone new to Total War likes this game and decides to buy it... If I were to make a toast about CA it would be to stop releasing a game every year and just take their time, because I find it quite disappointing with the way all this has been going.",

            "review_text": "despite the front cover featuring some generic-looking roundeye, the game and the music makes very clear they consider the Huns to be east asian, complete with throat singing more along the lines of Mongol than Hunnic.  much of this review is not just about Attila, but a broad overview of the Total War series as a whole, roughly since Rome Total War, and the lack of any real advancement in terms of AI.   The game basically fixes a lot of the problems introduced by Rome 2, while adding some others. The absolute best new feature is the ability to just flat out destroy a settlement completely from the map. Unfortunately, it can be near instantly rebuilt by any faction that seeks to do so, exact same name and spot.  As well, nomads can temporarily settle their armies into camps and build buildings to improve income and food and such, then pick up and move and settle elsewhere.  The settlement mechanics are still a frustrating, confusing mess for me most of the time. Oftentimes I end up with sudden food shortages out of nowhere with no clear cause. Other times, there's certain things which don't make much sense (like the Rivalry penalty) which only seem to escalate over time or don't seem to go away. Some of them (like the Civil War penalty) doesn't go away at all, even if you've ended it.   the main issue of the game is the same with almost all the other Total War games, in that as technology advances and the demands of a grand strategy game becomes more complex, more gameplay features are needed to replicate not just armies that go and fight, but the proper elements to support and maintain an army, balance income, grow a nation-state, and interact with other nation-states in a way other than destroying everything. Each Total War game handled this in different ways but in this and Rome 2 more so than ever, it's all essentially bunk because the AI is completely DOA.   Attila's AI is nowhere near as completely dead as Rome 2's is/was, but the issue is still there; the AI is such that diplomacy is completely dead. Getting things like trade agreements that last longer than a few years is a monumental task worthy of a Steam achievement. Things like creating tributaries, vassal states and so on are basically just filler options in the diplomacy menu because the AI will basically never accept half the options unless ground down to a single settlement and no armies.   The amount of coding necessary to create a complex, reactive AI is a massive task, but can be effectively done, as in Paradox games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis. Countless different statuses, constants, gameplay mechanics, and commands dictate how AI factions react and relate, leading to situations where diplomacy not only matters, but can be a powerful tool to either maintain a status quo among AI powers, or to simply prevent the AI from behaving brainlessly and having City-State X with 2 settlements and 500 soldiers from randomly declaring war on Neo Roman Empire Z with 840 settlements and 2,000,000 soldiers.   the Total War series has implemented several gameplay restrictions to help enforce this sort of thing, like in Rome Total War where the three separate Roman factions (Houses) are completely forbidden from declaring war on each other until the Civil War mechanic is unlocked. Shogun 2 had the same with the Shogunate.   Nothing like that appears to be in play in this game or Rome 2. Considering the immense amount of money poured in to Rome 2 and Attila compared to prior Total War games, they basically did no work on the game itself beyond aesthetics and the most barebones 'arcade' style combat mechanics, with lots of different 'special moves' unlocked based on the generals' stats or experience.   This would've been fantastic for an arcade game, but when half the achievements and gameplay is based on playing through an entire campaign of hundreds of turns, this becomes a monotonous slog which makes it impossible to play more than an hour or so at a time, to where I find myself going out of my way to auto-resolve most battles just because I'm completely and utterly sick of playing out every single battle only to have the brain-dead AI come back with a fresh army the next turn or two, because the game explicitly cheats by giving bonuses and money to the AI to compensate for the fact that it's completely incapable of doing much of anything otherwise.   When I play a game like Crusader Kings 2, I feel an actual sense of the faction I choose and its culture, politics, society, religion, and military. I can literally see the differences in race in the different faces, skin tones, clothing, and coloring of the vassals and courtiers I see and interact with. I can see a full-blooded French king with decidedly Arabic features, and scroll back on his family line far back enough to see when his French father married a Bedouin princess. In EU4, wars are not a default state of being, but affairs with clear goals in mind that can be negotiated over, with the AI actually seeming overjoyed when it's down 50% in war score with no clear path to even a stalemate and you come and offer a White Peace out of nowhere.  There's essentially none of that in Total War Attila. The difference in historical setting means there's less variety in terms of cultures and military units (less Greek/Macedonians, Phoenicians, Semites, Latins, etc) when more than half the factions are basically Celtic or Germanic. That's not the fault of the game, that's just the historical setting. But the game does so little with the sameyness compared to CK2 that many of the factions have the exact same units and there's no real sense of difference between them.   With DLC releases, both Attila and CK2 extend their timelines and overlap with the Charlemagne campaigns. In CK2, the Charlemagne startpoint feels like a wholely new, different period from the rest of the game, while remaining fundamentally exactly the same map, colors, UI, and units. Total War Attila's Charlemagne campaign looks and feels exactly the same as Total War Attila's grand campaign, just with decidedly more Christians and Muslims and significantly less Tengrii.",

In my opinion, its far better then rome 2 total war ever was. its like rome 2 done RIGHT. i've not run into any game breaking bugs (if really any come to think of it) and the game has been runing smooth on high settings on my laptop. theres not really anything i can say too bad about this game other then the dlc, which is not that bad compared to other total war dlc list ('rome 2') and the fact that the AI tends to occasionally cheat in the grand campaign.   there is also new mechanics like: where you can raze cities and or re-colonize it (which is really awesome!!) also besieging cities attila is Far better then any other total war game to date. for example, when you siege a city or town for a long period of time, the buildings and walls start to become dilapidated and run down from the siege. AND if the settlement is damaged during real time battle, like a catapult blowing up a building, it will show up on the campaign map and will have to be repaired if you own the city or decide to occupy it. you'll also have to deal with climate change, in where over the in game years it gets colder. forcing you to adapt or move your faction south.   all in all, if you like total war or are a fan of the series like me, you'll like this one. personally, I enjoy attila as much as I did with medieval 2 total war, and I liked 2005 barbarian invasion more so then 2004 rome 1. so this game (which is pretty much barbarian invasion 2) just worked for me. BTW the family tree system is back in attila total war.",

The thing that annoyed me the most was I had to unisntall steam and loose everything just to play it, Basically I got the game around Christmas time and it worked, I stopped playing total war untill the other day, And Attilla would not load at all, It wouldn't even go to the launcher, So I tried deleting the game and re-installing, That didn't work, I guessed steam was having problems... So I took it to the extreme and deleted steam and everything in it loosing all my game saves and everything. The game finally worked.. So if you have that problem that is the only way I know how to save it (I tried things given by support none of them worked)...  But on the Bright side I can now play as Saxons and demolish Frank pre-frog scum.... :D  (P.S.

The start positions for the nations are hordes are all interesting and offer a good opportunity for large range of options. The battles are interesting and the units are much more dependant on local superiority and quality rather than simply throwing them at one another.   Now onto the bad. The Unit Rosters are thin, and the units themselves are quite bland. No more professional Legions for either the WRE (Wetern Roman Empire) or the ERE (Eastern Roman Empire) which is quite sad. Honestly they look like hired barbarians clad in chainmail with rough shields rather than professional soldiers, which I guess to a degree is accurate for the time period but those beautiful Legions will be missed. Though I believe the modding community will fix these lacking points in time. Over all the game to me has many possibilities and I look forward to the community expanind the Game like in Rome II.

NONE. yes historically archers wouldnt have done much damage but there are holes in sheild walls, not every single part of a man is armoured and there are gaps for eyes etc.  -They NEED to buff units like palantina. elite units absolutely wreck the units which are still decent infantry, but cannot match more elite units. like they dont put up a fight. they kill about 4 and rout. noble germanic swordsmen have decent stats, even when upgraded, they get absolutely shredded like a russian in ww2. it is a complete joke. you are forced to use the most elite infantry, once again, ERE will win on that front too.  -The units are too hard to click on in game, i am constantly missing units and its really annoying, the little squares are too small and you cannot drag an area to select all of the time, sometimes it doesnt work.  -One last thing is the game itself. In multiplayer battles there are a lot of glitches, with people getting booted from the lobby for no reason, the game slowing down when someone has a ♥♥♥♥ internet/computer, it goes to very slow speeds and makes a game unenjoyable. i dont think ive played a siege yet at a proper speed. my game has crashed quite a lot also.  This game has a fun multiplayer, don't get me wrong, but i just cannot see the replayability for it because it is not based on skill, more on army compositions and i fear ERE is going to be very overused.  Buy it for campaign and casual multiplayer, it excels there. serious MP players, go get m2tw, its the best total war there is, this game has nothing on M2TW.",

Don't expect very much variety on that score (even with the DLCs!!).

The diplomacy function is useless, no one wants to trade with you, make peace with you, do anything with you.

With five settlements you might be able to field 1.5 stacks, with one settlement the enemy can field two full stacks, a decent chunk of which are mercenaries. When you use the encyclopaedia to look things up (such as what buildings you need for which units) it doesn't tell you, at least not that I've found. Raiding your lands (but not the settlement) isn't an act of war. Tributary states break away at will and declare war on you at will. The Sassanids are so overpowered it is a joke, their satrapies seem to do all their fighting (and winning). Trade is pointless as it doesn't give you enough income to bother trying. Your threat level seems to increase with each turn, even if your empire/army size is not. The longer you last the more people hate you regardless of how big or powerful you are. Alliances are pointless, no one has come to my aid when I've asked and when I've declined to come to theirs they just declare war. The units are all the same for most factions, in both styling and colours. Recently resettled provincial capitals can somehow last for three years under siege. Essentially what it comes down to is you'll be punished for being successful. I never ask anyone to help me in war but as the Sassanids your satrapies will often decline to declare war and therefore calim independence. As such they then go all Attila the Hun on you as you try to fight six different nations at once. One governor declared independence and a civil war started, this somehow dropped my inflow of food from 340 to -25. He had a single settlement, just one, and yet fields two full stacks of high end troops. I liked the family tree and arranged marriage from Medieval 2 but that's about it.",

Unfortunately, i find Attila to be utterly disappointing. While the setting is very cool and having that 'doomsday is coming feeling' in sense of climate changing and Huns as the game's boss, everything else is shaky at least. What bothers me the most is the fact that the Creative Assembly has tried to artificially increase the complexity of the game. I mean TW has always been famous for its magnificent and epic battlefields, if i want to play complex strategy games i'll go for Paradox Interactive. Here the complexity in terms of food and public order is absolutely absurd. I mean it makes expanding as barbarian (only factions i've tried) nearly impossible. In my most recent playthrough as Alemanni, i spent most of the game running back and forth 3 settlements and putting down the rebellions. Every second turn a rebellion would pop up! Another contraversial thing is the number of DLCs. I find myself to be neutral about that. Honestly they aren't worse than other companies concerning this, although there's quite a number of pay to unlock factions. I don't think it's worth it though, at least for those DLCs i've purchased as the factions are very similar. Maybe pay for the campaign if you are interested but that's expansion not DLC really. Overall i do feel this could have been done much better and eventhough Rome II had very buggy launch i find it to be more entertaining than this title. I am still looking forward to Warhammer: Total War. ",

A great example of a proper DLC that is worth paying for is Fallout 3 Game Of The Year Gold Edition. The expansion includes several missions and campaigns that extend the game in several aspects adding 80+ hours of worthwhile gameplay.    In the end, I love all Total War games and support their efforts, but how about they start respecting the player by adding the DLC that is expected with the game (factions, soundtracks and additional graphic upgrades). Just charge 10-15 bucks more if necessary with initial purchase. Console games are 60$ plus (up to 120$ if you buy accessories specific to game with purchase). If the PC gaming commmunity is to survive then PC gammers need to be respected and their wants attended too. Lets get real, and do this RIGHT!",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I have owned every single Total War game since the first shogun and have been playing these games since I was 10 years old. That being said, I think this is the freshest Total War game in a long while.   The Ai is the smartest in the series thus far, it will flank, it will outmaneuver you on the campaign map and it will kick you around if you are not paying attention. The best part is that the AI will no longer sit by as you rain death upon them with ranged units (usually). It is still not perfect however, they will still do stupid things every once and a while, like build an army with 10 war dogs units or put their siege engine in a stupid place. I have also noticed that for the first time ever, I have seen the AI take a lot of Mercenary units to flush out its ranks.   Where this game really shines is in the sieges, they are beautiful. Fires destroy whole villages, smoke effects are top notch, and projectiles look incredible for the first time in series history. The AI also shines here, using choke points and barricades to beat me up and keeping ranged units in just the right places to fire on me.   I have always found myself becoming bored with the battles in other Total War games after about 40-50 turns and using auto-resolve whenever I didn't need to fight a close battle because they all started to blend together and loose the excitement. This has not been the case in Attila. Every fight feels fresh, each encounter I feel challenged, and I often found myself being emerged in the battles in a way I never had before. There is a strange cinematic experience in Attila that has not been there since the first Shogun and Medieval, I am not sure if it is the AI, the graphics, or the sense of desperation in every move that gives it what so many of the recent games have been lacking but I am glad it's back and I hope it is here to stay.   When you win that battle there are now several options for what to do with the newly taken settlement. Most talked about is the ability to destroy settlements, this removes them from the map and leaves a little marker where the settlement was. You will gain some cash from this as well as food. Be warned however, rebuilding settlements is extremely expensive, a small lvl 2 town was going to cost me 13,000 cash and 600 soldiers to rebuild. One of the lesser publicized features is the ability to pillage settlements. This will damage all the buildings, and give you some cash but leave the city in the control of the other faction. This is useful for when you send a small army (or navy!) to attack an unprotected settlement but don't have the army to fend off the attack yet. Then you have the pillage and settle option which is a combo of the settle and pillage actions, meaning you damage all the buildings and get a lot of cash but also settle the town. Last you have the regular settle and subjugate options.   Winter is coming. Winter will kill men if you get caught without protection, the attrition is pretty steep and I love it.   City management is improved here too, all city’s (villages, towns, ect.) can have a governor who will both act as a general if the city is invaded (using the garrison troops) as well as allow you to place edicts on individual towns. This makes owning one piece of a region a lot more bearable, and doesn't force you to invade people just for that extra bonus.   I am trying to keep myself from getting to excited from this game, I really do love it but I also don't want to seem too fanboyish. I am just extremely happy to have a very good Total War game for the first time in a while. As of this moment I don't want to give a score of the game, I will save that for my first update after I have many more hours in game. I will say that if you are a fan of the series and you are worried about another Rome II, don't this is everything Rome II should have been.   I will keep this review up to date for at least the next few weeks incase something crazy comes up and ruins the game. ",

            "review_text": "tl;dr For me Attila is the best Total War product since Rome 1 when it comes to immersion, maybe Shogun 2 could beat it here but only in its current (bug free-ish) state. When it comes to playability / bugs this one *really* shines (if you know the problems previous Total War games had this is not that hard), at least after the first patch.   I love the Rome franchise and I dislike the Shogun franchise. Nevertheless Shogun 2 was my favorite Total War game until now. You may ask yourself 'Why is that? The Emperor Edition of Rome 2 fixed most problems' and that is true. The thing is, CA never managed to fixed the most important point in a game: Immersion. Rome 2 just lacks immersion. It feels like a game with a simple game mechanic (which you can see and feel all over) and nothing more.  Attila changed this. My god, this game has great immersion! This starts with the graphics -- the darker look and feel, the zoom factor -- and ends with tons of /new/ or improved features. You will find many of these 'small things' that make you dive into the world of Attila. As a long term Total War player you will have feelings like 'Oh my god my ranged troops with fire ammunition can burn down the forest in front of my spear wall!'   Since there are tons pros I don't want to enumerate here, let us focus at the cons.  Pro: +++++++++++++++++++ Immersion (thanks to many small things, new or improved features and bug-freeness)  Cons: - The ingame encyclopedia doesn't reference or even show everyting (e.g. when a building enables recruiting of a specific unit) - The UI doesn't show everything you need at a glance so you *must* use the ingame encyclopedia. - Religion only leads to very few problems. Some religions should lead to hate for each other. Also changing a religion should be more painful (e.g. your family doesn't care) - The family tree can become unclear quickly. - The viking forefathers factions of the viking (pre-order) DLC feel very much the same. (-) Very similar troops for factions of each culture. (-) I'm not sure how useful navies are since armies can move quite far on sea. (-) CA re-used many things from Rome 2 which is OK since Attila is some sort of a standalone expansion to Rome 2 but I fear they will abandon the game much faster than Shogun 2 or Rome 2. Nevertheless, I would die for having a Medieval 3 game expanding on Attila.",

I cannot however understand the faction DLCs and campaign DLCs, it's annoying to see already three additional factions being available and probably more on the way. Additionally a new campaign has just been announced, whereas the main game didn't feature any campaign whatsoever.

            "review_text": "TLDR - Sux!  Review in progress after 50 hours here are my thoughts.   Jan 1016   Attila is a good total war game that is brought down by obvious stupid design decisions. Other review steam reviews go way more in depth but here are my two cents. I don't understand why these design decisions were made when it seems so obvious what the consequences would be but that's CA for ya.  -Agents- There's no real progression with in 2 points (1 level) agents are super assassins. While in other games you could specialize in sabotaging armies or buildings or good ol fashioned general killing. Here agents can become amazing at everything   -Generals - R2 made generals mandatory for armies so if your gen does get assasinated another is appointed next turn.  -Land/water - Another R2 thing. Armies 'magically' turn into boats to travels water, they don't need no ship. What this does is make islands/water tactically pointless. Sure ships are way better than soldiers in battle but units can cross water easily. Result - England being an island is pointless because an army can cross the English channel in one turn.   -Economy - Some of the buildings are neat and it does take some thought balancing religion/economy/military/happiness but i rarely had any economic challenges with having 100k in the bank.  Family - They tried something new here with internal and family politics but it doesn't really work. You have a family tree when you can marry off you daughters and son or appoint them to positions but it just becomes tedious after a while I just can't care about saving 3% on missile units or +5 food in a governed province when i have 100k in the bank. I get that CA is trying to do a 'Game of Thrones' style thing but I wasn't carrying after a while and was just appointing at random to play faster.  Basically CA took out all the stuff that worked in Shogun 2 and put in stuff that doesn't work. From my prospective it seems obviously that this stuff wouldn't work from the start but hindsight is 20/20.  Going back to Shogun 2.",

The war against the Sassanids and their numerous allies was not going well and the filthy easteners were preparing for a final push. Northern barbarians had pushed into Thracia and would burn down the gold mine there, one of the biggest sources of income for the Romans.The Emperor Arcadius was stablizing Armenia and the Africans were pushing from the west. There were 3 Legions guarding the gateway city between the Empire and the savages. the Lord had sent them a vision of what was to come, defeat, death, blood. The 3 generals, all distinguished and honorable men, knew what had to be done. Vindonius, the best of them, the man who had defeated countless invading armies led his noble 2,000 into the endless dunes. Each Roman knew they would not live to see their homes, their wives, their children, but they did not run, did not cower away, for they were romans, not some raving band of undisciplined heathens. The gathering horde of 10,000 was waiting for them. The proud romans charged their ranks, brothers in arms and one with the Lord. After the 8 years of war, the Sassanids were expecting unmotivated, weak willed farmers, but what met them on that field was more than that. What they encountered was a band of brothers, men of culture, schooled in the arts and bred for war. They fought not only with the fire of honor and brotherhood, but with the fire of civiliazation and their faith in God. The rising sun behind them illuminated the world as if it was a visual represetation of their determination. They fought like lions and pushed the barbarians back. But even the heavens could not change their fate. Even as 10 Easteners fell, a Roman fell beside them. Some from arrows, other from their expert horsemen, and many from the spear and sword. Even as each one of their generals fell one by one, they pushed back against the Romans. by the fall of night, all that was left was Vindonius and his honor guard. They all defended their general to the last. But as the sun fell on this crimson day, so did Vindonius. The honorable 2,000 put down the swords of their mortal lives and took their rightful place at the hand of the Creator. the mighty trumpets sounded as they marched into the Kingdom of God and great rains were sent to the sacred ground to wash away the death. It is said rivers were formed by the weeping of widowed wives and orphaned children, but because the Sun fell on Vindonius, it rose once more for Rome. The 4,000 remaining barbarians were dleighted despite their heavy casualties as they thought that they had just won the war. Surely the last embers of resistance would be put out by the cold air filling the place of their beloved General? Surely the men of learning and luxuries would come to any terms the Sassanids wished. But their hopes were misplaced. For with the final breath of Vindonius, that ember of hope he carried in him blew to the tinder box of Rome and ignited a roaring fire. Filled with the last gift Vindonius had to give they marched with renewed vigour, fought with fiercer determination, and the seemingly depleted legions filled with those ready to fight. The tide was turned and the Romans marched to their enemies, The light of Rome would never die out!",

The fixes are a welcome addition from a buggy previous game. I would definitely recommend this game.  EDIT: The new freeLC is much better and actually makes up for the blaitant rip off Creative Assembly DLC they were releasing before. The free factions give a new way to play, especially Lakmids, playing as a puppet is a interesting concept.",

While UI is improved it still bad, espicially combat UI. Instead of throwing torches, gates can be broken with melee weapon, brilliant. Repetative battles over the same cities. Absolutelly terrible unit roster(espicially barbarian). Campaign is suffering from poor game design decisions too. Imperium rising from research, Atilla who need's to be killed 5 or 6 times on the battlefield to be actually killed. You can't even create a low level units after research. And there still ridiculous DLC milking, like Blood or cutted factions like longbeards, which is already in game  So.if you still want to buy this game- wait for a massive discount(like 75%). If you just want a game about this times- go get Barbarian Invasion instead.",

After 2 hours stright play I have to say I'm glad I held off. The only word to fit this is disapointing. Unit stats are pushed into an overuse of the encyclopedia resulting in a noticable delay every time you want to look up stats on any unit rather than just hovering over and getting them in an immediate popup. The grand campaign thrusts you into immediate problems without giving any opportunity to set up how you want your empire to be run. While there are some positive aspects like the return of the family tree and assigning offices, this is too greatly offset by the negative aspects that weaken the game as a whole and deviate it too far from the what made Total War a great game series. I hope Creative Assembly learns from these mistakes and returns the next installment to being the fun exciting game the majority of the series has been by focusing more in gameplay rather than graphics.",

The world feels dark and gritty, and like it's out to kill you. Which in my opinion, is awesome.  The unit movement is some of the best in the series, your units actually follow your orders  The family tree and politics system is back in and it makes the non-battle parts of the campaign so much more interesting.   This game might not be perfect, or even near perfect but I believe it's a thousand times better than ROME II.

Whether you play as the Roman Empire desperetly trying to maintain its large borders, the Norsemen from Sweden, and Denmark, or even the Scourge of God, the huns, the campaign feels amazing to play. The game plays very similar to Total War: Rome II, but then again this was to be expected. A good comparison to this game would be how Napoleon was to Empire.    ATTILA's Rankings   Bugs/Glitches - 9/10 Through my playing of this game, I have not encountered many bugs, and most of them were graphical bugs that should be fixed in a patch or two.  Graphics - 8/10 Though the graphics are very similar to Rome II, ATTILA has a darker and sharper feeling than its predecessor. The only problem with them is that occasionally, I get a random frame drop when I zoom into the action, but if you have a nice computer, you should be able to run this with ease.  Gameplay (Battle) - 7/10 ATTILA has made some progress over Rome II, however the battlefield AI is still not perfect and will sometimes make headscratching decisions. Despite a few flaws, the AI is very playable and a large step up from Rome II.  Campaign - 8/10 For me, ATTILA's campaign rivals such great campaign experiences of Shogun 2 and Empire Total War. I have found that (On Hard Difficulty) the AI makes clever moves and usually presses the advantage when it has an obvious one. A drawback to the experience is that it sometimes feels that a nation will declare war on you for almost no reason at all. The diplomatic system in ATTILA is, however improved. AI now make reasonable demands and will atempt to make peace if they are losing the war badly.  Interface - 10/10 In ATTILA the interface and advisor help have been fantastic. Even though I do not need to use the advisor helpthat much as i am an experienced total war player, it helped me through the new features of the game in detail.  FINAL ATTILA RATING - 8.5/10 The game is beautiful and fun, however i believe that the slight lack of AI inteligence and minor glitches bump it down a notch.  How ATTILA stacks up against other totals wars ive played (Based on fun factor ive experienced.) Rome 1 &lt; ATTILA Medieval 2 &lt; ATTILA Empire &gt; ATTILA Napoleon &lt; ATTILA Shogun 2 &gt; ATTILA Rome 2 &lt; ATTILA ATTILA beats 4/6 Total War Games. (67%)",

Day 1 Viking Forefathers Culture pack (17th Feb) Day 7 Longbeards Culture Pack (26th Feb)  So whats next guys? 7 days after that we get drip fed another DLC, each time unlocking more units?  Currently as it stands this is mocking us, paying full price for essentially a fixed Rome 2 and then drip feeding us the factions that are supposed to come with the game?  I can understand campaign packs or new factions which clearly werent made for day 1 release date, but witholding factions and releasing them bit by bit, especially when the factions are already full of copy paste units?  Of course someone in CA listens somewhere finally, otherwise Attila wouldn't be the game we wanted from Rome 2 (still a few bits missing sure but were closer), so we can sit and hope that they value long term gains over short term gains.

            "review_text": "As with Rome total war the review is roughly the same.  The game here is solid, it's classic total war. Great graphics, in depth strategy, hundreds of hours of content here. Most technical issues have to do with the fact this is a very demanding game on ones system. However with a powerful enough system the Battles are stunning, the attention to detail both historically and visually is great. Now the problem with the game has nothing to do with the game, but rather segas terrible dlc system.  $75 of dlcs on top of a $45 dollar game.   This is not as bad as Rome 2 which is still $60 and has $85 I. Dlcs.  This is a shame to see in what is such a beloved franchise. Now I am not against dlcs, or individually pricing them at this rate. But with no option to have a season pass,which is standard on nearly every AAA title that plans on doing dlcs; there is no other conclusion to draw other than that sega is squeezing te gamers for every penny. Now while most of these dlcs are a welcome addition to the game, one in particular has drawn the ire of I'm sure every total war gamer.  The blood and gore dlcs that have been seen in shogun 2, Rome 2, Attila 2, and I'm sure Warhammer, is nothing short than proof of the fact that sega is sticking it to gamers and bleeding them dry. This 'dlc' should have been in game at time of release and it's quite sad that what was once a beloved franchise has to resort to penny pinching.  Alternatively look what Bethesda with the fallout series has done, heck even the behemoth call of duty has a season pass. Come on sega do the right thing. Overall if you have $100 plus to spend on Attila and it's dlcs than go for it, but if you are like the rest of us who have bills, and money that does not grow on trees, wait till it goes on sale.",

Even at 75% off, Attila will waste your time if you find the battles are mere slide shows.   It baffles me how poorly optimized Attila is. Instead of the game engine spreading around the workload to the multiple cores found in every modern CPU, Total War games still dump most of the load onto a single core of your CPU, effectively wasting more than half your processor's power. And why do Creative Assembly persist, seven years later, game after game, in using this game engine that was already obsolete in 2009?   At least Rome II, after 17 patches, is acceptably optimized. Barring the release of further optimization patches for Attila, I would recommend Rome II instead.  And please CA, in future games, rewrite your engine to use all our modern CPU's power - multi-core and 64 bit. Enough is enough. Total War shouldn't be hamstrung by this ancient coding.",

            "review_text": "i don't know what to say anymore.  Attila TW is a good game.   Sometimes i swear they are releasing these titles just too close to each other for there to be any real difference or reviewable content.  So I am going to cut to the chase about total war games. If you haven't played any total war games you should play Rome total war the original. Now, I'm not being an old fart and trying to make you play a bad game with awful graphics because RTW is still, by contrast of todays games, still very pretty. It has some terrific units and the combat is some of the best on the TW series and against all the other TW games it is a serious competitor.  Its really a highly must have RTS. TW Empire is also one of a kind and an epic game set in a slightly more modern world I would consider it a TW essential much like RTW. Shogun 2 TW has some truly epic combat moments that you can only experience in shogun 2 but the world map is useless and after 20 turns the whole map is populated with just a few factions and diplomacy just trails away into asking for peace treaties that never last, even fully modded with radious mod the map does not last long enough. Rome 2 is a fair game and die hard fans of RTW should give it a shot, however i only really feel that by playing the romans would you get the full Rome 2 experience as most the fun combat situations seem geared toward roman tactics and the other faction tactics seem to not be as immersive or suitable for the style of play they tried to capture from RTW original.  That brings us to Attila total wars.   They have added some awesome content similar to plotting against your family or royal court. Some of the content just feels a little rushed though like for example the Picts were well know in British empire as nomads and were for a considerable time only allowed female leaders, however this is not in the game. On most units (something i adored from previous titles) the unit descriptions as mostly none existent and quite often talk about other ranting's unrelated to the unit. The tribes are all a little muddled its like no one took time to research or make sensible assumptions about what territory belonged to what tribe and importantly what areas would have been considered 'no-mans land' which was a very important part on ancient history in the ancient world. Instead it is all sort of vague and computer gamey which you could forgive but previous war games have been very detailed even if wrong it had immersive value as if somebody had tried really hard.  So what I mean by all this is Attila TW has lost a really important part of its gameplay and that is being able to right click on a units and read all the interesting things.  I have not been able to find a way to give land away in diplomacy which is really essential in most modern RTS as it ads to the plotting and general immersion and I'm a little disappointed its no longer available and the old RTS strategy of 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' seems to be slipping out of its content. i would also have liked to be able to plot against others even if the results were only slight or restricted to non family members in my family. it wouldn't have been hard to implement but it seems there are no options for plotting against people outside of your royal court or family even when they are in your family tree they just sit there taking up space, Awesome.  -this is just a good idea-  I would have liked it if there were options to capture other family members after a war for ransom and torture. Depending on the torture method the said family member would get a new trait, like blind or frail disposition. torture could reveal insights or just serve as warnings to others they then would be able to ransom family members back. Torture could be different for example the Europeans had a habit of displaying prisoners for weeks sometimes months in public with little food or water, the middle eastern counties had a habit of blinding prisoners and the roman and Greek countries regularly castrated their prisoners.  So to sum up it feels rushed. It is rushed. Its very similar to Rome 2. It has good ideas but they never really started to blossom. The combat is fine and similar to some of the finest TW battle you can have. Its even a very good game and I'm sure I will play if many more times and I also recommend it.  --edit--  i would also enjoy the game more if i didnt have to pay for blood effects with that in mind i wont be making anymore total war reviews in the future.  when i pay for a game i dont expect to be asked for more money unless there are new parts of the game to explore. i mean the difference is between game enhancement and stuff that should already be in the game things like gore, units and playable factions that were in the initial release should be included in the game on release. it just lazy to try to force people to pay for that sort of content.  if for egsample there was a new campaign and it enhanced gameplay significantly this is accectable. but i own all total war game up to date some i have paid for twice and i have always paid for all dlcs. if they release the gore DLC again im just going to play my old total war games and im pretty sure im not alone on that.  release sensible content or dont make as many sales.",

            "review_text": "Ok I've not played a huge amount and I've encountered one bug already but this game feels like its going to be a great total war title. The graphics are crisp and clean, the load times are far from extensive the new features bring some really nice new aspects to the game play, from roaming hordes to settlement defences everything that's been added really adds to the total war experience but fits in smoothly with the mechanics.   In the short time I've played this compared to my time playing Rome 2 this game has that sparkle that the previous titlle is still missing somehow. I've not been able to put my finger on whats wrong with rome 2 but as someone that's played every Total War game since Medevial 1 can say its missing something that drives me to finsih campaigns or to keep hitting the next turn button that the previous titles had, gladly Attilia has that back and it feels refreshing to play!  This is before looking at the far more user friendly interface and ability to bring up information when needed compared to Rome 2 (the best comparision because they run on the same engine), the return of family trees and the more structured agents and politics screens bring back a far more instantly recognisable structure that is instinctive to utilise, making the game far less irritating and actually faster paced as you have most information needed on the screen before you where in Rome 2 you could need to navigate multiple screens and tabs to find the relevant data making the gameplay feel slow and rather tedious at times.  Now I'm not saying this games perfect, as I said I've already encountered a scripting bug in the prologe and the way creative assembly hits us with DLC and minor expansions can often send the base games cost spirialing into silly proportions but this I beleive is going to be a fantastic total war game and one I really would suggest picking up to any hardcore fan like myself that's sitting on the fence following rome 2. I picked my copy complete with Viking Forefathers DLC for £17 yesterday with the help of google so its far from a high end priced game and while I tend to pick up the DLC's I wait until I get 75% off them during sales etc making my overall investment rather low.   While I fully recommend this title I would be remiss not to mention the fact that I agree with the various topics posts claims that this game is what Rome 2 should have been and the fact that this game has been made following the endless issues with Rome 2 is somewhat of a kick in the groin to players like myself. Rome 2's interface, AI optmisation, bugs, graphical issues to name just a few issues were beyond poor, even the core feature to gameplay it introduced the ability to combine land and sea forces was awful, I still avoid playing navel battles in rome 2 at the moment its such a nightmare to control and is glitchy as hell, the only saving grace was the massive Emperor edition release which did a huge amount to improve the game but still failed to deal with the fact the the user interface being poor and the players access to information was long winded kills any addictive qualities it may have otherwise had.   Anyway that's enough moaning, Atilla is addictive, being fast paced with cleaner graphics and more features both in battles and on the campaign map than any previous total war title. It's going to have bugs and there will be lots of additional DLC's but don't let that spoil your fun because this games going to get played the hell out of!",

            "review_text": "To start off I am a huge fan of the total war franchise so for those of you that see this being too big of a bias this review obviously is not for you. But, I will try and be as objective as humanly possible.  To date this is my favorite title of the entire series of total war games. I did not like Rome 2, at first I did but going on hour 10 and more into the game my opinion started to diminish. That is for numerious reasons, different title, I am not going to get into that. However it seems to me that Attila is the real materialization of the vision behind Rome 2. This is coming from the media pieces and such that I have seen with regards to Rome 2 and some about Attila. With all that being said I will get into the things I really enjoy about this game.  Some old mechanics are back, such as the family tree. Very cool cause the internal dynamic of your entire has stuff going on and CA has really implemented some meaning things here. Its almost like there is a mini game here that impacts the bigger picture. We got layers, and they seem useful. It is not perfect by any means and there are things that can be done here, but what they have works.   The battles are what you would expect no surprise there and they are as satisfying as they have been. There are a few small things that really complement this department, such as details and and sieges. What I like most about the battles is the different play styles and troops. I can be succesful with many different styles and I haven't really seen this in any other total war game. That is why this is my favorite of all of them. Sure Rome 2 had a bunch of different troops but create an army of heavy roman inf and they are pretty much unstoppable. In attila you got four real different styles of combat, which really adds 'flavor' to the game. To give background about myself, I am a hard to very hard type player, and i usually like playing factions that have harder than normal starting positions. I could have completely dropped the ball in all the other games and missed this aspect of them by a long shot, who knows.   In this title I feel like I am getting more of a complete package of grand strategy. I have to deal with numerious things all in all that have not taken away from my desire to crush an army in tactical combat.   Now from some of the things I do not like.   Having close to 140 hours, I would say the first 20 were tough as I was trying to figure out how the game plays out. I like to think I am quite familar with total war and this game can be quite punishing. I almost want to say there is a more linear way to which this game plays out for alot of the factions. Linear as in there are a good number of things you should do otherwise you are going to get punished. There are alot of factions in this game although we are only given a taste, which im sure will be release more and more with DLCs (which in my opinion is actually good business), I just dont like it. It is pretty hard to find things in this game that I don't like, as I am sure there are tons of internet people that could go on for hours and hours bashing and bashing. Yeah there are alot of things that could be done to this game im sure, but it is pretty darn good. I definitely recommend it! For those not familar with grand strategy this game has a learning curve but not as bad as some titles out there.   Out of five stars, i give attila 4.75",

But in the initial period of playing 'Total War Attila' | did not like it very much (first impressions) as it was too involved, and in comparrison to 'Rome II' was hard to enjoy as to it's complexity - but other 'Total War' titles such as 'Empire Total War/ Napoleon Total War and Shogun Total War were simple 'Total War' games as now they are considered older franchise - but 'Medieval Total War' was one of the earliest games for the 'Total War' series and this introduced the 'Family Tree' to the Total War players - i have now played enough as to write a review - i since have played enough hours to say that i totally love 'Total War Attila' - just playing in the campaign i can see the most complex details added to this game, where 'Rome II' was a simple game to be enjoyed - but 'Attila' is also a game to be involved in, so 'Total War Attila' is the original 'Total War' that the developers intended - that is why so many 'Total War' players are enjoying 'Total War Attila' at the moment as it rings true to the original concept of a 'Total War game' and I think that players of the franchise are more demanding so in my honest opinion 'Total War Attila' is one of the first 'Total War' games that will be 'In Depth' enough for players to actually control their settlements totally and to choose their Religion,allies and enemies with great more care. Overall I think 'Total War Attila' is a great step in the future where players have more controll over their faction than ever before!!! - 'Total War Rome 2' 10/10 - 'Total War Attila' 10/10 and because of this new family tree and more control over the faction you control :) but to anyone playing for the first time - if you love the 'Total War' franchise and are expecting more from 'Total War' you will not be dissapointed - such a great game :)",

I will even hold off buying this type of game cos i know it will eat up my time shamefully.

            "review_text": "An amazing new addition to my Total War collection. The new 'horde' mechanic is awesome, as is the immigration and fertility (and the way razing works). So far I have completed a campaign as the Huns and as the Geats. Both were much fun. The politics system, the economy, additon of governors and ability to assign somebody as a retainer to gain experience from another character, and the diplomacy I feel are all greatly improved over the old Total War mechanics.   Also the agent abilities I feel are finally about where they should be. They are somewhat expensive to use every turn to keep an enemy weak, and they aren't as OP as they were in all the past games. In Shogun 2 and Rome 2 I was practically winning wars with agents and never even declaring war, just sweeping in to take the land from the rebels after my agents did their work. That takes more time and a much larger investment now, and the agents aren't as 'sneaky' so you take the same diplomatic hits as if you had declared war anyway.  Right now I'm playing as the vandals and have roamed across Italy, Germania and Gaul sacking and razing to amass a small fortune of about 120,000 talents. I subjugated all the minor factions I encountered along the way and they pay me tribute still. I loosely followed the historic path of the Vandals, but decided to settle a bit earlier and in southern Spain. I ended up settling in Carthago Nova and taking half of Spain from Western Rome very quickly. Now most my former enemies that pay me tribute are very happy with me for beating Western Rome into submission, and they followed my path through Gaul and are stronger minor empires now with 2-3 settlements each.   You might read this and think 'oh this sounds too easy'. But it's absolutely not. That fortune I gathered, all gone now. I even went bankrupt once and had to quickly go sack more Roman towns to gather money. At the same time I was dealing with food shortages and my soldiers were dropping due to starvation, and I was pretty close to a mutiny a few times. I had to put down rebellions, hire generals and governors, and with all the influence my lead character had gathered I also had to adopt these newcomers, and use all my influence to keep the political system in balance.  The navy mechanics are still a little quirky, when trying to land an invasion force it still feels like there just aren't enough places to land your ships. You end up with your forces being split up into a disorganized mass and keeping your artillery and archers on the ships to bombard the enemies closest to shore. Wouldn't it make more sense to just let the ships stack up a in 3s at the landing sites? When enemy ships are landed, you should be able to destroy them to clear a path and land right in the harbor. When fighting against a garrison force now I tend to just double up my navies and auto-resolve, though I could easily take most garrison armies with few losses by playing it through. The navy mechanics just annoy me so much that I don't want to play it out =) This is really something that I think should've been sorted out by now, and I was disappointed that when playing with a force of Viking raiders I felt limited in exploiting what should be the best of Viking abilities just due to game mechanics that haven't been figured out yet.  I would say the challenge level of Atilla is quite right, and I'm a player that has completed multiple 'legendary' campaigns in Rome 2. I think Atilla is a little more challenging. There's still the way of ezmoding it by 'unrest farming', where you keep a province in disorder just to continuously put down the rebellions and gain influence/xp/etc. But that seems kind of pointless in Atilla since picking on the Romans is much more fun!  Overall, I say great job to the CA dev team. You guys did great on this one. But we need more campaigns! I am saving my grand campaigns once I get a 'minor victory' and will resume them after I have completed with all the factions. Hopefully by then you'll have more campaign DLC =)  Many people pointed out this game could've been an expansion on Rome 2, and I agree with that. However, I didn't feel like I was cheated paying for this game. Developers need to make money and there was a lot of development time invested in this game. It does look like 'a new skin for Rome 2' on the shallow view, but after playing it for a while it becomes clear that many changes have been made.  I feel a lot of people gave this game unfairly poor reviews due to it being a 'new' game and not an expansion on Rome 2. It's sad that everyone wants something for free or cheap these days. That's why strategy games are hurting so bad. I say ignore those fools. When they are only left with f2p/p2w mmo games they will realize the error of their ways =) Keep charging a premium price for premium games and those people will still buy plenty of copies when it goes on sale.  And a side note: I haven't played multiplayer yet, but I've heard it is better and more stable than Rome 2.",

My point is, if you don't want to spend extra on DLC, you don't have to.  CA is a company that needs to make a profit like any other company.

It doesn't look good for them, but it's simple economics. The DLC is a nice addition, but is by no means required in order to get the full experience. It'll be a long time before I get bored enough with the vanilla cultures to warrant paying for new ones.   The diplomacy system seems chaotic at first, but most of the issues stem from balance design. AI is limited in its creativity and dynamic thinking, unlike the player, and so steps are taken to keep the challenge alive from beginning to end. Small bugs and imbalances are being fixed patch by patch, and CA seems to be quite attentive to player feedback.   I have an AMD processor and the optimization was wonky at first, preventing cinematics from running smoothly, but this issue has been fixed in the first patch. Loving the game and cutting this review short so I can play more.",

I've only played roughly 2 hours and I'm still looking forward to more.   However, let me get to my complaints. I love how this game looks visually in terms of GUI and graphics visuals. It's more darker, grittier and more grimer. They definitely reflect the barbaric tribes with the dirt and scraggly looks. It isn't all clean and shiny in terms of armor and appearances like Rome II was.  However, my complaints is within how small the faction access is. It simply needs to add in more, It feels lacking, and the balance definitely needs tweaking, especially with the morale structure. I've had units shatter easily and they've only lost 10 or even 5 guys. So it's a bit rough at this moment, but I could be doing something wrong in terms of my unit handling so I don't know. But take my review with a grain of salt, I've only played it for 2 hours and I haven't fully explored the full features of this game yet.   But would I recommend it a buy? My answer is a resounding yes. It's everything I wanted Rome II to be, and more. Will I return to Rome II after this? Of course. I definitely will be bouncing from different TW games through the years.   Two words: FAMILY TREE!  That is all. Now get to raiding!",

            "review_text": "What this Game has done is improve on the bones that CA created with Rome 2. In some cases it rips away the rotten flesh of poorly thought out ideas and bad concepts and adds way way more depth to the game play. Personally I was really excited to pre order this title and did so on solid copy rather than buy straight from the steam website. Downloaded really quickly and was quickly surprised from the offset as, and I will do this throughout the review i.e. compare to ROME 2, the initial loading screen is almost 1/4 of the time from Rome 2. The opening video is actually pretty good and what will b noticed once you pay the game through is that the video is linked to others in the game. Faction wise there is a fair amount to choice from, not as many as Rome 2 but half of those in that game where just off copy and paste. Like I said I reordered and so got the Viking forefathers pack but haven't started a campaign with them yet as I am way too caught up in my Saxon campaign. The campaign its self is actually kind of story driven. CA trying to keep a bit to historical accuracy but they have really pulled it off as you feel that the world as you know it is coming to an end. The game marks the major points of Attila's life and with each passing year the world gets colder and the men of the north are forced south in order to feed their children and escape the cold. Winter is coming.  To many this game will feel like what Rome 2 should have been and it can be seen that CA have really stepped up their game in this one. The graphics are not my main interest but it's worth noting that they are slightly better but in my opinion they are less cartoonish which is what I felt Rome 2's where. The landscape however in this game, especially in Britton where I have done the most of my fighting is amazing. The wet surfaces no longer look like plastic and the mud looks so real you want to just roll around in it. On the visual side I will add that the fire effects in the game are spot on as if taken from Farcry BUT, and this may be SEGA up to their old tricks again, where is the blood? Yes there was DLC in the last game but this is supposed to be about the world collapsing and death everywhere so why is blood not seen as a normal thing to have in a war game? Two games already have had us pay for that privilege so I can see this being another but for a DLC so cheap, I got mines for Rome on sale for £0.99, why not just include it.  Not wanting to go on a rant about DLC when it comes to CA and SEGA, what caught my eye before writing this review is that already there are new playable factions set up to be released as payable DLC. WHY? More German Kingdoms? More Greek states ring a bell. How many do you need. In a game where you can leave your starting position straight away if you want to, what but one or two new units do you get with it. Personally I feel that, even excluding the pre order factions, there are just the right level of factions in this game for it to be played a million times and not get boring. And instead of creating new DLC why not make a patch for the game. You know to stop it from crashing every few hours. Sorry guys back to the game. The features in this game such as family tree are just like shogun but better. The levelling system is so clear compared to Rome that it really shows that system for what it was. A shameful display. The family members and other important people in you faction are animated and can be seen to change gear depending on what you have them do. Even at that in this game you can have them do so many things such as gather support for your family so they stay in control to marry or govern provinces throughout your kingdom or Empire. I could talk for hours about what makes this game but for you, reader who has read this far, only one more to go and its a big one. Battles. In Rome 2 they were too fast, unrealistic and just not satisfying or fun. The problem is the engine that this game runs on, it's just not built to have the same types of slug fests that you get from the old games. However, by removing the need for a kill move to, well kill, the battles have become more realistic and more like the battles of old. Micro managing is no longer as big a pain as it used to be and with the cinematic camera taken out the game can be said to be moving back to its old roots in terms of combat.  I recommend this game despite the number of times is crashed on me or when it loads the frame rate drops for no reason so I have to start it back up again. The crashes I know will be patched in the future same with any bugs and the reason I don't really hold it against this game is because of what we got from Rome 2. That games launch was a disaster and in Attila I can see that CA have really tried hard on this one and it is a fantastic addition to the total war franchise. ",

            "review_text": "Waited for the game to come on sale due a general overall lack of trust towards the developer and i'm glad I did.  This should have been a DLC for Rome II in my opinion, the same way Barbarian Invasion was Rome I. It in no way feels like a new game.   The only addition is the ability to change your faction to and from a city based civilization into a roaming horde. This is the only positive I can find in the game.  The food, public order and now addition of squalor in your cities means you spend most of you time sitting around trying to figure an ideal build for each province not to get a high income or create good troops but to just manage those things. It makes the game feel more like a an ancient city sim rather than a game about waging war.  There is also a new feature where as you reseach new tech and unlock higher quality troops these troops replace the older ones so you can only recruit elite troops by end game which have stupid upkeep costs that make it not worthwhile at all.  An example of the upkeep issue is this: Say you're playing as the Huns with 4 hordes. Each horde has 10 of the tier 1 horse archers. You then upgrade the tech to mid tier horse archers. They are slightly better troops but the upkeep increases by about 200%. Basically to upgrade your 4 hordes requires a spare 8000 gold a turn to cover the cost. It will take a while to have that kind of money being generated. It's just a broken system that wouldn't be a problem if the new troops didn't replace the old ones.  Because of the need to balance every provinces needs. i.e. Food, Happiness, Squalor, you can no longer specialise provinces into money makers or troop makers. The main problem is without a positive food supply in a province that province gets a 25% decrease to wealth, it doens't matter if you make surplus food in another province. It's just stupid.  As your empire gets bigger you suffer ridiculous corruption penalties which end up reducing your income by 80% and guess what? There's no real way to reduce this faction wide. Only in a few provinces can you affect this by using a governor.  The mini game that is politics has been improved slightly but it's easy to handle and still tedious and only exists to stop civil wars basically. If this system was made to be incredibly powerful if handled well (maybe it could tie in with corruption) and dangerous if handled poorly then I could see a point to it but in its current state I'd rather it didn't exist at all. The senate feature from Rome I was better than anything in a modern TW which shows how poorly this game is developed if they can't improve on something that old.  Nearly all the factions feel the same. So many factions have 'Germanic Spears', 'Germanic Archers', Germanic Horsemen', that it feels like there's only 4 factions in the game. Germanic, Eastern, Roman and Huns. There just didn't seem to be much effort put into making the factions feel unique. Maybe the DLC factions have more variety to them but i'm not spending another £20 to unlock those just to find out.  Finally I find the time period boring but that's just a personal opinion.  Overall I paid £15 for the game so i don't feel ripped off at least but I genuinely wouldn't buy it if I had the chance to go back. I just get the impression this game was made without any passion from the developers and it resulted in a poorly designed and ultimately boring game.",

Im not sure if this is just an issue on my end, but playing an RTS with 10fps on the lowest possible settings, after having played Rome II on medium settings and getting 100fps, I cannot reccomend this game as it is due to Creative Assemblies signiture shakey game launches. Im sure this will be fixed in time with patches that offer optimization.   How does the game play? Well, it's basically Rome II but forwarded a few hundred years. The campaign in Attila unlike in Rome II is no longer 'newbie' friendly, as there is a much more fleshed out politics system, and the ai seems rather adept unlike the launch of Rome II. During my brief examination of the campaign playing as the East Roman Empire on the hard difficulty, I started losing territory to various horde factions, and found I had to manage my empire very efficiently. The AI was just as good in the battles. They use their advantages rather well, on offensive battles they will use their numerical advantage if present, or in defensive battles, fortify choke points, usually near the rather OP towers.  Online? I had a few games. it's what you expect of a TW game. Cavalry seems a bit too strong, where a decent charge from shock cavalry can ruin almost any infantry unit, but all it requires is some minor tweeks. Comically there is more of a use for pikes in Attila than in Rome II, as pikes make good support infantry, able to secure the center, or flanks of your battle lines, making it harder for cavalry to charge right through, or around your flanks. Bringing 2 sets of cheap pikes clutched me 2 wins out of 4 games.  Verdict: 06/10. There is a good game in there somewhere. wish i had the frames to see it. Ill leave my reccomendation as a yes, as others seem to play this game fine with lesser rigs. Although if you do plan to buy it, shop around. ♥♥♥ sold this for £20.

However, give that this is a Rome 2 expansion dressed up as a full price game, ANY bugs are pretty much unforgivable. There is no new technology here, no real improvements to the engine, graphics or AI. Almost all the changes are cosmetic or changes Rome 2 was crying out for from day 1, such as the family tree.  There are several new features that CA have taken from the Divide Et Impera mod, so well done to those guys, they've introduced more innovation that CA's internal dev team.  Any old school Rome players will recall the Barbarian Invasion expansion. This is almost exactly the same, but updated for Rome 2. The biggest new feature not seen in Rome 2, is the horde mechanic, but that is fundamentally the same as it was in Barbarian Invasion, so there really is nothing new here. There is no more content that there was in Barbarian Invasion, iinfact there is less as the shockingly small choice of factions demonstrates. But now we are asked to pay full price.  It all works well, and it's fun and in many ways a bigger challenge than Rome 2, but to balance that it brings back some stupid ideas from early days Rome 2, such as ridiculous high speed battles and pointlessly slow cavalry that are actually no faster at a run then foot skirmishers.  I've bought this game, and I enjoy it, but I didn't pay full price and if I had I would be extremely disappointed. My advice is wait until a Steam sale offering at least 25% off, then you might get your moneys worth.  This may seem a harsh review given that the game is of high quality and is a fun challenge to play, but given that there is NOTHING beyond the new campaign scenario here that should not have been in day 1 release Rome 2, it is clear that a full price release is nothing short of a cynical rip off and yet another example of CA dumping on its fans.

Attila does make quite a few improvements over its predecessor, but it also takes a few steps back as well. As the other reviewers before me have mentioned, things like horde mode are good, AI razing settlements is bad, etc, etc, etc. So I'm going to widely ignore what has been already stated numerous times by other reviewers.  Similarities that should not exist: 1. As can be guessed by the title, the game will be centralized around Europe. However, the map is almost exactly the same as Rome 2. I think there are only two more provinces in Attila and that's it.  2. The animations are exactly the same. The animations only differ slightly if you purchase the blood and burning DLC, and that just makes it so heads get chopped off in every other animation.   3. Despite the graphics being very similar, Rome 2 runs better at High on my PC than Attila does on low (performance/max performance) even though the graphics look worse at that setting. This becomes a big issue when I have custom battles with thousands of troops on the field because it drops to about 20 FPS even at those settings whereas Rome 2 never did that on High.   4. Most of the battle and diplomatic dialogue has been ripped straight from Rome 2.  5. Difficulties harder than Normal just means that the AI cheats, it doesn't get any smarter.   6. Many of the character models are reused.   7. You still have to pay real money if you want to see blood.   These are the primary things I noticed during my relatively short time playing this game. Some negative things I noticed that I haven't seen mentioned are that there are fewer factions that you can play as, and you can't get a mod to change this either. I'd also say that the projectiles for arrows look worse in this game than they did in the last.    ",

The only downside is the amount of DLC's you do not get when you buy this title. We are getting used to this and Don't Look Concerned about how the games industry has to bleed us for more coin. There must be a better way to package these games so we can buy as a bundle for people like myself who will get them eventually even if I have to wait for the sales ;) Enough of my babble now and will always be a player of these titles till the electric stops.",

Someone is listening because there is game dynamics being put back in the game that the fans love, unfortunatly it seems alot of the game directors aren't listening or not qualified in the slightest.  Case in point.   1) When towns and provinces go up in flames and get completely burnt there should be an auto feature to allow the town to grow to an entry level town with a new country invoved. This will help with the gameplay when you have no one to play with after everything gets burnt, becuase no one wants to play alone.  2) More Soldier unit types that actually mean something fun. Clones of stupid clones that every faction has, that comes with a new 'Blue-Stacey-Malibu hat' isn't fun at all. I'll buy that DLC if it actually is awesome.  3) Less food vrs politics drama. It is really inbalanced, or you could provided it as an option at the begining of the game. or use money/agent as an means to reduce it in the game.  4) MORE unique/diiferent historical soldier unit types.  It really isn't so hard. Take the best of the best and build on it. Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rebuild the structure of a already awesome franchise.",

One thing that does grate however is the ending razing by the Huns of anything they come across - though I suppose that this is realistic. A total lack of cities in provinces doesn`t mean no one lives there - it`s just in games terms that there`s nothing worth going there for unless you plan on a total rebuild of the province.

Time Period: This time period is WONDERFUL. You have the fall of Rome, rise of the Huns. viking raids and the Germanic raids of England all going on at the same time. Each brand of faction has its own soundtrack so they feel... Unique! Every faction is different then the other and makes you actually work to see what the faction can do well/cant do well.  Migration: There are a new type of faction in this game. They usually start in Eastern Europe and under supression from the Romans and or the Huns. You have 2 armies and your job is find a new home, along the way you must aid your troops and raid and plunder. The north is usually safer than the south, the problem is, farther north=colder which means more atrittion which means you might die if you dont migrate fast. If you DO find a home you can make a vast empire, or you can just stick with making camps and make more money on the go.  Different Styles for different people: In Total War: ATTILA you choose how you want to play, weather that be a strong empire trying to survive hordes of barbaric invasions, an on the go tribe that has to keep moving in order to survive, or a small nation ready to go on the rise. You choose your style and try them all out.  Romans are HARD TO PLAY AS!: I went into Attila thinking the Romans would be easy, DONT WORRY! They are not, they are hard to play as and a challenge plus they are a lot of fun.  Great Map: The map is great with the textures plus the text really adds to the mood.  Family Tree/Political: They changed it completley and i LOVE IT! In Rome 2 I would look at the events, choose an option and go back to war, in this you have to have strategy and manage your family's role throughout your empire.  Graphics: Great improvments from rome 2. Facial features are much better and foliage is a lot better.  Citizens in towns: Enough said, this is awesome.  FIRE!: Yours Archers can burn buildings which lowers the morale of the enemy while raising yours, it also spreads realistically so thats cool.  CONS:  DLC: This has to go into the cons, it is PATHETIC. I myself am fine with it but why charge people this much money for 3 factions and so much for blood (something that should be in the game)?  There are no big bugs... I cant think of anything else, this is the best Total War game to date. 9/10 ",

Pros  -Family Tree is back with many imporovements (i.e. arranging marriages between factions, divorce, assassinations, bribery, securing loyalty/support, which all have repurcussions) -Migrating factions, it adds an extra layer compared to your standard hold territory &amp; expanding philosophy in previous games -Graphics are slightly improved compared to Rome 2 -Less buggs/glitches when first released compared to Rome 2 in my opinion -Razing settlements is also a nice touch to this game, allowing you to have a great impact on enemy factions without the need to occupy and strain your own resources   Cons -DLC; My first impression when I first entered the grand campaign menu was how few factions their were. I was definitely disappointed that they made the Celts/Vikings/Longbeards DLC that you needed to pay for. I would be more forgiving if they had packaged them all into one much cheaper DLC because then it might have been worth it. But $8.79 for 3 factions or $26.37 for 9, it's almost half the price of the full game. Don't get me started with the Blood &amp; Burning DLC. -Units; I feel like their weren't enough diverese units for each faction -Buggs/Glitchs; Don't get me wrong there definitely wasn't as many glitches as Rome 2, but there are still buggs/glitches that occasionally pop up that the developers still haven't addressed yet. Sometimes while I'm playing there will be the occasional blinking of the terrain, which you should be wary of.  I've played as the Huns, Sassasinds, Western Rome, Picts, Franks, &amp; the Saxons. Western Rome is a little to much if you are new to these types of games, lots to deal with on the first turn like corruption, various enemy factions and hordes, large already established empire, and negative tresaury income. The Sassasinds are quiet easy, being on the very East and surrounded by client states. Picts are quite easy and fun as well being on the very north of Britannia. The Franks and Saxons are quiet similar and are decent factions, but I got pretty bored with them after 100-150 turns.

I deffinetly recommed Attila Total War, any big fan of Total War games with will deffinetly feel and see a good difference compared to previous titles, if you're new to Total War then I highly recommed you get this game with the knowledge of caution, for there will be a lot of DLC on the way with more playable factions, probably campaign packs with more immersive senarios and hopefully a blood an gore pack which will give you a much more bloodier warfare.",

The game plays like Rome II but with a lot more and improved features and is much more of a challenge.  -Better U.I system -The return of a Family Tree  -Much more immersive politics system - Much larger campagin map with a huge amount of settelments. -A new governer system(that allows you to place a general in a city which he will fight in if underattack with the garrison force, and allows you to place a edict without taking a whole province) -The return of movie cutscenes(which provides a more immersive story of the upcoming terror that is Attila, and gives you a background on which ever faction you are playing as with faction introduction cutscenes) -A nice balance of stats with all units, with a good amount of units per faction.(Even though I do have a problem with Britanian barbarian factions having Norse units and not their own, when even Arabian Factions have their own unit roster) -A new dynamic fire and siege system  -A new razing system which basically allows to have a Scorched Earth effect on a whole area on which whatever settlement you're razing. I deffinetly recommed Attila Total War, any big fan of Total War games with will deffinetly feel and see a good difference compared to previous titles, if you're new to Total War then I highly recommed you get this game with the knowledge of caution, for there will be a lot of DLC on the way with more playable factions, probably campaign packs with more immersive senarios and hopefully a blood an gore pack which will give you a much more bloodier warfare.",

There was 10x more time and effort put in it yes it has only 1 expansion pack THAT IS ACTUALLY BIG AND WORTH THE PRICE, WHILE ASWELL UNNECCESARY TO PLAY WELL.  Now they cut off a faction, add two units to it and sell it for 7 dollars. Release a campaign with copypasted units and call it an expansion pack.  What enrages me is that they pretend they 'placed a lot of effort in it'.   Nothing was improved in warhammer. Siege battles are a proof that CA does not care anymore about detail as it used to do, but instead just throws garbage out of the window; garbage that sells becasue of the many loyal customers and the good advertising.  I loved total war more than any other game and i was baited in Shogun2, Rome 2 and attila. Nothing improved, and sadly the past 5 years proved how much of a piece of trash CA became over our money while vomiting false promises.  IM DONE. I am done of your lies.

They should've just made Medieval 3 , as i loved medieval 2 i really wanted to see a medieval 3 title but meah , i guess they really want to milk some money for cheap content.

Every nations starts off with three or four times your army strength. This happens even if you play the easiest setting. You get attacked by five countries at the start before you can even think about building an army to match their strength. I have played several countries and hate the fact that you do not receive the same armies that your enemies start with. Within the first few turns your nation is crippled to the point you cannot play the expansion. I was not a big fan of the last Roman for the same reason. The Viking expansion was ok, I wish I would not have purchased it at full price.

            "review_text": "This is my first Total War game, and overall I would say I am very happy with it.   The Grand Campaign is challenging and fun if you play as either of the Roman factions or one of the many barbarian or steppe factions. Unfortunately the only Eastern faction you can play as is the Sassanids, who don't really have any challenges at all. The horde mechanic makes the barbarians and steppe factions very fun to play as, and makes defending against them a good challenge. The fertility loss adds another layer of desperation to the campaign as all the ai factions rush toward the most fertile regions at once. There have been several DLC faction packs, none of which I considered worth buying due to lack of interest in those factions and because many of them are pretty skimpy with making the factions very different from other barbarian factions. If you are interested in them then I guess they would be worth it in a sale.   AI seems pretty decent in the battle mode as well. Depending on the army composition it attempts fairly advanced maneuvers, nothing amazing though. On the defense it will react to your maneuvers and reorient appropriately and if it thinks it is in a poor position it moves to regain superior ground. On the attack it is much less impressive and only tries to flank if it has cavalry, I guess that is due to it being forced to attack. Naval AI is much less impressive, it is very easy to just kite them along with archer boats.   The siege escalation mechanic is a neat way to simulate an extended siege against a city. This makes it important to relieve cities that are under siege because the defenses can be broken down making the garrison very vulnerable. The city maps in general are pretty good, the unique ones (Rome, Ravenna, Constantinople and Ctesiphon) are very fun to attack/defend as well as being pretty amazing just to look at.   CA also released mod tools that let you do quite a bit with the game from fiddling with unit cards to creating new city maps. Unfortunately there is only a very basic tutorial, but if you keep at it then it becomes pretty easy to figure out what to do, and there is a fairly active community that you can get help from.   Negatives include the poor performance of the game, apparently it was designed for future GPU's despite being based on a game that is 2 years old and engine that is even older. If you don't have a very high end computer then it will be slow and it will not look very good. The tech trees for the Romans are also very stupid, the people at CA really subscribe to the Gibbons theory on why the Roman empire fell. Right now they have techs that severely hurt their long term viability by removing sanitation and public order buildings from being built. Also it is very annoying and downright stupid how expensive upgraded units are. They are not worth the slightly improved stats for how much more expensive they are. Fortunately there are several mods that fix the latter problems so they are only an issue if you use the base game. Really if you have any gameplay related qualms with the game then there is very likely a mod that fixes it.   tl;dr this is a good game with great campaign features, good modding tools, competent ai and lots of mods. Only downside for me is the performance of the game. If you are new to Total War then this is probably the best game to try.",

GOOD: -very detailed internal faction politics. you can generally keep things under control by spreading rumours about the people who you don't want to become powerful (and the occasional assassination) -Rome 2's combat without the bugs. it's a good, reaslitic feeling system, and again, troops replenishing by themselves is the BEST thing (that was the only problem i had with medieval 2, my armies spent too long being rebuilt after battles- often literally years) -More aggressive AI. you want to see a siege battle from the perspective of a defender? in R2 they didn't attack if i had even one extra unit inside the walls, but now i get to be on the defending side of some nice, interesting sieges. Also, they've improved town sieges with minor fortifications, so it's not just a battle with buldings in the way, it's a minor siege. -The huns. i'm told playing as the Hun hordes is fun, but personally i really enjoyed playing as the saxons because of the looming threat of the incoming hordes. i had massive battles, and a turn where, over three battles, i killed attila, destroyed four hordes, and sent a fifth one running. Terrific fun. -More varied events, more flavour to the game, and bonuses to go with your choices, -GENERAL AND AGENT NOW HAVE VISIBLE UPGRADE TREES. no more guesswork, or waiting for the in-game wiki to load, it's all there in front of you. PRAISE JEEBUS. -There's also a building guide which is quiker and easier to use than the in-game wiki. not the best UI for it, but it works and it's clear what it means.  BAD: -you might not like the fact that you have to pay attention to internal politics. at first i found it to be a bit of a headache, and unnecessary busywork, but a few years in i'd got to grips with the major do's and dont's -The DLC [Lest We Forget] -Something about the economies of the one-town-factions lets them build up to two full stacks of units. unless you can take their city on your first turn, ignore them until far later in the game or you will cripple yourself fighting a number of troops you generally won't see other than from rome or the huns  TL:DR This game is good. If you've played Rome 2, it's better than that. If you've not played total war before... start with the original rome, see if you like it. YOU DO NOT NEED THE DLC FOR THIS GAME. for example, if you want to play as one of the viking factions, but aren't so bonkers about it you're hesitation to spend the money, get the base game and try the saxons.",

The only advantage I had was the topography of the settlement, high up with narrow passages.  I defeated the first 4 waves by forcing the enemy into a narrow pass 'think 300' and using my cavalry to keep their ranged units on the run.  My 2000 strong army was able to defeat about 9000 units before the 5th wave overwhelmed me.  I felt a sense of great loss when my leader a 5 star general was killed. This game really draws you in and makes you think carefully about your decisions.  What you do in battle and how you do it is a major factor, not just who has the most units wins.  The landscape and unit usage is very important.  The family tree is a welcomed change that makes it both useful and entertaining. I have never seen so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in my life.  ",

Now first off, i wanna mention the low performance issues and what CA said about it:   'Taking to the Total War forums, an official Creative Assembly spokesperson outlined each of the graphics settings and explained why 'Extreme Quality' won't be the best setting for... well, anyone. ' Please note, that the Extreme Quality setting is meant for future graphics cards, not for current gen,' the spokesperson said. 'This is why it's above Maximum Quality.'  Nice Bu11sh*t.  Other than that, the game has little to no bugs. I had a crash once while i sent two agents at the same time on the same guy, the first one succeeded but i don't know, the code pattern was not meant for two agents to do that at the same time when one succeed so i crashed. Not really a big deal honestly.  Finally, when christianity religion chapter comes up, i hope your 5 billion men that you spent 120 turns building up to fight off the 7 armies of the huns are dissolved because the game will f*ck you up by breaking your food and money income. I don't know what happened but now my armies are starving with a BIG -100 food (and i own 22 settlements) and a big income of 120 compared to my previous turn that had 168 food and 11k income....  So, the day they'll fix their g0ddamn game and they'll stop bringing up lame a.ss excuses like 'oh, it's meant for futur pc that'll cost you 3 thousand dollars' i'll recommend this potientialy masterpiece.

Medievel 2 TW did away with a lot of the nonsense and it was probably the 3rd best of all TW games. This game needs to get rid of a lot of stuff that is not fun. The useless research (I don't own any cities but am researching city improvements?), the extensively complicated (who gives a crap) politics, the overly complex graphics and interface (that make it hard to understand the stategic situation), the annoying concept of 'integrity' (that only makes sense for very large armies not the small ones in this game), etc. The time period in general is not really very interesting. After the lackluster European TW, I thought the obvious choice for the next game would be the US Civil War that combined elements from Shogun 2 (i.e cannon and rifle units) with European Total War (i.e. strategic map). Instead, they decided to do an awful remake of Rome TW and this lackluster Atilla game. I seriously doubt anyone was clamoring for either of these. I don't get what is wrong with this company. Please listen to your fans. I stopped buying these games after Shogun 2 (I have all the ones before that, but have only tested Atilla and Rome 2 as freebies from Steam).

But Total War: ATTILA actually deserves this review. The amount of pain I endured while playing this heap of garbage was immensely disgusting. Now saying that this game is disgusting MIGHT be a bit of an overstatement; it has the basics of a Total War game, and that's all I really look for in a Total War game. That's all I look for and at least SOME sense of logic. You see in Total War: ATTILA Creative Assembly decided they wanted to introduce a very... stupid design...  Introducing Empire: Total War all over again. Just like in Empire: Total War when you capture a settlement it just never becomes happy, which is stupid. All other Total War games have had it so that the populations of captured settlements gradually become happy and content with your rule. Well with Total War: ATTILA and Empire: Total War Creative Assembly said '♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥' and decided that settlements should constantly hate you and be rebelling against you every two turns!  Now this review is on Total War: ATTILA, not Empire: Total War, so I suppose I should say 'why' the settlements constantly hate you in Total War: ATTILA. Two words: Town Centers... You see when you capture a settlement of a different culture (which you'll be doing A LOT) it has different 'town center' than your faction's town centers. So what you have to do is convert that town center to your factions version of the town center. Now, that sounds alright, except that it is nowhere NEAR alright. Because not only does it cost WAY too much gold, I'm talking like 8000 Gold (the amount you make in around 8 turns, roughly 8 YEARS in game time) just to convert a SMALL LOW TIER TOWN, AND IF YOU DON'T CONVERT THE CENTER THEN THE POPULACE WILL JUST HATE YOU FOREVER UNLESS YOU FEEL LIKE WASTING A WHOLE ARMY ON KEEPING THE PEACE IN THOSE SPECIFIC SETTLEMENTS!  So what does that mean? Well it should be obvious to those that are familiar with the Total War franchise, but just in case this is your first encounter with it I'll explain: What it means is that you're wasting an army on just trying to keep your empire together rather than going off and helping you keep up the conquest. So you're wasting money just putting those armies (that you are paying the big bucks for) in every province you capture that, for the record, aren't producing enough income to make it worthwhile since you haven't converted the town center yet!  You'll even find AI with settlements that hate them too because the AI itself can't even afford to convert their town centers! This is such a stupid design choice that even the game can't function with it! You're better off just preying on those with the same cultures as you as you will already have the same town centers as them. But then in later parts of the game you are FORCED to have to eventually fight against a different culture, and if you don't capture all of their settlements then there's no way to defeat them! So it's either just rush killing your enemy quick enough so that you can make it back to your own empire in time to kill the townsfolk that are rebelling for the five hundredth time before they end up capturing half your empire, or just dying. Does that sound fun?  Now for those of you who are new to Total War then continue reading this paragraph, for those who are familiar with it you can just skip to the next paragraph. Let me tell you how a normal Total War game works: You amass an army and go out and conquer enemy faction's settlements, by doing this you get more income from those settlement's taxes. The more you conquer, the more you grow, but with Total War: ATTILA it's the opposite. The more you capture the more people hate you and feel like rebelling every two turns and you actually lose money from investing in armies to keep the peace in those unruly settlements.   I really wish that this game could've just worked, but the more and more I play it the more I just hate it. This isn't the only problem I have with Total War: ATTILA but it's definitely my biggest. Other problems I've found include: A boring setting that just doesn't really inspire me into conquering it all, literally everyone gets killed by Attila the Hun when he begins his murder spree, the units in this game feel lacking as you definitely feel that their more calvary based (which is to be expected from Attila the Hun, but you're not always going to be playing as Attila, rather you're going to be playing as some barbarian tribe), all those reasons and a few more are why Total War: ATTILA has to be the WORST Total War I've ever played.",

That being said the siege and fire mechanics are fun. But rebuilding the entire world is not. It becomes a sitting game of rebuilding a burned world rather than actually fighting anyone. The horde system is broken and can out produce your economy regardless of the climate. Overall this felt like a crappy expansion that didnt live up to the hype.

The computer puts up a better fight.    I am very aggravated by some of the random appearing personal traits that show up. Such as your King, for no apparent reason, suddenly gets the red Unjust trait, which lowers integrity and provincial happiness across your entire realm. I have to reload the save that I make, at the end of each turn, and end the turn, over and over again, until it doesn't show up.  Also, the Blind trait seems to appear on your best general making him completely worthless, reducing his stats, to the point to where you just have to take his troops away and send him out to die so you can be rid of him.  Also, the minus one loyalty if your nobles don't get the same or better position each time... companion, judge,etc.    And the Campaign AI can be really weird sometimes.   I'm playing the Francs and had managed,to get rid of all the nearby realms that, I would never be able to get along with. Also I had made trading partner, military access, allies out of the rest. Had a nice buffer zone against the Huns or anyone else I figured.  And I had already exterminated most of the other migrating rats, such as the Magyars.  Since I had alliances, I would highlight them on the political map, and head out after them. I would usually have a couple of my allies, that liked me alot, send an army after them also.  Exterminating the rats was a good thing also because, the paths they traveled were nothing but devestation, and realms that hated them. So alliances and access was fairly easy to get from the surviving realms along the path.  With that fairly secure position explained then you'll understand why what the AI suddenly did would tend to bother you.  Suddenly each turn my allies just started destroying their Province and going horde. So of course I lost trade with the Geats,Jutes, and Bungarians, That was some significant wealth lost plus allies that would send out armies with me to irradicate rat problems, when they appeared. They had nowhere to go so they just died off travelling around where they weren't wanted   Now the huns start to make their appearance in force toward the western Germantic tribes, My forces have just completed getting rid of the Picts, Caledonians, and, the Britains that were really western Rome leftovers. The Irish are great buddies and even converted to my religion.  All of that is fine but I don't understand why those 3 tribes went mobile just to die wandering around without even the attempt to put up a fight or send out forces to take a settlement somewhere else in the known world. The Huns at that point were still way east messing with the Eastern Romans.  So anyway I've got my two main forces back on the mainland heading towards exterminating the most dangerous rat breed, the Huns. Rugians are tagging along with 2 armies. I'll begin to see how this all turns out, now that I'm done with this short review. LoL.  Overall lots of fun and much more, if they get rid of the ridiculous negative traits, that show up out of the blue, and quit making tribes go mobile and commit suicide. You can't support much after the climate change in the Northern regions, with the one sizeable goat herd per town, that you are stuck with, if you don't want to be diseased. But that's better than Nothing so why go mobile? ",

Their launch has been excellent, to the point where I can almost forgive them for the launch of Rome II. The game is very well optimized and it looks fantastic.   Battles are a significant improvement over Rome II. Unit collision has returned, your cavalry can actually throw enemy units a couple yards after coming into contact with them, and you can actually disengage and recharge with minimal frustration. Infantry battles no longer feel like you are trying to pull apart two blobs of putty and then smash them together again. Siege engines are actually exciting and don't totally cripple your army's campaign movement, so they are actually worth investing in. Ranged units don't become totally inept when the enemy is outside of their line of sight and actually arc their volleys over walls and terrain.   Depth has been added to politics, gravitas and influence is now used as political currency so that you don't have to cripple your economy to engage in faction politics. Governors can be instated for settlements and there are specific governor bonuses within the skill tree alongside their general counterparts. Loyalty has made a return, causing your political actions to have weight among your empire/tribe. Also, you actually have to care a little bit about whether or not certain generals and governors are loyal, because they aren't nearly as expendable as they were in Rome II.   The UI is another improvement with more informative menus. You can access the building tree within the game without having to mess with that idiotic browser from Rome II. Unfortunately they haven't done away with it entirely as you still have unit information within the browser.   Despite any shortcomings Attila has, even if you don't care about any of the additional improvements I just mentioned, this is going to be the first Total War game since Medieval 2 where map resources are going to be available to the modding community. This means that custom campaign maps are eventually going to be available, and if CA is willing to release map resources, the capabilities for modders in this game could be endless.",

Many elements where added to the game - like return of family trees, ability to assing people to certain titles, migration system (which was expanded), new after battle options (like recruits some enemies to your army), the integrity system, the way which fertility and sacks now work and many more things, more imporant, interface have been improved (so gone are the strange unit cards from Rome II, confusing UI and even now battles show more accurate the power rating in the UI). It does feel like a new title, even if is something build over on Rome II.  Also, the game is really stable and performance (at least for me) is fine (playing with lots of option on higher settings battles do play fine, while in campaign turn speed is ok, even with cpu moves on).",

            "review_text": "Have been a big fan of the franchise. I own and have played every single Total War. I was pretty hesitant about Attila because I kept reading a lot of negative reviews. I played it during the free weekend and ended up buying it and all the DLCs on sale.  Attila feels like a different game. Has a lot of the same concepts of Rome II, but also a lot of new dynamics. The family tree is back and you have to do a lot of internal diplomacy to be effective. Tech tree is also new and you now have to pay to research some of the high level techs. I used to have a couple of provinces dedicated to recruiting troops with all the armour, weapon, and other upgrades in a province while the others provided support (food, money, research). That doesnt work as well now since even if your empire is producing enough food, provinces get penalties if you don't have enough local food. The spies, champions, and dignitaries are not as powerful and a different leveling system. The whole food and disease balance also make you plan a bit different. Not enough sanitation and you keep getting hit by disease.  Overall, I am enjoying it a lot. If you are a fan of the franchise, I say buy it. A lot of people are upset at the shameless nickle and diming with the DLCs. The reality is that it is a business model that is here to stay. On the plus side, you have the workshop to even things out. If you dont want to pay extra for the DLCs, there are plenty of very talented people making great mods out there.",

            "review_text": "Yes! A decent introductory campaign you can burn through in a handful of hours teaches you the basics. There are many of the good things from Rome 2, but many changes and tweaks. Money and food numbers have been increased so that there can be better differentation between buildings. So many religions, but the ability to convert.  Stuff. Looks. Beautiful. Even a wall-less half burned village makes you want to pause the game and check out all the background animations. Missile fire looks like black blobs of smoke streaking across the map...one minor meh. Otherwise this is a true joy to look at both in combat and the strategic maps.  So many tweaks that this is not just Rome 2 rehash. Need to put in at least 40 hours before I can give a nuanced review but right now I am a happy camper.  ONE PROBLEM: The online encyclopedia is just as stupid and slow as Rome's was. Instead of just letting you see what YOUR nation can build, you have to see everyeone's buildings. So hard to make informed decisions on what to build (that will get simpler with time of course). Key concepts are not listed in manual and can't find a search function. IE: What is religion osmosis? (I can figure it out that it involves transfer of religion but what makes one religious building option better than another? DUnno...there isn't even the world osmosis in the manual.) I hate the damn thing...why not organise it to only show what you can make? I could never understand that in Rome 2.  If you like TW games, you should like this. Can't wait to play one of the larger nations in trouble...the WRE from Rome:Barbarian Invasion was one of my favorite scenarios in the entire series.  Additional notes 3/25/15  TLDR: If you like 'vikings', Attila &gt; Rome. Attilla is in the throes of MASSIVE climate change, everyone is burning their provinces into dust, and the Huns are coming...so this one isn't as sand-boxy as Rome is, but complexity, depth, looks, etc...Attilla wins hands down. But get Rome on sale when you can (they just had 75% off sale somewhere)...it you want a more civ-style sandbox game, or want to play Egypt or any of the excellent cultural groups that are not in Attila.  More in depth:  While I have quite a few hundred hours into Rome 2 (into each and every TW game from the first one), and they were all good, Attilla is a a different game than RTW2 and mechanics-wise, much more detailed in many ways...politics, settlement building, battle, etc. The battlefields that include settlements are just georgious and much more interesting to fight on than Rome's. There are also ways to become migrating tribes which are pretty cool, though I haven't tried it outside the extensive tutorial.  Two things may make you pick Rome over Attila:  1. Climate change: One of the major factors in gameplay is that climate change renders eventually 2/3 the map infertile. It requires you to push south because you can't grow enough food in your northern provinces which takes a huge bite out of your finances as well as forcing you to waste more space on food production. Couple this with the ability to raze provinces, and it becomes very hard to find a decent amount of fertile land. Corruption is quite high too, so bad that you may be tempted if you start in a northern climate to just raze your startling territory and just head south for new lands. You really need to keep the big picture in mind because if you're unaware how drastic the fertility goes down you're going to be spending way too much time and effort building up what should be treated as a starting point, not the heart of your empire.  2. Hun hordes. If you didn't play Medieval War 2, You may not realize just how tough these guys are going to be. Lots of armies. Strong armies. The only thing going for you is that they can't take over settlements, just raid or raze them. I like to expand West and let the Eastern empires be my buffer. (edited...can't tell my left from my right duh)  If you like vikings, Attlia &gt; Rome. I like the viking fathers DLC. Your troops are not as buff as the Roman troops in some ways, but you have a lot of fear-producing troops and you want to hit hard and fast, get the enemy running. Your meat and potato troops evolve with tech from levy troops to some seriously decent killers...but become so expensive that you may want to do what I did...train up your garrison armies just before the next troop upgrade happens, then keep those armies off the front lines until you need top tier troops with twice the upkeep.  There are some things I don't like about Attilla. Documentation sucks, the online encyclopedia is slow and a lot of really important data (like the interplay of politics, what do certain buildings do, etc) are not shown anywhere. BUT, once you play enough you'll pick things up. The political system is the best one in a TW game yet...you really need to take it into account, and the number of options you have means you can really spend time optimizing your leaders and balancing your family so they are in power, but not seen as a threat to the natural order. The RPG feel of the older TW games is back, IMO. There are leaders that I roll my eyes over 'Oh, HE is causing me problems again'. Even enemy leaders have social traits though I haven't gotten into diplomacy through assasination to more tractible leaders yet.  Diplomacy is a lot more difficult too; granted I have never been a player throwing around big bribes like some folks like to do, but man do people hate you.",

The return of the family-tree and all the new political options you have with it is really nice, 10/10 for that.  Little sad with so many faction-DLCs, that is something that could have been reduced I feel. But then again if you do not want to pay more, you don't have to, the base-version offers plenty as it is.

Can't tell if that's just my computer or the game it's self so won't judge it there.  AI on the campaign map isn't nearly as stupid or broken as in Rome 2. Sure the AI will sit in my lands and just hang out every now and again, but it's nothing major or game braking. AI in actual battles is close to what CA promised us in Rome 2, (What we got was crap FYI in Rome 2.) The AI will try and rush you in battles where you have siege equipment when not dealing with a real siege with walls and what not. (Makes sences, try an rush them instead of getting hit with rocks the size of your face for 5 minutes.) They will also fall back and try to stop you from flanking them or hitting them in the back with cavalry.   Family trees are a welcome sight, along with an AI that trys to make fair deals with you instead of having a ton of money and all the AI decides it want to ask for 10k coins for a trade agreement.

The Huns in this game are actually overpowered in the early-mid game and they should be, when I saw them coming I ♥♥♥♥ my pants set fire to my small holdings and ran my happy ♥♥♥ to the west leaving nothing by a trail of grown man's tears.

The campaign feels so good as if each faction can have a real meaning in the gameplay in the campaign exemple if you play romains you will have a more defense focused game early and then try to take back what you lost, franks &amp; saxons will be the early starters and expand while playing the huns will make you wonder around the map attack who the hell you want and cause utter terror that is what this game is about immersion and roles that they did pretty god damn well.  oh and the raze ability that makes you feel like a fu%?&amp;!$ badass!  Now for the in-game combat : just wow the combat in this episode feels refreshing because it does not deal whit horrid combat that rome did i think and i may be telling bs but i think they took de combat systeme of arena which is more combat focused and as huge impacts, when u see your men fight u see how well and responsive the combat feels flanking attacks feels great and gives the impression of a huge impact in the enemy, leaders feels less overpowered that in rome 2 making a bit more exciting then just for exemple rushing your rome 2 spartan champions in 3 stacks not giving a ♥♥♥♥ and cutting them to pieces now there good but you cant be ruthless whit them as before.  For now whit what ive played i would give it a go if i where STR player and for the long timers who are regulars to the total war series give this a go i cant wait to continue this vanilla version and see what people will mod for this a great episode in the series. ps you can burn the sh$! out of the world 10/10",

That said, there is no real 'overpowered' faction, like there was in Rome II (Rome). I've been testing armies against each other, all die equally as fast. The fire idea is nice. Family tree is fun, if not a little complicated. Slow campaign start for most factions. Definitely alot of new aspects with the introduction of the horde/migration system. AI is actually smart for once. And it runs well, even on my crappy computer.  While it could use a few patches, its still a solid game--and since this is a first releaase, its very promising.

I would love if Rome 2 had Attilas mechanics but we all know that is too late to make those types of changes. Atleast please put more variety into atttila or It would be awesome but is impossible if they did an expansion around the year 100BC for this game. All the fans have been waitng for a game that actually works (Attila) and one that also includes tons of varietry (Rome 2). Once again I feel the cup is half full because attila lacks unit variety and factions. Starting in a small settlement and conquering the mediterranean was one of the coolest thing I could do. NOW IS NOT POSSIBLE. The starting roman faction already owns all the territories in italy, greece, spain and many other regions. Attila should of been a ROME 2 expansion if Rome 2 would of worked properly from day one, PLEASE make an expansion for attila that would allow for the conquering of the mediterranean. If you set it in the dark ages, after attila dies and before mediaeval starts, im sure the game could be fun.

That being said, I, like most of you, was skeptical at buying this game because of how Rome 2 was released. However, I decided to buy the game and give it a shot... Boy am I disappointed with the game. In my eyes, this is the most boring Total War game they have ever released. Every Barbarian faction has very little units to choose from, and if you play as a Barbarian faction, that's all you're going to be fighting against. Every single battle is going to be against the same exact units as the last 50 battles that you auto-resolved. I'm 55 turns in into my Geats campaign, and I haven't even reached the Roman Empire. It's just a constant process of auto-resolving countless battles against unrelenting Barbarian factions. I find zero unit diversity in this game, and it is extremely boring. So boring, I haven't even been able to finish my campaign. I find myself auto-resolving more and more instead of fighting battles and eventually gave up. The game no longer became fun and I abandoned it.  This game is definitely a step forward in game mechanics from Rome 2. However, an extreme lack of unit diversity absolutely kills this game for me. Oh, I forgot to mention! You can get more units for a price of $7.99 each!",

In this case Attilla reached beyond th $/hr ratio and deserves a review. I anticipate i will still be playing this game for some time. Quick info on value analysis, the $/hr ratio is relative to peoples intreste but when you have gotten more than an hour per doller spent its a good value ($/hr &lt; 1).   As of this review have +50 hours  By standards of $/hour ratio:  Single Player - 16 hours Multiplayer + Coop - 35 hours  My Evaluation currently $45 / 51 hours =&gt; $0.8/hr  Compare (Actual gameplay may very and will be different based on individual players): AAA - Star Wars Battlefront (Base) $60 / 16 hours (Average) = $3.75/hr Indie - Minecraft $27 / 40 hours (Average) = $0.675/hr  The only real differnce in coop to singleplayer is trading some features for playing with another human player, Many features of which can be reclaimed and enhanced by the steam workshop. The more of the following features that are apealing to you the more value the game will have to you.  + 4x strategy + RTS strategy + Quest Lines + Historical + High Faction Complexity + Coop 4x strategy (Limit 2) + Hard learning curve + Skirmish + Multiplayer Skrimish + Strong Mod Community + Strong Mod Support + Expansions Available + Cinematics + Light RND  With a hard learning curve it is difficult to get past the early game and have given the game its mixed reviews. So if your willing to 'Dark Souls' it and invest in the game then you can get you moneys worth out of it in the later game. Otherwise the casual or easy play is not right for you and you wont be able to get past the learning curve to start enjoying the game. I would only recommend this game if you are commiteed to 45 hrs of invest to really start enjoying the game.  Remember the $/hr evaluation regarding Expansions/DLC vs what will be a good value to you. Without any of the DLC the game is a good value but is also the source of other negative reviews. Buy the game as is and see the DLC for what they are, optional expansions to the main game to add value that you don't need but could be a good value to you.",

Fair enough if you want to play as those factions, but they really arn't worth it. Number 2 is many of the Germanic/'Barbarian' factions have pretty generic units which are shared by too many factions. There are also some balancing issues when it comes to pikemen, which mow down anything you send at them, unless you whittle them down by concentrating missile fire and then totally surround and charge one unit of pikes at a time. Number 3 is the Huns are quite overpowered. I understand that the game is playing on the myth and legend which surrounds Attila and the Huns, however the game can become pretty ridiculous when 8 full Hunnic stacks surround one city. Number 4 is that diplomacy still sucks.  Apart from the above issues the game is very enjoyable and some of the other issues are easily solved by steam workshop mods.",

If you go and play campaign mode on Medieval 2 Total War and then afterwards play Total War Attilas campaign you'll notice a big difference and that big difference only improves upon the older games there are a lot of new features, most of them are just little features but the fact that you couldnt do them in Medieval 2 is very annoying as sometimes you had to do something in Medieval 2 Total War that you just couldnt do well in Attila you probably can do it.  I'll be perfectly honest I didn't buy Attila for Attila I bought Attila because theyre are some fantastic mods out there which can compleetely change the time period to your liking or even change the entire universe it is in for example Rise Of Mordor is a LOTR overhaul for this game that is coming out soon.

Diplomacy is hard as I imagine it would be in those ages, people take time to trust you and relationships are fragile so when you decide to execute 472 Prisoners from a previous battle make sure its a foreign opponent and not a one sharing your own borders. I learned this the hard way; Playing as Mercia (Age of Charlemagne DLC) thought I'd send a message to my neighbours for declaring war and taking one of my settlements. I was the more powerful faction I had better tech and more numbers in my armies yet upon executing 472 prisoners I immediately became the most hated person in the North East former allies were disgusted and declared war, within a few turns I was surrounded and losing the campaign it was as the name suggested; 'Total War'.   The enemy acted with surgical precision capturing specific settlements that produced food and sent spies to incite unrest among my people.. One by one my settlements were erupting in rebellion and shortly after being captured by enemy forces, a few more turns passed and I was able to secure peace with one faction enabling me to rebuild my decimated forces. By this time I was seriously annoyed with what used to be a relatively successful campaign turned upside down into a losing streak I tried my hardest to recover my settlements but failed miserably, all because I executed a few hundred barbarians of the same blood lol.. Turns out they also don't respond well to you amassing a higher tech force of shock troops and raiding the newly captured settlements only to raze them one by one executing every prisoner you encounter. This is by far the hardest way to make friends in TW:Attila; BUT has to be one of the most fun at the same time, feeling like a king, taking a settlement and burning it to the ground has to be my new favourite method of uniting the tribes into one Kingdom. 10/10 would raze North-Eastern Europe again - Definitely worth it's price. I don't even have to mention the graphics but 10/10 physically burning a village to the ground with flaming arrows while in battle is priceless lol.. (fire lowers morale, why wouldn't you take advantage of burning every building) It's a beautiful game, one of the best releases if you're not a total historian and just like to watch the world burn, TW: Attila is what's missing in your life ☺",

            "review_text": "Love the depth, you truly feel immersed as the ruler of a kingdom, the commander of an army, and within the politics and infrastructure of your nation. This game even has a certain degree of customization, you can name your armies, pick their battle standard, choose the traditions such as increased attack, higher income from raiding, decreased to no attrition from winter conditions and much much more. You can also rename cities, and villages. Every decision you make has good or bad consequences. Choosing to name another man within the family tree your heir and disinheriting your current heir causes a drop in loyalty. To much disloyalty can lead to a civil war and a separatist off shoot faction of your own faction. Sacking a settlement vs occupying can get you riches but lead to provincial instability. Moving your army from a city or town to invade another faction or fight a battle can lead to victory and the capture of new lands, yet leaving your lands unprotected open the way for other armies to invade wreaking havoc amongst your lands. This game is all about strategy, well thought out choices, and finding the balance between military, economic, religious, political, and many other things concerned with the success of your kingdom, empire, nation, etc. I recommend this game to any one that enjoys history, watching armies fight bloody battles sometimes down to the last man, and feeling like the ruler of your own faction. I have logged countless hours in this game, conquered 75% of the map as the Saxons, and played several other campaigns as the Visigoths, Picts, Alemans and Langobards, (my favorite factions tend to be Germanic tribes due to their fierce warriors), but all of the factions have their perks. This game can be somewhat unforgiving to new players but if you play on easy and listen to all of the advice and play the prologue you can learn quickly. It took some mistakes and failed kingdoms to teach me a few lessons but this is without a doubt my favorite game and I've owned it for atleast a year or two.",

It is just so dark and kinda 'boring' in a way. Don't get me wrong because I do like some of the things that they added but ths isn't a true total war game. It's more abput survive or your cows and wals will get ♥♥♥♥♥ by the Huns. This isn't a 'conquer and prosper' type  which I personally like more.  Also The Last Roman campaign pack is just a different version the Hannibal at the Gates campaign (which I personally love!!) but with bigger empires which some like but some don't. I don't really like any DLC  that they made apart from the Celts, they got that right.  EDIT:  Age of Charlemagne is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, grab it when you can, the unit cards are very nice and the variety of factions is beautiful.",

You can also roleplay with characters, it just needs abit of imagination but i'm sure players playing these kind of games know what i'm talking about.

I'm so done with TW being a disappointment and their DLC being a disappointment. It's obnoxious. Then I hear my friend make excuses like 'Oh it wasn't in their budget'. How wasn't a critical part of the game in their budget? Do yourselves a favor, migrate (har har Attila) to Paradox and their grand strategy games.  _________________________________________________________________  I'm a huge fan of Total War. Let me start off by saying, CA is dead wrong in how it approaches DLC, I do not recommend buying this game unless its on sale, I don't even recommended buying all of the DLC unless its on a huge sale, and I think its a horrible way to conduct business. The original TWs, pre-DLC madness, were far fuller games, and when you got expansion packs, even moreso. Rome TW, the original, had an immense amount of diversity that you have to pay significantly more for in most modern TWs.  WITH ALL THAT SAID,  Attila is one of the best recent releases. I initially didn't care for it and thought I had been robbed by CA once again after the Rome TW 2 disappointment and the lackluster AI of Shogun TW2. Yet after it had been patched up, along with some DLC (on sale), it has made up for it. The horde mechanics are great, the diplomatic mechanics are great, and how the interplay works is beautiful. I think that the amount of fertility damage in North Africa due to climate change may be too much, but that lacks compares to how much time I've had enjoying it. I recommend it, only because it was so much better than Rome TW 2, significantly so that I open up the Emperor Edition and go, nah, then open Attila and gleefully resume a 200 turn campaign I've been working on.  I am literally only recommending it on its Merits and that barely pulls it through, cause CA is a damned thief that hasn't done anything significant outside of Attila, and Rome TW 2 was the biggest disappointment.   Buy on sale, buy the DLC on sale, never pay a full dime, hide your kids, hide your wife, cause they robbing everybody in here.",
