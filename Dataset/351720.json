            "review_text": "A solid Entry in a long forgotten Genre  I don´t get why noone plays this game. I scored in the top 5 on every single level i played and judging by the number of reviews, either the genre itself has been forgotten, or this game is burried deep within steam so noone can find it... Sure, it doesn´t look amazing, the soundeffects are absolutly horrible (my opinion) and it lacks a bit of clarity in some cases (be it the enemy lines overlaping in circles so you can´t exactly see where they will go or the lack of explenations on which unit belongs to what type). But still, the mechanics work great, the levels are challenging and there are a lot of modes to play. There´s also a checkpoint function similar to the one in Defense Grid where this game took a lot of its inspiration.  There is enough content here to make me easily recommend it to you. After all, there aren´t that many TDs on Steam that have a great mechanic so if you´re interested in that genre, check out this game. it easily makes my top 10 list of TDs on Steam...",
