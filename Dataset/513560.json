            "review_text": "Fantastic game!  Though, it does have a small community and it feels like it's missing a lot of content. I personally thought before I went into this game was that it would be a Diablo esque type of game. I wish it had some kind of 'Adventure Mode.' Like it would have a Singleplayer story or something and have a Multiplayer feature to it as well. I do dislike the fealing of lack of content but overall it's a great game!   It's a fun to get together with friends and destroy your friendships together in the Massacre (Free For All) mode! This game would also be even better if the game was being updated and supported by the developers.!  Final Rating: 8/10",
