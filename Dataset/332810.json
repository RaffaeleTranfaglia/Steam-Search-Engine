Unfortunatly, from the opening scenes to the main menu into the gameplay all it did was lag. lag, lag, lag. the opening scene which should only take a few seconds to get through, took 5 minutes. I tired skipping through thinking maybe just the opening scenes were the problem but I was wrong.   My excitement to play this game turned to disappointment when I couldn't get it to run without lagging. Hopefully Steam will let me get a refund.",
