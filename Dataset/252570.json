            "review_text": "*UPDATE 5-15-14* (This game is a total blast and a steal for $5.99; Phil, the dev, and John, from publishing are consistently on the forums answering questions and keeping players updated on future patches; I have beat the game thrice, I've gotten all achievements, and I've played for almost 19 hrs)  Depths of Fear Knossos is a randomly generated- immersive- atmospheric- horror- stealth- action- first person- dungeon crawler in which you play a Greek on a quest to defeat the great Minotaur in The Labyrinth.  Surprisingly this game is VERY good. It provides a wonderful mix of genres and is a blast to play. You start out in a hub world with multiple different dungeons. Within each dungeon there are three levels where you can get weapons, coins (to buy weapons), and books (supplies the player with tips and lore) and you do platforming, combat, stealth, and light puzzles. And the main objective for those three levels is to get the gold key to progress to the next level. The fourth (and final) level is a boss fight with whatever creature (saytr, manticore, etc) is the 'mascot' of that specific dungeon.  The best part of the game has to be the absolutely phenomenal sound and music design. The sound is very atmospheric and scary. Everytime a boss spots you in one of the dungeons, techno-dubstep music starts playing which is very well made and very unique for a game that takes place in Ancient Greece. *there is no voice acting which may annoy some people but I like not having that*  The graphics are pretty good: Bloom effect, lighting, vignetting, some textures, object models, architecture, etc.  The story is pretty straightfoward- go into the labyrinth, kill things, defeat the minotaur, bang some hot Greek chicks (most likely :D) and the lore is surprisingly strong. All the lore in this game is acquired through books or pieces of parchment and is heavily inspired by surprise Ancient Greek mythology!  And now for the not so good/ bad: It's got some bugs (clipping, animation problems, spawning of objects and enemies in some levels, etc) Also some textures and foliage doesnt look the greatest. And the stealth mechanics are very simplistc, barebones, and broken. (atm)  Overall this game has great lore, atmosphere, combat, level design, and sound and music design. And on top of all that, the game never grows old. It consistently gives you great enterntainment. I can recommend this game to anyone who wants a thrilling gaming experience for the low low price of $5.99.  *Review copy was provided by Dirigo Games and Digital Tribe; Thank you!*",

            "review_text": "I only had about an hour with this game, but my short experience with this game was not pleasant. I did not like this game, and will probably never pick it up again after this review.  Good:  I will say one good thing about this game:  I really like the setting and feel it has. There is a depressing and dark mood it establishes right from the start. There aren't a lot of greek-themed games quite like this either, which is refreshing, and the adventure itself is uncomfortably tense. Dragged out of a cell, thrown into a dark maze, running through shadows avoiding traps and monsters to find the key to the next level of the maze. It does have a rather good feel about it.  And the sound effects are alright. Nothing impressive, but that's not a bad thing so long as they work when they should.  Bad:  It didn't take me a long time for me to tell that this game was not going to be fun. I'm only going off my experience with the first few levels of the Satyr's dungeon, but first impressions are what matters, and despite this game's good mood there just isn't any good gameplay to match.  Firstly, this game feels very easy. Regular enemies like zombies and skeletons die in one or two hits from the starting weapon, and the Satyr is ridiculously easy to escape from. It just feels all wrong. This game should be challenging, sudden, and frightening, but every attempt I made told me otherwise; sometimes I cleared floors running around with my torch lit and never got hit once. Finally, I also noticed your health regenerates when you are close to death, or at least appears to.  And on the note of the Satyr, his walk animation looks ridiculous, and like most regular enemies his A.I. is just stupid. every other level he gets stuck on a corner, and his torch will clip through the wall; causing unsightly lighting glitches. Regular enemies also have a tendency to go through prop things and spawn on top of breakable props; which just looks silly for a game that is trying to be serious and tense.  And a few things just don't seem to work at all. There are these spinning turrets that look like they are designed to shoot fire, but I jumped right in front of one once and it didn't do anything. Another time I found a book that warns that the Satyr has a charging attack, but he never used it on me whenever he found me, and would instead walk towards me as usual. The Satyr doesn't even have a change in stance when he finds you. He just howls once, and then proceeds to walk towards you at the exact same pace he does when he wanders around.  This game isn't scary either. I didn't find a brightness setting in the menu, and it was easy to see through the darkness without ever using the torch. Most of the time I never did use the torch. And the slow response of the enemies kind of takes away any pressure the game attempts to give you. The music is also all wrong for a game that should be scarier than what it is. Regular enemies should be creepy and unexpected, but they are often stupid and easy to spot. The monsters should be quick to take advantage of the player, and a pain to confront; but they seem so plain.  I also noticed this game has a lot less depth than it likes to think it has. You get gold to buy weapons, but there are only eight, and they don't seem to be all that special from each other. What potential variety and interest there would be to gathering gold to buy some of the nicer weapons is destroyed by the fact that weapons spawn randomly too; meaning I got a really nice axe on the second level of my first attempt on this game.  There is also some 'lore' that you can obtain from books, but most books don't say anything at all and just give you 'lore points' to unlock magic abilities. For a game about mythical monsters, this game doesn't even take the time to include anything more than the most basic information about the enemy, such as 'the Satyr has poor vision in the dark' and instead opts to include a bunch of nameless books to collect.  I guess 'book is for magic, not reading' is an acceptable gaming theme, but I think there is a huge wasted potential in doing that for this particular game. I want to know more about the maze and the monsters and how they work!  Everything else about this game is just awkward and poor. Exits have a glow that is actually a thin plane that you can sort of clip through; said glow also looking very strange in certain dark areas. You jump pretty high and fall slowly, and it almost feels like you are on the cusp of gliding. Weapon pickups are HUGE for some reason. You can pick up random potions that you identify by drinking, some of which are poison, but since you can't use poison for anything other than to hurt yourself its basically just an annoying to catch new players and nothing else.  I never really considered newbie traps to be a good thing for a game. Maybe it is acceptable for a game that is supposed to be 'roguelike' but it feels cheap to me.  Lastly, this game loves to crash on me, which is why I don't have more than an hour yet. But I won't hold that against the game either. that could just be me.  Still, summing up my short experience, I can't say I was too fond of this.  Overall:  I like the setup. It looks really really good on the store page. But I just couldn't find anything that would redeem this game's shortcomings. Its not hard, its not scary, it is often clumsy, it lacks complexity, and, to be quite frank, I could barely stand it enough to get as far as I did in between all the crashes I had to deal with.  For the hour I spent with it, maybe I am being a bit too harsh. I never even got to the end of the first area, mostly due to constant crashes. But to me none of that mattered. What I saw was not good, and it was quite clear to me that this game has made some poor design choices.  I wouldn't recommend this game at all. There are better games for under ten dollars.",

            "review_text": "I must forewarn that this game is made by just one developer and basically exists in a state of permanent beta (not sure if he'd call it that, but functionally speaking). It's basically playable but there's still plenty of bugfixes to be done and the gameplay could still use tweaking in a few places.  All that said, Depths of Fear is a proceedurally generated action/horror game about the Minotaur's Labyrinth. Taking rather obvious cues from old Ray Harryhausen films, it pits you against eight beasts from classical myth including the Minotaur itself (plus a few generic monsters to fill space, mostly undead). Each has their own unique abilities to harass you with.  The game starts out with heavy emphasis on stealth, as you begin your way through the labyrinth armed with nothing but a torch and maybe a stick. The game's atmosphere is great here, somehow managing to make the angry bleating of a goatman the most terrifying sound in the world. To avoid the same confusion as I had, keep this in mind: you actually need to run each level three or four times in a row to reach the boss chamber and actually progress to the next segment. Before I figured this out I'd run it once or twice between breaks, thinking the point was to scrouge for treasure so I could buy a better weapon.  The game is pretty much a straight shot from there, running each level a few times, fighting the boss (who is present on every level but only permanently killable in their inner sanctum), grab the token and move on. By the time you reach the endgame you've evolved from a scared boy with a stick to a seasoned monster hunter, and if you can keep up with such Greek monster basics as 'don't stare at Medusa,' you should have no trouble pushing to the end with quick feet and a crossbow.  All in all I had quite a bit of fun for how simple (and at times buggy) the game was, and while its not without flaws I'm still looking forward to the sequel I've heard the developer mumble about.",

You can see the inspiration old games had on this modern dungeon crawler. It even features a merchant--with his own quirky music--to buy weapons from. The level layout is randomized; so each time you restart or enter a new area it's completely different. The creature and level design is good. The only problem this game has as far as I could see is the optimization. Even on a good PC it seems to run poorly. Lots of hiccups, especially when dealing with swarms of enemies, can ruin the game experience. I really hope these issues are fixed, because this can be a really good game.",

            "review_text": "Often I've found the sword-and-sandals genre of hack-and-slash to be tired and unimaginative. This game is a refreshing change. Not only is this a great take on the monsters of Greek mythology, but the procedurally generated environments (as is a staple of Rogue-like games) greatly increase replayability. And to discover that every aspect of the game was created by one person quite astonished me. I love it that the 'boss' monsters actually search for you and hunt you down, rather than just sit in a room accessed at the end of linear rails. These creatures also have more than one method of attack, and these methods will fit the situation. This game is not bug-free and the jumping mechanic was often rather tricky to me. Also, the way of attaining the medallions is not immediately clear (especially to those relatively new to Rogue-like games). But, the learning curve is not extremely steep and there are multiple strategies you can use to beat a level (stealth, speed, patient attrition by missile weapons, melee, area spells, etc.). And, when you've beaten the 'main' game, you have the endless dungeon to challenge you. SPOILER....   I would have preferred the final fight against the Minotaur to be in an actual maze but, overall, I enjoyed the challenge.  ",

The high level weapons are far too easy to get, which results in the scares wearing out extremely quickly. In general, the utterly broken line of sight mechanics the bosses use makes it a game of 'turn off the torch when you see movement' rather than 'sneaking around a deadly creature'.   There are some serious bugs, that I hope will be ironed out.  With a little more polish this could be a real gem, and yet I can't give it a thumbs down because I truly enjoyed the time I played it.

As I start to play it more, the amount of depth that exists becomes apparent, and holds your interest.

The good things about this game is that it is great for anyone who likes geek mythology. Thats what its all about, obviously your going to like it. It has a good balance between fighting and the stealth aspect. Im definatley better at the fighting aspect, so thats ho i choose to go about things. Next, this game is a challenge. I have died and had to restart a level so many times, that it was almost frustrating. Its different every time so that keeps the game going and exiting, even i you do have to retry the same level. Some things that arent exactly great about this game is that there are a few bugs. The only bugs i have noticed are not game-breaking and are all problems with the level generator. Sometimes there willl be a little gap between the floor generations that you will get stuck in and be unable to get away from (unless an enemy throws you out) Once, both the minitaur and cerberaus were stuck on the exit, and i couldnt leave! This rarely happens, and is not really something to worry about. People may whine about how little weapons there are, but seriously how many do you need? The game is not all based on fighting, there is more to it than that. The game isnt really a horror game with jumpscares, it is more the horror of not knowing where anything is. There could be a zombie just out of reach of your torch, but you can hear him and it echos aound in this creepy kind of way. Definatley not scary at all (which is good....i hate horror games!) I know that this wasnt a great reveiw, just wanted to get my scrambled thoughts out there. Its a good game, buy it.

The combat system is the same get a weapon and smack the ♥♥♥ off the enemy but makes it feel even worse when the A.I is horrible for instance, The weaker A.I I have seen stack on each other, stop randomly during a chase or fight, or not even react. The graphics are bad which doesn't bother me but it lags my computer and I can play payday 2 at a high res and get over a solid 60 FPS so I turned down the graphics and when I did I almost noticed no difference. The levels are repetitive, I talking like you play it for 20 minutes and you will probably know all the satyr levels and they almost seem to last forever. The scary effect is good, the bleat of the satyr definitely made me jump a couple of times but it is also ruined by the abysmal stealth system because the weaker A.I always see you and like I said the satyr has a third eye. The soundtrack feels great on the game really giving it the mythological feeling and it really has some great mythological knowledge such as praying to certain gods to recive their power for that level. But in the end the game is really poorly executed, which disappoints me so much because I looked at the positive comments and bought the game because it looked interesting to me because of the new fresh idea so at this time I would give the game a 4/10 for being a promising game that misses the punch.

This time the Satyr didn't stuck... but I got stuck after I explored the level a bit further. On top of that the game looks rather dull.

I went down in to my first run. I made it to what I presume is the final level of the Satyr area on my first go and noticed a pretty large amount of errors. First off, the satyr (which is the main thing you're to avoid in this segment of the game) would get stuck in random places, making it impossible to chase me even if it wanted. The satyr fell through the map on at least 2 occasions, and generally is just programmed poorly. All of the other creatures are so basic in their AI that it's almost upsetting.. They just move, and then attack if you're in range, and the way they attack doesn't change the gameplay, or how you react in any way. The stealth elements are pretty horrible too. You turn off your torch, and take 2 steps back, and immediately you're hidden! The game could have been good, it wants to be good, but it's bogged down by bad programming.",

Comments meant specifically for the developer will be CAPITALIZED. Regardless of the content of this (')review('), I will record a recommendation until a time that I've found Depths of Fear :: Knossos to be undesirable (should a time arise)(but, the premise of the game and the fact that it's the product of one man; THUMBS UP).   As of 1.4.4, the developer has addressed two of the issues I had recorded (whether because of this review or not):  'Fixed being able to hide in some torch lit areas... Vases shatter properly when struck in-level.'  Update 1.4.3 (Blood Moon), 10/8/14: I fall into a cramped Dungeon. I root through 2 rooms, see the Satyr's torchlight, put mine out, hunker down, move while crouched to the next room as the Satyr turns to head towards me, I somehow alert him after having made it around the corner (I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥). I can't find a way out, other than a hole with what looks like lava underneath it, so I say '*sigh* Guess I'll attack it again.' I get in a good 7 hits with the club that costs 1 Gold. Woah, how 7?! Well... THE SATYR KEPT WARPING INTO WALLS, allowing me to hit it until it finally won out in the endurance contest.  Later: I made it to level 2 of the Satyr! Without being detected! Alas... I peeped the Satyr's lightsource so I avoided it. Made the rounds, found myself back where I started. Still, that light persists! I check it... *facepalm* THE SATYR IS MOONWALKING - IT'S STUCK IN PLACE!   From The Update Notes:   As of Update 1.4.1: GUI includes: health and energy indicators, sound meter, crouch/sneaking icon As of Update 1.4.3: Health UI removed   ...Forgive my ignorance but, as I understand Updates, each of them patches the game; unless altered by subsequent Updates, former Updates still impact the game. BY 'HEALTH UI REMOVED' IS IT MEANT THAT ALL 4 ASPECTS OF THE HUD IMPLEMENTED IN 1.4.1 ARE REMOVED? OR, AS I THOUGHT, STRICTLY THE HEALTH METER? I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE HUD INDICATORS, UNLESS THE 'HIDDEN' INDICATOR AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION IS THE CROUCH/SNEAKING ICON. Notes (as opposed to logs): PERHAPS THE PATH BY WHICH THE BOSSES TRAVEL COULD BE MORE RANDOM? I've no idea what to expect throughout the game in terms of map sizes, but maybe the bosses could make one round in a certain path and then in the next round of scouting, take a different path? TWO WINDING TRAILS TO AVOID WOULD BE MORE STRESSFUL THAN THE ONE STRICT PATH. I'm not being snide: From the game, I can only assume that the basic vision is reflected, regardless of future Updates. Speaking as a critic (with none of the accolades pertaining to such a title, simply a player who wishes to give feedback), I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LIGHT WHICH EMANATES FROM OBJECTS YOU CAN INTERACT WITH BE DULLED; perhaps have the light from objects grow as you get closer, dim as you go further from. Having updated the game so that static torches can only be lit once, requiring destruction of the torch to snuff it, you're still tweaking how much leniancy the game offers us. By dimming the light of Gold, Books, Keys, etc., further trepidatious exploration would be encouraged, thus immersion would increase. By the way, I didn't see in any Update notes anything refuting Health regeneration. I have none. I've read in other reviews that at one time, at least, there was health regeneration. I doubt such a significant change is a glitch on my part, I can only assume you have removed it or lessened it greatly.  Please be sure to make notes of every change made.  I'm absolutely ham-handed on the keyboard ('What're you doing playing games on PC then?!?!' I gave away my PS3, have a laptop, there you go.) - I read elsewhere that apparently Controller Support is meant to be implemented eventually. Incredibly tense, I can only play Knossos for short spurts before panic overcomes (haha); currently, there is controller support in the sense that actions can be mapped; there are no Controller Options. Having mapped all of the actions successfully, the camera is irrevocably inverted. As soon as Controller Support is actually implemented, I will be able to play this for hours on end, as I'll be wholly confident in my ability   to   play.",

My expectations weren't exactly sky high; I did buy this game for 54 cents after all. Anyways, when I saw Depths of Fear: Knossos on the market, I was pretty intrigued by it. A stealth game based on Greek mythology? Sign me up. But when I first booted up the game, the first thing I noticed was how underwhelming the game was. You start off in some kind of room, then some dude leads you to the outside where you have to jump down into a hole. Once you hit the water, you're immediately consumed by darkness, and have to find a way out of the room. Then, you enter this massive cave-like area where you find a store, where you can buy weapons, and several paths leading in different directions. The first thing I did was buy a weapon. The only thing I could afford was a club. So I bought the club and made my way through one of the paths, (with the added difficulty of not being able to see 5 feet in front of me, even with a torch). I eventually found a door with a skull. This door was presumably an entrance to a dungeon. So, I entered, and I found a monster. I was honestly sick of the dungeon's darkness so I just ran up to it and was immediately struck down by the evil creature. (The monster looked funny as ♥♥♥♥ by the way). I respawned and found another door. However, this door was across a bridge with a lava pit under it. (A Shrek reference?) So I made my way across the bridge and found no way to open the door. (I assumed that there was some kind of puzzle involved and left the door alone). So I jumped into the lava pit. I didn't die by the way. I could literally walk across the lava. I was stuck and there was no way out. So I commandq'd the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I also nearly forgot to mention that the game looks like ♥♥♥ too. When I reached the menu, I could barely even move the mouse because of the really bad lag. So I just had to turn the graphics all the way down, and even then it still lagged.",

That waste of ~1€.    Pros  Didn't find any, had to quit playing due bugginess.    Cons  Graphical options, no matter which one you pick, game still feels edgy and doesnt look beautiful. Didn't even expect that tho   Sound&amp;Mouse sensitivity sliders, they're horrible   Buggy   Combat... just spam LMB? Didn't get to test other weapons than Club. With a shield or ranged weapon it might be different   You can tilt you head downwards, but barely upwards? This is really annoying  ",

I've only played it for a little bit, but however much I paid for it was worth it to actually feel like a real human being. Not a real hero though, unfortunately.",

After you kill a boss, it's dungeon become unacessible, but there is an endless dungeon you can do as much as you want with random bosses in each floor ",

You fall into the underground Greek labyrinth where you can enter many different areas of the labyrinth freely, each housing a different Greek mythological creature that you have to overcome. Essentially, it is a game of hide-and-seek that requires you find your way through multiple rooms (procedurally generated to an extent) until you get to the final boss fight room, and win, at which point you 'complete' the area. There's also a strange Poseidon-looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the wall that pops his head out and sells things to you. The objective is to complete all the areas. It's been a while since I've played it, so I don't remember much else.  Overall it's a terribly made game. Technically, it is a disaster — awful animations and graphics, glitches all over the damn place, more or less the same AI used for everything, it's repetitive and short... and yet it's just offbeat enough that you might enjoy it. Still, I can't recommend it even if I do like the setting, because everything else about it is just bad.",
