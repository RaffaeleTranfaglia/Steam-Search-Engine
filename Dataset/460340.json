Nice relaxing color palette. +Sound - Nice sound effects, music pretty average, nothing special. +Gameplay - 1st of all i have to mention that this game involves a lot of grind, you have pack of levels, you start from the 1st one every single time and try to advance as far as possible with current team, then you use reward to upgrade your units, buy some items and try again. That's it. You have 8 units to pick to create a team of 4, so the teambuild could be pretty variative. +Steam cards +Steam achivements (they are hard to get, pretty time consuming) -After hours of playing repeating from the very 1st level again and again can get pretty repeative and boring, on the other hand, that's what all the games of that genre suffer from.",

            "review_text": "  I recieved a key as a promotion, (most of my other games have been humble bundles for my kids) but here is my honest review and overview.  8/10 A solid little turn based arcade strategy game. Expect a game session to take 15-30 minutes or more once you've progressed.  5+ hours of game play including leveling time for normal, plus 2 more challenging difficulties of nightmare, followed by hell. 10 rounds of play per difficulty, plus an endless survival option if you beat all ten. Each round takes a couple minutes, the later rounds generally taking more time.   Unfortunately there is no save (arcade style) during these attemps to beat all ten levels, but you do keep rewards earned for how far you make it. The rewards you keep are mithral for leveling characters and buying items and stars for using skills. Once mithral is spent it is gone, but the stars can be reassigned at any time before starting combat for differnt skill choices. Mithral is earned for every round beaten and many quests (completed milestones of progress) while stars are based on your total progress across all difficulties and survival rounds, i.e. beating the same rounds you've beaten before don't add stars.  A third reward type is used only during a specific playthough. Gold is used to level your characters total health, normal attack damage, and special attack damage for that playthrough only.  Game play is simple, you choose your 4 characters you want to play with - you start with 4 and the other 4 can be unlocked with mithral - they will be randomly assigned to the front or back column. The three in front use their normal attack while the back row may heal, or be moved to the front performing a special/super move switching places with one other hero of your choice. The character moved to the back then heals some instead of attacking. Your turn plays as soon as you switch two characters then the enemies attack and advance. If you want to keep your current three in the front column, you may switch two of them and their normal attacks will fire in their new position. You never move outside these two ranks, the rest of the 3x7 grid is used for enemies. Each class has a different set of super and normal attacks. The healer for example has a ranged normal attack and a heal when moving forward. All the characters except the witcher have a ranged attack either in the super or normal attack. This is important since the ranged enemies don't seem to advance into melee range. As you advance through the game your enemies become both more numerous and diverse in the strategies necessary to defeat them. Luckily your team also gains new powers and potency as they level, and new skills and items become available to you.  Every level your characters gain is a different upgrade, subtly changing the challenge as you advance. You have character progression locked after a certain number of upgrades until you beat the current difficulty level, so you always have to put some thought into total victory for each of the 3 difficulties and not just grind your way there.  8 character classes with unique strategies for each.  6 special 'skills' of three levels each to aid your heroes and their options, such as improved healing in the rear position, or extra inventory slots.  12 expendable items to use, limited by your inventory spaces (2-6 depending on skills) and up to 2 of a type per inventory spot. these include items to revive a charcter (otherwise it's a loss on that round), extra attack damage for a number of rounds (3-4) or increased defense etc.  Moderate replay value, not quite diverse enough for high replability.  I hope for those interested the game gains some traction for my own sake cause I'd like to see additional characters to be added. That will depend at least in part on the success, or lack thereof, of the game going forward. Even new development teams can't live on aspirations alone after all.  I like it and I hope I've helped inform you whether or not you will.",

            "review_text": "I was expecting something fire emblem like  Instead, I got a sort of game which is turn based, and involves you attacking once, and watching your witchers special ability get absolutely wasted every single time.   It looks very nice for what it is, which to say, a top-down experience of looking at what can only be the fleshy blobs of insects, and the rough hides of pig-like things.  The entire game is you switching out heroes in different lanes to be most effective in their set areas. Same rules as ever apply: Melee dudes are always stronger than ranged dudes, and the healer is a ranged dude. Yes, the healers do the same amount of damage as the dude with the bow. What is the healer firing? Healing bolts that heal you for negative damage?  I love how that's literally what she's called. 'Healer'. TF2 called their healer a 'medic', and the healer in Overwatch is called 'Mercy'. I can get that you're trying to remove any guess work, so when you look at her, you know exactly what she's capable of doing, but goodness man.  If you're gonna make me pay to get the gnome, at least make him 'better'. An ability that does the exact 5 more dmg than his normal shot does not count, and it does not help your case when said shot is 'random'  Its not great but if what I've described something you're after, fire away.  7/10",

It's a fairly simple game and as far as I could tell there didn't seem to be a lot of complexity, but i was surprised at how challenging it could be to beat levels without using the right strategy. The music in the game is very enjoyable (if a bit repetive), but it definitely made me excited to play. All the heroes are fairly different and the enemies all change which is pretty cool for sure.",
