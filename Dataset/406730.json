            "review_text": "This game is not typical, but that is one of its' greatest assets. You find yourself in the South American town of Cachiche, Peru and using a local Brujo as a guide (Brujo means something like Shaman or male witch) you explore this extremely trippy town. The graphics are not super slick BUT the way the graphics are works perfectly with the story. The colors, the feel of the game, all of the way the game is designed, mimics my own experience South of the border, though I didnt meet any male witches with motorcycles, unfortunately ;) I enjoed that feeling and I am amazed at how weel the game was able to trap and capture such ephemeral feelings of being a stranger in a strange land. I had no issues with game play, no stuttering, no walking through walls, sound works perfectly, no problems, nada. The game runs smoothly and apparently has different endings depending (I believe) on where you go, who you speak to, etc... I definitely recommend this game for those who like out of the box games which are creative and follow an intriguing storyline. 9/10",
