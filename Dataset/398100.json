            "review_text": " Originally written to investigate on potential yuri content, this review is written from a queer perspective, although I do not claim to speak for anyone in the community but myself, and any opinion expressed here only reflects my own personal experiences.    - Characters -    Shoji:  - Main Character, androgynous looking - Some shots show a definite feminine physique complete with a narrow waist and wide hips - Complimented on their feminine appearance, may even get upset when confronted to their lack  - Initially identifies as male only, and still refers to themselves as male by the end  - Grows up into their female persona, even enjoying it to some extent - Starts thinking in terms of what is appropriate for girls to do together during interactions  - Is permanently afraid of people finding out about them being male, feels guilty about it, and becomes afraid of losing their friends if they were to find out about their situation    Lea/Ms. Rowen:  - The Principal, potential romance - Seems overly enthused about the Shoji's feminine appearance - May buy you female clothing, and even enter your cabin when trying underwear - Definitely into forced feminization, from the way she treats Shoji  - When Shoji points out they're starting to enjoy school even if they're not being themselves, she retorts that she doesn't think she would be any different as a person if she pretended to be male, and that interests and clothing should be enjoyed regardless of their stereotypical gender association.    Selina:  - The sportive girl, potential romance  - Genuinely finds you attractive as female      - Initially assumes Shoji to be transgender as their female identity appears genuine      Hoshi:  - The nerdy girl, potential romance  - Is confirmed to be uncertain about her sexuality    - Story -   I didn't expect a lot from the topic at hand, given the treatment it is usually given, but was actually surprised with a quite compelling story, with a protagonist that seems genuinely torn between their personal feelings and others' expectations of them, also experiencing what appears like some mild gender confusion along the way, for example,  when asked if a lesbian, Shoji will initially answer no, but later feel confused and claim it to be both false and true.  I know there are multiple endings and even if   all the romance options knew about the protagonist's identity and only seem to really get involved together after Shoji openly reveals it to them, at which point they reveal themselves that they knew it all along and did not care, because they still are the same person that they have grown to like and/or love  , I would say this game did tackle its subject matter rather competently for the most part, subverting the 'anime cross-dressing' and 'only boy in a girls school' clichés and, in my opinion, even scoring a few points on the LGBTQI side.   - Major Spoilers -      Selina: - Queer ending, where Shoji admits enjoying dressing up with her and reverting to a female role, albeit privately       Hoji:  - Straight ending, where Shoji permanently assumes a male role      Lea: - Teacher's Pet ending, literally, she seems to get off on forced feminization a little too much and I found her slightly creepy      - Final Verdict -   I'll be honest, I was very curious but also expecting to tear this game a new one due to the tropes it's wearing on its sleeves, but I instead found myself quite pleasantly surprised, maybe I'm being biased because I found some parts relatable, sometimes in a  reverse  sort of way  with the protagonist being male but having to  pretend to be female  because of the plot, lending to a sense of confusion and dysphoria and ending up like  one of the most faithful depictions of gender issues I've seen in a video game  , maybe I'm being generous on account of what these subgenres usually do, maybe because it's not so much about sex as interpersonal relationships, but I found Highschool Romance to be a cute and endearing visual novel, with some interesting views on gender roles and social expectations.      - Addendum: Theory Corner -    As with the introductory disclaimer, this theory comes from personal experiences only, as the more I played and thought about it, the more this game seemed to have deeper layers.   Now, this might seem crazy, and can be disproven by a few scenes in the game, but I thought some facts didn't line up, which brought me to an interesting, if flawed, theory:  - What if Shoji actually was actually a transgender male student?   Let's look at potential hints: - Their mother signed them up as female in a girls boarding school,  which Shoji blames on inattention  - Shoji's physique shows  a distinctly female waistline and hip structure , dressed or not - They might be flat-chested, but they are also arguably the only character with a proportionate breast size in the game - They might make a point about shaving their legs being difficult, but not every woman does - When confronted about their feminine appearance, Shoji questions their actual masculinity - The principal could very well be forcing Shoji to conform to gender norms, which they can refuse - Shoji identifies as  'a guy through and through' , but reluctantly accepts to conform to said norms  - Shoji is a male given name, yet nobody seems to pick up on this fact - at all  - On the same note, they show attraction towards girls, but do not identify as a lesbian - Their clothing choice might be masculine, but  it is repeatedly pointed out by other characters that they seem to be equally comfortable wearing female clothing , and wonder if the masculine look is more of a statement, the Principal also makes a point about it (read above)  - The only person that is not convinced that Shoji can appear like any other female student is themselves  - Shoji shows  a lot of signs of gender confusion , feeling either complimented or insulted about their feminine appearance, and often getting caught in thinking from both male and female points of view  So yes, while this theory can  easily  be disproven by  literally one scene , I thought it interesting to include as an after-thought that all along this game,  Shoji could also appear to be someone who stongly identifies as male and feels trapped in a female body.    …then again, I could just be reading too much into what is just a light-hearted, slice-of-life visual novel.

            "review_text": "Played through and got the Selina ending. It's a cute game with stylish art, the characters look great. But it's pretty short. You can play through it in about one two-hour session, which isn't including the different endings of course.  Something else that bothered me were the static characters. There aren't a great many expressions for them, and this clashes with the dialogue and intended emotion of the scene more than once. There are visual novels out there that do this better, but it's never really jarring, just disappointing.  Also, I would have liked it better with adult content. Not sure if they left that out because of Steam or aesthetic decisions, but there is no 18+ version of the game.  I'd recommend waiting for a sale, but if you have the money to blow I defs recommend it. Very cute characters with fun personalities. Plus adorable trap boy protagonist, what's not to love?",

            "review_text": "So I bought this game out of impulse when I saw Chilled play it. Let me just say this game was my first Visual Novel. It has a great, if slightly generic, storyline and definitely worth picking up if you're new to Visual Novels like I was. 'Nudity' is a rather misleading tag because the closest you get is underwear and lingerie. This fact is better, though, as players can focus less on mindless sex appeal and perhaps enjoy the story a bit more. Is it worth $10? Probably not. Is it worth playing, however? Absolutely.  Final recommendation: Shave a few dollars off this and it's definitely worth it. Full price, maybe, if you really want a quality Visual Novel.",

You are one place, and then without any warning you are in another place, or even another day entirely.  2. There is no distinction between what the main character is thinking, and what he is actually saying. This made it hard to follow the conversation sometimes.  3. Finally, lack of consistancy in the backgrounds with regards to time of day.  Despite these 3 complaints however I very much enjoyed this cute, albeit short, story.",

It's rather short and the backgroungs art is ratherlimited and a bit to realistic in comparison to the bright characters and sometines doesn't match the scene (says it's getting late and the sun is shining full force through a window), lastly the choices you make don' make that much diference besides a few very important questions that you don't know until you try them all or just choose them coincidentaly.   Now on to the stuff I love about it.   While it is short the dialogue is quite a large amount making a full story, the dialogue meshes well at key points making those moments more powerful, the three girls you can choose to go after are all good but stereotyped, but not in a bad way (nerdy shy girl, sporty friendly girl, and the somewhat refined but knows how to have fun girl), and the protagonist is male but is forced to crossdress making it a lot funnier and less serious most of the time.",

The reason why I purchased this game; CGs with gratuitous nudity (because non educational VNs should have fanservice IMO) sadly did not come to fruition.

            "review_text": "  Highschool Romance is rich in visual attitude, but it fails to capitalize on a rousing plot point due to its shortcomings in character variety and meaningful choices. Its price tag and pleasing presentation do, however, offset its faults making it a short but cute experience.     The Good:   Highschool Romance offers a different perspective into the visual novel x school life genre: that of a boy dressed up as a girl. While it may remind some of a famous asian drama, the cotton candy of an art style used to design the four main characters keeps the premise somewhat fresh. I recall launching the game for the first time and seeing the pastel like UI take over my screen, leaving me to gawk at the fonts used to set the tone of the visual novel. Then I saw the character design which immediately elicited fond memories of some of my favorite artists growing up. The art direction is certainly the game's selling point, and is in full display in every key scene.   The plot in Highschool Romance is simple. A desperate boy in need of graduating takes on an all girl school donning a shirt and skirt, because it's the only school that apparently accepted him. Beating this in one hour and getting one of the handful of possible endings is reasonable. I received my first ending just shy of one hour, but I am a fast reader. Choices are present so there is a risk of missing out on achievements which is a welcome element in visual novels.   I found the sound quality to be decent for the most part with a few melodies proving exceptionally catchy: the menu screen for one. One of them even made me smirk as it sounded more like a tune fit for a timer warning in a nintendo platformer.    The Not So Sood:   The choices weren't always clear or did it hint of their their implications with respect to the few story paths available. While I did appreciate the myriad of choices presented, upon clearing the game, I was not sure whether some choices truly had an effect on the plot. I think some were included to merely pad the experience rather than provide a means of steering the protagonist to a potential ending. Furthermore, the characters even in their climactic moments seemed to still lack development, especially given the divergent nature of the choices which left some characters in the shadow.  I saw the potential in the story the moment the protagonist agreed to change his outfit, but then I realized that the characters advertised on Steam were going to be the only characters in the entire game. Not a single NPC or the generic I'm-here-to-guide-you friend are present to counter the flow. Simply put, not enough variety. The same goes for the songs. It could have used more variety, because no matter how soothing the tunes may have been, they wore me out by the midway point.   Lastly, the still images shown by the Steam previews account for a significant portion of the total stills present in the whole game. That shocks me now that I look back at it, and it further exemplifies the need for more variety, especially in a visual novel with characters so well designed.",
