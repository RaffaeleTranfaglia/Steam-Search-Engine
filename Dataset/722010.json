    "description": "Do you like to tickle nerves? Then this game is for you. Atmospheric rooms, nice graphics, with one very big mystery in the game B A S E M E N T. Notes that will immerse you in story history, sudden frights and discharging lights. All you need is to get out of the basement, I doubt that you can do it.",
