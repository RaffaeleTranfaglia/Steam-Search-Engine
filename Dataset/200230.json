            "review_text": "Most offroad racing games have you racing around a relatively smooth dirt track that maybe has a few jumps. This game has some tracks like that, but where it really shines is when the smooth track ends at a huge pile of rocks and the only way forward is up and over.  You have quite a bit of control over the vehicle with the ability to use lockers, adjust air pressure, switch between high and low gear ranges and a winch. Knowing how and when to use these systems is essential to finishing most of the tracks, thankfully a tutorial is provided. The graphics and climbing physics are impressive and there is a nice selection of vehicles, although a little more customization would be appreciated.  This game has some fairly significant issues however. The driving model works quite well at low speeds (including simulating how easy it is to get stuck in deep mud) but breaks down at higher speeds on the smooth sections of the track where the vehicle has no sense of weight and slides and bounces around unrealistically. When you do get stuck without a nearby tree to use as a winch anchor, the lack of a reset button means you have to restart the race which can be extremely frustrating with the length of some of the events. The game does at least reset you if you roll the vehicle or fall off the track.   In all the events you're racing a ghost ai which often feels cheaty when it effortlessly floats over a mud pit that you're stuck in up to your axles or hovers over broken rocks that hang you up at every turn. When it's not cheating it's not particularly smart and is relatively easy to beat.  Unlike most offroad games, there is no free roam mode. The tracks are very detailed with lots of interesting obstacles, but you're confined to a relatively narrow corridor that resets you back on the track if you stray outside the boundaries. Sometimes these boundaries aren't very clear so you'll miss a turn and end up off the track with a time penalty. At least you have the option to set up an empty multiplayer server and drive around the tracks by yourself to better learn them and to test out the vehicles. I haven't found anyone else who has this game to test out multiplayer with so I can't comment on how well that works.  For awhile this game appeared to have been abandoned with the devs being MIA but a recent update just a few days ago added additional language support so there is hope again that some of these issues will be fixed.  Despite all these issues, I still had a lot of fun simply because there aren't many games that actually simulate low speed rock crawling and scrambling (besides possibly spintires which I'm waiting for a good sale on). I can hesitantly recommend this game as long as you can live with the issues and you can find it on sale, with the number of unresolved issues I wouldn't be able to recommend it at the full asking price.  Pros: graphics track design rock crawling  Cons: cheaty ai poor vehicle handing at speed no way to get unstuck without restarting race no free roam  7/10",

Graphics Are great but could do some fixing. i Love Being able to get in the mud and dig and sling mud adding more to that would be fantastic considering once you hit a certain point in the mud you don't go down any farther and stop slinging mud. The biggest improvement by far to this game would to add a free roam in Different countries and sceneries",

I played it as long as I did only because I somehow thought that always using the internal view would be bearable. Sadly this isn't the case. Do not buy.",

Contrary to the official website this game features a multiplayer section that fails to work. I even downloaded and used Hamachi &amp; Tunngle with a friend and still no online co-op play. With such potential it is extremely sad that the makers have failed with this game. I only hope that a patch is released to fix this massive issue!  [UPDATE]  Since I last posted this review back on the 28th of December 2012 I have since then found a fix to be able to play multiplayer/co-op with a friend in Off-Road Drive. If you are reading this and you would like to know the fix just message me.",

The vehilcles power are not even close to how they perform in real life. This game feels like they got pretty close to being perfect and called it quits. And why no sandbox mode or a least a practice option to where you can just slowly crawl your way through a track for fun. Even in the start up video there is a vehicle slowly crawling it\\'s way through a course, but not once in this game will you be able to have that pace if you want to win. Would I recomend this game? Maybe if it was free, but it needs some more work, and it appears the only thing the developers are worried about it how many languages it has.",
