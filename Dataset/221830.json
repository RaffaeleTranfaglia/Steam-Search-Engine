The puzzles are quite a bit harder than the original Book of Unwritten Tales (which is welcome since it was a tad too easy), but this one has the same great writing and humor that made the first game so dang lovable. Critter Chronicles is a lot shorter, though, but that's to be expected since it is more of a side story than a full game.",

The graphics have improved, but I am looking forward to see how good it will be in the next gen of this game. Last but not least, the game is super fun, but it's still hard to see some of the small objects that you have to find during the game. Continue the good work King Art!  8/10",

From the characters, to the dialogue and the puzzles, everything comes together in a very entertaining adventure. The puzzles are not that hard, but they are fun to solve and they actually contribute to the story, an element that is very hard to find in adventure games at the moment. All in all, if you love a good, fun adventure story, don't miss on this one.",

It was for me about 9 hours of game play and that was totally my money worth it, but I did buy it on sale. The only down point I would give is that sometimes they are really reacting slow in the cut scenes. Even still it's a really good game.",

Ever play myst, riven, or obduction and think 'Hmmm, a cripple could step over that boundry and push that button, but i cannot.'? It's like that only much, much worse. for me it just feels so artificial and contrived that I cannot appreciate the game play. The goofy antics may entertain others, but apparently I'm terribly jaded.",

            "review_text": "Critter Chronicles is a point and click adventure game with a comedy theme. Most of the puzzles are inventory based, with a few minigames thrown in. None of the puzzles are too hard, although I did get stuck once on a minigame and had to consult a walkthrough. About half of the game was completed by my nine-year-old with a little help. I think this is a great game to play with your kids, they love the sophomoric humor. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Overall I thought this game was a little more polished and clever than the first one. I definitely recommend playing BoUT first before playing this game, since the story makes more sense this way. Overall the game was very entertaining for the story and the comedy, the puzzles keep you busy but are not all that challenging.",
