            "review_text": "a fun Tennis themed Angry Birds' style game, i'll explain in case you don't know what is Angry Birds. you have to knock the people in each stage using tennis balls, you aim where you want to serve and try to hit all the targets with one shot or as less shots as possible to get high scores. there are many obstacles like glass who would ruin your shot or a pack of tennis balls that will send many balls flying in the stage to knock your targets, but of course just like angry birds, some stages will require that random luck to finish using only one shot.   the game is cheap and its fun for sure, if you like angry birds type of games then there is a big chance you will enjoy this game too.",
