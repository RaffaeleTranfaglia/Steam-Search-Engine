Puzzle Quest is a silly wrapper around the puzzle game which ends up strangely compelling - you get special abilities your character can use which use 'mana' depending on which colored jewels you combine. You collect experience and money by matching those, and deal damage to your opponent via lining up skulls. Victory is defeating your enemy before your own health runs out. It manages to take an already addictive formula and make it even more addictive.  I was first exposed to this game via the Nintendo DS game, and honestly think that the game is more suited to a mobile platform than to the PC, but the game is still a lot of fun here. Check it out if you haven't.",

            "review_text": "Much like Final Fantasy, they keep trying to remake PuzzleQuest, but they just cant make a better puzzle game. This is the Bejeweled version of D&amp;D (Baldur's Gate) with a Final Fantasy Tactics inspired storyline (FFT was the best FF related game you didnt play other than Ehrgeiz ;). My second time buying this game and sixth time playing it through. (A+) 10/10 Killed Lord Bane in three moves, WOULD CRUSH DEMI-GODS AGAIN.   Ironiocly the fact that PuzzleQuest: Warlords is almost abandoned is a good thing. It isn't greedware spamming, intentionally trying to get you addicted or advertising anything. Its a relaxing casual game that will both challange and fustrate you in all the right ways. You can play this game for six months on one character campaign, and you still will be willing to play through a second time.   There are six Puzzle games by Infinite Interactive. This is still their best one. There is an X-pac (Revenge of the Plague Lord) currently not available on Steam at the time of this post, but there is a PC mod for it out there somewhere. Firemint now owns PQ so don't expect it to go on sale anytime soon and marval made its own version which is considered the best version since this one, but SCREW THAT GREEDY TEEN-POP NOISE.",

            "review_text": "Probably the best entry in the Puzzle Quest series. This one also happens to be the first. I will also note, that at the time of this review I only have 5 hours of gameplay, however have played the first Puzzle Quest on numerous platforms.  I has been ported many times, and has not suffered at all from it.   The game blends classic RPG elements like leveling, stat building, parties, main and side quests, shops with items and more with a simple match-3 puzzle game concept. It executes it very well.   The colored gems represent mana, aside from the purple stars and stack of coins which yield experience and gold upon matching. There are also skulls to match that damage your enemy. In puzzle quest your objective is to damage your enemie's health down to zero by either matching skulls or using the mana gained through gems with offensive spells. There are also other types of spells, meant for healing or a form of crowd control so the pace and complexity rises there and can add some fun gameplay and combinations to your moves. There are also the mechanic where if you match more than 3 of anything in one move, you gain an extra turn. The combination of all these makes for exciting, strategic gameplay.  The cons are that the story is rather stale, but this is firstly a puzzle game before anything else and can easily become overlooked. That is the only negative thing I can really come up with. Clever game; good fun. Highly recommended.",

You level up, gain skills/stats, collect items to add passive traits, and by all accounts the story mode is at least 30 hours long (I played 9 hours.)  It has quite a bit of depth for this type of match the color puzzle game: You basically battle AI or a person to cause damage to each other by matching skulls or casting spells by matching colors.  The reason I am not finishing it... 9 hours in and I do not feel like playing anymore because it feels like Color Match Grinding. Interesting but the random aspect can someone skrew you over or make a boss a joke. The random stuff can be frustrating that actually makes it boring after a few hours.  Worth it if you like this sort of thing!~",

The only negative feedback is the music doesn't loop very well, it can break your imersion suddenly when the music jumps to the begining of a track halfway through a note.

The only downside is the endless wandering monsters, which you run into every few steps when you travel, and even though there's no question you will defeat them, you still need to play the gem-matching game. But this is an annoyance that many RPGs with turn-based combat have. If you like RPGs AND gem matching games (you've got to like both), and you don't mind old school 2D graphics, then this game will be worth it.",

Fortunately, as far as leveling up goes, it has all the trappings of an RPG, replete with sidequests and a rich story. Unfortunately, it has all the trappings of an RPG, and that includes a steady grind. The game can be frustrating to come back to after a time away, especially where the story is concerned.  But at its heart, Puzzle Quest is trying to be your friend. It's a casual puzzle game in an RPG's clothings, and they're worn well.
