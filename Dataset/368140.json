            "review_text": "This is an excellent mix of Mario and Kirby gameplay styles. It's one of those games I keep playing because it is just plain FUN to play. You can jump into blocks to get coins and health items, like Mario. When you swing your staff at enemies, you can get that enemy's power, like Kirby. The special magical powers you can get are many and varied, and most of them are actually pretty useful. One thing this game does better than Kirby is that you can hold two powers at once and switch between them on the fly. This makes the game alot more dynamic. Coins can be used to buy health upgrades or special powers. There is a hidden item you can find in each stage, as well as a secret exit to a secret shop in each world; these can extend the replay value if you like. The level design is generally good (not stellar like Mario 3 or Mario World, but fun). The graphics are simple yet effective, with levels having a style similar to Super Mario World and enemy designs similar to the Kirby games. The music is catchy and fun to listen to.  The controls are a little bit floaty, making it hard to land difficult jumps at first. You character slides a bit whenever you want to turn around or stop. However, I got used to the controls after a few stages and can play it just fine now. If you play the demo and have some trouble, keep in mind that you will get used to the controls with a bit of practice.  This isn't really a casual game, even though it looks that way from the screenshots. After the first couple of worlds, things start to get pretty challenging, probably slightly below the level of the average Megaman X game. Some of the stages are trememdously difficult to the point of absurdity. If you aren't already good at platformers, you'll probably have serious trouble clearing the game because of this. That being said, the difficulty curve is relatively gradual and fair. There are only a couple times where I felt the difficulty spiked for no reason. Deaths are usually the fault of the player, and not because you were blindsided by some random thing you couldn't see coming. And really, the gameplay is so fun that it has that 'just one more time!' factor built in, so you'll want to keep playing until you overcome each challenge.  This game puts a big smile on my face when I play it. It's not perfect, but a game doesn't need to be perfect to be worth playing. It's a must play for people who like 2D platformers. ",

The plot is wonderfully cheesy with many laughs to be had. Definitely recommend if you're a 2D platformer fan, I definitely got my money's worth at around $2 at the time but I don't think it's worth it at full price.",
