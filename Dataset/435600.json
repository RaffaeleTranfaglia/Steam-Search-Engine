            "review_text": "Just started playing and am having a pretty good time with this genre blending game. Essentially, you are defending a tower from a variety of enemies. You have quite a lot of options on defensive items to build between levels, and the action ramps up fairly quickly as you go along.  On the plus side, there are a lot of ways to customize your character with stat boosts and such. Plus the towers are fun to build and deploy. A good bit of strategy there.  On the negative side, if the setting changes, I haven't made it that far yet. I think you stay on the same tower for the entire game for as long as you can survive the waves. This could become boring for some people after awhile.  Overall, I'm enjoying the game and do recommend it.",
