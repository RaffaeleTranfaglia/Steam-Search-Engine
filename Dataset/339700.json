Ok now this game is kinda good i just wish they would have the option to change the controls around for both mouse &amp; keyboard and gamepad also that they would add a few patches to this game i did find a few glitches and some lag and i wish they would add the option to turn off that shield icon in the bottom left off. So if you see this game on sale you should buy but if they do fix the things i said and add the options i said it would be worth full price and yes i am overlooking that this is a iphone game port",

            "review_text": "Hello, and today we are reviewing I, Gladiator. This game is based inside the roman arena where intense stand offs and bloody carnage took place. I, Gladiator successfully recreates the brutal and unforgiving world that was arena fighting, complete with chopping fighters hands, arms, legs and of course heads off! However this game isnt mindless violence with lack of depth to it, infact there is a VAST array of customisation that can take place! You can buy countless weapons, armour, shields from the local merchant. You can also upgrade your character with skill points upon leveling up as you progress through the game. The story behind this game is of the main character Rufus who was at the very pinnacle of the arena world, until the unforgiving world of the arena betrayed and forsaken him to the lair of Hades. I, Gladiator is a story of betrayal to triumph and revenge, with intuitive fighting controls that feel responsive and fluid, just as you would expect from a fast paced fighting game! We here at ZaccyboyGaming really enjoyed our brief time with this game, with its exciting combat and deadly executions, to its vast customisation options. Even the multiplayer fights are well implemented and enjoyable, with the opportunity to taunt your friends because you have destroyed them! i,Gladiator is currently on sale on steam for a very respectable and low price, so make sure you pick this game up! We at ZaccyboyGaming give I,Gladiator 8/10.  Stay tuned for more Reviews on some more great games :)",

Graphics are kinda nice I guess but it doesn't save this game. I really can't recommend this at least in it's current state.  Somehow Steam doesn't keep track of my game time. It's about 2hrs, not 0,1. (this is a lie)",

Tell him to swing a sword and he stands there to 5 seconds doing nothing... tell him to dodge and he stands there getting 7 shotted by some low level npc bozo... Poor controls, very frustrating. Kind of improtant in this sort of game.",
