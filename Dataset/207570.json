Very first impression is 'Oh, this is just sokoban', and then it starts ramping up newer and newer concepts on you throughout the whole game,   A downside is that if you get stuck on a puzzle, you don't have many options to simply play around that puzzle - you HAVE to solve it in order to progress, even if that means looking up the solution. A case could be made that if you don't master the concept in an earlier puzzle, it will bite you in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in a later puzzle anyway, but I'm not sure that is always true.   If this sounds like your type of game, the amount of content makes it worth the full $5 pricetag. Otherwise, move on.",

Just be warned: it is real 3D, you WILL have to rotate the camera, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• IS going to become hard in under 5 levels.  I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing love it already.",

The first thing I noticed about this game were the rather quaint aesthetics and atmosphere. The game has a somewhat lax feel almost begging the player to continue. The varied puzzle types keep the game interesting and at times unforgiving. I'll be stuck on a level for a while, then out of nowhere an answer will appear making me feel like I've learnt, adapted and achieved something I had previously not been able to do or figure out. I got this on sale, for 39p, but this game is definitely worth the full price and is a must-have for puzzle fanatics or just the casual gamer... or everyone basically.",

One particularly merciless puzzle (very mild spoiler) requires you to build your OWN puzzle and solve it. You'll spend 30 minutes just figuring out how to design a puzzle that is solvable in the first place. Most puzzles will take you a few minutes, but you'll eventually be stumped, and you'll fiddle around with one for an hour. This game is perfect for masochists.",

This is a good game, but be warned: this is not something to play to unwind. This is something to play when you want to give your brain a good workout. With that in mind, I definitely recommend.",

They're a challenge at times (which is what you want from a game like this) and change style A LOT! It also fully runs on Linux without any problems whatsoever. A small perk: the menu is very interestingly styled. For a cheap price highly recommended!   Subjective final score: 8/10  I shaved off points for in-game textures of the world and music, plus missing labels in the menu. They're all minor complaints in comparison to gameplay and such, but you don't want to give a game 10/10 when it's not absolutely perfect ;) ... I tend to be rather strict.  Big thumbs up.  ",
