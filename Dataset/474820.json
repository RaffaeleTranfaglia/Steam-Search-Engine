            "review_text": "I really wish there was an option to give a neutral review, because The Magical Silence is not without merit. The game is artfully made, and I really like its dreamlike, whimsical nature. However, the game is incredibly small, and once you have figured out what to do (which isn't very obvious), it can be easily completed in less than 10 minutes. That would be fine, as I don't really mind brief games when they achieve their purpose, but the ending of this game just seemed so...pointless. It was going for surprising, I suppose, but it just came off as unnecessarily morbid and disappointing. This is a case of the game being much more about the journey than the destination, but the journey was hampered by controls that I found somewhat buggy, and the exploratory gameplay was only marginally enjoyable. If you pick up this game as a part of a bundle, I would say go ahead and give it a whirl, but I wouldn't buy it unless it's discounted.",

            "review_text": "Watch the youtube video first (pretty boring and short).  There is one (yes 1) achievement which is lost if you deinstall the game.  If you have wrist problems, avoid this game. It wants you to spasm click things. Sorry, that is the extent of the 'puzzles'.",

            "review_text": "A short, surreal point-and-click game. Even considering its criminally short length, it is frustrating because it's very difficult to discover what you are supposed to do. I was hoping from the images and description that this would be something like Samorost, but to draw such a comparison would be a huge disservice to that game. You explore an area with your mouse cursor, scrolling around clicking stuff and hoping it progresses you somehow. Repeat a few times and the game is over. As I finished it, I couldn't believe what I had completed was not just an introductory level.  The artwork is nice, reminds me of old windows stuff (in a good way) but there really isn't very much of it. If it weren't for the unfathomable 'puzzles' you could complete this in a couple of minutes. I can't believe anyone has got the trading cards for this game without just idling it. Charging money for it is very cheeky, and even for less than a pound it's really not worth it. There are lots of free games on Steam, and you'd do better with almost any one of them.  If this is meaningful, I don't understand it, and whatever its meaning is must be pretty darned brief.",

It is what it is for the price. I can't even begin to give this a score. It's like a low-budget 'The Mighty Boosh' game. I would recommend it, even if it is just so other people get to see for themselves how weird this game is haha.",

All I did was click until things happened and the illuminati at the bottom which summoned apples from the sky and televisions from the sea. wat. Also now I'm sad about how the story ended, if you can call it that.",
