            "review_text": "I was really conflicted about whether or not this game deserves a thumbs up.  In my opinion, the amount of cons outnumbered but did not outweigh the pro's, read below why. I'd say: if you can live with the cons listed below, by all means do check out the game.  Pro's: - Really cool creative puzzle mechanics! Takes a while to get your head wrapped around it. - Soft colours, nice simplistic art style and music. - Philosophical messages in between the levels. - After playing a while, you learn how to take 'shortcuts' in the game, entering sections at weird angles and getting away with it.  - This whole game is made by one person. - Cheap game, and it will probably take a couple of hours to finish it.  Cons: - Everytime after I flipped the world, I couldn't move my mouse right away after the landing, it'd snap right back into front view position before I could look around properly. In a game like this, that is a big disadvantage and very annoying. - WHY is spacebar the 'turn the world upside down' button? How many times I instinctively tried to jump and instead flew off into oblivion... - No rebinding keys. - The mouse sensitivity is way too low! - The camera angle: it's hard to tell what's right below you and when you flip the world it's disorienting. (- It doesn't tell you how many crystals you need to collect per level. Can be annoying at times.) (- Little spelling errors in English.) (- When I started the game a while ago, the achievements didn't work. These are now added.) (- I still don't understand the use of the Special Tube... except that one time I randomly drifted into space, created a Special Tube, steered myself towards it and it dragged me right back into the level.)   Thanks for reading, I hope this has been of some help to you.",
