            "review_text": "Touch an arrow, and gravity changes to that direction. You have the freedom of placing the arrows before starting the level and adjusting between tries. Add a bit of platforming and orb collecting and you have Gravity Error.  The game's design might look simplistic but it easily pulls you in especially with its soundtrack, and if you happen to be very good at platform puzzle games you will find yourself finishing this in one sitting. Some levels are harder than they look if you plan to get all orbs. Overall worth the low price tag.  I only wish it had more challenge-based achievements, but that's just me.",
