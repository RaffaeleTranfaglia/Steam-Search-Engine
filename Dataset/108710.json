Nice mountain scenery, pleasant radio and television stations. 'Filmness' and climate pours out of the screen - and is still a great audio track at the end of each chapter.Feels like you are playing through a Stephen King book. The game mechanics are good and everything is so pretty! Worth recommending.",

            "review_text": "Let's get one thing out of the way: If you're a creative type, especially a writer of any persuasion, Alan Wake is worth a playthrough just for the subject matter, namely the nature of dreams, the unconscious, and the creative process, and how they are all tied up in each other. Any professional fiction writer will tell you that they often don't know where their 'ideas' come from -- they might as well just come straight out of the proverbial ether, and to anyone else it sounds like superstitious mumbo-jumbo. But the truth is, it often really does come out of left field, left field being that ocean of subconscious impulses and images that is constantly roiling in everyone's heads. A writer's job is paying attention to those images when they do show up, when most people can comfortably ignore them, and that makes it a tricky business. That's the gist of what Alan Wake deals with, and if anything, it's worth it to see what the game devs have to say about it.  Is it a GOOD story? Well. That is entirely up to your interpretation of the events in the game. And I'll mostly leave it at that. I'll give some of my impressions in no particular order: If you like the show  LOST , you'll like this. If you like David Lynch's stuff, you will like this, particularly for some of the music and very obvious homages to things like  Twin Peaks ,  Blue Velvet  and perhaps  Lost Highway . That is to say, if you want things to make sense in a linear way, forget it. It's actually a little bittersweet to play through this if you are a big fan of Lynch, because while Alan Wake is very very obviously a love letter to the 'weird stuff happening in a little town' genre, and it really does nail some of the spooky imagery that Lynch is known for, the characters and the dialogue fall disappointingly flat. It's a very rough imitation of the unforgettable dialogue of  Twin Peaks ,  Blue Velvet , etc. I can't fault them that much for that, because at least they tried. Enough of that.  Gameplay is pretty technically tight with satisfying, challenging gunplay mixed up with light-source mechanics -- you weaken things with your flashlight, and then blast them. It's fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. But, and this just may be my low tolerance for the same damn thing over and over, there are many times later in the game where you wish you could just get it over with. The pacing is a little annoying and predictable at times; when you would appreciate a chance to just wander around in the more story-oriented areas, suddenly you're back in the gauntlet of enemies running through the nighttime forest. And there is a LOT of nighttime forest. You've never seen so many trees! But they certainly look pretty. One of my biggest gripes would have to be the fact that the game occasionally does not follow its own rules, which inevitably leads to some frustrating reloads. The enemies will sometimes cheap-shot you, for example falling on you while you're in the middle of opening a chest; most of the time you cannot break out of certain 'cinematic' moments fast enough and it will screw you fairly mercilessly. Thankfully reload times are fast and the checkpoints for the most part are plentiful and logical. Just minor annoyances when it comes down to it.  It's a fun ride for the most part. I wish I could say that 'this is, excuse me, a  damn  fine cup of coffee,' but for several reasons it's just a pretty good cup of joe. You take what you can get, though!",

            "review_text": "Alan Wake is the sort of game only the people at Remedy could pull off. It has all the charm and meticulous world-building that made the Max Payne series great with the game universe having its own pop culture you're privvy to and yet managing to keep your nerves on edge.  It's not a terrifying game in the sense that Amnesia or Silent Hill are (though Silent Hill is the series I'd liken it to the most) but it does its job as a suspenseful and tense survival horror nonetheless. Using light as a weapon and having to conserve your resources makes every fight an exciting one and the pacing is very well executed, giving you the occasional downtime while the story advances.  The story is an interesting breed and pays homage to multiple works from HP Lovecraft and Stephen King to Twin Peaks and the Twilight Zone and does its job well to keep you playing. There are some over-arching themes that I found interesting, but that I won't spoil here. Suffice to say that as far as Survival Horror stories go, Alan Wake is at least moderately ambitious, thematically. The structure is an episodic one splitting the story in several manageable 2-3 hour long chapters giving you a clear cut between story arcs so that you can take a break for the day.  The graphics make for some beautiful, if perhaps a bit dated, sceneries even if most of the game takes place at night. There is attention to detail to spare in Alan Wake and it seems to be a labor of love. The sound and voice acting are subject to little criticism and I guarantee that at least one or two tracks from the score and soundtrack will wind up in your playlist.  It comes highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "It's about time I reviewed Alan Wake, Remedy's new IP and genius creation. The game takes many ideas from a TV show (It's split in Episodes, 6 if I recall correctly, and at the end of each episode there is this DUN-DUN-DUUUNNNN moment, that makes you want to play the next episode. During that final episode moment, there will also be played a nice song, which suits the mood very well!) The game is, overall, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece, the effort put into this game is clearly huge, as I will explain later. As for gameplay, it's unique in most aspects: you fight the 'taken' during the whole campaign (don't worry, it's varied enough, there are maybe like 5 or 6 types of taken, excluding the possessed objects, which are thrown in your direction and cause massive damage!) and they are protected with some sort of 'shadow armor' that you will need to break with your flashlight and finally shoot them with your gun. To break the shadow shield just simply point your flashlight at them (the flashlight is also your crosshair, sounds weird but surprisingly works quite well!), to destroy the armor faster, you can 'focus' the flashlight, but it will drain your battery much faster! This mechanic is genius, since it adds tension to the table! You will constantly have to check if you have enough batteries so that you can more freely spam focus the flashlight or be more careful about the use of the batteries (And I strongly recommend you don't spam the flashlight at all! This game on Normal or above is harder than 90% of modern games! You will often run out of ammo or batteries, and if that happens, you do what most people do in horror movies: F'cking run like the wind!!) and the same goes to saving bullets, which are surprisingly scarce and the enemies take a few shots to die, mainly the big ones! The axe guys take a full 6 round clip from the revolver or a full (2 shells) double-barrel shotgun blast! Gameplay also features a dodge mechanic which allows you to avoid incoming attacks, whether the attack are ranged or melee, occasionally the dodge mechanic, if successful, will result in a cinematic slow-motion dodge, which looks very nice and quite badass! Moving to the graphics, this is an XBOX360 game from 2010 ported to the PC in 2012 (this game doesn't exist for PS3, most likely because the PS3 can't handle it &gt;:D) and the game is heavy as ♥♥♥♥! I'm not joking! It's very heavy and this mainly applies (I think) to it's fantastic lighting effects which blow anything I've ever seen in term of lighting effects out of the water! Shadow quality is top-notch as well, and the attention to detail is amazingly high! The game runs well on my AMD, no lag or FPS drops, so you should expect the same smooth gameplay, if you have a decent PC. Continuing to the graphics department, the game has also very nice and smooth animations! Moving on to voice-acting: amazing! The game can sometimes be creepy with the shadow voices or funny when you talk to some people, usually Barry, Alan's manager. Finally getting to the story: the story itself is original and epic in almost every aspect, from the amazing voice acting/ lip-syncing, to the storyline itself, which takes huge twists and turns and concludes to an amazing ending (and this isn't a clear ending, like Bioshock or Spec Ops, you will need to think about the story as a whole and think a bit about the end part of the campaign) but when it all becomes clear, it's a joy of an ending! Alan is a successful writer that goes on vaction with his wife to clear his head and get away from the fame, but he has nightmares with weird shadows (the taken) that go after him and then they move on to real life and ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan from then on, after his wife is kidnapped...  Alan Wake deserves a 9.5/10; It doesn't deserve a full score because it has only a campaign that lasts 10 hours! And for 27,99€ it isn't really worth it, although the campaign is great! Usually you will find it 90% off, that is 3 euros the whole freakin' collection (DLC and a second game [it's a spin-off, not a sequel]) and is completely worth it!",

When this game went on sale, i immediately bought it because i enjoyed American Nightmare, so i thought that probably i would enjoy the main game even more and i did.  The combat system its not the best, but its okay for PC. The story itself and the events that happen on the game are pretty good, the idea of the darkness vs light was innovative for its time and for people that like good storylines in videogames, you have here a good example of it.  I could see Alan Wake as a TV show, but i enjoyed it a lot as a videogame and i wish they release a sequel of the game, maybe to close this series with a 'happy ending' to Alan´s story. I think the guy deserves it by now.  8/10. I carry a flashlight everytime i go out in the darkness, just in case. Thx Remedy Entertainment.",

The city of Bright Falls captures that American small town feeling perfectly in my opinion, and a big part of the charm in this game is the enviroment: It's extremely detailed, the surrounding areas that you get to explore, the characters, their dialoque, it all creates this awesome world that (at least for me) is easy to immerse in. This isn't an open world game, it's pretty linear in the end, relying more to tradiotional level-structure than fully open world, but the areas are diverse, feel real and are interesting to explore.  The plot is better-than-your-average horror story. I didn't finish the extra episodes yet, so i know only the main game, but as a horror lover (note: real horror, not gore, people seem to confuse those these days) i can say that the story is good. Everything isn't handed to you, some questions are left to be answered by the player in his/her own way.  Controls are tight, i played on keyboard + mouse, but controller works fine too. I didn't encounter a single bug on my playthrough, so it's a quality product. This is one of the games that shuold be on every dedicated gamer's shelf, virtual or physical shelf :D I got the physical collector's edition myself. And also the novel that this game inspired!

The visuals and audio were beautiful, and the presentation of the content in a movie-like fashion was brilliant and fit the game perfectly. The NPCs in the game are VERY well done and helped lighten the mood in a dark game. Not to mention, I don't think I ever heard a repeated phrase by a character and I loved that about this game.   The actual game play however was very poorly done for my taste. The fights were repetitive, predictable, intrusive, and unnecessary. Every 15 steps the game would interrupt my progression with a slow-motion introduction of a 'new' set of enemies, and all I could think was 'just let me play the game'. It made enemies too familiar which took away any of the horror feel that they were supposed to bring to the game.  There were a few pieces of actual game play that were fantastic and stood out from the rest in my eyes. The battle on the stage at the farm was the most enjoyable out of all of the combat scenes in the game. The music and the rock-and-roll stage scene made me feel like a boss killing all of the Taken, and having Barry there to cheer me on made it feel like I was fighting with a friend. Although not every combat scene can feel that epic, having more scenarios like this would have made the game play much more enjoyable. Even just changing up the music for other fights would have helped add variety.  While I did not enjoy the combat, every other aspect of the game greatly helped it redeem itself. The entire story and ending left me in awe and I very much look forward to seeing it continue in the future.

I started it yesterday and played it the whole day (with my shutters closed of course) and it hasn't bored me yet.   The story is gripping and the characters are well-defined, even though the facial animation is so sloppy everyone seems to be suffering from a stroke all the time. And even though Wake is a geeky writer, it's extremely irritating to see him get winded, slowing to the speed of an octogenarian and gasping for breath every two seconds, even with crazy axe murderers chasing after him.   As always, with any computer game in the history of the world, driving is horribly implemented (steering with the WASD keys, in this day and age? Seriously?!), and the strangely skewed third-person perspective is a bit uncomfortable for first-person aficionados like me, but I suppose that's part of the survival horror genre.  I'm not gonna review graphics and stuff, because seriously, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ as long as the game is good? (They're lovely though)  Still, those little things aside, if you like survival horror, this is a must-buy, and even if you're just indifferent to the genre, like me, it's still a worthwhile purchase - but wait 'til it's on sale again.",

            "review_text": "Alan Wake is another stunning example of a stylish cinematic (and yet rich in gameplay) narrative experience that has become a trademark of Remedy Entertainment. Following the story of a writer who may or may not have found himself inside a horror novel he has been writing, this game is a delightfully postmodern journey that constantly makes the player doubt his perception, and the reality of time/space. What is true, what is but a dream, is the protagonist a 'real' man or a character - but wait, isn't he the character of a game that you're playing? Drawing heavily on the style and works of Stephen King and David Lynch, Alan Wake leads you through a dangerous track of uncertainty, and through that achieves genuine tension. It may not be a very scary 'horror game', but it definitely is filled with anxiety.  Another highlight of Alan Wake is its unique multi-layered narrative - one that can only be found in the art of interactive media. The plot unfolds simultaneously through a variety of sources: the actual story experience, pages of an in-game novel that the player collects, occasional radio broadcasts, the timely use of licensed and original music, episodes of an in-game TV series... *and* the TV series that the game pretends to be with its episodic format! It's clever, it's ever dynamic and it is also a smart instrument of manipulating our fears. Every now and then the games 'spoils' an event to come - for example, by revealing an attack on the protagonist with the next page of a novel - yet it deliberately omits the circumstances, the 'where' and 'when', thus driving the player to assume that the said event might happen anywhere and at any time during the episode.  With Alan Wake, Remedy Entertainment also re-establishes itself as one of the leaders in video game art direction. While it's simple to say the game is a beautiful one - and remains so even even now, at the dawn on the new console generation - it is first and foremost *effective* in employing colors, character and location design and, naturally, light and shadows to affect the player emotionally. Like any good horror story, Alan Wake builds up tension not as much through confrontation with 'scary stuff' as it does by visually dividing safe areas, small and well-lit, and the vast dark misty territory of the unknown dangers outside. The game encourages exploration through various collectibles, yet here exploration require courage.  In the world of Alan Wake, every step is not taken lightly - and thus matters all the more. This game is an engaging experience with a complex story, fascinating characters (all the more fascinating because of how they might not be real), outstanding game design and a sense of dread that is sure to cling to you for days to come, making your heart skip a beat every time you find yourself on a dark street with only a faint light of street lamp in the distance.",

Alan Wake has a good feel to it, a bit creepy when running around the forest and enemies appear! I love the concept of the light. Standing in light protects you from enemies and you must point and boost your flashlight onto enemies before shooting them. You can use flares, flaregun and flashbangs along with a pistol, two different shotguns and hunting rifle. There are a lot of hidden items through-out the forest you must collect.

By the time episode 4 started, I really thought about putting it down and not finishing because I just wanted it to end already. But I did finish it.

Fighting in the dark against torrents of 'taken' farmhands and mechanics is certainly my idea of a good time.   The graphics are amazing in this game, allowing for countless opportunities to take snapshots of the beautiful rural scenery both in light and dark - but even if they weren't, there would still be much to be enjoyed through the narrative that one becomes intrigued and lost in. I cannot overstate enough the narrative genius that is communicated through this game.   There is only one negative that I would have to say about this game, and that is the driving - which can often feel sluggish and untamable. However, this does not in any way detract from the game's overall ability to impress.   I have thoroughly enjoyed this horror, and if anyone knows of any that are similar, please let me know.  10/10 without a doubt.",

It is one of the most atmospheric games I've played and ranks in my small personal list of great games.  Play alone, in the dark and with headphones. Engage your imagination and child-like fear of the dark, then feel your skin crawl as you play. Never did a lamp-post look so appealing. Enjoy.  Note: For me, get the original and stick with it because the extra bonus levels and American nightmare just don't cut it at all. They don't have the same well written atmosphere to them and do nothing for the terrific ending of the first game.  During the game listen to Alan Wakes' description of what makes a horror story feel real etc etc. If you get what he's saying then just stop at the end of the first game.

The light/darkness mechanic is the core point of this game and very interesting to play with, unfortunately I expected more variety and creative use of its possibilities, but the game fall short of that, giving you a dozen of weapons and creatures to play around instead.

Remedy did it again, the game felt quite like Max Payne did, while at the same time managing to set its own distinctive path.  The atmosphere, story and graphics were awesome, like a good Stephen King horror book/movie should be. The creators made it so the game plays in episodic segments, much like a TV series and the inspirations they got from said movies, tv shows and books are noticeable throughout all its length.  I personally found it to be much more than a horror story though, it also has the classic struggle of a man to save his loved one, but even more than that, it's a metaphor for a man who tries to overcome his fears and problems and in the end manages to 'return'. I won't spoiler you the rest, play the game till the last dlc to understand!  Despite all that, the comedy element, numerous references and witty lines which defined Max Payne are present here too, Remedy made sure of that. Especially Alan Wake's best buddy, Barry provides great comedy relief feeling and lines!  The soundtrack was equally awesome, from its haunting pieces to fitting works of various artists, with band Poets of the Fall being in the spotlight with 3 songs. The band had also worked on the second Max Payne game.  My only complaints here were the gameplay and the checkpoints system.   The gameplay manages to catch your attention at first with its innovative style, but gets repetitive and annoying pretty fast and unfortunately it doesn't improve much later in the game. Max Payne had a similar issue, however, being a more fast paced game, it didn't stand out that much. As for the checkpoints system, I wished there were more in some spots, as losing in said points and starting all over was quite infuriating.  Hopefully they will fix these issues in the game's true sequel, which, due to poor sales performance, seems like will never see the light of the day, but I do believe will eventually manage to come through and shine light in the darkness!  Until then, if you are a fan of all the above, wake up and play Alan Wake!",

The main character is a writer, so he is portrayed as not very athletic. This translates into the feeling of slugish and unresponsive movement. Enemies must first be cleansed of darkness by shining a flashlight on them for varying amounts of time (3-10 seconds). I found this mechanic to be a bit frustrating later in the game. The flashlight also acts as the targeting reticule. There are 5 different guns available: revolver, double-barrel shotgun, pump-action shotgun, hunting rifle and the flare gun. The flare gun acts as a rocket launcher since all of the enemies are weak to light. There are also flashbangs and road flares. Ammo is somewhat scare, and there will be times when the player will be out of ammo if care isn't taken. There is no upgrade system in this game.  If you play games for the storytelling, then you will probably like this title. The main character and his wife go on vacation to a small pacific northwest town in an attempt to cure his writer's block. I found the characters to be mostly interesting. I also though that the dialog and voice acting were very good.  The design of the world and the characters is very good in my opinion. The lighting is mostly dark, though. There are a few sections of the story that take place during the day, but most of it is during the night.  I was annoyed by the frailty and sluggishness of the main character, and the fact that most of the game takes place at very low light levels. This obviously gave a sense of urgancy to everything, but this changed to annoyance for me towards the later parts of the story. I also foung the game to be more challenging than I would have expected on the lowest difficulty setting.  Overall, I enjoyed my time with this title.

It feels like an interactive book, the cutscenes are well done and the one you learn about the story by finding pages from your book fits in very well.

I am merely making the Silent Hill reference to show you what a great story-driven and carefully crafted game Alan Wake is. It is certainly not a Silent Hill clone and is very unique.  Clever story, fun combat, and some very tense moments. The atmosphere and story work together perfectly. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, and some parts of the game will really get your heart pumping. I won't spoil anything. I'll just say some of the scenes get really intense. There are a few puzzles thrown into the mix, but they are pretty basic and easy. The story and fun combat is where this game shines.   I will admit that some parts of the game were really hard for me, even on easy mode, but you can get through them with a little learning (learn to find the hidden item caches, look for alternate paths, run instead of fight, etc). I don't fault the game for this because it made me think of alternate solutions and made it feel really satisfying when I finally beat a part of the game that was giving me problems. Don't worry about it too much though. Checkpoints are encountered often so you won't have to replay much if you die.   Picked it up for $5 during a sale, but would have no problem paying the full price. You can easily tell within moments of playing that the creators were passionate about making a great game. It's an awesome game worth playing for people who enjoy adventure/action horror games.",

Nowadays its really hard to find game with good characters, solid storyline (without big holes in narrating), and unique combat system. Alan Wake got all this qualities. Probably combat system is the main feature of Alan Wake. Using flashlight on enemies and only after that shoot them makes this game real survival horror (specially when you are against few enemies). Variety of light weapon is impressing. Alan got different models of flashlights, flash grenades, flyers and etc. but at the same time only one revolver and and couple hunt rifles (proly i might forgot something ᘳ º ͜ʖ º ᘰ ). Thing that you dont have advanced military guns (like M4s or AKs) is also a great plus for survival horror game. The second best part of this game is a storyline. Hands down, Sam Lake and Ilkka Villi made a great job to create tension plot with cool and unique characters and well-written dialogues between them. Also pages that you can find all over the game explain big part of the plot and make dark'n'evil atmosphere. This game really held me till its end and truly recommend to everybody who did not try this game still. Regrettably this game was a victim of weird Microsoft policy. It was Xbox 360 exclusive for 2 years. In 2012 it finally came out on PC and developers were really impressed by the sales. Despite that whole sales numbers were low... That's one of the reasons why now we see Quantum break and not Allan Wake 2. P.S. After Alan Wake i have no doubts that Sam Lake is one my favourite writers in game industry. P.P.S. Looking forward to Quantum Break. P.P.P.S. If you just like me are Shinji Mikami fan and you love Resident Evil series and Evil Within you must buy Alan Wake! └[◔.◔]┘",

The storyline is excellent with Wake giving narration of what's occurring in game as you find pages of the unpublished book. Kinda odd that they treated it as an episodic game when it never releeased as seperate episodes, but I guess they were going for a 'You should probably take a break now and process all the awesome you just played' to break up the story.

The story centers around Alan Wake (didn't see that coming, did you? :P) a writer who gets caught up in supernatural events. The story isn't the most original in the world, but it gives credit where credit is due. Homages to Stephen King and Twin Peaks, among others, give Alan Wake a surrealistic charm.   The 'Light vs the Dark' mechanic works extremely well. Flashlight batteries and ammo are most definitely resources to be used judiciously (run out and you'll be sweating bullets).   Personally, I loved this game mechanic. Nowhere in Alan Wake do you ever find random ammo and battery dumps just so you can stock up. When you do find them, you'll probably faint in relief. IMO, the game ALWAYS gives you just enough resources to survive the various encounters. No more, no less. How you survice, IF you survive, will require a little thinking on your part.   Additionally, every 'encounter' and discovery serves to drive the story forward; 'filler material' is almost non-existant. Very few games out there can make that claim. Be patient as the game is like any well written thriller (film or literature). There are 'red herrings' and detours but they too serve the overall story.   The ending will certainly leave some peope confused but never fear! Simply go the Main Menu, options, episodes, and voila! The two DLC that come with the game, 'The Signal' and 'The Writer' will be there for you to continue the story. &lt;'The Signal' is the episode you'll want to start with&gt;   I bought Alan Wake during a Steam sale at 75% off though I would have gladly paid full price for it.

The environment is gloomy, dreadful, with hints of gothic.  + The setting might resemble Silent Hill.

Combat mechanics were not always the most spot on, but really combat is a correlary to the story not the overal purpose of playing, and it all kinda smoothed out well.

The game overral has a great atmosphere, giving you a jist of the story through dialogue and giving you the rest through hidden pages/TV's/Radios. It's dark, and you fend off enemies with your greatest weapon: LIGHT! (oh and guns too). The game is very well written and narrated as it's done by Alan himself (they really went full out by modeling a character from a real guy). The game also has a bunch of small jumpscares scattered throughout the game in the form of 2 second cutscenes with lound noises, but I guess you get used to it. The gameplay part is fun and Wake moves fluidly through Bright Falls.  Overall, I would definitly recommend this to any fan of good storytelling and mystery.

            "review_text": "From the makers of Max Payne comes a thriller originally released exclusively on the Xbox360 in 2010. Remedy finally did what it promised to PC gamers a long time ago.  As a Remedy fan I had to preorder this, and I was pleased to see this as a port done right, even though the game was meant to be a Windows Vista exclusive in the first place. Because of Micro$oft's tyranny over the IP, many PC gamers felt left down. Some even built new computers just to play this game back in the day.  In Alan Wake you collect manuscript pages, damn fine coffee in thermos and shoot stacked beer cans. Light is your key to survival against the dark forces, which try to stop you as you are looking for your loved one. Exciting!  If you like Twin Peaks, X-Files, Twilight Zone and Roy Orbison's In Dreams, this is the game for you. Story has been divided into parts to represent a TV series. Gameplay mechanics may be old for some and the combat gets repetitive towards the end, but nevertheless it is still an exciting psychological thriller.  Alan Wake surprised many of us by making it's sudden appearance on Steam, and this time on the right platform on which it belongs!   For people who like to tweak their games a little there are a number of good SweetFX profiles for the game that sharpens the image, adds more depth to colors and makes the game look overall less washed out. Try 'em!",

He decides that he needs time away from being bothered by many of his rampant fans. Him and his wife go to a small town called Brightsprings where they plan to vacation at. Throughout the game Alan starts to notice things are going strange thoughout their trip. If you have a decent computer that can handle the beautiful graphics and you are looking for a horror/adventure game I recommend you take a look at Alan Wake when it goes on sale. Personally in my opinion after playing through the game, I rate it 4.3/5 because the game has a interesting story line along with beautiful graphics and combat, however the game does not attract me to play it over again for a long time.",

The gameplay is honestly rather repetitive, and takes some getting used to in that, for whatever reason, Alan doesn't walk straight ahead when you hold forward. But really, it's very easy to overlook and ignore those issues, as they become extremely insignificant when compared to the story. Between the cutscenes, in-game narration and various manuscript pages you find throughout the game, I really got the feeling of reading a great book that you just can't put down. I'd stay up long into the night playing it, constantly on edge, wanting to find out what happened next. The only thing that broke complete immersion for me was the, eh, less-than-subtle and out-of-place product placement here and there.

City dude with writer's block going on vacation in remote town which is being taken over by an omnious dark presence controlling people and things; battle between dark and light; a lot of psychologial mindplay and questioning whether it is all actually happening or not; manuscript pages scattered around that describe the events before Wake has them happening to him and the townsfolk. - Game is designed like an episodic TV thriller. Theme is packed into a damsel-in-distress story which is not totally chliché all over, but I don't know, is love the only thing that keeps heroes going on in fiction? There is more to life than that, there are other ambitions and there can be more reasoning. But I guess it serves as some kind of red thread. - Gameplay has interesting ideas: Getting attacked by dark figures from multiple sides in small spaces, dodging their attacks (melee mostly), 'burning' away the darkness that has captured them with a flashlight and shooting them, using other light sources for area-of-effect attacks or as defense barriers and seeking them as beacons of hope and restoration. Sometimes however it felt repetitive and (on my difficulty setting) too easy in it's execution. The game wants you to feel constantly haunted by the dark presence, there sure is enough action, but once you understand how to dodge and fight the enemies there is some lack of challenge, and with it the feel of being threatened boils down somewhat. - Settings sometimes become rather repetitive too. Many levels play in rather dense forest and rural areas. Which makes sense gameplay- and (I assume) geographical-wise. Most enemies attack you with melee, they would pose no threat if they were engaging visibly from longer ranges, but sometimes it felt a bit tedious and I just wanted to get out of those forests. Or maybe that was (at least partly) the feeling the devs were intending to create? - The game comes with some bonus 'episodes' originally released as DLCs on the Xbox. They were very entertaining and refreshing, they advance the story further, add more interesting mindplay ideas and also bring in some refreshments gameplay-wise (you interact more with your surroundings, 'summon' objects and light sources, not easy to explain but makes a lot of sense in the context of the story and mindplay.  Overall a nice-looking, thoughtfully crafted and well optimized (it was running like a charm on my computer) episodic story-driven action thriller with an appealing 'hero', some interesting gameplay ideas and some noteable music too (rock band Poets of the Fall has provided some tracks with perfectly fitting lyrics, and those songs are cleverly put into the game as there is a 'rock band' (two old geezers somewhat past beyond their time) in it too loosely resembling PotF.

Have to use a trainer to finish this thing, and it was a pain in the balls to find one that works. Still recommend it, make sure you have a big screen turn off the lights and get inside this wonderful universe, and if you are like me take some stress balls so you don't throw your shoe to the screen while a monster is after you and you don't have bullets.   Why do the developers don't add a console or native cheats, I pay for it so i have the right if I want just to have fun on a baby difficulty for the sake of the history. ",

You can only carry so much ammo for each weapon and a certain ammount of batteries so it all comes down on your way of playing - will you kill all the enemies to feel 'safe'? or will you run like a scared weasel and save those supplies for what may lie ahead? Some advice - use your supplies, seriously. Oh and the ending is really awesome too.",

Maybe as a child i can spend 8 hours repeating the same mission a hundred times until I memorize the script and which way the monsters gonna came out. But now i just want to learn about the history and the universe of the serie.  This is a game like the movies you watch it once and remove it, probably play it again in a couple years when forget about the history.  Have to use a trainer to finish this thing, and it was a pain in the balls to find one that works. Still recommend it, make sure you have a big screen turn off the lights and get inside this wonderful universe, and if you are like me take some stress balls so you don't throw your shoe to the screen while a monster is after you and you don't have bullets.   Why do the developers don't add a console or native cheats, I pay for it so i have the right if I want just to have fun on a baby difficulty for the sake of the history. ",

He's a celebrity, with posters advertising his latest book all over the place and his agent on the phone every other minute. The waitress at the local diner can barely string two words together, she's so star struck. After a slightly bizarre encounter with two ageing rockers, Alan and Alice head to a lovely island cabin where they intend to have a relaxing few days together. Things don't go as planned. All you really need to know is that Alice goes missing, Alan's work plays a huge part in the events that unfold and that darkness is very bad when you're wandering around the heavily wooded Bright Falls. Things don't necessarily go bump in the night, but they certainly like carrying chainsaws. Light really is the main priority of Alan Wake's gameplay and storyline. In the sunlight the town is as picturesque as a postcard, with sweeping vistas and gorgeous yellow beams piercing the tree lines. Once night falls, however, the darkness quite literally takes over. Alan, understandably goes on the hunt for his wife, but stumbles across an evil presence that is hell-bent on using Alan for its own wicked means. Bright Falls residents, possessed by the darkness, are just one of the many enemies Alan has to overcome. It's not just humans who you'll face, either, with the darkness very willing to possess inanimate objects, such as JCBs, trucks and massive wire spindles. At certain points you’ll even face flocks of birds, which come at you in a terrifying swarm of chirping evil. You can vaporize these with some well targeted light from your torch, but at times it pays to use Alan's incredibly useful dodge move. If you're in a bit of a pickle -and you frequently will be - the assortment of extra weapons and light sources comes in handy. Flares can be held aloft or dropped to scare off enemies and give you a moment to breathe or, better still, fired directly into the air or into nasties; a well-placed flare shot into a huge possessed flying boat will quickly end its assault from above. Generators can often be powered up, turning on high powered lamps that can be used either as safe havens, at checkpoints and recharging health stations, or as a means to blast enemies. Certain beams of light are so intense that you don't need to use a weapon at all, with the light itself being enough to send the nasties back to the darkness from which they came. If run out of light, a flash bang grenade or two will clear the local area any Taken or possessed objects.

I bought the franchise package and can honestly say that it was one of the wisest choices I've ever made. If you're someone who's all about graphics, then you will have no complaint.   The story is about a writer named Alan Wake (obviously), who travels to a small town in the mountain side. His wife is worried about him because he sadly hasn't been able to write a word since his last book which was written 2 years ago. He finds out that the real reason they took a surprise 'vacation' is because there is a 'therapist' who says he can 'help' Alan (when you play the game you'll findout why I put the quatations). They get into an argument and he steps out of the cabin that they rented. His wife is INSANELY afraid of the dark so she didn't follow. The darkness grabs his wife and drags her into the 'lake' Alan jumps in.... And the rest you can findout for yourself.   This game so richly deserves a Five-out-of-Five Stars!

You are supposed to feel hunted and in fear of an overwhelming darkness. Don't treat this as an FPS. It's survival horror where your try to avoid things that go bump in the darkness not seek them out and shoot them. On higher difficulties, it is nearly impossible to combat every enemy.

The protagonist isn't an amazing action hero... There aren't any shady mob bosses or any globe trotting... Instead it's a claustrophobic, beautiful, tense, well paced adventure.   Everything takes place in a mountain range wherein Bright Falls, the town Alan Wake visits, is located. The graphics in the game are incredible for still being stuck on DX9, and the environments/draw distance are incredible. Characters are unique and at times genuinely funny, and there are some out of left field but welcome campy moments akin to twin peaks or donnie darko.   The storyline, for once, was the biggest draw of the game for me. It followed an almost Stephen King kind of pace, giving just enough airtime to the evil permeating the game, but never revealing it until the right moments... But even then not giving a full enough answer to make you lose interest in what will happen next.   Finally, the combat... I have never been more impressed with how light and darkness have been used as 'weapons'. It becomes integral and makes you think a little 'out of the box' in terms of how to approach certain combat situations. 4 guys approaching, a bulldozer, and 2 heavier guys all coming at you at once? Throw a flashbang! If that confuses the ♥♥♥♥ out of you... Yeah, this games combat is very unique, but once you get the hang of it you'll be poppin' flares and takin' names in no time.   Highly recommended, for something different, something unique and one of the few games that doesn't need a sequel.",

Bright Falls is a seemingly simple town until things start to happen that only Alan Wake can explain. He wrote those things in his upcoming novel, the same one he is working on. The story is well thought, perhaps one of the finest in a long time.   The game puts you up against the Darkeness and its minions the 'taken' who can only be killed after their shadow 'armor' has been shattered. To do so, they have to be damaged by light before they can be killed. Although the game puts you up against the same enemies for majority of the game, they do tend to ramp up the difficulty and situations to make it seem fresh enough. There are few weapons to choose from and most will be using the revolver and shotgun for the most part, you can forgive that point considering the premise. Its a small town, you won't expect to find M16s or grenade launchers after all.   I recommend this game for anyone who likes survival horror and a good story.",

Like mostly everyone else who has reviewed this game has said, it does take heavily from Stephen King. However, that doesn't mean the game does follow its own path and merit. But please understand if you have interest in playing Alan Wake, do yourself a favor and BUY THE COLLECTORS EDITION!!! I won't be that guy who spoils the ending of a game but i will say that it leaves you with a cliffhanger and the collector's edition provides you with two additional episodes (previously availably as DLC) which provide much needed clarity to some of the loose ends.  Graphically the game is flat out impressive. On my copy of Alan Wake it has a setting to play on low,medium, or high quality graphics and lets just say if your computer has the ability to process the high quality graphics your instore for a few truly breathtaking gameplay graphics and goregous cinematics.   The Story in my opinion is what makes this game an uncontested classic. Thats right i said it CLASSIC! Maybe not in the GTA OR COD Mainstream sense but definetly in a cult classic one. The dialogue is fantastic but I found a slight problem with the plot pacing towards the end of the game.  After completely this game I found a desire to play through again at a different difficulty just to experience it all once more. Remedy (The team that also created Max Payne) has undoubtly succeeded in making this game an original piece of art that in my opinion will only have its audience grow from this day forth.   9.1/10",

While not a perfect game (gets a bit heavy on combat in parts, and some level gimmicks are more interesting in theory than they are in practice), but the story was enough to keep me interested. The sound design is also good (both music wise and sound effects), and the graphics are pretty solid for a port of 4 year old Xbox 360 game, with some very good lighting effects.",

The protagonist isn't an amazing action hero... There aren't any shady mob bosses or any globe trotting... Instead it's a claustrophobic, beautiful, tense, well paced adventure.   Everything takes place in a mountain range wherein Bright Falls, the town Alan Wake visits, is located. The graphics in the game are incredible for still being stuck on DX9, and the environments/draw distance are incredible. Characters are unique and at times genuinely funny, and there are some out of left field but welcome campy moments akin to twin peaks or donnie darko.   The storyline, for once, was the biggest draw of the game for me. It followed an almost Stephen King kind of pace, giving just enough airtime to the evil permeating the game, but never revealing it until the right moments... But even then not giving a full enough answer to make you lose interest in what will happen next.   Finally, the combat... I have never been more impressed with how light and darkness have been used as 'weapons'. It becomes integral and makes you think a little 'out of the box' in terms of how to approach certain combat situations. 4 guys approaching, a bulldozer, and 2 heavier guys all coming at you at once? Throw a flashbang! If that confuses the ♥♥♥♥ out of you... Yeah, this games combat is very unique, but once you get the hang of it you'll be poppin' flares and takin' names in no time.   Highly recommended, for something different, something unique and one of the few games that doesn't need a sequel.",

The levels and stages within the levels are divided up in chapters and jumps through time and space, making the game more immersive and the characters even more relatable. You don't just play a game - you really ARE Alan Wake. You doubt reality as he does, feel remorse as he does and gets cheered up by the comic relief, Alan's manager Barry. The game is story driven and very linear, but the game benefits from it.  Oh, yeah, and the biggest selling point - I'm a huge fan of Stephen King. If you are too, this game is definetly for you, 'cause it's basically a gamification of a King novel.  9/10, a really good game!",

            "review_text": "Easily one of my all time favs! Alan Wake has a whole bunch of three of my most coveted things: woods, darkness and flashlights.   Synopsis: A vacation in the charming little mountain town of Bright Falls was supposed to be a much needed break from the hectic city life of New York and the stress of insomnia paired with a classic case of writer's block for our crime thriller author protagonist, Alan Wake. Little did he or his wife know that a dark presence was once again stirring beneath Cauldron Lake and the island cabin they were supposed to be staying at during their trip. Next thing you know, Wake's wife Alice goes missing and so does a week's worth of time as Alan awakens in the wreck of their car not fully able to remember how everything transpired up to that moment. Thus begins his dark journey to find his wife and to discover what's been taking over the town's people and twisting them into what is known as the Taken.  This game is heavy on narrative and the superb voice acting makes for an unforgettable mystery/thriller gaming experience. There's a lot of exploration if you choose to track down the collectibles, most prominent among those being the manuscript pages from a missing novel you didn't realize you were working on which actually reveals much of the backstory of the townspeople and what's really been going on. The use of light/dark, namely burning the darkness off of the Taken so that they become vulnerable to attack is a very satisfying gameplay mechanic and the two bonus episodes are very well done. Also, the graphics are really good and truly make you feel what it is to run around a mountainous forest at night while being pursued by darkness. Thankfully this game contains more batteries than have ever been manufactured in the real world. You're gonna need them!!  Don't wait for a sale if you're contemplating getting this game - you'll be glad you bought it.",

            "review_text": "I don't usually care much for story-driven games, but Alan Wake is an exception. It's basically 'Stephen King Book: the Game' (it even mentions him by name a few times in the dialog - heck, his name is the first two words spoken in the game!).  The plot revolves around the title character going on vacation with his wife to the town of Bright Falls in the Cascades of WA (close to home!), only to end up with her disappearing. After Wake suddenly comes to in a crashed car and realizes a week has passed of which he has no memory, things start to get weird: people go missing and turn up in the woods attempting to murder Wake; apparently his wife was kidnapped, and the kidnapper is demanding a certain book manuscript as ransom, but Wake is certain he never wrote the manuscript being demanded; and the cabin he and his wife were staying at was apparently destroyed nearly half a century before their arrival in a volcanic eruption, meaning they'd been staying at a litreal ghost house. As Wake stumbles through the woods trying to figure out what's going on and how to get his wife back, things just get weirder.  The game itself is set up to look like a TV miniseries, with six 'episodes' each ending with a fade to the game's title on the screen accompanied by end-credits-y music, and the next one starting with a 'Previously, on Alan Wake ...' segment recapping the events so far. It works well for the way the story plays out.  Gameplay consists of wandering through the woods along vague paths (you have a radar that points you in the right direction, so getting lost is never a problem) while fighting off shadowy people known as the Taken. The Taken are people from Bright Falls who have recently vanished, now somehow appearing as corrupted, dark versions of themselves bent on killing Wake. Your only weapons are a flashlight, which removes the shadowy 'shield' the Taken possess when they first spawn, and whatever guns you can find, with which to shoot the de-shadowed Taken - even when the flashlight is used on them, they remain hostile, so you have to get rid of them. The combat is unfortunately a bit limited, and is the game's weakest point: there are only four different kinds of guns and two kinds of throwables, and most aren't available at most times (you lose your previous equipment frequently due to various story circumstances, such as falling off a cliff). There are occasional places where the environment provides other tools that can be used for combat, such as aiming a spotlight as a giant flashlight or running over Taken in a truck, and minibosses pop up from time to time, including a couple of possessed bulldozers. Still, it gets a bit monotonous hiking through the trees and shooting the same Taken over and over. Apparently the woods around Bright Falls were filled with mad meathook-wielding joggers ripe for possession.   PROS:  +The story is excellent for anyone who enjoys Stephen King books - it feels like something he could have written +The episodic format makes for nice breaks in the story, and each episode ends on a cliffhanger to keep you going +Some nice songs on the soundtrack, including one that's used cleverly for story exposition and guidance towards the next objective +Collectibles and achievements add a bit of replay value +An entertaining and ever-shifting cast of characters +A few very annoying characters got what they deserved   CONS:  -Exploring the woods gets old after a while, especially since interesting landmarks stop appearing after a while (early chapters have campsites with tourist-y stuff to explore) -Combat is repetitive with only a few weapons, most of which aren't available at most times -Wake himself doesn't really develop as a character, which leads to his attitudes and monotone voice getting a bit tiresome   Overall I'd recommend Alan Wake for anyone who enjoys Stephen King's work and doesn't mind rather simplistic gameplay if it means getting a cool story.",

You learned to conserve your ammo and move quickly.  Yes, this is a scary game, my friend and I joked that I 'noped' through a lot of it instead of facing the enemies (sometimes this didn't benifit me because I would get lost).  There aren't really very many 'jumpscares' but the game does mess with your head a little bit.  The controls were a tad weird at first, considering this game is meant to originally be played on peasantbox360, but I solved that problem by turning the sensitivity WAY down.  The current price of 30 USD is well worth to those who are looking for some 'cheap entertainment' *icarly reference* And I would pay for it hadn't I bought it on the winter sale.  Overall the game was amazing, but for some reason the sound didn't work all the time (may be due to my multiple monitor display) but I couldn't find anyone else who ever had the same issue as me so I guess it was a personal problem.

This review in short : I just defeated an IMMENSE amount of bad guys using the power of Metal, including a ♥♥♥♥ing Dragon, Fire works, stage lights, and Metal playing only to be followed by the comic relief using a card board cut out of the hero to mock him and then a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome folk guitar song to tell the hero what to do next.....Followed by getting super drunk. 10/10 WILL Play Again",

The kind of things that want to kill you, for no apparent reason. Your only means of survival is light, be it environmental or the one coming from your handheld torch. The game is quintessential horror at its best, and a quite psychological version of it as well, which only goes to show that you don't need bloody gore and meat cleaving left and right to build tension (I AM LOOKING AT YOU, EVIL WITHIN). The engine gives a memorable experience and runs flawlessly, while the soundtrack rounds off the whole package in a very neat fashion (look out for the EPIC track 'Children of the Elder God' by Old Gods of Asgard).

The flashlight is your best companion throughout the game (just make sure you aren't short for batteries), I feel there is a perfect balance between the relationship firearms and the flashlight have, this offered a cool way to play the game as bullets alone are simply not enough to kill the darkness and planning how you approach each encounter (especially on nightmare difficulty) is important.

It's a really great price for an amazing game.  I would highly recommend playing the bonus chapters (I forget exactly what they're called; it may just be that), as they provide much more closure to the story than the base ones alone.

That's not the point!  In my personal opinion the horror aspect of the game only comes from the fact that some 'things' are trying to kill you and it's frightening to think so, the only jumpscare I was given was some points when Taken would come out and suprise me or when a big chainsaw man or axe man comes just a hair away from killing me, but, again, that's just my opinion.  The best part of the game is the storytelling. You follow Alan Wake, a writer who just happens to encounter a bit of trouble while on his vacation. I don't want to spoil too much for the story tells everything very well. All the things that happened in the story made me come back for more, especially the 'cliffhangers' at the end of each chapter which makes you yearn to continue and see what happens next in the story.  Overall, I think the story is very well told and the suspense that builds up to the end of each chapter really pays off. The only flaw in the game in my own opinion is the very vague ending.   Alan Wake is overall a very great game and I definetly reccoment whomever reads this to play it!",

The point of the game is to solve a mystery and a rescue operation. Quite typical for a survival horror/thriller genre. The combatis a bit clonky but it doesn't need to be any more elaborate; it gets things done, and after all you do play a writer, not a S.T.A.R.S. operative for example :D  The game is episodic, which is interesting, but watching the 'in the last episode' montage right after you just played the episode gets old very quickly. It works when you havent played in a bit and you need a reminder, but otherwise it's too much.  All in all, it's a very fun game with an interesting story and creative gameplay dynamics, I recommend :)",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed Alan Wake. I'd say the game is softcore horror shooter. I liked the world that was created, it did feel quite big, even if you are forced to stay on somewhat narrow paths at times.  The good:  World. The backdrop or rendering distance looks great. No time really spent in loading screens. Does look like a real place to me.  The Atmosphere. There's fog, there's darkness, there's hope in the distant lights. I think the atmosphere in the dark forest is what carries this game for the most part.  Level design. Quite straightforward, but still there's always something to explore; a hidden path, a hut with supplies. If I was to replay the game I'd explore the levels a bit more thoroughly, there's a lot of stuff I missed for sure. Casual puzzles can also be found, never too much trouble, but still nice change of pace.  Technical Performance. Runs solid 60 FPS, or more, even on a weaker machine I'd think. Certainly not a horrible port. Controls were also very good with KB+mouse.  The things to improve:  Facial animations or animations in general. I don't really remember how this game compares to the stuff released at that time, but the facial animations were pretty bad. It's not really something that takes that much away from the enjoyment for the game, but characters could feel more alive for sure.  Combat. The basics are okay with me. You need light, you need weapons. I think I would have just wanted to see a bit more interaction with the world with this. You can't make any sort of traps, there's the occasional gas tank that blows up, but even those weren't exactly useful or needed. I wish there were more powerful combat solutions offered in the level design, like collapsing stuff or dropping something etc.   Driving parts. Pretty boring. I guess you don't have to use car if you don't want to, but that would be pretty hard I think. At least the car can drift :D  Story. I think it's silly to say it would be just bad. It wasn't. Just not my favorite one ever. There's just too many questions left after completing the game. The answers I got weren't really that fulfilling.  Horror aspect. I think they could have made this game 10 times more scarier, by just giving the play way less info about what's going on. Now almost everytime there's enemy spawning they really let you know. There's a real lack of true ambushes or jump scares, they exist, but only a few times really.   Texture work. I think everything or most stuff is directly ported from xbox360. There's some pretty bad textures in this game at times.  Overall I'd give this game 7/10. Quite entertaining, I enjoyed most parts, even if this game should have been way scarier. I think Remedy was aiming for more sense of desperation and bigger worlds where you could maybe even get lost or something, but since the game was in development hell I guess, they had to release something and went with more traditional linear scripted shooter. At least the pacing stayed good and things never really get boring.",

Another surprise for me was how original and enjoyable the combat is.

The combat system involves your torch and a variety of guns that include: a pistol, shotgun and flare gun as well as the ability to use flares and flashbangs. The camera angle seems to swap sides every so often which can become confusing and annoying but this is very minor and only matters if you can't stand change.

The game is full of tense moments, jump scares and plot twists. One of my favourite aspects was the TV series style, which again I wasn't expecting.

To be honest, this game has so much in common with Twin Peaks, the only reason I can think of they didn't just call it 'Twin Peaks - The Game' is copyright issues. Though most fights get quite repetitive after some time, it's the story that really got me going - the game also pays attention to little details that most people would miss in a hurried playthrough. What annoyed me more than fighting undead lumberjacks for the gazillionth time though was the blatant product placement of real brands, which I believe doesn't belong in a game like this. But apart from that, I have no complaints.  All in all a great game by video game designer Sami Järvi, who already gave us the exceptionally intense Max Payne franchise.

I have nearly sixteen hours on record with this game, but my actual play time is probably closer to ten hours. I have enjoyed this game somewhat, but the gameplay is repetitive to the point that only a real fan of the horror genre could see this game through to the end without becoming bored stiff, not that much horror exists in this game, ironically.  The story and how it is narrated throughout is very good, as are the graphics, but as mentioned already the same just can't be said of the gameplay which threatens to ruin everything with its predictability and repetitiveness. So many times during this game I knew what would happen before it happened. It becomes so unbearably predictable that after a while you'll be gazing around your room in search of your crystal ball. I dislike the fact that as soon as you lose your gun, which seems to happen all the time in this game, another one magically appears five minutes later, usually in a hut. Why not let the player feel vulnerable for a while by making us fend off our foes by other means? Vulnerability is a selling point in horror and this game fails to take advantage of that perk. Instead, we're forced-fed the same (not even slighty scary) enemies all the way through the game, which rarely provide any challenge or hinderous to our survival. Alan Wake just isn't scary at all, the fact that you always know when the darkness is coming removes the element of surprise. The maps, to be fair, are good, although spending 85% of the game in the woods becomes rather annoying, as does Alan's apparent inability to run for more than five seconds without becoming breathless. The flashlight also runs out of batteries quicker than the blink of an eye, but it's okay because you'll never have to worry about running out of flashlight juice as batteries seemingly are abundant, they can even be found in the woods, but then again that's where you spend most of the game anyway.   On reflection then It may seem like I'm being rather hateful of this game, not true. I'm just being honest and pointing out that Alan Wake is a frustrating game that should have been better than it was. I don't hate it; I just don't love it either. Recommended only at a reduced price.   Pros:  - Good story and narration - Good graphics - Decent voice acting - Good maps - Nice character design (not including enemies)   Cons: - Very repetitive and predictable after a while - The same recycled objects all the way through the game (including enemies) - Not scary  - Too easy - Controls can be clunky  6.5/10   Would be a 5 if not for the decent story and narration.",

The game excels at story telling through player interaction and internal monologue, which is fitting because the player is a bestselling author. The selling point of the game is undoubtedly the story, that being said, the graphics are very pleasing even for a nearly 4 year old game. Another stand out is the sound design which does an excellent job of convincing the player that the world they are interacting with is truly 'alive' with something evil. Song choice is phenomenal, especially the credits song. Overall the only thing that could use improvement is the lack of enemy variety. I would like to have seen varied and unique combat situations and enemies. Overall I give Alan Wake 9 out of 10 stars and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story driven games.",

            "review_text": "THIS REVIEW IS LENGHTY AND IF YOU WANT TO GET THE GIST OF IT, SCROLL DOWN AND READ THE GOOD, THE BAD, And THE UGLY Alan Wake Review When I picked up this gem for $6 dollars during the steam winter sale, I had no idea I was going to get so much out of my money. If you haven’t watched the trailer for Allen Wake, Here Is a Brief, Simple, and Summary. You are Alan Wake, A famous American author who is in a writer’s block. Unable to write, he and his wife decide to take a vacation down in the middle of volcanic lake. The story takes a dark turn, when his wife is kidnapped by dark forces (known as the Taken, which are people who are overcome with darkness and attack you) and now must figure out what happened to him and his wife.  Visuals and Presentation:  The visuals are pretty awesome to look at! If you have a good rig under your hood, then your experience should be awesome. (GTX 760). Watching the Taken be overcome by the light and then blown away by my shotgun is sexy to look at. At the time of this games release, It was ahead of the curve. Using awesome lighting (or lack of, because 99% of the game is in darkness), to enhance the game. The voice acting is really top notch! I was so involved in the story because it felt as if these characters were real!  Gameplay:  In order to survive, you have to shine light on the Taken to expose them and the use a weapon to destroy them. The light can come from the flashlights, high beams, Barry's 'Eye of Mordor', or even car headlights. Through the majority of the game, your most faithful friend is the flashlight. This device needs batteries to operate, and the batteries are scattered everywhere throughout the game. Don't worry, these batteries are easy to find and sometimes you will be overcome with them. To destroy the Taken for good, you need to shot them...with guns! The game arms you with pistols, shotguns, and hunting rifles. The game even has a explosive arsenal of flash bangs, flares, and flare guns! There is nothing more satisfying than chucking a flash bang to incinerate your enemy, then shining a light at the Taken and blowing them away with a rifle. It makes you feel powerful in a powerless situation. This type of gameplay can get really repetitive, this is one of the games BADS. This type of gameplay can get pretty boring after 6 to 7 hours of lighting and gunning. They do try to switch it up later in the game by arming you with high beams and take you to a homemade concert stage (This is one of my favorite moments in the game). But after a while I started to cringe when I started to see that the Taken come out of the woodwork over and over again. This really turns me off because It make me not want to play this game again once I finished it! Another bad is the lack of variety of guns in the game! You only get about 4 guns to choose from! I understand that Alan is in a small town, not a military base! However, give me more guns to play with besides the four I have!  Another thing I wanted to say about the gameplay before talking about the story is the difficulty. IF you play on easy, then this game is yes...easy. However I never felt so frustrating while playing certain moments of the game in normal mode! A example would be in the section of the game where you have to cross this bridge and the Darkness is for the first time, flinging objects at you! So you shine the light at one object while there another object being flung at you! I died multiple times in the section and I felt so frustrated. I do like a challenge, but sometimes when a game is this story driven, too much of a challenge can be a bad thing. Sure some could argue that maybe since you are a average human being and not a badass ( I'm ranting so you can skip my rant if you want), your best option is to avoid the Taken (which I did in some cases of the game) but, during that moment on the bridge, I tried that option multiple times and you just couldn't run away. This game is also many easter eggs. For example: when you turn on TVs in the game, sometimes a TV show called Night Springs, starts showing (which is filmed with real actors). To me I feel this is a parody to the Twilight Zone. Which in a funny way makes since because this game feels like a episode from the Twilight Zone.   The Story:  The way Alan Wake starts off is how most video games should, you introduced the characters, give a little background of each one, make the main character's wife Alice to be hot so you the play will feel motivated care for her, have the setting to be filled with mystery and ominous foreshadows that the game is not going to be a happy story, thing like that. When I played the game I felt as if I needed to figure out what the F*%&amp; is going on! The mystery motivated to push through the repetitive gameplay. The game presents this story really well with talented voice actors! You can feel the characters emotions through the voice acting which is a + for me.. The Main character however can be hard to relate to, Yes, maybe if this happened to me! I would go above and beyond to get my wife back from dark forces! However some of the things that character did, I would not do in real life. The Taken COMES OUT IN THE FREAKING DARK! WHY AM I TRAVERSING IN THE DAKRNESS!!! ALAN!!! LETS JUST FIND A BUNCH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT!  This game gets even more interesting when the game introduces the Manuscripts. ( trying to make this review spoiler free as possible), These scripts basically tell happened in the past, what is currently happening in the game, and happens in the future. These scripts also tell what is happening in the background of what is currently happening in the game. Which I thought was awesome! These manuscripts are collectable items which are distributed throughout the game. I highly recommend exploring as much as you can while playing to collect them because they enhance the experience of this game. Some things about the games story kind of took me back during some moment. The game creators didn't really touch of some key points of the game. For example, why is this Author so famous? I mean, yeah he had a hit trilogy but I don't many authors who are idolized the way Alan was. Maybe I don't know many famous authors who do get that status, but in a day and age where movie stars and directors are in the spot light, it is kind of hard to believe that Alan is just as famous as them. Also they didn't really explain why this one character was really after Alan. Another Issue is that the main character is kindof hard to relate to. He makes all these decisions that left me annoyed.   THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY The Good:  - This game has a really strong story and is enhanced when you go and explore every nook and cranny of this game! You will start to love these characters and hope they survive the ordeal.  - The Night Springs Parody is a nice touch  The Bad:  Blowing away Taken is fun for about 6 hours, however, when I started to realize that this is along ♥♥♥ game and I would have to do this for another 6, It became pretty repetitive and annoying -Lack of guns!  - This is the kind of game that you will play once or twice, and wait for the sequel  - Alan is not relatedable (could'nt connect well)  IS this game worth the $30 dollar price? No Is this game worth it when it is on sale? YES!!!!!!",

I played it in the Normal difficulty and it was a smooth ride, but the 2 special episodes after the ending are way more difficult than the original game, so I had to play them on Easy.   Combat is varied and interesting enough and there are a ton of Easter eggs to find, but the best thing about this game is its story, presented like a miniseries in 6 episodes, plus the 2 extra. The next best things are the setting, a kind of 'Twin Peaks' little town and its surroundings (and things get way more interesting in the special episodes, because of its surrealistic feel), and the soundtrack, with the likes of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Barry Adamson, Harry Nilsson and David Bowie.   Although the game is very good, it's not exactly pleasant; I found it to be very tense and it used to wore me out after a while; most of the time I played it for less than an hour.

Though the graphics are slow and stuttery for my computer, it didn't affect me too greatly. Nothing in the game is as good as it's story, though. For a medium-length game, the story-line is extremely intracite and complex. The game sells for thirty dollars, and I don't think that it's worth that much, but if it goes on sale for around a little bit more than half that price, it's a definite buy.

A writer is suffering from writers block (go figure) and takes a vacation to help him get over it. It doesn't take long for something super-natural to happen and for the story to take a weird direction. It gets very interesting pretty quickly, and this game is actually a lot longer than I was expecting. I thought I was near the end of the game when I was in the third episode, but it kept going for two more.  Without spoiling anything the story is really the driving force behind this game. It's very gripping and steadily reveals enough to keep you interested. Also this is very much a survival horror game, and the creepy atmosphere and foreboding feeling is ever present.  Mechanics wise this game is basically a generic third person shooter, where your flashlight plays the role of a weapon, as well as your aiming reticle .  Enemies are shielded and can not be harmed until you shine a sufficient amount of light on them. As such you need to be very careful with your ammo. If you go around popping off random shots, or missing all the time expect to get stranded in a difficult area without enough ammo to make it through.  Also it pays to explore in this game. If you come to a fork in the path many times the 'wrong way' will be stocked with ammo, batteries, flares &amp; flash-bangs (this games equivalent of a grenade).  Early on it felt like the game was giving you just barely enough ammo to make it through, but later in the game with a sufficient amount of exploration you will find more than enough ammo to handle the hordes of enemies it throws at you.  In the end this game was definately worth the time to play it, and if you wait until it's on sale again you could even snag it for about $2 like I did.",

It's a class act on its own with the superb storyline. It's basically about a writer who got entangled in the battle between dark and light. The atmosphere, the art direction, the sound design, the soundtrack are all AAA.  The sense of vulnerability is ever present in this game, and you ain't going to be blessed with superhuman reflexes like that of F.E.A.R or BFGs in Doom 3. Mind you, this is also nothing like Resident Evil where you got powerful weapons to help you get through the gritty parts. As one would most of the time be outnumbered in Alan Wake. Should I mention that it involves the woods or forest during the night for most of the time? Think Slenderman getting mixed up with Silent Hill.   The gameplay mechanics, is what survival horror supposed to be.

His wife goes missing, and his search to find her is swiftly diverted into the realm of the paranormal, forcing him to pick up a gun and pull the trigger to stay alive. The storyline of the game spans over six episodes, each crafted like part of a TV miniseries. With really awsome video clips / animation sequenses. Locations are packed with detail and feel rusted and worn. During the day in each episode Wake can wander and talk to NPCs, but once the clouds roll in and the moon lights up it's a whole different beast. Interesting storytelling mechanics and a fast and responsive combat system to keep play entertaining. The infrequent driving sections feel underdeveloped.

It's like Lovecraft, King, Poe, Twin Peaks, and a few others rolled into one, told through six episodes (literally, each new 'episode' comes with a 'Last Time On...'). This game is something different, haven't played anything like it which can throw some folks off, but hey, if you like experimenting with game styles, this is a good one to try. It's a bit slow to start, with lots of cutscenes, but again, it's a story based game. There is action, and it can get pretty damn hard if you can't take out the mobs strategically.  Part of the story telling mechanic that's different is that you fid bits of Alan's manuscript around the game that tell you things that you either weren't there to see, or have yet to happen. One of the best examples is finding a manuscript in Episode 2 in the middle of the woods, 'I was out. The woods were left behind me. And then I heard the chainsaw.' Chainsaw? What chainsaw? I don't hear a ♥♥♥♥ing chainsaw, ♥♥♥♥. Oh, and it's got a pretty decent soundtrack. Any game that uses Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is a winner in my book, ♥♥♥♥.  Alan Wake's New Nightmare is along the same lines, except it's a lot more action oriented. I'd suggest playing the first game to get the feel of the play style and in-jokes in New Nightmare.

            "review_text": "Ah, the first game in my alphabetical backlog clear... Complete.  Alan Wake is a writer. He and his wife go on a retreat to a creepy-♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing cabin in the middle of a backwater town, Bright Falls, ostensibly as a vacation. Soon enough his wife is kidnapped by an evil presence, he's lost a week of his life to amnesia, the pages of a book he can't remember writing are telling the future, and crazy shadow people are trying to kill him.  As Alan, you'll shine light on stuff. Sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes for five or maybe even six. The stuff will then flash, either accomplishing a task or making said stuff vulnerable to a writers greatest tool: his ♥♥♥♥ing gun. This is the basic mechanic of the game, dark = bad, light = good. Enemies wear the darkness like a shield, and the game does a good job of getting creative with light sources to help you disperse it. The classic explosive barrel, fireworks, and an entire lighthouse are at your disposal at various points to aid you in your battles against the creeping blackness. This is basically the framework of the entire game, and I found the combat slightly tedious by the time the credits had rolled.  There are few different weapons in the game, but they all function roughly the same way. The gunplay is standard third person shooter fare, with a nifty dodge function that feels pretty satisying when you pull it off at the perfect time. Alan isn't a soldier tough guy - his name is Alan, for christ's sake - he's a writer, and he feels suitably flimsy and fragile.  The selling point of this game is the atmosphere. Creepy and uncomfortable, obviously inspired by the likes of Twin Peaks (Alan's coffee addiction, the town itself) and the Twilight Zone (in true Remedy style, TV's littered around the game play episodes of 'Night Falls' a TZ rip off that Alan wrote a few episodes of, all in full motion video) the location and the people are well executed and suitably weird. Though I feel it may suffer somewhat from its video game format, as the antagonistic Dark Presence is very, unsurprisingly, present throughout the entire game, making the story and the events seem kinda cheesy and overplayed.  Still, a good game. Not great, but good. The DLC episodes are worth a go if you enjoy the gameplay, but don't add much to the story.  = 3/5 =   Enjoyable. A dim light in a dark world of CoD clones and MOBAs. Get it on sale, you could do a lot worse.",

Animations feel stiff, but Alan Wake is an older game and it is easy enough to look past.

You control Alan Wake, a novelist, who went on vacation with his wife because he had writer's block and could not complete his book,'Departed.' While on this vacation, Alan's wife goes missing. During his search, he experiences events from 'Departed.' Though he has written the book, he has no memory of writing it. The narrative of the game is compelling and makes you want to complete the story to see what happens.  The game is structured in an episodic format. There are 6 episodes, excluding the DLC. The DLC shows 2 additional episodes. Each episode takes about an hour and a half to 2 hours to beat. This will give you roughly 11 hours of game play. If you choose to get all the different collectible and achievements this will take much longer.  The game wants to present itself as a psychological survival horror game, but falls short in the psychological and horror areas. The game lacks an open narrative and decisions that are necessary for a psychological game to be tailored to the individual playing it. The horror aspect of the game is also quite lacking, as all the enemies are very similar and the same methods are applied to defeat them all. The enemies are cloaked in darkness and are invincible. To defeat them, you need to shine your light on them and fire your revolver at them to damage them. The first few times you encounter these shadowy figures, they are a little unsettling, but as you encounter them more often they loss the creep-factor.  The combat in this game is quite repetitive. You shine the enemies with your flashlight and fire your revolver. The combat is easy to pick up and play, but doesn't really change to scale with the player or the difficulty. The most difficult sections are when you are faced with multiple enemies at once, or if you are low on ammunition. This combat format fits the game well, but doesnt make you feel like you are the character.  The collectibles are interesting, as there are multiple kinds of collectibles in the game. My personal favorite collectibles were the Manuscript pages. These pages tell the story of Alan's next book that was not finished due to writer's block. I found these insightful as they may explain different sections of the game and tell a separate story to that of our protagonist. If you wanted to collect all of the pages you need to play on Nightmare mode, as some of the pages can only be found during this mode.  Overall, the game feels like an adventure game. It handles very well and is a joy to play. The story is interesting and tells more than just the main character's story. The collectibles are challenging, but not impossible to obtain. I would suggest this game to someone looking for a great story, but not for someone looking for a challenge.",

If you are a fan a Stephen King (unlike me), you might find it even more enriching, as his work shows it's influence in the game. The only thing wrong with this game that i found was that the enemies voices could have been done better, after a while they all sound the same and seem out of place, that's just me; but i digress.   The game is episodic in nature which helps, because it stops just at the right time, without lingering on too long. For me, a fan of books i enjoyed the little well written narrations scattered around the world. Each episode has its own collectibles, radio, and pages, which tell the whole story, the story that you are not a part of, the story that exists in the same world as Alan, but he has no control over, which gives you an intense feeling of loss control and isolation, the feeling that you are not in control of your narrative, which is the most important part of the 'horror' aspect of a game. In-fact the world it self is a story, passages, hints and parts if which you go on finding in the dark. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger followed by a sick ending theme, which adds to the episodic nature of the game.   Overall it is a good game and a rich experience. 8/10 (a new idea, which payed off well, the end was a bit of a cliffhanger with a squeal planned, but no where in sight.)",

The main character is even a writer, which can only be an homage to King. It took about 15 hours to beat, but I only completed half of the achievements, so I would expect a normal playthrough to be closer to 20 hours. The ending has a nice twist, but I figured it out way before the game was over. Even so, I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes horror games without the blood and guts of your average horror shooter like the F.E.A.R. series.",

Still a good combat system, but a bit same-y. If you can pace your playthrough properly, you won't notice this though, and the episodic setup for the game works very well to pace things - with the TV style 'previously on...' segments excellently keeping you in the loop if you take a break, without spoiling things.

It kept me guessing, and begging for more. The scenery of the game was breathtaking, and while there were quite a lot of 'forest' areas, every single one of them was paired up with an astounding view of a valley, or beautiful mountains in the distance.  Combat in Alan Wake was nice and refreshing. It was a nice touch that you simply can't shoot your enemies, but have to decide how to take on a pack. While the selections of weapons in the game was modest, you could use them to great effect. I fell in love with the way dodging works in this game, and it made defensive evasion - something that people often overlook in favor of brute force - a pleasant skill to practice.  This game was long, and it was good. It is definitely one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in a long time (9/10).",

            "review_text": "After releasing two incredibly successful third person shooter games (Max Payne and Max Mayne 2: The Fall of Max Payne) Remedy could have done what most developers do; they could have played it safe and released a third Max Payne title. Instead they took a risk, they sold the rights to the lucrative Max Payne franchise to Rockstar and invested the money from the sale to fund a brand new IP. Remedy took further risks by creating a mature single player, story-based horror/thriller adventure game when currents trends seems to dictate that your game must be a FPS with a multiplayer component to succeed on the Xbox platform.   I'm pleased to say that the gamble paid off. Alan Wake is an expertly crafted game full of believable characters inhabiting a deeply enthralling Steven King-esque town; all built upon solid, well polished gameplay mechanics.   The game is divided into six chapters each lasting around two hours each. If I had to pick a criticism with the game it would be the padding that goes into a few of the levels in order to bring the game up to that twelve hour mark many feel comfortable paying £45 for on console. While the gameplay is throughly enjoyable the story does suffer a little for it and the illusion of living in Alan's shoes for a week is somewhat broken.  This isn't just a criticism of this game but of the industry as a whole and all games that attempt to tell meaningful stories. Very few actually manage to strike a correct balance between giving the player just enough gameplay to tell a satisfying story.   Ultimately it seems gamers are more that happy to sacrifice the tightness of the story in favour of extended gameplay.  At the end of the day Remedy just gave the punters what they wanted.  10/10",

The kind of things that want to kill you, for no apparent reason. Your only means of survival is light, be it environmental or the one coming from your handheld torch. The game is quintessential horror at its best, and a quite psychological version of it as well, which only goes to show that you don't need bloody gore and meat cleaving left and right to build tension (I AM LOOKING AT YOU, EVIL WITHIN). The engine gives a memorable experience and runs flawlessly, while the soundtrack rounds off the whole package in a very neat fashion (look out for the EPIC track 'Children of the Elder God' by Old Gods of Asgard).

You need to explore in order to get a lot of the achievements, but the game punishes exploration by spawning additional mobs to fight. This means getting the collectibles will make the game harder, evne some of the hidden chests do this, because it takes more ammo to deal with the new mobs than you get from the chest.  3.) Too often the game takes away all of your supplies. Sometimes there's a game reason. Other times there's not. I understand if I'm detained by the police, they are going to take away my guns.

You control the main character through a daytime town with little danger, to a nighttime nightmare scape where the darkness comes alive and your only option is to hide in the light. The dynamic was thrilling and the gameplay was pretty well handled too. Lots of 'gather this for that' mentality in the game itself, as you look for missing manuscript pages and even thermos containers throughout each level.   Well worth 30, don't pay more.",

The game has a really good and gripping story that will keep you playing until the end. The collectibles are fun to look for and satisfying to find them all.   Very good horror game (not all too scary but not a big deal).  Feels much like twin peaks/twilight zone.",

            "review_text": "The story alone is reason enough to get this, but there's plenty more to it.  I won't say too much about the story because it's best to just experience it, but suffice to say it's a Stephen-King-esque horror/mystery story about a lake with a mystical effect on creative works, a dark presence within it, and a writer fighting (and writing) to set things right. It's set in a small town in the Pacific Northwest (as someone who lives in a small town in the Pacific Northwest, the backdrop felt well-captured and realistic) with a wide cast of interesting characters and unexpectedly beautiful environments (every now and then, you're fighting the forces of darkness and come upon a lookout tower or something and you go up, turn on the local radio, stare out at the mountains, and everything is completely and inexplicably at peace, and then you reload and get back to shooting things).  Alan Wake features a few sets of collectibles. The most significant are the manuscript pages - these, without giving too much away, help fill in the details of what's really going on and can even give you information about what's about to happen and what to be prepared for. There are also 100 coffee thermoses scattered through the game, which are a brilliant and hilarious choice of collectible for a writer in the Pacific Northwest and lead to great moments where you sprint through a horde of ghost zombies, grab a thermos, and sprint back to the light. Coffee. It's that important.  The game is formatted as if it were a TV miniseries, with six main 'episodes' and two post-game specials. It works quite well for the purpose of the narrative, and each episode in turn is divided into segments for replay purposes, which is great for tracking down those pesky missing collectibles.  Now, it's not a perfect game. The combat, while the central mechanic of fighting off enemies with both light and gun is unique, gets repetitive because the enemies mostly work the same way throughout the game (though the fact that the flare gun is the most powerful weapon in the game is beautiful in its own right). The voice acting is apparently not great (I played with the game sound off and can vouch that it's plenty gripping without the audio, so if you don't want your internal voice for the characters ruined, that might be worth doing). The over-the-shoulder camera can be a bit wonky at times (though the flashlight generally means you have a built-in sight). But it's absolutely worth it.  It's dark. It's brilliant. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

Don't make collectables for the sake of making them. It is unimmersive and stupid.  2. Bad voice acting. You can't convince people to take the story seriously if the voice actings for the majority of characters are cringy as hell.  3. Inconsistent gameplay. I like many multi-genre games, but this is getting stupid. What is this game even trying to be? Is it an action horror game or third person puzzle platformer? Why are there several jumping puzzles and what do they add to this game?  4. Not horrifying horror elements. No, 'Absurd' does not equal to 'Scary'. Corny lines are not intimidating; they are corny.   5. Arena-styled level design. Don't ever make 'this is obviously an arena, therefore you are going to have a big battle' type of level in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ episodes. This is the most 'gamey' thing you can ever achieve.  6. Bad driving mechanics. Here's a general rule: either make a good driving mechanics, or don't make a long driving section if you don't have a good mechanics for it. Cars in this game remind me of MAKO in Mass Effect, and that is not a compliment.  7. Walking Simulator gameplay before cutscenes. Why would you force players to follow a slowly moving, crippled npc just to have a cutscene to play afterward? What is the point of this lack of gameplay? Does this achieve anything? Why not just make a cutscene of those characters walking then? At least, that will save players from pressing W for like 20 minutes.  Other than these, story is mildly interesting but nothing mind blowing or new. Graphics is mediocre. Gameplay is somewhat satisfying, but dodging mechanics is annoyingly unresponsive.",

            "review_text": "It did not take me long to decide this game was a mistake, and that is a shame for a game with so much potential. On the plus side, visually this game is a masterpiece. As someone who lives in the Northwest from which I understand this game's environment was inspired I must say I have never seen a video game so wonderfully depict the foggy coastal forested mountain atmosphere. At night the moonlit creepiness fits the mood of the game to perfection and creates a memorable gaming experience.  Also, I found the plot to be refreshingly unique as it followed the fate of a writer who found himself living out the disturbing pages of a book which he hadn't even written yet.  Unfortunately, that is where its good points end. The plot of this game may be unique, but it was executed horribly. Starting the game out in the middle of a nightmare after a car accident with little or no backstory to soften the blow was actually a cleaver move I thought, but once the story gets properly underway being suddenly and inexplicably torn out of it to go through another nightmare following a car crash resulting in a desperate nighttime escape through a dark wood (almost) precisely like the first starts to feel a bit forced if not outright contrived. I began to wonder if the whole story wasn't going to be a series of excuses to throw the user into yet another moonlit escapade trying not to get killed by axe-wielding phantoms in a dark wood. In fairness, the game is a horror-fantasy adventure, but even so I did expect to have a bit more of a structured plot to hold it together. Perhaps with more patience it would have gotten better in this respect, but I was turned-off too quickly and too thoroughly to find out.  And no, it wasn't just for that one reason. In fact that was the smaller of my issues with the game. The larger issue was the cripplingly awful nature of the combat. During these creepy wanderings through the woods running into phantoms trying to kill me with axes was an inevitable occurance. When it was just one, this could actually result in a rather exciting and heart-pumping experience that really completed the game's horror feel. However when there were several it started to feel quite tiresome. I would often enough find myself running out of battery power before my foes were defeated. Dodging requires skill (which is nice) but becomes fairly impractical when there's more than one opponent coming at you. Killing them before they can close the distance and overwhelm you means burning batteries and once your run out it's just over. No, you can't outrun them so don't even bother. A shame really, considering a tense chase scene through the woods would only add to the horror feel of the game. It might also give you the chance to flee to a more lit location, such as the occasional streetlamps you find along the way, and avoid your impending doom. No such luck. It gets especially idiotic when in order to get power to the area light you first need to kill all the phantoms so that you can start up the generator without getting mauled. Of course if you've killed all the phantoms you don't need the area light any more... Thanks game designers. No there's no need to turn it on for later, since as I mentioned you can't outrun the beasts so there's no leading them away or fleeing to safety.  You'll find the occasional puzzle in the game, such as moving cranes in order to create a log walkway to get access to the next part of the map, but they're all fairly simplistic and feel almost out of place and superfluous in what is clearly not a puzzle game.  All in all it felt like a poorly implemented horror first-person shooter. Perhaps my greatest lament is that I can't simply turn off the phantom zombies and simply enjoy the gorgeous ambiance and brilliantly rendered environments. They're almost worth the purchase price by themselves.",

This game is a fire-hose of pop culture references – Twin Peaks homages being the most egregious – and nearly every last one of them is clumsily implemented. The story has some intriguing elements regarding the themes of creation and the internal conflict that inevitably arises within the creator(s); however, it's executed in a fairly uneven manner that seems more interested in playing the mysterious 'is it all real or in Alan's head' angle, and lacks a resonant through-line of a vastly superior title such as Silent Hill 2.   The controls are also disappointingly loose, and the resultant gameplay is sloppy. Such issues are commonplace among survival horror games, often defended as 'enhancing the tension' among apologists; yet loose controls need not be antithetical to good gameplay, as other survival horror entries such as Amnesia: Dark Descent ably demonstrate. There are plenty of moments in Alan Wake with ample tension that are not aided in the slightest by the easily-exhausted sprint function or the awkward aiming and character movements. Nor does it help matters that the jump function works about a tenth as well as it should; though, as luck would have it, this does nothing to stop Remedy from tossing in a number of platforming-based segments that wonderfully illustrate the blundering majesty of the game's physics engine.   And on top of it all, the game is absolutely obsessed with speed ramping (THERE's that 300 connection) and wresting control of the camera away from the player to show you something any time it feels bored with what's happening in the game, which is all the time. This obsession with fashioning the game in a cinematic vein is incredibly detrimental to both the gameplay and the overall experience. I don’t need to be shown with an elaborate zoom that there is a threat looming ahead; I can already see it because it is directly in front of my f*cking face, obstructing my forward progress.  The world of Alan Wake is indeed an impressive one to behold and explore. It’s just too bad it’s tanked by clunky gameplay, ham-fisted dialogue and story, and all-too-knowing references. (Maybe don’t start the next game off by name-dropping Stephen King in the opening seconds.)  (4/10)",

Last but most important, I found the repetitive gameplay to be hugely detrimental, all enemies are fought and eliminated in the same manor, and the dodge controls are often unresponsive or ineffective.

Please, only a small fraction of the population even knows what Steven King looks like... I have a million other criticisms heavily focused on that, but I'll contain my pet peeves.  The game is a horror genre. Again, not my typical gaming style, and after playing this, even moreso. I planned on playing through a terrifying game that had plot points and objectives and scared me on occasion. The game doesn't really terrify so much as makes you very uneasy at the though of whatever is behind you. You can generally skip past them by just running. But then again, the fear is lessened by the addition of a gun and ... flashlight. Yea you kill dream demons with flashlights and you guessed it: batteries for ammo.   The worst part is just the storyline, its not something that interests me remotely, but even if it were, the cutscenes/amount of storyline to gameplay is annoying prevents me from wanting to play even past the opening scene. I played through the first three nightmare sequences and have decided that that was enough for me. I have far too many games to play one that I dread on a daily basis.  If this game had some different tones or it was less story based, I would probably give it another chance, but for 5 bucks this game is a depressing waste of money.  Overall score: 4/10",

The car driving is horrific and futile. The controls overall are just really bad. Why do you have to use the same button for running and dodging? The game completely feels stretched to a length that wasn't planned before. If there is a cut-scene with Alan in a car or a helicopter or whatever, it will to 100% crash anywhere in the woods.

Other times you HAVE to kill them, but you can't tell for sure which without trying one or the other, then if it fails and you die, switch tactics on the retry. Which wouldn't be AS bad if it at least did a better job of having save checkpoints closer to these encounters.  The gameplay is also overly repetitve.

Lastly, the combat itself is frustrating. Switching, loading, and firing weapons feels cludgy and slow. Aiming is difficult thanks to the combination of the 3rd person perspective and the angled 'target', which is the beam of light from your flashlight. And as the game progesses some enemies are just a giant sack of 'shadow', meaning you have to sit your beam of light on them for its entire charge before you can even hurt them.  This is my second time coming back to it, and I just can't make it through for the sake of the story. And even though I got it on sale, I can't help but feel a little ripped off.

            "review_text": "Episode One - From the beginning, this game certainly leaves an unsettled feeling with you, and as far as episodic play goes, it cuts out at the right moment. The gameplay was pretty straightforward, but the 'boss' at the end did make things a bit challenging. The dream nature of the game leaves the player with a lack of control, which may be an appealing concept to some, but I suppose isn't something that draws me to video games. If I wanted to feel like I was only observing, I would have watched a movie.  Episode Two - The gameplay didn't change much with this episode, though the story telling took the front seat in more ways than one. The vehicle segment toward the end is something to look forward to, and had some of the most accurate driving controls I've seen in a while. The birds fight at the end, was frustrating and underwhelming when complete, but the cinematic at the end was a nice cliffhanger ending, and did encourage the player to keep playing.  While I found myself drawn in by the story of this game, the drawn out segments of stumbling through the dark did not create much of a draw for me to keep playing. I was honestly expecting more of an adventure game, and not really a survival horror game. Perhaps this expectation has created some of the disappointment for me. Unfortunately, the repetitive nature of the enemies, and consistently dark tone of the game did not create a world that I wanted to return to explore past Episode Two.",

I remember someone writing online that they just set the game to easy and ran all the way through to see the story, because the combat was so boring they didn't want to do it.   I became so bored, I just read their description of the plot instead of doing what they did.",

While the game has an impressively creepy setting and forces a real sense of Isolation and doom, the story itself is quite lacking. it has a real max payne 2 feeling but without the same sense of purpose. part way though the game you start to really feel like you are simply running through some horror house that covers a small town and the surrounding forest.  While I dont think this game was executed correctly, it still offers fun and immersion. I have very high hopes for a full sequel if that ever were to actually happen.  The dlc is not worth playing. it doesnt offer the same world as the main game and is almost like a VR mission pack but in a tiny black empty nightmare world. even if you own the dlc its questionable to play it.",

The reason why this is so annoying is that if the game would simply be bad, I could and would have stopped playing after few hours. Now I 'had to' finisht the game to get to experience the good athmospheric thriller but suffer from the really bad development decisions and badly implemented 'features'. I would give the game a neutral 'grade' but since I can't, I'll give it thumb down because I definitely can't recommend it. How good the game is for you depends heavily on how you want to weight the different portions and aspects of the game.  Pros. + At its best the athmosphere is really great. + The town is great and fits for the story perfectly. It really feels like more believable Twin Peaks. + Voice acting is between good and great. + Story telling and pacing of the story work very well. + Light and lighting effects look really good even on todays standards.  Cons - Driving. Really Remedy why did you put driving in Alan Wake?! If you can't bother to create proper driving simulation then do not, under any circumstance, add driving to you game. - Platforming. Same as driving, If you can't bother to do it well leave it out. - The poltergeist sections lacked both tension and, in the lack of a better word, gameplay. They really felt like they weren't meant to played through but itstead just emperienced to show the power of the darkness. - Light weapons outside flashlight really destroyed tension and the general immersion to the feeling of fear and terror. They felt like collectable superpowers. - Combat. I'm sure this divides people but I did not really like it. The combat works at the beginning where the focus is on athmosphere and tension. But when the focus goes to action, the weaknesses of the combat mechanics start to dominate badly.",

The sounds and music were fine, but I felt like I was constantly running from my own shadow.   Just not that fun.  Overall, 1/5. Even for a discounted price, I feel like it's a game that just needs to die and be forgotten. ",
