            "review_text": "The notion of free-running is one that inspires wonder in the hearts of many. As our cities begin to reach for the clouds with concrete and steel, humanity’s collective desire to explore follows. Sadly, we are restrained from truly achieving this dream by the rather irritating force of gravity. Parkour and free-running offer a route for us to step upon where we openly avoid, a route that Lemma sprints down in its attempt to offer a worthwhile experience. At its core, Lemma’s closest parallel is to be drawn with Mirror’s Edge. You play as a completely unarmed character in a strange and confusing world, one that seems to grow around you while trying to halt you in any way it can. As far as presentation goes, everything is seen from a first person perspective with Minecraft-esque blocks making up your playpen of an environment. As simple as this may be, there’s something altogether alluring about it. Rain falls throughout Lemma just as frequently as the sun shines. Each of the numerous levels that you’re given free reign to run around is presented with its own particular feel and sound. While a very early zone, Jungle in particular showcases how beautiful everything can be with a few simple blocks and a lot of creative design ability. The visual presentation of Lemma does not particularly affect its gameplay. As stated before, this is a first-person platformer. You run along, gaining momentum in preparation for a leap across whatever geological feature is in your way. There’s no run button or sprint mechanic in action throughout Lemma. The necessity of maintaining a consistent flow with your motion is something that’s rarely seen in gaming and yet, after seeing Lemma in action, a feature that really adds supplementary purpose to gameplay. It isn’t all about simply running from platform to platform until you reach the big shining door at the end. Momentum plays a key part in Lemma when you begin busting out impressive wall-runs or gravity-defying leaps to make your way around the terrain. While it can take a little getting used to, Lemma’s most delightful aspect comes in the form of this very feature. The environments around are just as enjoyable to play within, too. Flowing walls and walkways mix in with seemingly impossible to reach platforms as part of a recipe that creates something special. Completing a game is all well and good, but just being able to run around while simple motion itself makes you smile is enough to make Lemma worthwhile in some ways.  That being said, the worlds of Lemma do have a slightly bitter seed that doesn’t seem to blend with everything else. At times you’ll come across a dead end or challenge that seems initially to be completely impossible. They rarely are, you just can’t see what has to be done. No clues are dropped into this soup of geography though, and certain inconsistencies rear their heads when it comes to the mechanics that you can manipulate to push forward. Your only way to work out what exactly is going on in the world Lemma creates is through mobile phone messages that arrive when you reach certain signal points and multiple note piles scattered around. They weave a short but evocative tapestry, steeped in scientific intrigue but lacking in any emotional substance. It’s an interesting idea which almost gives Lemma something special in its narrative, falling short through a lack of personality indicative of text-based conversation. Lemma’s sound design is nothing special at first listen, until you realize how easily it seeps into your ears like nectar dripping from the beak of a hummingbird. There’s a very indie feel to it, propelling the audio over and above almost any other games of this ilk.  The sad thing is that, on the whole, Lemma is far from a memorable experience. Make room for it on your hard drive and you’ll find an interesting experience that’ll make you smile. The moment you turn it off, though, there’s none of that itching desire to go back. It lacks that something, that mark of passion fundamentally stitched into all great indie games.  It is, however, good. A fun distraction which opens the door to a small star of happiness in a sky filled with many brighter celestial bodies. If Lemma were in a constellation, it would be one of those stars sat in the middle. Lemma shines just as bright as its contemporaries but doesn’t have that one special mark that makes it a game you have to buy.",

            "review_text": "First off I am very happy with the controller support in the game. I would not have expected it, but it is here and as good as it should be.  It is very easy to draw parallels between Mirror's Edge and Lemma, but they are very different games. Lemma is a giant maze with parkour and puzzles. There is no combat, the physics are less realistic but more fun. The game is extremely impressive for having been made by a single person. While I never got stuck too badly I would come in expecting to get lost a bit.   The world is built out of large connecting open areas. You have to figure out where to go and how to get there and that can be quite a challenge in the later areas. I sometimes felt a little directionless, but I followed my gut and felt out where the level was trying to lead me and that has carried me through so far. The game is very hands off on teaching concepts. It expects that you are smart enough to figure things out. This can be seen in both the lack of a map, and very little hand holding in puzzles. This is both bad and good. On one hand it is refreshing to have a game that challenges me to figure things out. On the other hand there are some things I am not sure if I am understand correctly.   For example : there are red blocks that chase you by changing block colors to red. I am not sure if there is any way to change the tiles back once they have turned red. If there is a way I have missed it and will continue to play the rest of the game this way. Not a bad thing, just a consequence of not holding my hand.  With so many games overcharging for what they are, it is nice to see that the game is priced correctly for what it is. It is fully functioning and polished, but it is not a triple A title. You will get hours of enjoyment out of it, and there seems to be a story to find if your willing to dig deep enough. Much like the rest of the game, the story does not hold your hand.  My take? If you liked Fez you may like this. It is more about digging for secrets and finding your way than playing with the core mechanic of the game.  Full disclosure I know the maker of this game. I am glad to see the first of hopefully many games coming out of Columbus Ohio.  I am glad it turned out well. It took 5 years to make and it would really suck if I had to say it was no good after all that effort.",

The sheer joy I get out of this game allows me to over look many of its flaws. These flaws include frustrating enemies, some annoying glitches (no crashes though), and a really hard to follow storyline. But honestly, I don't care about any of these issues when I'm playing.  This is the only parkour game I've played that truly embraces the idea of no boundries. Often times, passing a level isn't about going fast, but by thinking creatively and forging a new path.  What I like most about this game is that it posseses a dream-like quality to it. You have weight yet the faster you go the more weightless you become. Puzzles can be solved through incredibly messy solutions. You run away from monstrous creatures as the level crumbles around you.  Try it out and see what I mean. Don't expect to be blown away, but intensely satisfied!",
