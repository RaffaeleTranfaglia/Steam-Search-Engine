            "review_text": "I played this game from the time when Evendim was first introduced up to when they released the Helm's Deep 'expansion'. In that time, it was my primary game. It was great. Kins, raiding, PvP. It was all I wanted in a MMO, with a Lord of the Rings theme. Unfortunately, the game went down hill.  The first expansion was Moria and was a good expansion. Probably the height of the game. We got loads of instances, a lair raid, a legendary weapons system and two new classes. They even gave us a few more updates with some instances and a couple of raids.  The second expansion was Mirkwood. It was marketed as a 'mini-expansion', and though it was smaller than Moria was, it was still much larger than anything we had later. We got a new instance system called 'Skirmishes', where we got soldiers and about a dozen instances to fight with them in. It was good, it filled it out. Mirkwood also came with 3 x 3 man instances, 1 x 6 man instance and a 3 boss raid with a gauntlet at the start. It wasn't as good as Moria but it was cheaper, so we accepted it.  Then came the biggest issue: Turbine was bought by Warner Brothers. Only a couple of months after this, the game went 'free to play' (you can play for free, but it's heavily restricted and you need to pay to unlock things). The community was a little concerned, thinking that it would mean the reduction in quality of the game or finding lots of 'pay to win' items. Turbine assured us it would be alright.  They released a large update with about 4 or 5 instances and a raid. It was a good instance cluster, but it didn't come with any level cap increase so loot wasn't that desirable. It also came about 6 months before the release of another expansion.  Rise of Isengard was our first expansion since F2P. And cracks were beginning to show more and more. They released it without any instance cluster initially. Only a single buggy lair raid that was originally promised as a free update and later tacked on to the expansion to fill it out. Then, slowly, we got the instance cluster and raid. It was an alright raid but it felt hollow. We'd waited a long time and then got nothing more than a mini-expansion had provided before, especially when it cost twice as much as Mirkwood did.  After that, we got Riders of Rohan. This 'expansion' was the biggest joke of all. Originally, they didn't tell us what was in it when they released pre-purchases. Then, after people bought it, they revealed it wouldn't have any instance cluster. No raids. The only end-game would be a daily grind to rebuild a town. That was it. The community kicked off. Eventually, they gave in and said they'd include an instance cluster. But the instance cluster was about Erebor (the mountain in the Hobbit) and not anything to do with Rohan. It was clear it was intended as a cash grab for people who watched the Hobbit films. We got the first half of the instance cluster a few months after the expansion first released. Then we got the second half. Both times they gave us these instance cluster halves, they called them 'updates'. Usually, updates had new content in. This time, it was just delayed content that was supposed to be part of the expansion. The downside being all of the instances were terrible, the raids were 2 lair bosses and a gauntlet (so less than the Mirkwood raid), and people gave up.  By this point, Turbine had also gone out of their way to monetise what they could. They ignored complaints about lag, grinds, and broken old content. Instead, they began selling more store-only items. They milked what they could from the playerbase without caring what sort of content to deliver. It got to the point where the community was so divided between fanboys and people hostile to Turbine that the forums became a propaganda-fest. The CM banned dissenters left and right.  With customer trust erroded, Turbine finally announced their next (and my last) expansion. Helm's Deep. They didn't have any instances, only these things called 'Big Battles', which took away any importance of class and relied on generic big battle upgrades. They also did the thing that killed the game for many people: Trait Trees.  Before, you could trait your character how you wanted. It made hybrid builds viable and widely varied. You could make a class built for survival, or DPS, or whatever you wanted. But Trait Trees took all of that away. They gave generic builds to everyone. Now, you couldn't run a hybrid build because you could only choose one line and the skills it came with. They literally locked our skills behind 3 different lines. Where a person might have a few healing abilities in their DPS build, they were now locked behind the healing line only. Sure, you could put points in other lines, but it didn't give you the skills you wanted like before. In effect, they took everyone's characters and made them generic, cookie-cutter builds.  After this, they said they had no plans for another expansion. A few small updates here and there, but it's basically maintenance mode now until Mordor. A cash cow to squeeze, not a game to please.  And now we're at the point where they've driven so many people away that they're having to merge servers to save cost and to make the population look busy again. 29 servers cut down to just 10; 5 US servers, 5 EU servers. It says a lot when a game is forced to make such drastic changes, while pretending it's doing fine. Not only that, they've been unsuccessful with actually transferring characters between servers, so in true Turbine form they've got no clue what they're doing.  TL;DR: Do not play this game. It's no longer what it once was. It's a broken, hollow, generic shadow of its former self, and Turbine are only using it now to milk the few remaining loyalists for all they're worth.   Edit: To clarify, I have a Lifetime account. I get full VIP perks forever because I paid a large amount when I first started playing. So my complaints are from the perspective of someone who doesn't even need to pay for it, yet still can't bring themselves to play it.",

There are several regions which have their quests unlocked and other quest packs and services can be unlocked using Turbine Points which can be easily gained ingame by completing deeds. A lot of people pay for 1 months VIP subscription for the permanent unlocks it gives, but I love the game so much I decided to go VIP to put some money back into a game that satisfies all my mmo needs. Awesome cosmetic/wardrobe options, great crafting system, beautiful places to explore and I love achievements &amp; titles!  I haven't covered the raiding/endgame or PVM (player vs monster) as I haven't been involved with those. But the PVM, where you can create a monster race player &amp; fight other players in the Ettenmoors sounds like a lot of fun.",

In April, LOTRO will be celebrating 10 years and players will be preparing to journey to Mordor alongside The Fellowship to destroy The One Ring. While such a declaration may make give the impression that things are drawing to a close, that is hardly the case. The fan base for LOTRO remains one of the most dedicated in terms of an MMORPG's popularity, right up there with World of Warcraft. LOTRO has been featured in Atlas Obscura, a college course in Tennessee has featured and been inspired by it, and new players are joining the game everyday. With the tenth anniversary coming up, this is the absolute best time to either start playing LOTRO or return to it. In no other game can you so througly immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth. No matter what games I play in my Steam library or consoles, I still login everyday to chat and play with my kinmates and lose myself in this beautiful world for an hour or two or five. These reasons and many more are why Lord of The Rings Online deserves the Steam Award for The Test of Time.",

            "review_text": "Lord of the Rings online was a lot better back in 2007 at launch or up to 2 years after it. But time has changed as did Lord of the Rings online, so I will comment on how the game is now.  Lord of the Rings online is almost a MUST PLAY for every Tolkien fan. The developer always works close with the Middle-Earth Enterprise (the license holder of Tolkiens legacy) to make sure that the game is very close to the lore. A lore that's one of the most richest ones in the whole Fantasy genre.  The game world is very well done and gives you a very good feeling of how Tolkien meant Middle-Earth to be. Weather you visit Bree to take a drink at the Prancing Pony, take a stroll across Rivendell or walk through the Mines of Moria, the world feels quite real.  One of the best features of Lord of the Rings online is the epic story. At the start of the game your character is about 3 months behind the Fellowship. While playing through the 'original' game (the one that was released in 2007), you'll stay behind the Fellowship, only to catch up with them in Rivendell at some time. The epic story does not tell the story of the Fellowship or your character though. Instead it tells a story of what's happening all around Middle-Earth and reveals things that are not written in the book.  Game play though is an other thing. For a MMORPG there's very little player interaction in the lower levels. Mainly the last 2 expansions (Riders of Rohan and Helm's Deep as of this writing) are the places where you need to party to get your progress in the epic story. In the 'older' expansions the game has been modified so that you can actually play the old party content all alone, which I think is a sad thing.  In all, I think Lord of the Rings online is still a very good MMORPG for it's age and I hope that Turbine will be able to extend it's license (about to expire in 2014 and no word about it so far) so that we can play the game for an other 5 years",

            "review_text": "As a veteran of MMOs (and MUDs before that) I would have to recommend this game for several reason.  -F2P: Its actually free to play. The RMT (real money trade) store items are mostly cosmetic. There are some that effect gameplay convenience wise. However, the RMT currency (Turbine Points) can be also earned in game in many different ways. Basically, the game gives you RMT currency as a side result of playing.  -The Community. The community is not the typical MMO trollfest. MOST players you come across are more than willing to lend a hand, give advice or even (sometimes) free items etc. They are very friendly and generally tend to help the new players out.  -Social MMO. Despite this game having boatloads of grindy combat like any other MMO, there are many unique social aspects to this game. Making/playing your own musical instruments in a band, player/guild housing etc.  -Massive world. The gameworld in this is rather big. While certain areas are locked out until you purchase the expansion, there are equivalent zones for the free (budget) player.  -Customer Support is very ... human. And tends to be helpful with the player rather than absolute sticklers to policy.  -Mounted Combat/Legendary Weapons/Raids/Dungeons/Crafting/Typical MMO stuff etc., etc.,  CONS:  -I had performance issues on my budget laptop. The game can get very laggy with xpacs and infusion of players.  -WoW ruined any mmo without flying mounts &gt;&lt;  TL:DR give it a spin if you like mmos. While it doesn't break any new ground in the genre it is a solid game with unique social aspects.",

            "review_text": "Wow. It is really hard to review a game which became a part of your life and of your soul. I'll start with negative points then, hope it will be easier for us all this way.  1. Move along if you're not familiar with Lord of the Rings. This game is made for fans of Middle-Earth by fans of Middle-Earth. It is story-driven game which rewards you for being into this world. It is not worth your time nor money if you are indifferent about LotR. Better go read some books. You might as well close this review, won't be anything more useful here for you.  2. Teh graphics suxx. LotRO doesn't hold its line against any of nowadays-popular MMORPGs (except maybe WoW, which looks just as awful now). I'm not sure if I placed 2 first points in the right order, but anyway: if you're looking for impressive effects and fappable grills, move along. Go play TERA, it's just what you need (and quite good a MMORPG by the way).  3. The combat system is decades since deprecated. Yes, it's THAT point-and-click we all were tired of for years. If you consider it disgusting and still reading it for some reason - move along. Go play TERA or anything else, there is a plenty of action MMORPGs nowadays.  4. The game is not free. Period. If you don't spend a single penny on the game, you will have really hard time past level 25. However, don't leave yet. It's the first matter I'll deal with below.  That's it for contras, I think.   As promised, concerning money. You have two options: to buy a subscription or to purchase all items (mostly, quest packs) separately. Aside from that, you'll need two out of three DLCs ('Steely Dawn' is auxiliary, nothing mandatory there). Taking all the discounts into concern (~20% off in-game items, 50-75% off DLCs at large Steam sales), the second option is much more convenient. Still, it will cost you dearly (around $30 for Russian players and probably twice that much for all the others: there's a solid reason for this difference, but I won't elaborate here).  Still reading this? Kudos to you then. Now I'm going to persuade you to install LotRO.  1. THE STORY. I cannot stress this enough. The game is highly story-driven. Every single quest is a brick in a huge building of the Middle-Earth story. The epic storyline follows the road of the Fellowship of the Ring. It reached Gondor as of when I'm writing this. And it's called epic for a good reason. Still, side quests play no lesser role. All of them contribute to the story and to the atmosphere.  2. The graphics. You've got it right, and f**k those who left in the progress. The effects might seem simple, the grills might seem not fappable enough, but it's LotR, not a manga. It feels natural, however natural it might be for a fantasy world. And you have my word that you will stop once in a while just to have a longer look at that landscape.  3. The world. Do you remember? It's the good old Middle-Earth. You can venture into icy crevasses of Forochel (don't jump in the water!), walk among the golden mallorns of Lothlorien, explore the dangerous depths of Moria and ride with rohirrim against the tide of Uruk-hai.   You can even find a hat Gandalf dropped at the very bottom of the Endless Stair.    4. The atmosphere. You get used to it, to every good and bad thing about the game, and you really feel like you live in this world. The domestical system. The music. The language in quests is good and proper English (or Elven, mind you). The mobs are not concentrated at farming spots, but are mixed and scattered across vast logical regions. The crafting system (you can actually cook, Valar be damned!) HP is called Morale, so you don't actually die, but desperately flee when severely outmatched. The Dread system which turns your screen gray and replaces minimap with a flaming eye, when you encounter something truly fearsome.   Like a Balrog corpse.   It is, definitely, the best LotR-inspired game in terms of atmosphere that ever existed.  I could go on. I could mention the community, the music playing (yep, you can play any music in the game at a MIDI quality), the PK absence, the epic battles and whatnot. But I will conclude.  Come and feel it yourself. If you're still here - it is worth it. This is an experience you'll never regret. And LotRO will love you back.  THIS GAME IS A F***ING BLAST AND I LOVE IT. DO IT. Join the Fellowship.  Oh Eru, I wanted to say it from the very start.  Sincerely Yours, Talcano Mithrenhen, Landroval (ex-Mirkwood).",

            "review_text": "The Lord of the Rings Online is by far the Best MMORPG I've kind of played. I was a late to the game, but I subbed for a few months with some friends (and even more since f2p). The fellowship quests and group content is as solid as it gets for old school MMORPGs. A time came when new and shiny things came and Lotro was left behind for me and my pals, But I still go back every now and then. I love the rich lore/story, the fantastic graphics (even today they look good), and the truley epic settings.  LOTRO at first glance when playing is odd. I totally understand when someone says they just didn't like it. Yet at it's core, this game is as good if not better than any MMORPG made during it's time. It just does things a little differently. For instance it tries really hard to stick to the books (the I.P it draws from-not the movies) so there are no mages or wizard classes bc the only Wizards are the famous ones - (Gandorf, Radhadgas, Sarapmon). There are however classes who play like mages using knowledge of powders (Lore Master), ancient runes (Rune Keeper), and...music (Minstrel). There are no 'hit points' or health. The green bar is morale, and when it reaches zero you die..so yeah its health, but not really, and some abilities are just silly like the crowd control Burglar ability 'riddle' (in the heat of combat you tell a riddle and the enemy thinks about it for like 20 secs). Thats what Lotro does. It holds true to the lore of the book and the world it created. Each class is very fun and there are quite a few 'one of a kind' classes in Lotro. So often mmos copy paste classes. At the start of the game, the music is not great, your gear looks like barf, and you're screaming at enemies to do damage. It's different and these can push ppl away, but the music is optional, lotro has an amazing (before it's time) outfit/wardrobe system that is fully customizable with dyes and overlays, and screaming at enemies lowers their morale so get over it.   The main reason I don't play it very much is the lack of friends who will play it. Like many MMORPGs back then, playing with friends is a tricky and often demanding experience. Need to be on the same server, and need to be near the same levels. Servers have merged, players are a bit low, but It's still good and the Free to play model isn't horrible. You can do anything by grinding Deeds. The f2p model locks out questing zones and trait slots, and sometimes the paygates get annoying, but if you don't care to grind deeds it's really not that big of a deal. Especially if you make alts bc their deeds count towards the in game currency too. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings in any form, nothing beats exploring and visiting all of the awesome iconic places you've only read about or seen in movies. Give it a try! I know I will as long as it's still alive.",

            "review_text": "I used to play this game until they released a patch which which broke the musical instruments so I left the game with sadness in my heart. You may wonder why I would have instruments as a reason to leave the game, so allow me to ellaborate;  Once long, long ago I began my journey in LotRO as soon as it was released on Steam. I had thoroughly enjoyed the books and loved the movies to an equal measure so I decided to see what kind of game the MMO would be like. The experience was honestly the best I had ever had out of an MMO up until that point and I loved it down to the core of my heart. I loved exploring around the vast maps on my mount, dismounting to farm and complete quests and then return to uncover more story and venture deeper into more and more locations. The I found instruments but didn't know about how to use them correctly so I left them to one side. Eventually during my adventures I caught up to a group of people in the same area who were courteous to me and even allowed me to join them in their party so that we could all complete the quests faster and adventure together. Not long later they invited me to their Skype group and we would talk and play LotRO for hours on end. Slaying everything from the lowly mobs to major bosses and we would do so joyously. Then one person in the group stated they had been looking online at guides and forums and had stumbled across ABC files. These were essentially MIDI files that were programmed to work with instruments in LotRO. We messed around with them initially until someone in the group had the brilliant idea of synchronising our music by counting down in Skype and beginning to play the same song simultanbeously. We did so and the result was fantastic; we were essentially a small orchestra of terribly mismatched instruments but the sound was fantastic to us nontheless. Not only this but when we began to do this in centers of population like towns and hubs other players began to gather around in small crowds and use dance emotes as we played the Star Wars theme tune, MJ's Smooth Criminal, the Pirates of the Carribean theme tune and so on. Even though this had nothing to do with the game itself it was as if we had created a tiny meta-game within LotRO which we as a group resided and we even stopped questing as a whole. We simply went from town to town as a traveling band and it was the best time I have probably ever had in an MMO. It was also an extremely unique experience. Never in my life had I ever played an online game in order to avoid playing the online game in favour of doing some stupid pointless thing and it was still so enjoyable.  Then the updates happened. Not only did servers begin to die out and disappear but they eventually released a patch which broke the instruments. HOW they broke the instruments, items which have literally no impact on the rest of the game or needed modifying or changing in any way shape or form is still beyind me, but they did and this crushed my heart and the hearts of my fellow group. We had spent what mjust have been three or four moths running aroudn playing music and being generally stupid while occasionally helping lower level people who required assistance withing quests. We unanimously decided to all leave the game. The thing which had become the core gameplay to us long after the grindy and repetitive combat had become stale was lost. We waited for a few weeks. We posted many complaints. There were quite a lot of forum posts. But this was to no avail. After each passing week the desire to return to LotRO had subsided and I have never return since. This in it's entirety is the tale of my LotRO experience. Although it may not be the most useful or the most interesting this is how I viewed the game during my playtime and the reason why I abandoned it.  P.S. If under any circumstance they have fixed the instruments please reply to this so that people will know if they have not played the game but my desire to play is no longer here so I will not be returning regardless, thank you.",

Don't bother playing without a subscription or good hardware, either - most of the game requires cash to access (including class-critical abilities), and later areas are laggy.  The character building/equipment system is a joke, especially since essences. - There's a whole bunch of base and derived stats (maybe 25-35, depending on how you count), but only a third is actually relevant. The remaining stats come free when gearing for the important third. - There are sixteen equipment slots (plus legendary items, which are class features, not items), but they all do exactly the same: they exist only to dump armour with lots of essence slots into. Yes, there are set bonuses, but you could easily reduce the whole equipment system to, say, six numbers (# of four kinds of essences, # of two kinds of equipment set). - Overall, there is a semblance of complexity, but successive updates only seem to replace the need to think about your equipment with more grind-based power creep. - To be clear, combat is fine. It's just that char-op is boring.   I don't recommend it, because I don't like it (anymore). However, if you're not interested in deep character building systems, you like being monologued at by NPCs (in LoTR-style speech), and you don't mind a bit of grind, it's otherwise a good game.",

Now on the bad side: the graphics are a bit dated now but the landscapes can still be stunning. Combat animations are slow, which makes combat feel a bit sluggish. The game is also far too easy when levelling up, but this is fixed at higher levels.  Overall I'd highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "People complain a great deal about The Lord of the Rings Online in how it isn't immersive with its dialogue, or lack thereof, and other rather old MMO elements. So World of Warcraft and Star Wars Galaxies were not great games either that followed this game doctrine?  LOTRO is an exceptional example of an MMO for fans of the books, movies, and newcomers alike. The player-base is smaller than others, but this leads to a community that is more friendly, and charitable. That is one of the best parts about this game also: the community. In LOTRO, you won't find many toxic people (At least, on my server, Crickhollow). I bought this game the day it came out, and have had the luxury to see how it evolved since then, and the toxocity has not increased much (but, this game is free, so expect some bad apples).  The MMO is also very relaxed, meaning that if you are used to super-competitive MMOs, and want to retreat from it all, LOTRO is a great game to relieve that built-up tension. The crafting system is also elaborate, and fun to do as well, with crafters even giving some of their finished work for free to players in need.  The attention to detail involving the world of Middle-Earth is very accurate to how J.R.R. Tolkien wrote it (not how Peter Jackson tried to erase it in the movies), with famous characters, places, and events all happening that fans read about. I can compare this to Star Wars Galaxies (RIP), where you are sort of 'Along for the ride' with the major plot.  Overall, LOTRO is one of the best MMOs out there right now, if you don't want to remove your scarf and thick-framed glasses and play WoW (tried WoW, got bored of it the same way the people who gave this MMO negative reviews did). So many elements encompass the greatness of this rather obscure, and in some ways forgotten, MMO. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes MMOs, give it a shot, it is free after all!",

Its an absoloutely amazing game, especially if you're a big fan of the LOTR triology, as you can easily relate to many parts in this game, story, characters etc etc...The game truly has great content, and a huge world to explore as you level up to capin at 105 :) ...Graphics are quite decent , especially on high specs, and runs quite well on alot of systems.. no matter if you have an average pc/laptop etc...Communities are great and there is always someone there to give you a helping hand when you start off. Apart from the exciting and adventurous story and quests, LOTRO also brings PVP, which is quite competitive involving the Freeps( the good side :) ) vs Creeps( the monsters/bad side). Both are playable and both are great, its all up to a matter of preference which side you would like to PVP as :) I wont review that in detail, but there's plenty of playthroughs and info on pvp online.  Im currently a lvl 105 Beorning [ with a lvl 63 hunter &amp; 3 extra spare character slots ] ( totally F2p ) in the server of Evernight - Name : Hranvir, and have not spent a single cent getting here, with expansions, and quest packs leading up as far as the end game Far Anórien quest pack.(excluding the odd few quest packs/ and the helms deep expansion, which are not too necessary in reaching end game) , as well as gold cap, Auction house slots,beorning class w/ character slot , and more restrictions all unlocked by doing the deeds, quests etc to unlock these ( Turbine points/ TP ) , basically farming and also using different alt characters to repeat... making hundreds each run (approximately around 400+) within 2-3 hours.  It just shows that if you're a F2p even for the start, how far and how much you can achieve without paying anything, just with some time,patience and dedication, which will pay off in the end :) . Its up to you if you want to pay for the game expansions/quest packs, especially if you feel you do not have the time at hand to farm them all out. (even going VIP for 1 month will unlock many permanent restrictions on your account (characters which you log on while VIP is up will gain benefits), aswell as giving you some TP &amp; access to PVP as a freep... only for the price of $15 ) I have not done it yet but its definitely worth it imho.   Overall, if you loved the LOTR story/books, and are a huge fan of MMO's ,you like open world action, the freedom to do/go as you wish, meet many new friends, and encounter some great adventures... this is the game for you! :)  I personally love this game and once you get started, its quite tricky to let go :) its just really exciting, and is a great experience to try out.. and i would certainly recommend this to anyone and you should download and give it a go right away! ^^ If you would like to have a deeper look into the game/gameplay/action and so forth, Youtube is simply the way, as it will show you through gameplay, the races/classes/mounts/ etc etc. so do check that out!   LOTRO is definitely a great MMO, and one you will certainly get to grips with and enjoy! :)",

Some of the strong points of the game include:     Story and lore - there is a ton of story and lore packed into this game, which is awesome if you're a Tolkien fan     Music - the music is top-notch for the most part and really fits the world well     PvE content - there is always something to do, whether it's following a quest chain to level up you or your epic weapon, following the main storyline, fighting in a skirmish, decortaing your personal or kin house, or participating in one of the many festivals     Character housing - something WoW has yet to implement...   Some of the weak points of the game are:     Rewards - Turbine has a problem with giving away proper rewards in their games. It happens in their D&amp;D game as well. you can run through a long Instance for 20 minutes and get a bit of skirmish marks, or you can do a quick skirmish and get the same number of skirmish marks. And the daily gifts are usually something you don't need or want     PvP is lacking - I'm not very much into PvP, but if you are, this probably isn't the game for you. The PvP (in LoTRO, PvMP) system seems stale and boring. It is cool to be able to fight on the monster side, though     Graphics are outdated - models and animations need to be updated, though there are many times the graphics are quite beautiful. I appreciate that the graphics are less cartoony than other MMO's, but an update would help a lot    Many people complain about it now being F2P, but it doesn't bother me, I just love the LoTR world and love being part of it. This game may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I definitely recommend it for a shade of Earl Grey.",

What I love most about the game are the story and the immersion you feel when you're playing. You really feel like you're a part of the Middle Earth World, which to me means a lot (I'm obssessed with Lord of the Rings). The regions are varied enough that you feel like every place is different. Also, each class has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the other classes; most people have multiple characters on multiple servors because they want to capitalize on all the different class options and play styles.  The main problems I have with LOTRO are that the combat is getting clunky, certain classes are way overpowered compared to others, and the questing in certain regions is getting a bit monotonous. The combat is generally the same the whole game, so it's important that you pick the class that goes with what you want in the game. It can just be very repetitive at times. Likewise, certain classes are way stronger than other classes. My hunter is so frail at level 89 compared to most other classes. So frail that it becomes difficult to get through basic solo quests. Finally, the quest are around the same thing over and over again. I know there can only be a finite number of quest ideas, but I would appreciate more diversity in questing.   Overall, I find myself coming back to this game every couple of months, getting bored, and then coming back again in a cycle. I've done this for four years now, and I expect to d othe same for at least a couple more years. 8.5/10",

You will be spending a lot of time re-rolling characters and running the same zones over and over to earn enough points to unlock the next quest packs, expansions, bag upgrades etc.. etc.. My recommendation is to subscribe and get everything for a monthly fee, minus the expansions that will have to be purchased of course. ",

It has been a long running favorite with huge amounts of space to explore and a skirmish system that other MMOs need to pay attention to.  The downside is the game is starting to show its age a bit more than WoW does. The art in the game manages to land square in the uncanny valley and the player animation is sloppy. Anyone with a speed buff comically trots in place when starting or stopping. No ability to unsheath weapons, and everyone in your party will be synchronized when entering or exting combat. These things are minor, but jarring. Hunter's port system has become a chore, and travel from point to point to point is now confusing and tedious. Travel needs to be revamped to just a drop down of where you want to go at this point. Also, a lot of this game is simply NIH going extra lengths to not be WoW even when WoW-like was the right thing to do.  The upside is the game continuously expands and improves. New gameplay mechanics, often new innovations, are introduced with each year. The lore is immersive (as it should be), and elaboration happens with consent and approval from the Tolkien estate. The cosmetic outfit system is an example of a place where WoW (and every other MMO) specifically needs to take notice. Content is often truely difficult rather than outright unfair, even when playing retro-content several levels under you.  Warsteeds were a fizzle addition to the game, largely because they amplified the slop in the controls by an intentionally sloppy and unweidly system. PvMP (because WoW calls it PvP) is amazing, but often unbalanced as stats start in favor of monsters and end in favor of Hobbits by the end of an xpac cycle. Legendary weapons are not cosmetically customizable and obsoleted every xpac. This flys in the face of the intent of the original intent of the system, and is a very tedious grind. The legendary system is also confusing and dependant on huge amounts of randomness. Keep these as your forwarning as they will be the biggest sore points.  Despite the complaints here, I still love this game. I still recommend this game. I hope that they will approach fixing the sloppy controls and simplify the legendary system as these are the only things causing me to drift towards other games.",

The things I like about the game is the beautiful scenery, the storyline, cosmetics(!), and the player community is one of the best I know. There are 4 player races, all with their own backgroundstory. The classes are also fun to play (I tried them all). Another good thing is that it is normally F2P, so you can try it out as long as you like. You don't have to pay a monthly fee, unless you want some extras.

Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game?   Then LotRO is definitely your bet.  2. This isn't a game about PvP.

Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.  3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.  4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!  5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.  6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for).   7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.  These developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.  8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.  9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.  10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game.   You'll certainly fit in our bunch :)  Total score would be 9\\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.",

One of the best MMO's that I've ever played. Also, the roleplaying servers are very active, and this game offers the best roleplaying that I've ever experienced in any MMO, hands down.  The only drawback is this games age, because of the age of this game, the community feels like it is slowly dissapating. While still a very friendly and helpful community, and honestly one of the most mature communitied I've ever seen in an MMO, the player base seems to be dwindling so much, that it may, at times, leave you feeling alone.  If you haven't played this game, and are ok playing alone, give it a shot. If you have a group of friends to play with, give it a shot. If you're patient enough to have periods where it seems like no one is online, give it a shot. This game is great!",

You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game.  Another clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use 'Turbine Points'. How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world.  There is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot. In short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.  PRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria.",

The material the game is based on was written by a well-respected literature professor, and this shines through in the setting and different areas when compared to similar games; I think the Shire is probably the most relaxing place I've ever been to in an MMO.   The story missions and dungeons were very immersive and were set cleverly alongside the storyline of the books. I had lots of fun and met some very cool people. It's had player housing for a long time, which most other games strangely didn't seem to pick up on until recently. Graphics are starting to look pretty dated by today's standards, and from what I've seen of the free model it probably makes more sense to just subscribe if you're going to put a lot of hours in (the bulk of the time I played was before f2p and being available on Steam).

The down side of the RK is you have to use real money to purchase it from the lotro store. Now if you are a tank you coud go with the gaurdian this Class has the upmost amount of Hp i think the most ive seen in HP is 21k at max rank this class is ment for group stile playing made to take all the damage while dealing lots of Dps, nwo if you like to help the group out and do alot of DPS then i recoment the Champion this is almost like the gaurdian but doesnt have as much HP this class is set more towards high amount of DPS with little dameage taken good for group still playing, if you are mre of a ranged player and not for the up close and personal then i recmend the hunter class it your usaual bow and sword class good for ranged DPS but in this game it has a major ability that everbody needs this ability is swift travel witch basically mean that you dont have to use a stable you will have a skill that will let you go straight to the desired location the last class this game has is for more a quite sneak around play this calss is the burglar this class uses more of trickster skills to throw the enemy.   this game is a well worth it game i again recomend it and i hop ethis helps you guys/girls out and enpires you to play this game, if you do decide to play this game and start to have problems or need help add Themusicguy that is my toons name and i will be happy to help",

RP servers seem really dead recently, but from those I've seen they're probably with their kinships and guilds, etc. Otherwise it really does feel dead, any player who does show themselves is usually either not talkative, or wants to spar, all. the. time.  Features Housing too, which (lowest for me was 950 Silver coins.) does feel a little grindy in terms of getting one. most quests give 1 silver and 90 copper.  100 copper - 1 silver. 1,000 silver - 1 gold.  I'm level 16, played for 15 hours - gold is almost a myth, although I imagine when I reach near the cap it'll seem like it's flowing.  Try it.",

It captures ALL the moments from the film, be it items, to characters/npcs, or simply landscape/areas.  Problem is, thats just about where the fun of the game, ends.  It's pretty much the same things that you have to kill, in different zones.  Lots of re-skinned and tougher stats for monstes across the world, and it's really sad to see this, but then of course... LOTRO based their game of the old style WoW... You can see it with so many things which are alike with both gamesit's uncanny.  From the combat, right down to the crafting system, and everything inbetween.  Honestly, getting into a Guild, is normally the way to go with MMO games, as it tends to draw you into the game more, as you form bonds with your guild-mates. However, for me... This is a game that I would actually like to enjoy Solo, and really experience the world and all it has to offer, for myself.  Sadly, even doing this though, the fact that there are so many re-skins and multiples of monsters which are boring and dull. (Generic types are Goblins, Orcs, Spiders, Wolves... etc)... That was enough for me to finally, after 60+ hours of game time, to put the game down for good.  I can only recommend this game to the hardest of LOTR die-hard fans, who want to immerse themselves inside Middle-Earth. They can look past the boredom of the combat system, amongst many other simplistic functions of the game.  For everyone else, nope... You will likely hit the wall I have... and look for a more modern day game, which has more variety in it, excluding different skins for monsters.",

The storyline and lore was fairly immersive apart from the occasional out of place line of dialogue, the graphics are definitely low budget so don’t expect too much out of it.  As for the gameplay itself, the character that I played had standard WoW style combat with channelled spells, instant casts and a ‘white damage’ melee attack. Movement and camera control was almost identical to WoW too down to the num lock for auto walk.  I guess that you could say that the learned biases they utilised allowed me to jump right in without much learning, but it also made the experience feel like a cheap independent version of WoW.  In a good free to play model the ‘free’ players are used as tools to drive the in-game economy or gameplay, add value for paying player. For example Valve uses free players in TF2 and Dota2 to drive demand -through trading- for paying players to open chests (See Steam Dev Days for more info). In this respect free players are valuable in both a commercial and community sense.  But as a new player only a few hours in, it feels like free players are not valued at all. From what I've seen, in-game purchases are in your face within the first 10 minutes of play and it just gets worse from there.  In conclusion The Lord of the Rings Online feels like a $5 independent title trying to bleed you dry, with its only redeeming features being the large amount of content. It is also incorrectly labelled free to play, it’s more like a demo for a subscription game with mandatory DLC expansions and pay to win mechanics.",

I confess right off the bat that I have been spoiled by other f2p mmo's particularly regarding voice acting (there is none in this game). I also need to make clear that while I enjoy the franchise I'm not the most well versed in the lore of the Lord of the Rings universe, and perhaps that's why I couldn't get inot the game. I found the game to feel similar to the later Elder Scrolls Online, the game feels like a generic fantasy mmorpg with a coat of lotr paint on it. Combat is your typical hotkey button mashing you've seen plenty of times before. The graphics are marginal, although the game isn't too recent so I'd say take it with a grain of salt. I didn't play for long before this game bored me to the point of asking the dreaded 'why should I care?' Another point to give to the game is that I didn't find any pay to win (though once again I didn't play for too long). You might enjoy this game if you're really into the LotR world and lore, or if you have a group to role through the game with. If you're not very familiar with the universe and don't have anyone to play with I'd reccomend giving it a try as it is free, but I'm not sure you'll find too much enjoyment as there are much better mmorpg's that are also free.",

As a black person and lover of high fantasy it is noteably very hard to find representation within shows, movies, etc that show such time periods, but often I have found that in MMO's or games that have at least some degree of character customization that allow darker skintones. Literally, the lightest I was able to go was a slightly darker tan. This turned me off from the game enough to delete it off of my computer completely, damn the hours I had wasted trying to play it in the first place.  This kind of disappointment is unfortunately very common, but other games have included darker skintones and been able to hold much more vast audiences.

Because you will walk A LOT before you get your horse. And we arrived to the spot: is this game really free to play? The answer is usually 'sort of, but not really'. This case? YES. You can earn TPs (Turbine Points) by achieving and completing given deeds in the game (you can think about them as 'achievements'), which are originally can be bought for real money (or if you subscribe, you get 500 each month). You can buy from TPs the usual cosmetics and consumable boosts as well as new areas of the game, quest packs etc.  All in all: worth trying.",

            "review_text": "Overall a very good MMORPG. If you are used to high end ones like WoW, the controls might seem inresponsive and laggy. The community is very friendly. There are two 'modes'  Free People (Freeps): I used to play this game actively in the late stage of the expantion: Siege of Mirkwood, so I base my opinnoin on how the game was back then. Free people is the 'normal' mode where you play one of the well known races, human, elf, dwarf or hobbit. you also get to choose which class you play. all with unique playstyles. You will have to level up your character and you will will grow fond of it in the process. Sadly as a free player you can only have two characters and only the areas from level 1 to 30 are available to you by default. Please don't make this the deciding factor whether or not to play this game, since it has a lot to offer. The game has a storyline which runs in paralel with the events of the Lord of the rings trillogy, it is truly a masterpiece.  Monster Play (Creeps): When you level a freep character to level 10 Monster play mode unlocks. Monster play is the mode where you play a monster race like for example an Orc. This mode is way smaller than the free people mode, it is limmited only to the world pvp content. You can choose a class not a race like the freep classes they are all unique in playstyle. Only one of the classes is available. When you create your character your character imidiately is maximum level. However you have a 'rank' it starts at 0, at the start you can not possibly solo a enemy player. the higher your rank the stronger you become. once you hit about rank 10+ (takes a LOT of time) you become an unstoppable force that can destroy the enemy team even when you are outnumbered. I'm not saying there is nothing to do when you are low rank. If you want to play as a monster a lot of grinding is needed.   I'd personally recommend playing as a freep character with a few friends (best number would be 6, because of pve content) I highly recomend you check this game out and wish you many hours of fun.  I would rate this game a 6,8/10, due to outdated graphics and obvious flaws.",

It is a truly beautiful game and although the graphics may be slightly behind modern standards, the fact that you can explore middle earth at your own pace is truly breathtaking for a fan and those who aren't fans will find themselves immersed fairly soon. The developers are not sparing any details when making middle earth however which means they release different sections of middle earth as time goes by. Now I know it says that I only have 0.1 hrs on record, and that is true of steam, I was one of the first to own the game back when you had to buy the installation disc from the shop and install it manually before it was free to play, it is truly great fun and I do not regret a second of my game time...

If you however despise frame drops like you are constantly rolling down stairs with the occasional land mine planted somewhere and a die-hard stiff necked fanbase that will never accept anything is wrong with the game and will proceed to spam you with 'Go play something else!' as soon as you mention any issues about the games terrible frame drops or companion AI that was probably designed by a sloth spazming on the keyboard (Because the mobs have the reaction of one, they'd rather watch you get beaten to death than react properly).  They praise the story in this game like it was directed and animated by J.R.R Tolkien himself eventhough some of the scenes are so horrible it makes you cringe like you are watching old people make out while gollum over on the yonder narrates each specific action while touching himself. Although I will say some scenes are quite epic, the latest ones leave much to be desired. Especially Pelennor field which was like watching a poorly funded spanish soap opera and it was just plain awkward to be there on the field, i'd rather have been elsewhere farming potatoes in the shire or something.  Now about the classes, man oh man. Are you interested in being a champion, loremaster, burglar, minstrel or the beorning(which was left for dead by the developers as soon as it was released?) WRONG, if you want to play end game these are the classes that will not be wanted though perhaps your Minstrel and Champion will be welcome. Also Loremaster and burglar will bore you to death, the foremost with long cooldowns on the only good skills and the latter with no area of effect abilities so it takes forever to get anything done. If you want to be a Damage Dealer, you will HAVE to be a Hunter(Blue trait tree apparently most damage so others not welcome) or Rune-Keeper(Usually fire tree).  The stuff I just spoke of only matters if you want to take end game content seriously, I tell you this because otherwise you will not be invited most likely because people are, quite simply put, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the end game. I ♥♥♥♥ you not. They are the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you can imagine and i'm probably no exception.  Combat is fine but if you get to Rohan and mounted combat.... you will see the most sad and pathetic display of mounted combat to date. Apparently Horses are some form of ballerinas who slide on the ground like it's made of ice. It also seems to be massively server sided so it's the laggiest experience you will have to 'Enjoy'.  You jumped over a fence? Watch yourself warp back BEHIND THE FENCE OR WORSE DIE BECAUSE THE SERVER THINKS YOU'RE HACKING OR SOMETHING SO IT TRIES TO PREVENT IT BY KILLING YOU.   So in the end... ugh... I guess I can suggest this game if you enjoy grinding for Turbine Points, the story(only half of it) and just casually living in the world of middle earth.  I do NOT suggest this game if you want to: Enjoy end game content without being policed about your class/build/cosmetics because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hates the color. Enjoy large raids without having the frames drop to 1-15 because the game is optimized to run on single cored toasters that launch disks out like ninja shurikens. Do not enjoy picking hundreds of flowers during wartime just to get that one cool piece of equipment that is most likely garbage because it's not end game raid gear version upgrade. Want a fluid good mounted combat system that wasn't designed by someone whose brain has a latency of 500ms or even more.

However the worst part of this game is the same problem that Dungeons and Dragons Online has where many esential dungeons or grind spots are locked right from the start which is terrible and forces loads more grinding than someone witha money pass. And yet these areas are few and far between making only a few areas into massive grind fests.

LOL   Not everyone will enjoy this game as much as I do; but you'll never know until you try it. Some folks writing reviews say it's not fast-paced enough for them. Personally I like the pace. The graphics are great. In fact, some of the scenery is breathtaking and a close friend I met in LOTRO loves to just sit with me in pretty places and talk at times. He loves to say that there's more to LOTRO than just questing. That's very true! I've met some great people here!   There's a great deal of emphasis on team work in LOTRO which makes it hard to play alone at times. So you are actually forced in some circumstances to meet and play with others (unless you just want to run around and kill stuff haphazardly like one of my friends). That can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. I think this might be the norm for other MMOs but I don't really have that much experience with other games. I've played some other games, like Shaiya (which I really didn't like due to all the morons I encountered who loved to steal my kills) and I also tried Everquest 2 and RIFT (which I'm also not fond of as they were very confusing at times). I like playing with other people though. After all... isn't that what an MMO is for?? :p  You will also need to buy the various areas other than the four free ones: Ered Luin, The Shire, Breeland and Lonelands. That will provide you with free-to-play questing only up to about level 30 tops. Any other areas must be purchased with turbine points (TP). You can still kill stuff and gather crafting materials and even level; but you can't quest without buying the areas and that's where a lot of the fun is, right? You can only earn just so much TP in the free areas too. You can't earn TP in the areas you have to pay for unless you buy the area first. So if you're looking for TOTALLY F2P then this will give you quite a few hours in the free areas but then you'll get bored after that unless you buy stuff. That means either spending realy money or grinding for TP. I've met some people who haven't spent a penny of real money on this game -- they grind for the TP to buy stuff. However that takes a lot of time. If you're patient and don't mind grinding then that's not an issue for you. You can max out your toon(s) by earning TP in-game. I started out with that plan in mind but... well.... I have to admit I've dropped a fair amount of change on this game because I'm impatient. LOL  It's also much harder to play with only the three inventory bags you start with. If you want more bags you have to buy them. It's also harder to play unless you have shared storage between your toons. You have to buy that too. They've changed the housing now as well; so even though you can expand the storage on a single house now it costs a lot of gold to buy extra space. They're also pushing you to buy mithril now which you can't get in-game (except for some rare times when you get it for gifts to tease you into buying more). You have to pay money for that.   So LOTRO (like any other game) has it's ups and downs. I would still definitely recommend this game but.... as I said.... it's not for everyone. You won't know for sure though if it's for you until you try it. Just be prepared for addiction! :D",

The game's storyline is first rate however and there is a lot to do within Lotro's many zones. As with most MMO's getting into a quality/active Kin (guild) adds a lot of dimension to the game. Like anything else sometimes it takes doing some extensive homework and time to find both a Kin and a server to your liking, but I believe it's time well spent.   Lotro's quality control standards are lax in areas that developer's don't seem to feel are as important as far as the overall scope of the game, for example player housing and the way furniture fits and can be adjusted as well as surfaces and color variety. It's been a couple of years since some bugs and problems have been widely reporteded in Lotro forums and direct contact with Lotro GM's in those regards with no update fixes in sight. The quality of a game is in the details as much as anything else including fixing minor bugs in a timely manner.   On the plus side the game is very flexible for a variety of player budgets, anywhere from free to play to spending hundreds of dollars on subscription, expansions, perks, and Turbine Points (Lotro's in game currency). In theory you can over a long period of time acquire many of the above mentioned items except for subscription by saving Turbine Points from deeds earned playing the game on different characters in free to play. From a practical standpoint if you don't have either the time or a lot of money to acquire many of above mentioned you can find some compromises by both earning deeds for Turbine Points and being patient and waiting for sales (and there are some good ones) through the Lotro Store and/or Steam, particularly the expansions. A subscription is always gonna cost real money, but the 3, 6, and 12 months subscriptions through the Lotro store amounts to $10 a month which is cheaper then most other MMO game subscriptions for the same amount of time, not to mention there are occasional sales on subscription time on top of that.  If you come from a game like WoW, keep in mind this is more of a niche market and the amount of player support in and outside the game is far less then WoW's. So there aren't many dedicated websites in support of the game that are regularly updated. Be prepared to fly by the seat of your pants in trying to update to the latest/best gear for your class or finding an online spreadsheet to help you number crunch your dps, heals, etc, but then again maybe sometimes it's more fun to leave a little guesswork in the game.  Overall I'd rate Lotro 6 out of 10 points. I'd recommend it for the casual and/or budget player that wants a good game storyline with some immersion, but doesn't have high expectations compared to other MMO's like WoW or SWTOR in regards to graphics, quality control standards and player support.",

LoTRO has found a way to breath energy into the questing by giving them purpose and a general sense of importance. There are just kill and collect quests but instead of filling the leveling experince with them they are used in the form of tasks to be completed for faction rep which makes them completely optional. The biggest difference i've found is i was mind numbly bored as i quested or dungeoned my way to multiple 90s in world of warcraft, with LoTRO i am parterning of with random people who are out for the same goals as me and when we finish a fellowship quest or a group suggested area we can break up again without feeling bad because thats how its built to work. On the other hand if you want to quest with a friend that is entirely possible and standard features like quest sharing are added to by the ability to see who in your fellowship (party) has completeled which quests or who is available for the quests. I am by no means at the end game content for the current expansion but with atleast six expansions already released there is hours of main quests let alone optional side areas and storylines. The game is Free to Play and through hard work you could unlock everything in the game for free, or if you just want to experince the core game and end game content quickly you can pay for membership that unlocks all the content for as long as you remain a member. As a member you will recieve turbine points and earn even more, these can be used to unlock content permanently even if you decide to end your membership.

I advise players to get VIP, atleast once during their gameplay, the advatages are high, such as currency cap, unlocked traits and 500 turbine points per month.  ",

I got another mount and named it Bill. I traveled a lot and picked up goat poop in Moria. I never broke the free to play structure. The only things I bought were the expantions and Sam Wise pack when they were 50% off. Honestly the only to buy them as they are grossly overpriced. Really, I got hooked. See this game does something none other game does as well in my opinion. It feels like a journey.   Vast amount of land to travel over with one of the best draw distances I have seen in any game make this a immersive rewarding game. The visuals can look aged at times, but at others they look spectacular.   The UI is needlessly confusing at times, and LOTRO store is even worse. Really my biggest complaints about this game. With only one key but big complaint. The combat is turn based stradegy. Sure it has some openess to it, but not much. Though after awhile I have gotten use to it, but it is far from good. Its an old system of hotkeys and auto attacks.   Still there is enough here to make me want to play. Just the scale is worth. From one side to another took me two hours on a war horse. Running it would be like six hours. Making this hands down the biggest game world I have ever seen!",

The skirmishes and instances are amazing and i would also reccomend joining a kinship to make great friends. join fellowships if needed to complete difficult tasks and just for a bit of added fun. so yeah very good game i enjoy playing it but i love lord of the rings thats mainly the reason, you cant get better than this, its truly an amazing game, very beautiful graphics everything looks good from characters to landscapes. The community is very nice and helpful to anyone from new to experienced players so if you every have any questions dont be afraid to ask.

(im talking to you Bree) * The combat is a bit slow and clunky but you get used to so is not really a 'con' * You need to buy like every zone to have the skirmish/intances and the quest's/deeds for that zone (you can still level up but its more boring not having diversity)    Overal i liked the game but i will not keep playing because of the amount of time i need to spend to actual do quest's in diferent zones and stuff...

It still had the concepts I loved and more such as Epic Battles, where you fight alongside characters from the books and movies in the Battle of Helms Deep. This game is still getting updated and improved since then. One of my favorite concepts is Monster Play. Where you can play as one of 6 classes in Sauron's army against the forces of the Free Peoples. You don't have to level all the way up to [Max level] to play as a monster in PVP. You gain infamy in order to rank up and improve yourself by fighting against the Free Peoples and doing quests in the area.

Bends the lore more than a little to get some of the classes, but I mean you are playing as one of thousands of people all journeying sort of near Frodo and the Felllowship so a bit of bending was necessary.
