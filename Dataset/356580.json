From a story aspect, this game sucks you into the conspiracy of this dystopian society ruled by a secret society of shapeshifters. Tackling aspects of transgender topics head on, it delivers a unique ride into an unsual game premise with huge Bulgarian influences.  Also the soundtrack is sweet. Hint, make that available for purchase.",

Doesn´t feel like a 'cheap/poor' made indie game ;)  You don´t have to sneak &amp; silent kill all the time (+ it´s NOT hard and frustrating for gamers which don´t like sneaking games - for example metal gear...).  Finally a dev who has courage to use a trans/homo main character. There´re not enough games today which risk to do that. I really honor it. (I´m not trans/homo / but we got 2015 and it´s time for more tolerance !!)   ",

            "review_text": "2D platforming and shooting with stealth elements. I was sold on that description alone. And Aerannis almost works! It's a painful non recommendation.  I can't comment on the story because I didn't see it through the end. It's pretty confusing so far. I think it's trying to approach topics like prejudice and sexual identity.   Right! let's talk about the meat of the game. Action platforming is good. You got your shooting and jumping, a small variety of enemies to jump and shoot around. It's not too deep though, it gets boring after a while. It also introduces a human shield mechanic but it doesn't fit the action segments very well most of the times, as it's better to just shoot them directly. Except when you have to use human shields to open doors! that is pretty neat. It's like finding keys, but the keys shoot back.  I was looking forward the stealth mechanic but it's the most disappointing part of the game. It's hard to describe why it doesn't work because stealth is extremely delicate, and tiny details can make or break the experience. Considering they went for missions where you get insta-killed when they spot you, they should have been extra careful with it. The lack of visual cues to read the guard's patterns is one problem; They just turn around instantly. There is also no timer for the guard to go from unalerted to 'you're dead'. A chance for you to get back to your hiding spot and correct tiny mistakes, while the guard goes into suspicious mode or something. There's also the case of climbing stairs (door like stairs that teleport you to neighbor floors) that lead you straight to a guard. Guards also bug out sometimes, forcing you to get caught just to respawn.  Again, tiny details. That make the whole stealth experience is unfulfilling. It's made even worse when you get the run upgrade or, as I like to call it, the double-tap curse. When trying to move slow and carefully it's normal to tap the directional. With the double-tap curse you'll often find yourself doing quick runs in place. Not enough to actually run but enough to alert guards around you.  Then there are the bugs. I was actually willing to finish the game with the criticism above in mind already, but the game has the awful habit of bugging out during dialogues and there's no way around closing the game by force. All 3 times that happened to me made me lose a huge chunk of gameplay, as they are usually at the end of missions, before you had a chance to save. So, if you're already cursing at the game's imperfections, having to replay an entire mission because the game bugged out is a deal breaker for me.",

            "review_text": "First things first: while this could technically be a 'metroidvania', it's... really not, it's a shorter adventure game with some action scenes. You get a few upgrades, but we're talking count-on-one-hand territory here*. Don't head into this if you're looking for the undiscovered exploration jam of 2015.  Straight up, the highlight of this game is the soundtrack. I need to find out if it's for sale somewhere since it's not on-Steam purchasable, because  dang  is it the standout star of Aerannis. The game itself isn't bad, but it falls into that small-team issue where there's some jank, in this case related to the controls not being quite as precise as you'd like, doubly so in stealth sections. If, like me, you just don't want to put up with that: Cheat Engine + exact value search for a Double variable, your max health is 15. Lock it and stealth sections turn into 'sections', disabling the auto-fail.  I enjoyed the game and while I occasionally winced at a line, nothing stood out as slagging on one of the myriad real-world perspectives it covers. The ending was a little less so, but frankly, it's not the first video game to abruptly turn metaphor into something that falls flat, and it's not game-ruining, just kind of '...really?'. I enjoyed it and will forevermore consider it the weirdest possible Half-Life 3 we could ever get, given that this basically takes place in City 17 + some extra factors.  * It's entirely possible I missed some, but my final count was 6:   Gun speed, wall jump, dash, stickybomb, bomberang, and defense+ from a shopkeeper.

((Edit, the following lines are an intended feature, I was just an idiot and backtracked through the apartment building instead of taking the elevator shaft down.))  However, I can't recommend it as in the Mac version of the game, a platform required to leave the first stealth mission becomes intangable after you complete the mission. This prevents progress beyond that point, as there is no way to get out of the building otherwise. ",
