            "review_text": "This game is an adventure / FPS hybrid. You switch between the modes as you explore the strange Oddworld landscape. So you would do some jumping puzzles and then blast away the enemies with your crossbow. The crossbow is powered by live animals which you pick up as you travel along. You can pick up stingbees that rapidly fire at the enemies or spiders that web them and many more. The mechanic is a bit bulky because you constantly have to switch between 3rd and 1st person. The world itself is beautiful with various landscapes from forests to deserts to icy tundras and mechanical fortresses. It's a very fun game but a bit frustrating sometimes even on normal difficulty. The battle before the final boss was pretty ridiculous with enemies chain stunning you so you have no chance to survive (except luck). I would still recommend this. 7/10",

            "review_text": "Oddworld: Stranger's Whrath HD is a first/third person game. You are a bounty hunter who works his way up from capturing and turning in wanted criminals for Moolah. The reason why is becasue he needs an operation quickly but it costs 20,000 Moolah. You play a character simply called Stranger who uses like ammo to trap his enemies which is the only way you can turn them in.  + The game looks great and live, throughout the game every place looks great and diffrent which keeps you intrested. The option menu is good since there is alot of diffrent options for the grathics so most computers can run the game.   + Storyline works well and since you will get paid differently depending whether you capture them dead or alive, but of course its harder to capture them alive bt you will get paid more. You also get to choose what bounty you want to go get which give you more freedom.  + There is a good length in this game since its around 10 hours on easy, 12 hours on medium and 15 hours on hard. This a good amount of time, you will get more time if you try to bounty everyone and explore the surroundings thoughout the game.  + Stranger's Wrath can be a hard game at times, first few hours are fine but then it starts getting alot harder and you will die alot at some points in the game. Its at a good level of difficulty since its not too hard that you want to give up, the game will make you want to get though the hard parts which makes it very rewarding when you get though it.  + The controls are good and work well with the keyboard and mouse, you can also change the keys to what ever you would like which is great since they can be changed to your liking. Only problem is that Stranger's Wrath does not have controller support.  + The music is great, it fits perfectly and does not get boring or repetitive. The music mainly plays when your exploring or when your fighting bosses, this works well because it really fits in with the mood of the scene. You can get the soundtrack from the Oddworld website for free.  + Having Steam Achievements and a good story means that there are some Replayability in the game since you can go back to complete all the achievements or just play th egame again. There is not much but there is enough.  + Stranger's Wrath is ten years old now. The HD edition is now five years old. It still holds up and looks good to this day. I dont think it will look outdated in some time now.  - The PC port is bad! Really bad. Most computer will be able to run the game but the main problem is that the frame rate is always really low... I get around 25 to 30 on a R9 280X. It you want the game then be prepared.  - For some reason Stranger's Wrath HD is really buggy, the original game isnt but this is. There are lots of bugs and some of them are game breaking. Since they dont update the game anymore you will have to put up with it... Real shame is I love the Oddworld franchise.  Overall I would say Stranger's Wrath HD is a great and fun game that most people will like. Its original and diffrent which is whats great about Oddworld. I rate Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD an 8 out of 10. I would recommend the game if you can put up with the port and the bugs.",

Well let's start with some aspects of the game   First stop OddWorld never released a game with the combat they literally just created 'OddWorld: Munch's Oddysee' wich was the first OddWorld game that had a 3D animation with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ camera movement, carrying on Stranger's Wrath has a great camera movement, a good combat engine wich you can use the map and it's resources to do it stealth or go aggro all the enemies and hope you don't get killed, when I was playing the game I got really stealthy and decided to hunt the enemies one by one until I reached the boss and I was on hard mode so it literaly made my life easier I din't wasted a bunch of ammo and got captured the boss in ease, the only think I don't like in this game it's the short story it took me 16 hours to finsih the hole game in hard mode thats how short it is, and they are never making a new game about the legendary steed 'Stranger' since they are focused giving a epileptic seizure to future generations with 'OddWorld: Abe's New 'N' Tasty' and the up comming remake of 'OddWorld: Abe Exoddus' wich will literaly make me epileptic (hope not, well they abuse in the lightning again) and forgot to metion that Oddworld was going to relase a game with engine of Stranger's Wrath but with a few changes called 'Oddworld: Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot' got canceled due to the collapse of Oddworld Inhabitants, but has they got a new team now I know it will be released and people will love the studio wich I still love since I was a child.   ----------------- BUY THIS GAME GIVE SUPPORT TO THE ODDWORLD STUDIO! ------------------",

Now i may of forgotten alot of the stuff i learned when i played the game years ago but hey i don't care, strangers wrath is one of those games that after you'll beat it you put it down, and go out and do other things for a while like read a book or take a walk ( if you're a casual) that or just play a bunch of other games that kick-â¥â¥â¥, and then after that, you can go right back into the odd world universe and love it. Well at least i can anyway  And for those who haven't heard or even played any of the odd world games, let me tell you about this one. Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feel  But in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat company that trys to make the same thing, their â¥â¥â¥ is getting blown out of the water by this game.  But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.  Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers",

Now I'm kicking myself for not getting this sooner.  There is a lot to say about the game now in HD. One the anmation and detail level is fantastic smooth. Sounds are great as well as the smak talk from some of your ammo. Add in the Oddworld sense of humor and boom you just can't turn your nose up at this game.   The michanic of using the different types of ammo to disable or trap you bounties is fantastic and so much fun. I played for the first hour and that's was it I had to make a review becase you have to play this. The ability to flow from FPS to third person was great too becase you could come at your enemys in different ways alowing you to snipe, stratigic or just power your way through.

            "review_text": "Oddworld: Strangers Wrath is a third person shooter with elements of platforming and exploration.   The plot is relatively simple at first but gets progressively more complex and facinating the further you go on. You are the stranger, a lone bounty hunter who uses small animals as ammo in order to capture bounties. You are gathering all the money you can get your hands on in order to get an operation of some kind, one which will allow you to 'survive'. I wont spoil anything else about it, but the plot is well worth the price tag.  The gameplay is simple enough. You have a crossbow which can hold two types of ammo at any given time, each ammo type has a limited capacity of shots before you need to restock, and each one has a different function. Most are lethal, while some are none lethal, which is handy considering you get more money bringing in enemies alive. When you use the crossbow you enter a first person perspective and aim down the sights in order to bag'm and tag'm. However, when your outside of the third person perspective you go into a third person perspective where you can move much faster and do melee attacks, plus jump around and explore with impunity. To progress, you must go from town to town, completing all the bounty jobs in one town before you move onto the next, each one has an entirely unique level dedicated to them and different mechanics you must overcome in order to capture them. its much easier to kill them, but you get half the reward money. You can also buy upgrades in the town if you feel so inclined, or just punch the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the chicken people for a while.  Around the final quarter of the game, it changes drastically, i wont spoil why, but suffice to say there is no longer any real reason to not kill enemies anymore, and it stops being about the individual bounty heads your collecting and the entire focus shifts. Now, while i understand why this occurs in the game, this sudden shift of tone rubbed me the wrong way, as i was enjoying the whole 'find and collect bounty' aspect of the game, but i would consider this a personal issue instead of an actual fault.  The game handles rather well, with only a few times i had to fight the camera (which happened maybe once or twice). The difficulty of the game does have a tendency to jump around however, one minute its very easy, the next its frustratingly hard. This can lead to some minor fits of rage, but rest assured these are only a minor aspect of the game and can be plowed through with skill, patience and a disregard for capturing the bounty alive.  Graphically speaking its an old game, but it still holds up quite nicely, it still has a certain charm to it and is very much of the PS2/XBOX era. The music in the game isn't particularly noticable, and when listened to on its own it has a few stand out tracks, but on the whole its not special, it does its job and doesn't distract or subtract anything, only adding to the overall tone.  Strangers Wrath is a classic and a very satisfying hybrid of first and third person action, i would recommend this to a fan of shooters or plateformers. fans of the wild west might enjoy the setting and plot of the game. really though, i would recommend this to anyone.",

It's one of those few games that perfectly blends first-person and third-person, and has eccentric, interesting characters suitable for a good movie. There's also a twist halfway through that completely changes the game. It's very bold, and it might make some gamers angry, but I've never seen it in a video game before and it really spices up the story. Even the dialogue is consistently humorous and provides an awesome western feel.",

Unlike the previous games which are puzzle/cinematic platformers, this is a cocktail of an FPS, third-person brawler, platformer, and open world game (The open world is nothing large, but its competent). Above all that though, the main selling point of this game is the ammo. In this game you're not pumping lead into some random-â¥â¥â¥ mercenarys, you're planning each move and thinking of fun ways to kill the many outlaws in the game. This is because you have bugs and small creatures for ammo, which can do a ton of things, like distracting enemies with the very annoying chippunk, or wrapping outlaws in webs to keep them on the ground for a easy capture with the bolamite.   The game also has a fantastic sense of humor, as per usual with the oddworld series, and a lot of boss fights (Although a few are questionably designed). As for story, Its not as complex as the stories in the main quintology, but its still good, and it provides a good amount of lore for people who are interested in it. (Like me)",

You use a mix of third-person platforming, and first-person shooting. It mixes very well. You spend most of the game fighting outlaws as a badass bounty hunter, but there is a still an amazing story to go along with it. It is also full of surprises. I recommend this to anyone that loves playing video games.",

The next thing I realised was that I had forgoten that when they ported it in HD they did not add any custom button layout options at all... That honestly disapointed me a bit, because you either have to take your hand off of your mouse or ASDW to switch ammo types with the arrow keys... Nah, no, that's not where that goes. It should all be on the left side of the keyboard. On a controller, reload should be the left-most button(X), melee is the right-most button(B)-- everyone knows this.",

So yeah, I highly recommend this, and as far as less adult but still gritty goes this is the game for that, a hardened somewhat dark world with that oddworld sorta semi-brutal style but still relitively kid friendly.

When I saw this game debut way back when I was a teen on the verge of manhood. it filled me with such excitement, the very concept of this game. at the time I THINK 'Gun' was around and I absolutely loved that game. This looked like that with a fantasy twist.   So, to the game - It opens up with a cutscene, our Hero is collecting some critters you see him afterwards setting them up on the ground nice like. Orderly. he then procedes to cover them with brush. A few seconds later We see a big ol'fatty chasing something through some wooded brush, vines everywhere. Its quick. Hes consistently popping off rounds with his blunderbuss, an just as consistently missing. Eventually we see what hes chasing is actually our hero, a Feline like bounty hunter. Got the raspy cowboy voice an all. Leather vest, Cowboy hat. He quickly turns the chase around onto the other fella chasing him. He leads him to where he had laid those little critters he collected earlier. Turns out he was just leading the guy on all along. he had a trap waiting for him. Nasty little buggers jump and start gnawing on any part of that bubblin fool they can sink their teeth into. Our Hero, procedes to use another spider like critter to than ensnare his catch. Wanted, Dead or Alive. Luckily for him, The Hero, Known as the Stranger. Does not use firearms.   This game is basically Dog the Bounty Hunter with Furries.",
