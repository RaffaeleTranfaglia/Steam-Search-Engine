            "review_text": "Airport Madness 4 is an arcade-like game about airplane management that is, at best, alright. If your standards are early 2000s flash games.  You are put in the role of the airspace controlling whatever it is called(I can't really remember the name of the job) at an airport and you have to manage your aircraft to let them land and take off without making them wait too long or crash into eachother.  And that's about it. You'll occasionally find yourself getting a helipad added to your entrusted airport, and in level 1 even an extra runway, but it doesn't change or become more complex in any way after you figure out the basics.  It's a simple concept with decent replayability, but it is incredibly repetitive and shallow as far as a full game goes. It's just a slight bit more than what would be a succesfull flash game one would find on games sites, but not much more than that. It seems to be about the same size as one would expect from a flash game, and has about the same animation(Very poor explosions). A price of 10 euro is then very, very steep for what you get.  Coupled with the simple gameplay comes a few issues. The resolution is tiny(The steam preview pictures? That's almost full size, almost.), full screen mode will stretch everything if you're on a widescreen monitor, and your area of operations is tiny to the point where you can not even see the aircraft before they're starting their landing on some of the maps.  To say it's an amusing way to spend a few hours is correct if you're a fan of the game and have absolutely nothing better to do. But to call it a full game and worthy of 10 euro? Not even close. If steam had a rating lower than 'no', this would be the one to get it since it's definitely not worth the price. But if you can pick it up really cheaply it is probably an idea to give it a shot. Maybe at a 95% sale or something similar, but if it's for anything more than one euro you should avoid it like the plague",

You need to pay attention to the each aircraft's performance characteristics to time departures and modify the speed of landing aircraft. You can also send craft into a holding pattern, where you can control their direction and send them to a new runway choice, or you can send them off the screen to ease the pressure for a small monatary loss.  I wish you could modify the speed or direction of the departing helicopters.  The game play doesn't have enough depth to interest me in purchasing other games of the series, but I am happy I purchased this game.             ",
