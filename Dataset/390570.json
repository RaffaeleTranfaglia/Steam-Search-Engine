I like to be challenged but this Math based game proves to be too much! On a positive note there are over 500 of these puzzles, cards and achievements.  You are provided with 10 numbers ranging from 1-999; the range increases as the puzzles get more difficult. You have to highlight these numbers either red or green in order to make these 2 groups 'sum' equal each other.   If this information doesn't get your blood pumping, don't worry that's normal. There is no tutorial so come into this one with the mindset that these puzzles won't be breezed though. There is a problem solver website that can help you once you have been mentally defeated.   Itâ€™s worth $1-3 based on the length. Only buy this if you like hard math based puzzles!     Accidently Reviewed",
