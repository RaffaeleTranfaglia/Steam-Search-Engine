            "review_text": "Whilst this is clearly a 'first game made in Unity' it's got ambitions way beyond the usual tutorial and slapped-down assets we've been seeing of late.  That said it is EONS away from being a commercial-quality/ready-for-the-public game. There's loads of stuff going-on, most of which is poorly explained and what IS explained is arguably even more obscure. It's glitchy and clunky and every single model clips through every single other model and effects fire randomly and moving stuff around inventory/quickbars is almost entirely potluck based (equipping things has an RNG!!) and so much more...  Props to whoever put this thing together - no lack of ambition shown, but it's NOT a game ready to be sold to people by any means...",
