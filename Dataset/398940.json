            "review_text": "I recommend it if you can get it for under a dollar.  I beat the game itself in about an hour and a half, and getting 100% of achievements afterward in about 30 minutes.  I feel like the developer intended on a thriving community to add content to the game after the fact, but a clunky UI for the level builder made me not want to make any levels beyond the one required for the achievement.  Controls seemed tight at first until I realized there was a bit of recovery after jumping, making segments with repeated jumps frustrating. You have to pause briefly before attempting to jump again or you'll keep running forward. This caused a few cheap deaths for me.  If you can beat Super Meat Boy, you'll find this game too easy and too short.  Me, I liked it enough, but I wouldn't have paid full price. I'm still giving it a thumbs up though because I'd like to see more from the dev. He had a great idea, it just fell a little short. It's an above average game, though.",
