To do that, you need to turn commentary on. This commentary came straight from the developers from Valve, like Gary McTaggart, Robin Walker, and Chris Green. After playing and listen to what they had to say, I understood the process of making a game a little bit more. As far as graphics and level design go, I would give it an A.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

I can see that this level/game is not linked to the Half-Life which is fine by me. What I find alot about this, is that there is a great amount of puzzles to solve to finish the level, which I find quiet difficult, but at the same time, quiet good. I really like the end of the level, shooting down an enemy helicopter, now thats a good ening to a level! ;)  Valve, please keep making more games. Also what I recommend doing is that if you ever are gonna make Half-Life 3, you should release a tech demo, so you can show us what its like, but try not spoil the story, if there is one, of course.  9/10",

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is more of a sightseeing tour than an actual Half-Life game. The game is supposed to take place sometime during the 'Highway 17' chapter of Half-Life 2, but it really dosnt fit in.  Half-Life 2: Lost Coast introduces nothing new to the series, exept a heavily modified Source Engine. The water is more reflective and Gordon's pupils ajust to lighting. Thats it.  The game looks more like Counter-Strike: Source that Half-Life 2.  Standalone, you pay $50 for a 10 minute experience. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is $30 for the main 2 hour mission, plus side missions. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has one mission, and one mission only. Do NOT buy this as a stand-alone game. Buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes (if you havnt already) and you will get this for free. You will also get Half-Life Deathmatch: Source and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Three free games for the price of one and two expantions? Thats a good deal.  Half-Life 2:Lost Coast isnt a bad game, its just unfairly priced. If anything, it should be free.  2/10",

With everyone patiently awaiting the arrival of the highly sought after 'Half Life 3', some of us are forced to take more drastic measures in getting our 'Half Life' fix. We're forced to replay the original 'Half Life' games, yep all three of them, even 'Opposing Force'. We're forced to replay 'Half Life 2', yep every episode, and eventually, when there's nothing 'Half Life' related left to play, we must play through this early tech demo of a removed section of 'Half Life 2' redesigned to showcase Valve's HDR lighting.  But in all seriousness, 'Lost Coast' is a twenty minute demo where you basically walk around admiring the world's surroundings. And when I say admiring, I mean admiring. Seriously, I must have taken in the scenery for over an hour while walking through this demo. And I especially loved the area with the staircase where you get to see Valve's fancy new lighting software and how it mimics what the eye sees in real life. It really is quite impressive, and still is, seeing as how I played through this demo in 2015; 10 years after it's initial release.  You also get the chance to fight some bad guys, solve a very simplistic puzzle that honestly took me way too long to solve, and shoot down a black helicopter (yep, those black helicopters) with a rocket launcher. The real reason however to play through this demo is to get a chance to hear from the developers themselves with the added in commentary. Aside from that it's pretty much everything you'd expect to see while playing 'Half Life 2'.",
