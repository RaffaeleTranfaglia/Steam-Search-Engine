            "review_text": "Ok, it turns out I am a God awful driver and it took a while for me to get used to the very simple controls, but once I did I loved this game. Chasing those ghost cars of other players is incredibly addictive and in my case infuriating. Really loved the build your own track function and can see myself spending way to much time playing with this.   All in all I would highly recommend this game to anyone.",

            "review_text": "This game is a celebration of the competitive spirit, and nothing more. It is not a sim by any means, and you're better off looking elsewhere if that is what you want out of Musclecar Online.  My guess is that you're looking at this because it's in some bundle and you're wondering if it's worth your time, and I say that depends on your competitive spirit. If the idea of perfecting your lines, shaving off hundredths of seconds, just to beat that one dude who seems to be topping the list every day, then this is your kind of game. A casual player need not apply because they simply won't accomplish much.  So what is Musclecar Online? It's a top-down keyboard-controlled racer (which means you need to learn how to engine brake if you're going to do any good here) that features a daily user-made track - and yes, that means they can be quite crazy - with leaderboards for 10 or so different cars, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, though some feel closer to each other than others. The key point here is that, like Trackmania, it's all about your laptime. Fastest laptime wins the day.  At first, you will have access to maybe one or two cars and a handful of 'coins'. This is in-game currency, so no worries about any extra charges. These coins are used to unlock other cars, but more importantly, their variants as well as the tires they run on, and believe me, if you want to be in the top spot, you'll need to know exactly which variant and what tires you need to run. Placing a decent time will earn you a silver medal, a great time will earn you gold, and the top spot will earn you an achievement, bragging rights, and possibly the chance to wave your virtual fiddlestick around. Each possible position silver and above will net you more coins, which will allow you to buy even more cars, more variants, and even a fancy helmet (totally cosmetic). For the ultimate prize in coins and prestige, win the 'daily overall' spot by being the best in the most car classes. I have no idea what the actual prize for that is because there are TWO SPECIFIC dudes who play this that will make life difficult for you haha  At any rate, it's easy to sink lots of time into this game if you are chasing the top spot because you will need to set the fastest times in the most car classes possible, and that means gradually unlocking all of them and running them on the track for that day. This can take a significant amount of time if you become obsessed with it. You might constantly get that feeling of, 'I can shave off just a -little- more time on the next lap' and round and round you go (protip: turn off the automatic-end-run option or you might mess up your mojo).  Your opponents? Other people from around the globe. I constantly see players from the UK, France, Sweden, and many more. By 'see', I mean you're not just out there on the track alone; you are racing ghosts (they can be turned off if they are too distracting) and those ghosts are constantly mocking you as you cross the plane just a hair behind them. The game even features an in-game messaging system so you can send a note to your favorite opponent telling them how much you loathe their face and wish to see it plastered on your car's grill.... *cough*  tl;dr - this is a 2D trackmania and it's incredibly competitive. If you feel that need to run that perfect, perfect line and edge out the win against other peoples' ghosts, you will find yourself diving down the rabbit hole. What I thought would be a filler game quickly turned out to be a small obsession and the community is great.",
