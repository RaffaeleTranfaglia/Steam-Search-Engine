            "review_text": "INTRO This review covers a lot of the political repercussions of the poor launch reception but also discusses some key game features and their improvements. The nature of this review can cause quite a controversy so read at your own risk.  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR IMPROVEMENT The game is much more likely to achive a greater improvement if the development team is motivated to improve it. Negative reinforcement alone is not a good motivator at all and in fact can leave the person or people in question unmotivated to do anything. I feel that if we want to see good improvements on this game we should give more support to the good features of the game but in so we must not forget the bad ones either.  GRINDING Well the game has a lot of grinding as do other games and the grinding can be fun, but if you are just playing the game to complete it, then the grinding becomes the main objective and it can become very boring, if you take your time to explore and scan creatures and appreciate some of the good ones then you can expect to have a nice evened out experience.  SIZE OF THE GAME The game is big, very big. The game consists of more planets than you will ever be able to set foot on so there is that but at the same time this is just kind of an illusion as you are going around from planet to planet, eventually you will realise that there is not a huge amount of variation amoungst the plannets. But, there is enough to give you that illusion if you let it, of course you can nit pick and look really closely and break the illusion but you are only doing that to yourself, take it like a picture best viewed from a certain distance.  EXPLORATION It is no lie that No Man's Sky has a veriety of means to produce novel situations to the player, this is wonderful and really helps drive your onwards, the creatures that you discover can be very different from one another. However, you need to take this with a pinch of salt, it can't be easy trying to populate a game with all kinds of new creatures when the game is as big as No Man's Sky. There is a wonderful video that explains how the creatures in No Man's Sky are made up, I recommend taking a look at it if you are interested.  STORY The game has an objective but also has freedom, the 'main' objective (if you want to call it that) is to get to the center of the universe, yes you can do that but you can also take your time in doing so, that is how I have played it and I am enjoying myself doing so, you can really immerse yourself along the way and enjoy the game as an exploration.  SPACE TRAVEL Who does not love space travel, and no mans sky does it wonderfully, I can fly down to a planet and blast off from one with no loading screen and I can explore a vast collection of star systems and fly wherever I want, the game does this brillinatly. The only drawback from this is the inavbillity to fly close to structures and terrain with your space craft, this really breaks the illusion of flight and makes it feel like you are being bubble wrapped and your hand is being held, maybe I want to crash into the ground!!  GROUND COMBAT The combat in the game is some of the weakest combat I have experienced in gaming. However, the combat is there, it exists and I am happy that they put it in the game, the ground combat at least gives me some sense of danger whilst you are roaming around on the ground doing your thing. However the ground combat is really easy and does not pose much of a threat, this could really do with a tweak.  SHIP COMBAT Well, the ship combat in the game is a different story, I personally like the ship combat with a pinch of salt but yet again, the inabillity to fly close to objects and terrain ruin it so much, I want to fear the ground and other objects as I battle it out in my ship, I want to use them to my advantage as I take risks by flying close to the ground so that my enemy struggles to keep up. Besides this immersion breaker, the ship combat is awesome and does what it says on the tin. However, it is few and far between, you are not going to be finding a lot of combat unless you go out looking for it and even when you do it can take a while to find it.  CRAFTING &amp; INVENTORY Of lord of lord, the crafting and inventory system needed a lot of work and work has been done. The inventory system was lacking to say the least and the crafting was simply combing two objects to make one, It felt very tacked on in the game. I am sorry Hello Games but this is one of the things that I couldn't stand in No Man's Sky and it needs an overhaul. I will however give it props that it does work and it does what it says on the tin so I can't complain too much, it is not somthing that will ruin your time playing No Man's Sky but sheesh, it could do with a little touch up.  VALUE A lot of people critise the game for its price and I completely get that, I do see how the game could be a bit too pricey, yes it is pretty costly but I am keeping my hopes up that with more and more updates the game will become worth the original money that I payed for it. The first update marks a great step towords a great game and I have faith that the updates will keep on rolling out  NOTE ON SUPPORT I know that the advertisement was really missleading and I know that the game was over hyped by a lot of people but if we keep throwing insults at the game just for the sake of it and just falling into confirmation bias, then all we will see is a crap game. Try not to be driven like a sheep with horse blinders on and make your own oppinion of the GAME and not the ADVERTISEMENT or POLOTICS that run with it. What we have here is a good game, its not the best game by any means but it is not a bad game at all. I have really enjoyed my time in No Man's Sky and will continue to play the game. Be unique and make your own oppinion of the game and don't follow the mass of people that are slandering the game for political reasons alone.  NOTE ON NEGATIVE REVIEWS The majority of negative reviews are unfortunatly the product of something called 'groupthink' (look it up) Where a large mass has come together and followed majority view and slandered the game without any real thought, in fact a lot of the reviews you will see have only reviewed this game, so you can see by this that they are just jumping on the band wagon and giving it a negative review. HOWEVER! before you go crazy on me, some of the negative reviews, in fact a LOT of the negative reviews highlight a lot of really helpful things that the development team can take action on, these are constructive reviews and well explained personal oppinion and I respect them.  NOTE ON POSOTIVE REVIEWS The positive reviews on No Man's Sky are lacking and I am making an inference based on the key points I have discussed that this is a product of 'The bystander effect' (look it up). Of course by saying this I am making the assumption that Hello Games is a victim in this and I know that will spark a rather large proportion of controvecy so please think of it as, this: Everyone is attacking the development team and no one wants to help by giving an alternate view, in fear of being attacked themselves. Yet again, I erge you to make your own oppinions.  TLDR The game itself is fantastic, I love it and will continue to play it, I have outlined a lot of the reasons as to why the game is seen as such a negative thing. The game has a few immersion breaking features but can be overlooked, as an exploration game its brilliant, as a survival/FPS, it lacks.  Overall I will recommend No Man's Sky not only to people that are new to it but also those that have purchased it before the update, give it another go and please make your own oppinion of the game, don't fall into 'groupthink'  P.S I value all others oppinions and I am open to constructive criticism of my review. Respect people and people respect you.",

I was okay and cool with the initial release and was lucky that I've never had any crash like other user reported.  The gameplay itself was okay, the game managed to keep me busy with exploring and discovering new creatures, techs, multitools and ships.. for first several hours.  After a while, I suddenly already had discovered all the multitools and ships tech, and it was only matter of time to discover the materials to build them.. Discovering techs suddenly became boring. Multitools and ships came in different shape.. but with no different feature. Pistol-like or rifle-like, I couldn't feel any difference, what matters only the installed techs. Same goes for the ship, whether is big or small, it was really doesn't matter. The shape purely is for cosmetics, and I was not satisfied with this mechanics.  What keeps me up to play NMS, was purely because I like to explore, and the gameplay itself wasn't that bad. And now with the recent update, NMS was getting better. With survival mode, base build and what so ever yet to come, I guess I'll play this game regularly again for a while.",

            "review_text": "As someone who was onboard with this game from the onset, I never jumped on the hype train. Did Sean Murray choose poor phrasing/lie about a couple features in the game? Technically yes, given what was released. But as a developer who has worked with a number of publishers, what does and doesn't get cut when time becomes a factor is usually out of the developers hands. Maybe Murray blatantly lied, but why would you lie and then try to right your wrongs, when you already have the money??? Because everyting he stated was probably on the laundry list of features planned for the game. ♥♥♥♥ gets cut... thats a reality of game development.   No Man's Sky is exactly what I expected it to be. An infinite universe that you will never be able to even come close to exploring even a single percentage of it. Is there a lot of repetitiveness to the gameplay? Sure there is. Did anyone expect every single planet to be a completely unique experience? Do you actually think that if you went out into the galaxy you wouldn't find some repetitiveness/likenesses the more you searched? I for one quite enjoy the (mostly) relaxing nature of this gameplay. Cruise around literally anywhere and discover another variation of procedurally generated animal X. It's fun. Is it $60 fun? That's an opinion only you can make for yourself.  The addition of the new features in 1.1 is a step towards fulfilling the unattainable expectations generated by the public. I hope Hello Games continues to build upon this truly unique and beautiful game.  Unforetunately not many folks will actually read this, but the sheer volume of negative reviews on this game are completely unjust. This is a feedback vaccuum where 95% of people read something and then just spew the same garbage rather than actually formulating their own opinion.  Buy it. Play it for a couple hours and decide for yourself, and then refund if you feel it's even 1/4 as terrible as all these reviews would have you believe.",

The environments have been fun to explore, creatures fun to find and stories developed worth sharing with friends. I am 7 hours in at the time of writing this and look forward for future hours spent in the game. There's something oddly charming about flying around this vast universe filled with planets to explore that take real world time to get to. I was at first a bit confused and upset with how long it took to get from plaent to planet, seeing as how a minute of doing nothing seems like a long time to warp from one planet to the next but I quickly found the down time to be relaxing. Something akin to taking a nice drive through space on autopilot, enjoying the act of looking at the slowly approaching planet, wondering what tentacle hentai monster awaits you next. Despite coming to terms with space travel though, I still think the game could do with a slight bump in pace. Sure you land on big planets but that doesn't do me much good when the good stuff is all really far away on foot. Pacing complaints aside I look forward to whatever future updates come our way. My favorite prospect would be being able to invite a buddy into my base and then launch off to go exploring together, kind of like virtual hiking with friends. Such a multiplayer element would be awesome. Also, the modding community for this game has already made some neat stuff, if we were to get some official mod tools we'd be in business for a long time coming!",

Just started playing this again. So I was on Survival mode.  Leaving my first planet was really challenging experience, but very very very fun.  It took many skills, efforts and time. Timing and distance managements is crucial (to control and use life support and protection properly), and enviromental awareness is important (height can kill you, monster can very annoying now, damage is higher than normal, starter planet have very harsh enviromental, every common materials now become so important because you going to use it VERY VERY often due to high consumption per charge.)  . .SURVIVAL EXPLORATION . It took a hour to leave my starter planet. but luckily I survived it. So on my 2nd planet, visitted after reached my first Space Station.  I went there to refill fuels and stuffs.  Usually this kind of planet is the boring type planet we often spent time less, You know the type of planet where its all dusty, no creatures, no cool floras, no eye popping stuffs. It still death gorgeous due to geographic landscape of dusty and the planets on the sky. if you check my artwork, there was an eclipse I encountered. which is cool. . But for survival mode, its becoming more crucial for self improvement. Because it have zero dangerous creature. sentinel not aggresive, common materials much more easier to spot, no weather.  I haven't try base building yet in Survival mode, but I realize that, it will become so handy to live and explore in this mode.  . So far, this is the best mode for No Man's Sky. It shows really much what it is , not just explore mindlessly like sheep, it challenge you with something, it gave you a purpose and stuffs. . 9/10 for letting everything destroying me.",

The game runs much smoother now, with some lag and frame drops every now and then, but nothing I can't handle(as I already played 20 hours at under 20fps). The game itself runs much faster now for me now, graphics set fairly low, but still looks nice to my standards(originally a console gamer).  The gameplay is fun, I'm not going to complain. I play games to adapt to them, and have come to enjoy the crafting system. Limited space in inventories drives you to get better equipment or increase space so you can hold both materials and your upgrades.   Exploring a new planet is great, finding new animal species is interesting. Some might complain about certain buildings looking the same though. All planets I've visited so far have been very different, and I look forward to exploring more.  I can only hope for improvements in the future, but as it is now, it is a fun game. I am a sci-fi nerd, so that probably helps!",

            "review_text": "Hello there,  I preordered this game in Feburary and was hyped for it since 2014. Many people started interpreting things into the game, that have never been mentioned from the devs so the danger of Overhype was real.  First of all I want to point out that this game is for people who enjoy exploration, discovery, gathering and crafting, e.g.  If you are one who can play Minecraft Survival vor 20 Hours straight, you will probably like this Game.  I personally really enjoy the game so far, it is like a arcade version of Elite Dangerous or the X-Series.  Most of the mechanics are present, but for example getting money is not that grindy.  Which is really my type of game.  The space travel is really nicely done, not a bit boring like in other games, your ship is really fast and the planetary gameplay is a classic exploration game.  But I rate the Gameplay 4/5, because of one really annoying thing: Sentinels I can understand, that Senitinels get angry, when I steal things or break Stuff or destroy the environment. However there is one extremely dumb thing, if you kill an aggressive creature, which is about to wreck you hard, the dang Sentinel Force gets there and finishes the job. -.- --&gt; Self defence should not be punished in the game.   Moving on.  Many people complain about performance Issues, for example jittering or framedrops. I think it depends very much on your software setup, sometimes the game has short lags for me, but hey its release day,  Which game of the last years was bugfree of Launch? Especially from small studios.  One Thing that would be really nice is if you could adjust the level of detail, for the render distances. (when things start to spawn in, because when you're moving very fast close to the Planet everything just drops in right in front of you.  One last complaint: Some of the tooltips are really annoying (build grenade launcher xyz) would be nice if you could deactivate the tutorial after playing some whil and only leave story tooltips.  We will see how the game develops in the future.",

The gameplay itself is a but confusing and should require some kind of tutorial, especially for all of us who just spent 59.99 to get thrown into the mix. Some things that didn't come to mind right away included holding down the mouse button for a second or two to trigger a selection vs. just mouseover and click.  Then it was off I went to start farming materials for ship systems, I get the gathering part but I don't get the hovering drones that harass me, I shot one by accident and apparently that introduced achievements and more drones which start to appear more frequently. Shooting them down is repititious and boring and seemingly impossible to dodge their fire.  Gathering materials is interesting and discovering new things but its not so straightforward what to do with them and how to upgrade things. Mostly I learned trial and error. Many people will say suck it up but when it comes to an expensive game that promises alot and not being a diehard nuts and bolts guy I want to know something about how to do things. Let's face it, crash landing on an alien planet in my ship wearing an environmental suit means I already know these things, yet I don't really because it feels like baby steps.

Although it's not without problems/bugs, I personally feel the good outhweigh the bad. Overall score 8/10 (in my humble opinion).  Let's begin with the negative (as I have experienced them), since that is the topic of a lot of reviews.  - Sometimes crashes on startup from steam, however usually works after 2 or 3 attepts.  - Drastic fps loss after 2-3 hours of gameplay.  - Quite a bit of fiddling with the settings to get decent frames per second. Although I am on an old   750ti so I can't complain too much.  Here are some things that you should be aware of, however not necesseraly negative.   - You start with very little information and have to figure things out on your own.   (Personally I enjoy not knowing at first)  - A lot of inventory management because of limited space before you find ways to upgrade.  - No multiplayer. It would be a fun addition to the game but not necessary imo.  The good  - Exploration. The fact that you really have to search every nook and cranny to find tech and   upgrades gives you that feeling of accomplishment.  - Story. While it does not give you much to begin with, you find little bits and pieces you have to  put together in your head or even write down. It's the reason I'm still on the first planet after   17 hours. (I'm thorough to say the least)  - Graphics. Although not perfect, it looks a lot better than other procedurally generated games out  there.  - Making units (money). You can earn from trading, uploading discoveries and tons for 100% discovery  of a planet.   - Stable. I personally have never had a crash ingame, (only startup).  All in all I find this game very fun and addictive. Just when you're going to log off and go to bed, you say to yourself: 'what's over that hill'... Good bye sleep.   Even though I strongly recommend this game, don't take my word for it. Do your own research, check out youtube or twitch to find out if this is the game for you. At a steep $60 you should be sure.

I see reflections of that world in No Man's Sky--a procedurally-generated galaxy that is really an analogue for life a lot closer to home.  I became interested in this game when I saw a trailer last year. I did not follow it much beyond that, and as such, I did not jump aboard the hype train. Because of that, I was initially bewildered by some of the negative reviews. I've since read more about this, and I can understand the stuff that isn't just knee-jerk negativity without rationale.  Here is everything you need to know, good and bad:  1. The worlds are beautiful. I have spent about 45 hours so far discovering new places, and even the most forbidding worlds have an astounding beauty to them.  2. This is a very old-school game. It has the feel of King's Quest or The Black Cauldron, two games I enjoyed thoroughly when today's complainers weren't even a gleam in their father's eyes. There is no instant gratification here. There is no instant-win here. There is travel and exploration, gathering and building. Which means...  3. There is no instant gratification here. You aren't going to be able to outrun the game. You aren't going to be able to shortcut this to any meaningful extent (and doing so would be missing the point entirely). You aren't going to be able to bypass the laborious process of amassing enough wealth to let you buy a ship that allows you to amass more wealth. Like life here on Earth, you will put in the time and the work, and you will build something for yourself. And then you will build it bigger and better, bigger and better, bigger and better, ever onward.   4. This is not (really) about combat. Yes, there are space battles. No, they aren't spectacular. Do not expect the rush of battle, the thrill of victory. I went after some space pirates a few times, won some, lost some...and haven't really sought out battles since then. It is more of an afterthought than a primary element thus far.  5. The flight controls are not intuitive. Coming from flight and space simulators meant I thought I knew how I would handle ships in this game. That turned out not to be the case. The controls don't quite line up, and the ships come with a 'flight assist' that actually makes things more difficult. You cannot fly close to the ground, so get rid of any ideas of stunt flying on a gorgeous planet, or doing loops through giant arches, etc. Landing is done by pressing a key to engage an autolander, but you cannot look down (or left or right) to ensure you are properly lined up with your desired landing spot, so you'll miss it 9 times out of 10. I have found this component to be frustrating.  6. The UI has an annoying habit of making you perform a 2-second-long click on everything. This is only a mild annoyance until you are in combat and need to recharge a weapon. At that point, fiddling through menus that take two seconds to activate can become a bit more problematic.  7. This is not a $60 game. The developers have done AMAZING work with their small team in putting this package together. And it is indeed a pretty package. But we have essentially paid for the process, not the result. The procedural generation is fantastic, and works quite well. I'd gladly have paid $40, or even $50 for this title. I believe a lot of today's angry reviews stem from this being at the same price point as something like Skyrim, and I think that upset is justifiable.  8. Buy this game if you like games like SimCity, Cities:Skylines, King's Quest, ARK, Space Quest, Myst, Riven, Farming Simulator, Chess. Games where things take time.   9. Do not buy this game if you like Halo, MMOs, Call of Duty, Titanfall, Overwatch, Checkers. This is not a fast-twitch game, and it will not excite you.  10. If, and only if, you meet the above criteria, I recommend this game to you.   This game is NOT for everyone, and my review is based solely upon your ability to know what you like before making a purchase. As for me, I have had a lot of fun exploring new places. I've watched incredible animals appear from caves and fight with one another, and then with me. I've seen beings that look like pineapples bounce away from me as I, in turn, ran away from something that looked like a dinosaur horse. I've seen underwater outposts, tears from frightened aliens, Grand Canyon-esque cliffs worth photographing as much as traversing.  Know what you like, and know what you're going to get before you buy. If you like the exploration more than the battle, the building more than the result, then this is for you. And I would recommend it to you.",

The only problem I've had was the game not running smoothly at 2560x1440 -- while *simultaneously* streaming. Switched to Borderless Fullscreen, 1080p &amp; turned VSync off. Runs smooth after that.  As far as the gameplay goes, it's exactly what I expected of the game. Keep in mind I've been ignoring the vast majority of information outside of E3 trailers, etc, because I prefer to get my info while playing and not allowing the hype to get to me. With that in mind, here are my feels:  Pros:  - This game is GORGEOUS. I love the fact that its not the standard browns &amp; greens, and its genuinely a beautiful game. - The variety of things to find is magical. The creature combinations are NUTS. I found a planet that had FLYING EELS FOR BIRDS. - The survival aspect of the game is light enough that its not nonstop fixing/healing on all planets. Some require more work and more gear to balance, but its background for the MOST part. - The crafting is pretty cool. - If you don't have enough Exosuit slots, look for Outposts!  Cons:  - The Procedural Generation *can* show itself after a few planets, but the devs are showing themselves to be working on new content. - Some of the space flight is unyieldly. When this happens, you can slow yourself down to make it a bit easier to control.   Last Word:  The game is exactly what I expected it to be after going in with minimal hype. If you enjoy exploration &amp; survival games, don't hesitate to give this one a chance. :)",

While some worlds can appear similar, it never gets boring when you enter orbit as the sun rises.

You repair, craft, explore, discover places which you can rename and upload them, there are worlds of all kinds and sizes, some with mostly water, barren, dead moon, lush and tropical, different sky colours, it is a very pretty and calm game. You can attack pirates, discover alien technology and outposts, buy, sell and trade raw resouces or found items, follow the storyline or go your own way and for that it is an enjoyable game.  Minor spoilers to follow:  However ship creation is non-existant so far, puchase, find and repair one on a planet...yes, upgrade shields and weapons and engines etc, but you cannot design your own or add inventory slots so far.  After 65 hours I have yet to find an Atlas Pass V.2 or V.3,   Don't sell your Atlas stones as you need ten of them and if you die from pirates and have them in your ships inventory they are gone, if this happens go to options and reload the previous save, I did not know this at the time.   If you sell an Atlas stone you get 60,000 units or so however if you want to buy one it is about 2,300,000 units or more.... very irritating as you cannot start a new game if you lose your Atlas stones. You only get one game, there is no 'start a new game' option.  The generated planets are interesting and varied but the longer you play the more similarities you find on every planet in every system. Especially the platinum plants, zinc plants, I've found crystallized gold which is odd and some creatures that looked like a random generator just rolled the dice a few times with feet, legs, body, head, ears, etc and looked out of place, but a lot of the creatues are indeed interesting and cataloging them is funish but pointless except to upload them and receive a completion bonus of credits.  The story is great, I found myself spending hours hunting down language stones, ruins and monoliths to learn the 4 different languages but again after 65 hours I have learned over 600 words and can pass most verbal tests but sometimes you wonder exactly what is being said as only about 50% of the conversation is translated for me now and don't get me started on the Atlas language as you don't learn much by the time you begin to interact with the Atlas stations and have no idea what it's really saying to you. You will find monuments that teach you a word like, 'murder' and then a little while later you find one that teaches 'murders' or 'murderous'...that feels cheap and it has happened more than a few times, there are many text errors, one I keep seeing is when you access a plaque and it says,'the knowledge of the Gek hannel into my mind' or something... but 'hannel'? Really? Ugh....  Eventually you will find that the only thing left to do after buying a better ship, upgrading your exosuit(I have 37 slots and counting), upgrading your multi-tool and upgrading your ship and following Atlas' path is to head towards the centre of the galaxy (I am in the Euclid galaxy)and it is a loooong way, I expect to take another 20 or so hours of only crafting warp fuel, warping as far as I can and through a black hole which helps a little but breaks something on your ship every time and then repairing with elements that do not show up is very time consuming.  Don't get me wrong though, this game is unique and if you know what you are getting this game is excellent and hopefully thay release a giant patch and some dlc to give more to do and more achievements.

With the 30fps cap in place I was getting like 25fps, so if your getting ♥♥♥♥ performance then that could be something to try. Other than that, it's a great game in my opionion. There's so much to explore, so many different resources and secrets you can find. The world is beautiful. Yes, I know the textures are mushy (even on high), but the vibrant colours and vast landscapes more than make up for this. The fact that it's only 2.5GB in size is also appreciated as my interent is slower than the devs were at launching this game (2.5mb/s down, 300kb/s up). Yes, BITS.  Here's the bottom line. The game is a great survival/exploration game, but it's not for everyone. Before you ask, this game WAS overhyped. Like every other hyped up game is. I don't really notice perfomance issues because I have a 980ti and 4790k, but I can see there are some performane issues from other people's comments. These will get fixed, I'm sure of it.

Then I got it on sale with the 'foundation update' and it was AMAZING. I think it's a good thing that I did'n rush to buy it and my experience wasn't spoiled with high expectations and any problems that the game had at that point. I absolutely loved it. It looks awesome, sounds even better. It's endless (of course it's going to become boring at some point. But I'm more than 30 hours in and still enjoy every last bit of it). It's so atmospheric and immersive. I love the soundtrack. 65daysofstatic is an awesome band. Abesolutely love them.  Procedurally generated terrain is great. Mountains, caves and bizarre rock formations on some planets form beautifull scenery. I sometimes find myself wandering about just to enjoy it. Creatures are also great. I love all the giant dinosaur-like beasts with deep rumbling voices and flying-balloon whales. Didn't think documenting all the creatures on a planet could be so much fun. It's also a cool surprise for me every time I come across some classic science-fiction reference. Even the game title itself sounds like a title of some book by Isaac Asimov. I really looking forward to future updates. Awesome work Hello Games! Keep it up!",

Too far ahead of abilities.   This can lead to something similar to a burn out where you try to achieve too much in a short amount of time.

So far, I'm enjoying the game quite a lot, and I think if you were lucky enough not to start it with the lag and bugs so many were complaining about during zero-hour launch, you'll enjoy it too...just be prepared to sit back and experience at the game's own pace.

The early parts of the game are simply a tutorial. Not the entire experience. So why is everyone giving a not recommended? Because they expected to have this massive groundbreaking game in which they can do anything. This is a process. It's a slow going process in which new ideas are being brought into the gaming industry. This game is the most advanced in its time, even if it's not the most diversified experience. Creatures are all different. When I say different, I mean actually different. Not colored differently. But physically different. Even they it had been stated that planets would all have one biome, there is still a large amount of diversity on planets as well. Caves seem like a different world when compared to the surface. Some planets have storms. Some are non hostile. What people are expecting is more than even your own actual universe can provide for you. Half the planets in out solar system are made up of gas. Different colored gas. Ooh, so diverse. Stop expecting Hello Games to make this amazing product more than what your own reality can offer. Yes, I very much recommend this game. People have yet to even scrape the surface of possibility. Play a few hours. Experience what the devs want you to experience. Don't jump on a bandwagon.",

This game is like if darksouls and Warframe had a baby.  You see the beautiful seductive eyes, but as you scan the rest of whatever this abomination is you realize how messed up it really is.  Beautiful vista's. Exploration.  Unchallenging survival/fights and the best of all which comes primarly from warframes genome. THE GRIND   Following the game's natural railroaded pathway you will discover this game is only about grinding 5 or so resources. To go to system after system doing THE SAME THING.  new suit technology or weapon technology is worthless. So is ship technology except for the most vital which is an upgraded hyperdrive that allows you to jump further allowing you to skip a 15 second cutscene. EVERY.SINGLE.JUMP.  The only time my existence was ever thretended in this game legitamtly was during space battles where enemy ships have PERFECT ACCURACY. You have to open another screen, during combat while also loosing propulsion, to recharge your shields leaving you HELPLESS.  Space and ground combat is not worth it, yields no rewards except the satisfaction of blowing up space hill billies.  The game is relaxing for like 30 minutes after that you're doing self assinged tasks that waste time in the greatest sense of the word. You know why?  There IS NO MULTIPLAYER. Its not a matter of finding another player. There literally is NO multiplayer right now. WHY BOTHER finding the best of everything when there is nothing to show for it except a wasted time   Darksouls at least had challenging combat with its barley existant storyline, and semi grinding of resources that was at least fun. Warframe has at least fun, fast pased combat, with an every expanding storyline, worldverse, and updates where what you do or get you show off. Where the new things you get matter.     This game has nothing except the ability to finally break the horizon of a planet and fly to the stars. The worthles stars filled with poop-tier planets that have nothing to offer you.  I have finished the game, its finally message is relavant. ------NO SPOILERS--------    Why bother exploring when your destiny is already set?

Unclear equipment names make it harder than it needs to be to upgrade. Theres a well hidden loading screen when you warp between systems. Overall a feat of excelence given the scope of the game and the team size. \\TL:DR  I've really been enjoying NMS since I booted it up. it started out super slow but once I got the hang of what to look for it's been a riot. In my play time I've learned a few things that are only a minor irritation for me but might be more so for you. First off there is a loading screen, it's very well masked but it's there. When you change systems and go to warp it's a shiney lightshow that is a load screen, you can tell because about half way through your windows close (if you have them open) and the game becomes unresponsive (for me it's about 10 seconds so no big). Going planet to planet trying to scan all the different things is kind of fun but super irritating when you have one animal left and can't find it. Some method to pinpoint one at a distance so you can go scan it would be wonderful. Worth good money if you can catch em' all to.  My only two major gripes thus far however is that when you get an achivement theres this wide screen border effect that shows up and prevents you from say.. defending your self against a poorly timed sentinel attack. It's super annoying but i'm sure it will get fixed. The other is the equipment names, I have no idea which is better beam cooler sigma or beam cooler Tau. The text is similar but there nothing to indicate if one is better than the other. I can infer one is better by the resources it needs but by how much I haven't the foggiest.  As for people complaining about the multiplayer rug pull, I'm pretty sure that's going to get patched right quick. Most likely it was a desynch problem between the two players who met up. I mean it's a team of 15 people working on a game with epic scale, yes they charge full price but they gotta eat, pay rent, etc. while they work on the bugs so I'm totally cool with that even if i end up hating NMS tomorrow I'm glad to vote with my wallet to have more game like this made.",

I haven't logged much time yet, only due to the annoying lagginess of the game, but from the 2 hours or so that I have, I have enjoyed myself in the game. Some people seem to miss the concept that this is a survival game. Which is not really true. It’s as much survival as Minecraft is, where all you have to do is make sure your health and shields are able to handle some time out of your spacecraft. Planet similarity is to be expected with this type of procedural generation, so if you were expecting every planet to be unique in every aspect, that’s just the wrong idea. The real point of this game I believe is using the economy, resources, and other beings you find along the way to aid you in reaching the center of the universe. This is about farming resources that are in demand to buy upgrades for your ship, figuring out what types of planets yield what resources, and deciding what kind of player you want to be, whether you are a pirate or explorer. Despite your views on this game, I believe that Hello Studios set out to deliver an exploration game that put into perspective the scale of the universe, and I believe they delivered on what they promised. So give this game a go, and if you don’t like it there are steam returns for a reason. Happy Exploring!",

I have spent 20 hours in one star system - and I have met the Korvax. I have learned much of their language, helped them out where I could, and earned their trust. In return, they are giving me fantastic technology, and revealing an incredibly deep story.  The Korvax have already sold me a hyperdrive. I haven't used it yet. There's so much more to find out in the system I'm in.  This is a game to take slowly. Experience, absorb, understand. It's very complex, and a lot of fun.  Oh, and the PC controls are a nightmare.

You have to balance between; upgrading your suit/tool/ship with mods or saving that slot to get more loot. It is a system I've never seen before, and I like it. Other might not. -Really well done exploration game. This game won't appeal to people expecting a shoot'em up game. This just isn't what this game is.  Cons: -Silly click and hold to click UI elements. I get it to craft or use an objects, but it should really be turned off for most elements. It is something I got use to but is still clunky -Flying on the planet doesn't feel right. I want the ability to fly through arches or under floating rocks, even under water.

I have several other friends playing the game, and none have complained about it.   Having said that, before buying the game make sure your system is up to snuff. About 8 hours was spent getting the proper drivers on my computer before I could play. Also the game was over hyped, but now it is being over hated. It's probably worth closer to 40 than to 60. I expect and hope that this is the frame work that Hello Games will enlarge on.   Watch some game play on line. If it intrigues you its worth a shot.   Pax,   Lewis",

Also setting the game to border less windowed mode seems to fix any alt tabbing problems   At the beginning my game crashed before it would even open, i had to add a .dll to my system32 folder (which for most probably sounds a bit sketchy, but it worked), if you want to know if that'll fix your problem, launch the game from its .exe, if it gives you an error regarding a missing .dll, that should fix it.   I played the game on the PS4 for about 25 hours this week, before it released on the PC. The PC version looks better, runs WAY better, the controls are easier to use, the menus seem like they where made to be used with a mouse, i've already sold my PS4 version, with no intention of playing it again now.   Game play wise, if you like exploring, mining, nothing/no one to hold your had and lead your way, you may like this game. Will you $60 like it? I sadly cannot tell you that. The combat/space combat does leave a bit to be desired (this was considerably worse on the PS4).

I know I've only scratched the surface of this game.  There is no competitive multiplayer which to me is a plus. I want to be able to just chill in space without having to worry that some player has me lined up in his sites for no other good reason than for the lulz.  Coop multiplayer would be a nice addition but honestly, so far, the game is fine without it.

Update 1: An update came in just as I wrote the review and it bumped the graphics performance significantly. I do seem to get noticeable lag if the connection to the servers go down.  Update 2: After a few hours into the game, I'd say it is for the most, playable. There seems to be a memory leak issue, where the whole game gets sluggish an hour or so in. A restart helps with that. Sometimes I also get launched straight out into space when lifting off from a planet's surface. The game itself is quite fun if you like exploring and gathering, and once they add some kind of base building it will be a solid game.

There seems to be a lot of negativity towards this game, but I've put down a little over 10 hours myself so far and I'm absolutely blown away by what such a small indie dev team has accomplished.   I'll start off by saying I never let my hype before launch get the better of me. I knew not to expect some fantastical dream land where everything I ever wanted in a space exploration/survival game will exist. Especially not by some small dev team.   Now, I understand people are getting their panties in a twist because the game isn't running too well, or maybe not even starting at all. Still doesn't justify planting a negative review right off the bat because 'that'll show em'. I on the other hand haven't had any huge issues. I've got all the settings maxed out, FOV set to 100 on both, and FPS set on max. I run a GTX970...So nothing too highend these days, but the game runs fine for the most part with some hiccups every once in a while. The one exclusion to this, is on planets with LOTS of water. The game chugs along for me when vast amounts of water is in sight.   In any case, these issues and more will most likely be corrected in the coming weeks with Nvidia's Game-ready driver updates, and the updates being pumped out by Hello Games.   I'll leave this off with a quick list of Pro's and Con's off the top of my head.  Pros: -Stunning colors/visuals. -Great variety of ships &amp; multi-tools. -Plant and animal life seems very diverse. Haven't run into things too similar to each other yet. -The lore/backstory between the races in the game, along with atlas itself is pretty interesting.  Cons:  -Flight controls (Mainly on planets!)...This has to be the biggest for me. It's pretty clunky. I wish ships could hover in spot and go up and down instead of being forced to move forward all the time. This makes it hard to land where you want. You can't even really point the ship downward to even see where you're going to land. This definitely needs to be addressed. -Galatic map. While cool initially due to seeing the scale of the universe/galaxy in this game...It's very barebones and pretty painful to navigate. I'd definitely like to see some improvement in this area...Maybe even a way to search for a specific system?   The state of the game in terms of optimization and such could be under the Con's section, but I believe that'll be dealt with in the near future and as such doesn't deserve to be put there.   I'll edit this if I feel like there's something worth adding or changing as I progress through the game.",

In the game settings Turn V-Sync of for crying out loud and change max fps to what you prefer (i chose 60). 3.

I understand this is an exploration game and those features don't make a lot of sense in this style but this is the age of survival base building games and those features would go a long way to making this game a more well rounded product with a wider variety of playstyles. I can see where this game is going and have been having a lot of fun playing what is there which is why I can recommend it.

Granted I don't play it as much as my friend does but I find it to be a good game when you're bored of your other ones.  This game is pretty visually intense so just be aware of that buying it. I personally still feel I am lagging a bit at medium visuals on everything and anti-aliasing off. Most other games on the other hand I don't have that problem with. So be aware that depending on your system and graphics card, it may not be as beautiful as the trailers, though I still find a sense of beauty in this game.  If you're also like me, you like having an objective. I mean I usually free roam in games but having the option of something to put my efforts into is something I hold dear. This game will give you pretty much nothing. I've had two 'objectives' so far which was repair my ship and get credits to get a hyperdrive (which I will add I have not done). Otherwise the only objectives you'll have are self made ones. So if you do play like me, again be wary of that fact. This to me doesn't make the game unplayable but it does give me a harder time trying to stay in the game.  Overall though the game isn't that bad. I was expecting most of the things that I listed on here and I might have sunk $60 on this (which for me is a lot of money) but I don't regret it. I'm enjoying my time there and I plan on continuing with the game into the future. My only hope is that they will add some sort of multiplayer so that I can play with my friends. If you're borderline on this game I recommend grabbing it. It's good when you're bored and it's fun to experience what it has to offer. Worse comes to worse just get a refund through Steam. But I have certainly been enjoying it thus far.",

It is amazing buy it and enjoy if you have not over hyped yourself and you love exploring and space you will really love this game!  PROS: • Whole game is 2.5GB download! • So massive that you will be exploring places no one else in the whole world has been! • Great survival elements • Moderate learning curve • Dialog is awesome! You get to learn alien languages but in the interim the game gives you a description of the interaction and then you are given choices and based on the race of the NPC depends on how you should respond with rewards for a job well done! • There are no quests like “go get me that bowl of soup on the table” that is 2 feet away. • Tons of options for spaceships • Several ways to get spaceships, items and upgrades. • Different dimensions of exploration • Still hidden features that after 14 hours I am still learning new things about this game is pretty awesome. PRO/CONS: • Caves are awesome and tempting but entering them could mean you never get back out. (Pro because that is pretty epic, Con because well you could end your game this way) Cons: • When searching for wildlife on planets it can be near impossible sometimes to find all species I spent a solid 6 hours trying to find the last animal I needed on a planet before giving up and leaving. • Buildings on the polar caps tend to be in walls or partly in walls so you can enter them but you cannot interact with everything. • If something is underwater, you should probably move on. • I am really bad at shooters so the little flying creatures are impossible for me to scan I have to shoot them down first which is almost just as impossible for me.  So at the end of the day yes it has bugs. Honestly what game doesn’t when it comes out. Everyone loses their mind over nothing. It is still a fun and amazing game I cannot wait for more content to keep pouring out of this game. Realistically I can see getting about 100 hours into this game and then without adding any content I would likely start to get a bit tired of it. But 100 hours of gameplay for $60 awesome! People are out here complaining and yet you have games that you can easily beat in a few hours coming out with a $60 price tag and the same people don’t even bat an eyelash.  I hope you pick it up and maybe someday we will come across places each has explored but only maybe. Enjoy the game for what it is not what you expected it to be and have fun with the future patches! Thank you to the dev team for an amazing game and the I am sure countless hours that have been poured into it!",

Last night I had a gaming session of seven hours and only once I needed to restart the game. It was after five hours of play time when suddenly my FPS dropped from 70 to 7! No other glitches or performance issues. Game itself is highly addictive... 'Damn I should go to bed. Maybe if I just quickly peek over that hill...'  There are a few things though I found somewhat annoying or that might have been made better. Game is very quick to start, that's good. But throwing the player on to alien world without suggesting any kind of graphical setup is a bit harsh thing to do. You can't tune your setting until you allready are in the game. And what makes this really annoying is that after you change your settings, you need to restart the game. And guess what? That also changes the planet you are on! Ok, optionally you can play a while with default settings so you get your game state saved and start fiddle with your setting after that. Another thing is that I guess most of the FPS issues are caused by those default settings. If I recall there was a FPS lock set to 30FPS by default. So by default there's VSync and this external FPS lock restricting your FPS.  User interface is nice. It's not as good and intuitive as I expected but one can come along with it. It does do everything that needs to be done and after a while I got used to it. What felt strange at first was that if something took time to get ready you just can't click an action button and wait, you need to keep that action button pressed to get things done. But that's just a matter of getting used to that.  Since No Man's Sky is an indie-game and no other game can offer same feeling of loneliness and vast space I would say it's a 10/10. If it would have been released by any of the big companies I'd say it is 7/10... I'm sure that future updates will make NMS even better experience. NMS is not really a cheap game but I guess it's worth of it's price tag. If you like fast paced action shooters then stay away. If exploring and casual shooting is your thing... Then this game is a MUST!  Ps. Did I say feeling of loneliness? During my 7 hour session last night I saw three flying starships in the game? Dunno if they were NPC or PC but that was a bit of a downer ;)",

The gameplay does not change so if you do not like the game within the first 10 to 20 minutes, you will not like the rest of the game. There is 'no' story, and 'no' multiplayer. I say 'no' because any discovery YOU or someone else makes is uploaded and if an individual comes across your planet they can see that you discovered it. As for the story it is about finding the cener of the universe, nothing more or less. how you get there is up to you. The main point of this game is to explore. I have spent whole days on planets just exploring and looking for new words, or ways to make money. One major improvement that the developer could make is to improve the flying. You can not crash into a planet, but hitting an asteroid is ok.... because they prevent you from self damaging your ship flying low is not fun, and feels weird.

I've already played it some stupid number of hours (going on, what, 18 hours straight? I planned my weekend around it already and my GF has cloistered me into the office where my gamer funk won't bother the more civilized of the home.)  If you're on the fence about buying it, wait until Hello gets it in front of a real QA team and cleans up the rough edges. This is not a release-quality build of NMS. This is a 'Steam Early Access'-quality build. I realize they probably couldn't do Early Access due to whatever weird contract they had to sign to suckle the Sony cash, but really this needed to be in front of a much larger audience before a 'real' release.  It has a lot of compatibility and interface issues (see the /r/NoMansSkyTheGame subreddit for the comprehensive ♥♥♥♥♥fest). If nobody at Hello is foolishly married to the interface, they'll probably hear the hundreds of thousands of voices yelling at them to stop with the 'click-and-hold', slow-as-balls fade-in menus, intrusive achievement screens (that can get you killed), silly puzzles you can't do over even though in many cases it's completely unrealistic (for example being unable to access your inventory when offering something you have in your ship would be the correct thing to do), and unskippable, immersion-breaking cut-scenes peppered every-freaking where.   They say it's a chill game, but when I think chill games I think easy-to-use UI, for example Banished -- The UI responds to you quickly and gets the hell out of the way. NMS does not have an easy UI. It's fiddly as freaking rubik's cube. That is not chill IMO.   All that said, you will be awed by beautiful renders of amazing worlds, even if you have to play on the lowest possible graphics settings (like me with my GTX660M). You will learn by trial and error what works and what does not work. You will find yourself immersed for hours on end in a mindblowingly large sandbox in which you have a choices between one of three different narrative guides or pure open sandbox play. If you liked freelancer, elite, et al, and prefer a game that is more procedural sci-fi novel with some narrative depth rather than the Elite: Dangerous flight simulator, this game was made for you.",

I'll try to provide a more honest look at the game.  No Man's Sky is about exploration and survival. The bulk of the gameplay consists of wandering around with a camera and gathering resources. A lot of reviews stress the resource angle, but it's actually quite easygoing if you want it to be. Just gather two or three different minerals as you go to keep your equipment charged and you're fine.  Along the way you'll learn bits and pieces of alien languages, which helps you interpret what merchants on orbital outposts are trying to say. These guys will buy your junk, sell you new stuff, or even offer up their ship for you to purchase. It can get a bit grindy if you want to buy an expensive ship with money from resource gathering, but you could do the same thing through exploration if mining bothers you.  On planets you can discover flora, fauna, and various locations. Some locations have a scanner that may lead you to other locations, and you have some choice in this. Scan for local transmissions or check out an abandoned manufacturing facility. Up to you. Sometimes you'll be confronted with a choice relating to the aliens who left artifacts lying around. If you choose right you'll increase your standing and get a bit of lore.  Visuals and sounds are abstract and strange, colorful and awkward. Don't expect the highest fi, because that's not what they were going for. It's more about feeling like you're in a place far from home and far outside your experience. In this NMS has succeeded, but it'll be lost on many. The game doesn't hit you over the head with its purpose, so if you're used to that it'll seem more than a bit aimless. That's half the fun.  NMS bears more resemblance to Flower than to CoD or GTA. The challenge is subtle and the reward is newness rather than imaginary points. It's not for everyone. I often toss a game out after less than an hour of play not because it's bad, but because it failed to grab me. NMS grabbed me from the start. Averaging my ratings returns a 5/10, but that's not accurate because things like combat are only a tiny part of this world.   It's worth your time, if only for the novelty, but PLEASE wait for a patch or two so you can actually play it. I'll agree with the critics that this should be priced lower. If the premise of NMS interests you, you should look into Rodina for a cheaper alternative. It's unfinished, but it scratches the same itch.  Anyway, right now I'll say the game's a healthy 7/10.

Unlike that game, this one was able to hold my interest for longer than an hour. This is a game that lets you explore randomly generated planets. Some of those planets may seem the same, and others will surprise you by being amazingly different. It is a grind, but it makes it feel like you are really traveling through the stars. Having to stop on a planet to recharge the ship's engines. This is a chill out game more than a competetive game.  I will say that the game isn't as optimized as I would have liked, but I was able to plow through the FPS hits, sound bit rate, and play.   Edit: (This has been patched and now it runs even more smoothly than before)  I only wish that they could have added more to the game. The game is good fun for 50ish hours, but after that you will be hard pressed to experience something brand new. It has so much room for improvement that I wish they would have added more because they have created an amazing universe full of potential. They can definitly improve the replayability. I would like to get more hours out of the game.   In summary, No man's sky's hype is what hurts people's impressions of the game. Leaving them with mixed thoughts. Causing them to dislike the game instead of seeing the game for what it is. This game is for people wanting a chilled out game session. Not for the Mt. Dew, Dorito consuming inmature power gamer.

It is very important that you immediately disable V-sync and unlock the fps (easily done in the game's options menu). From there, I believe you could run the game on max settings and still receive a smooth 60-180 fps with a somewhat high-end card.

This is not your standard game. It's got a strong personality and vision, and has not necessarily been made for everyone. It's an exploration game first and foremost, with a dash of survival (but not that difficult) and some space combat. It is NOT a twitch FPS - heck, it's not an FPS at all. There is a reason why your 'weapon' is called a 'multitool'.  2. It's a game made for the long run. Don't expect to be able to shoot your way out of space pirates right off the bat, or flying to distant solar systems after 5 minutes. You have to view it as a slow game and appreciate the results of the algorithms. If you think you can't be bothered with that, don't buy the game. But honestly, it's great to play it that way.  3. The game ran perfectly well at max settings from the get go for me. My rig is pretty standard : windows 10, i5, gtx970, 8gig ram. I keep my things updated and I am not at all an expert.  4. For those who would need that, the game will have more features in the coming months, if we're to believe the devs, and I do. I've been following the devs and the game for the last year and a half, and in my opinion they delivered exactly what they said they would. What people read in the last weeks or months in thousands of badly researched articles is another thing.  I can't figure out why the steam users are so steamed (see what I did?) I don't want to judge anybody, but it sure looks like some people are reacting far too strongly, and far too quickly.",

The game play is smooth though, the transition from running to flying to space travel is great and everything feels natural.    I am however disappointed lack of AI. Most of the NPC's you encounter have dialogue, but most dont make any noise when they talk. Just lips moving with text appearing on screen. This is 2016 at least put beeps and boops in for their voices. Also there are alot of times where it looks like you could make dialogue choices in responce to some of the NPC's but you only get one response. And the Ai for the animals is pretty minimal as well. Not much that makes them interesting, just something to scan and move on, farming them is tedious and I havent gotten anything super rare from them yet.    I could go on and on about this game good and bad. SO FAR I LIKE the game but by no means am I happy with a 60$ price tag. Its a big game but it feels incomplete.   Performance wise I have had 0 issues with the game at max 1080 settings, at 1440 it looks beautiful but there is a bit of studder even dropping the settings.   i7 4990k with 2 GTX 770's and 16g ram.  I do find the game crashes from time to time when I enter certain areas. Cant figure out what exactly but one time if I landed on a trading post it would crash and another time entering a crashed pod crahsed the game over and over.

The level of saltiness surrounding this game is hilarious. I've been following the development of the game from early on, and can't recall any time when the game was marketed or sold as something more than what it turned out to be, which is a fantastic space exploration game. I can only assume that people thought it would be more than it is, and got salty because their own expectations let them down.  If you can't afford $60 for a game that you can never 'complete' in your lifetime, or the combined lifetimes of every person that buys it, then you shouldn't be spending that amount on any game at all.  Only gripes come with the bugs - some occasional clipping, and the engine seems to make my beasty PC struggle with the upper tier of grraphics.

As a background I am a gen x gamer so I have more patience with long slow games than most younger Millenial gamers. Back in the 80s and 90s we had fewer game choices and those choices included simulator games that took 100s of hours to play out. This game should last that long hopefully but may not in its current form I have my hopes.  What is this game you may ask when compared to all others? First off lets start with what is it not! It is not your typical Michael Bey video game that pollutes 99 percent gaming these day with nonstop action and explosions and spamming bullets randomly and no long challenging exploration/discovery type things to achieve. There are no meaningless kill streaks and empty prestiging like in that bloody cod franchise that extorts you for 120 or so dollars a year ever year.  This game is a fantastically large has you exploring beatiful worlds and pimping out a spaceship and gear which takes some effort. Dont fear though there are exploits and cheats for you kiddoes too impatient to enjoy the game though. This path is available for those who are accustomed to Michael Bay 'win' the game in a weekend type of games.  This game deserves 60 dollars not for the fact that it is fantastictally executed but for the fact that the rest of gaming is just so unambitiously poor in what it sets out to achieve.    When people bash this game for bugs and missed features and yeah a several blatant lies from pr people, it is still better than the rest of gaming these days. So yeah it gets an A+ in my book, but that is grading on a curve against the rest of the gaming world which is mostly worried about releasing the next +1 version of a shooter that is just a mod of last year's shooter.  I do hope hello games tries to meet their oversold features, puts in more variety, makes the game harder for the long term player with challenges and rewards or else this game will just be a blip to be honest. Once i have my gear and ship pimped out I just dont know that the already easy gameplay wont be even easier. This was a problem I had with other open world sanbox games like minecraft too though.   You owe yourself this game if to just prove you are not a drone headed off to your next generic shooter game on a map that can be traversed in a minute of gameplay. The 60 dollars is worth it to tell the gaming industry to stop putting out 1 dimensional garbage on tiny shooter maps when compared to the fantastically large size of no mans sky.",

        {
            "review_text": "I don't usually do reviews. So this is more of a recommendations list for what needs to be patched, to make this worth the pricetag.  No Man's Sky has a procedurally generated universe, full of wonder and strange animails and largely samey looking locations. There is little striking variation, especially in the things you actually interact with.  Despite encountering three different sentient alien species so far in my relatively short exploration of the game, all the tech looks the same. All the bases look essentially the same. The ships even look surprisingly similar.   So on to the dot points: - Fix the achievements. You are doing them wrong. Achievement should be something aspired to, not something that gets in the way and slows down the game. At least offer the option to minimise the alert, so it just pops up as a text box in the bottom corner. Having the entire screen narrow and your HUD obscured is a pain. Also, please make them a little harder to get. An achievement for everthing I do in the first hour? A little much. I can manage without the constant applause.  - Make the ships different. Getting a new ship should include some change to the basic stats of the ship, whether power supply or armor or shields or speed. Currently it is only the number of inventory slots available. Everything else is completely ignored. You essentially get a new ship so that you have a bigger bag to stuff things into.  - Fix the inventory system. Things needs to be stackable. Having a single pearl take up as much room as 500 units of iron is beyond stupid. And having two pearls not be able to be stacked, means two pearly take up as much room as 1000 units of iron. Which is just... dumb. Have a limit on the stacks, sure. And maybe add a tech so that you can store them more efficiently. But it makes collecting things from your exploration actively discouraged.  - Fix the tech system taking up space in your inventory. Perhaps split them out into two separate inventory areas, so ships can be differentiated based on the amount of cargo space, and how many upgrades you want to put on them. More different options means more fun.  - Allow the analysis visor to the turned on, and left on, without having to hold down the F key. Just press it for on, then press it for off. Is that really even something that needs to be pointed out? Or am I missing something in the controls that I should somehow magically know?  - Include some tutorial-style tips for the controls. Seriously. Even just a quick overview.  - Have an upload all option for explorers. Going through and manually uploading each rock you found is a pain. If I want to do that, and name them, I can. But an upload all option would save so much time.  - Add visual effects for the mining laser upgrades. Having it look exactly the same (or pretty much the same) no matter how many fancy techs you plug into your magic tool is boring. Even a colour change would be good.  - Make techs movable in the inventory. Also make them able to be turned on and off so we can try them out, in combinations.  - Fix the flight controls. The flying feels rubbery and weird. And have some kind of punishment for flying into stuff. Even taking some shield off would be useful. Invulnerable space ships? Boring.  - A down pointed camera for picking landing spots. My god but trying to land where you want is a pain. Especially on trading posts.  - Autopilot for trading posts. Select and let the machines do the work.  - Speed up speech interactions. It takes so, so long to talk to aliens. And its all text. Let me speed up the text. I read fast, and waiting for the next word to show up makes me feel like I am being actively prevented from playing the game.  - Info boxes that pop up when selecting a ship, before you speak to the alien. Not the tech, just the size and basic stats. Having to talk to the alien, select the menu option to make an offer on the ship, and only then find out its a piece of junk that I don't want is annoying. Also let me go back to the trade menu after that, rather than exiting out.  - Merge the buy and sell trade menus. Why are they separate? What is the point of that?  - Have a record somewhere easily accessible of the number of words found. Maybe each time you find a new one, note how many you now know of that language in a pop up. Again in a bottom corner somewhere. Or a top corner. Not filling the whole screen.  - Stop getting in the way of me having fun with overly long messages, overly large menu screens, and repetitive cutscenes. Or at least let me skip them. How many times do I need to zoom out of the planet so I can see that I now have a map marker? - Give me a map. At least a minimap. Any kind of map. I have a spaceship, but no idea where I'm going.  That's all for now. I suspect a lot of patching is in order. Or modding. Lots of modding.   Other than that, its a fun time. So I'm going to go with a yes to buy this game. If you wait six months and the price comes down and they fix a bunch of stuff.",

I spent $60 expecting hours and hours of pure exploration, discovering cool new flora and fauna. What I got was that plus a ship and weapon upgrades, alien races to befriend (or not) and trade with, languages to learn, and interesting lore to discover.  There seem to be a lot of reviews from disappointed people who somehow expected more than that when all that was promised was an open universe and a starship. If that's not enough, you can pick fights with sentinel drones and every ship in space, including traders, military vessels, and pirates. If that's not enough, don't by the game.  Will I get bored eventually? Probably, but I'm 10 hrs in and I've only been to a few sparse planets, and I'm still hooked. Apparently space becomes more crowed and eventful as you get closer to the center, but if it doesn't, that's fine.",

Props to the devs though as what is there is solid and unique from such a small team.    Pros:    - Beautiful  - Unique idea  - What's there is well executed  - Fun to be able to fly to a planet from space with no loading    Cons:    - Have never felt challenged in combat  - Auto-hover system while flying around on planets is annoying  - Not enough variance in building/base designs on the planets  - Gets quite repetitive  - Costs too much for what you get  - Confusion over initial quest after claiming pre-order bonus ship  Some people would put performance in as a con, however, I will not. It has high requirements and a lot of people don't meet them   all   and/or haven't updated their drivers.    Features that I've experienced so far:    - Stumble upon creatures that got a job here after Spore  - Rename said wildlife inappropriately.  - Collect different coloured rocks from 50ft away.  - Delete said rocks because of no inventory space.  - Accidental barrel rolls.  - Meet a member of Daft Punk every other production lined space pod.  - Have more credits than Bill Gates. With nothing really to buy.  - Get attacked by spider crabs  - Epic-landscape-screenshot-friendly  Haven't run into a space battle yet. I'm struggling to acquire Electron Vapor for Antimatter. Wondering if I'm bugged somehow. Oh well, the search continues today... :)    Desktop Performance   It runs smoothly on my PC with the following specs. Have had 1 quick crash after 7.2hrs of gameplay. Everything except shadows is on High (I haven't tried to knock that up to High because I'm used to shadows killing performance):   - AMD FX-8350  - Radeon R9 270x 2gb  - 8gb 1600 ram    Laptop Experience   For people with laptops, they had better have a dedicated GPU &gt;= requirements. I launched it on my laptop to see how it would perform, out of curiosity. It loaded (after 5 minutes of stars) but was unplayably chuggy in-game. The gfx card is the issue. You really need to meet the specs for this game. My laptop is as follows:   - Intel Core i7-5500 2.40GHz  - NVIDIA® GeForce® 940M 2gb  - 8gb ram     Update:    I can feel it getting repetitive after 10 hours and find myself just skipping points of interest because there is really nothing of depth/value at them after a while. Really hoping the devs add many more features over the coming year. With the money they just raked it, they can sure afford it, and should possibly grow the team a little. Thoughts? The most interesting thing to me right now is finding nice landscape screenshots and just seeing what the randomly generated landscapes look like per planet. ",

If you are looking for more than that, you will likely be disappointed.  Is this the end all be all to space sims? No, definitely not, but the sheer size of the universe in this game is just mind blowing and awe inspiring. Bugs and crashes aside, the game does have it's flaws.

It's more of an experience than a game, but it tries a little too hard to be a game (when it doesn't need to). For me, crafting and mining interrupted what NMS is best at, exploration. For some reason the game attempts at every moment to make you stop sniffing the flowers and going to new places to open your inventory and refuel, or go find something worth credits so you can go to better planets. Unlike most it seems I didn't really have too much of an issue with the small inventory, however it's possible I didn't play enough to really experience the major issues with it  That and the flying controls are a little bit horrible. Too floaty to be arcadey, too little control to be a space sim.

The tractor beam grabs you when close and does the casual slow 1 revolution spin that Han used to do with the Falcon. Landing is automatic in the space port. Fly in straight, land on pad, pad turns 180 degrees to get you facing the right way when leaving. recharged my health and left. On to the next undiscovered planet.  I think the devs did a great job so far. Im not on the latest drivers so Im not sure if the small problems IM seeing are because of that or not. However, none of it makes the game unplayable. I would suggest turning the framerate to 'MAX' because anything less than that I was hovering around 32fps. But on planet surfaces I average 90FPS in valleys and when I come to top of valleys Im in the 55-69FPS. I am getting gpu downclocking but I'll take my suggestions to the forums.  Overall its very cool. The actual game play seems simple, straightforward, and well thought out. And who doesnt want to explore space freely?? That is what I loved about Empyrion.

            "review_text": " Review from just after release  Firstly, I'll have to say that I am not seeing any fps-drops or lag. I'm on an Asus RoG with a Geforce 980M 4gb, 16gb DDR3 RAM, i7 4.00ghz quadcore. Maxed everything out in options menu, even SSAAx4 and ultra-shadows, and I have no problems whatsoever. Only a little load-lag when I start up the game. No lag AT ALL while playing. Runs completely smooth at all times. You people must have torrents, Windows updates, 50 browser-tabs or something running in the background. I hardly see any landscape-popping either. I had been afraid of that, after watching so many videos.   Conclusion  I'm loving the game so far. Already met a couple of aliens, got a new gun, tried to break into a research facility, got pummelled by drones, escaped, and farmed an entire asteroid field for fuel.  TBH, though, some of the ground textures aren't convincing, and I don't like the way mushrooms sway in the wind. That just looks wrong!  9/10   Additional review, almost 3 months after release  Even after the aftermath, I still recommend the game. It's evident that HG are working on a rather big update right now, and just about all crashes have been eliminated. Granted, the gameplay is a bit bland, but that's sort of the point of the game: focus on exploring the planets, and don't rush to max out everything, and you'll be content for many, many, many hours. Just pick up a few bibs and bobs along the way, to sell to traders or at the terminals, and pick up a new ship and weapon when you can. The best thing you can do for yourself, is to max your suit inventory, though. That'll be a tremendous help, in avoiding the inventory clutter. Don't hold on to things you don't need.  With mods, the game can be transformed into a variety of new forms. Crazier planets and more varied everything (Better Worlds mod), removal of the many small irritations you might have, higher definition textures, more cash from doing discoveries, more AI freighters and fighters in space, amazing asteroid fields etc.  When you get a hold of the save editor, your NMS-life can change forever. Personally, I'm not much for cheating, but simply changing all the unstackable items in my inventory to stack in 10000s, to avoid spending my life managing a clunky inventory, is one of the best things I've done for myself in this game.  The game engine is an incredible piece of art, and I am sure HG are going to take advantage of it, and will rake back many of their lost customers, after a few good updates. If they even take the time, to make it more natively modable, there's a large community waiting hungrily to lob content at it.  I do see quite a bit of landscape popping now, but I think some of the mods adding crazy amounts of trees and foliage, are to blame for that. The author of the Better Worlds mod, TemplarGFX, has an increase in draw distance in the works. I'm hoping he gets it going!   Conclusion  It retains its score of 9/10, but only because the game doesn't seem to mind being bent over by modders. If you don't care for modding, the score would be around 6/10, simply because the vanilla world generation is too restricted, and the gameplay is next to non-existent, clunky and even irritating at times. But as a universe exploration simulator, it's actually doing a pretty good job out of the box.",

            "review_text": "Alright, Now that I've had time to really play this game, I want to add my two cents. Especially with all the negative reveiws.   Let me just say this, for 90% of the gamers out there this game is not for you. This game is for a certain audience, and I happen to be one of them. I did NOT like Elite: Dangerous, it just wasn't for me.  However, this is a great game. It's for those who want to explore space, but at a less hectic pace. Objectives exsist, but you don't have to do them. You go at your own pace. It's a great game for after work when you just want to keep things mellow. You can explore and look at the beautiful scenery in the game, or go start a fight with the sentinels. Maybe you want to explore new planets and spend your time tying to 100% completely log a particularly interesting planet. That's the beauty of this game, you honestly can do WHATEVER you want.   Now some complaints from others I want to address:  1. I see that people are saying that 'every planet is the same', and I promise you that's not true. Certain planets do look similar but if you are willing to explore the star systems, you will find wonderful planets that look out of a dream. They are truly amazing.  2.Some people say this game is grindy. While this CAN be true in the game, it's all about how you play. Past building your first star ship and any MAJOR upgrade that is needed to complete a task, the game is only as grindy as you make it. Any augument for your multitool, exosuit, or starship is completely optional; it is not required for you to complete the game or even leisurely explore a star system. You really only need a few materials to sustain yourself and your equipment's charge as well, all of which can be easily found on nearly every planet. Once you build your main items, the materials you gather and the things you build are for the most part up to you.   3. The 'its not worth $60 dollars' argument. Now, how can someone justify the price of a game for everyone. FOR ME, the game is worth every penny I spent. All $59.99 of it has gone to good use. For you, the game may not be worth that price. That is something you need to judge for yourself, I cannot tell you what this game is worth to you. Sure, you could say that this game has less features than other $60 games and I would agree with you 100%. However, what about games like Battlefield and COD. Those games cost $60 as well, but have less features than games like Skyrim or MGS 5. The 'Not worth $60 ' argument is 100% wrong, due to the nature of this game. Let me put it this way; if you are willing to utilitze and appreciate this game for what it offers, then that price does not matter.    If you're interested in the game, I suggest you watch someone on youtube play it. I would recommend only watching the first 2 hours of the game though, as to not spoil everything for you as you progress in game.",

            "review_text": "No Man's Sky is very good if you like just straight exploring. I've played 12 hours and am still blown away. People are saying that there is a lack of things to do, but this game is very different from most. Instead of hitting you over the head with stuff you need to do, it gives you a general direction then says go play. No Man's Sky is a game where you make your own fun inside of it. Instead of saying 'Oh there's a quest marker there! I guess I should go check it out.' I instead say, 'Wow, there's a cool rock formation or a new alien word I can learn over there!'. There's a lot to explore and the variety is very good.  There are a lot of performance issues so I'd wait a bit for those to get sorted out. You need a pretty beefy computer to get a stable frame rate. If you have a good computer that is above the min specs, and can handle some choppy frames here and there, it's great.  Even though I really enjoy the game, and Hello Games has said they will continue to add new things, No Man's Sky is not for everyone. If you need quest markers constantly telling you where to go, who to talk to, or need faster gameplay, it's not for you. However if you like to stop and marvel at what is around you and take it slow, this is the game for you.",

Let's just say that I decided to stay home from school to watch No Man's Sky's reveal and I had never been so happy to see a game in my life. Soon after I started to find out everything I could about this game that I could. All of the things that Sean Murray said sounded amazing and I thought it could be true. But I was wrong and I wasn't just wrong, I was really wrong. All of these 'promises' were way too optimistic for a game's release.   On the day before the release on PC I decided to pre-order the game. I had never been so excited for a game in my life. The high of the game lasted for about 5 or 6 hours until I realized how repetitive and mindless the game was. I really like the concept of this game being a relaxing game and in some parts it but in most it isn't. This game needs some very crucial things that should have been in the game at release. The game is still great don't get me wrong, but this game is far from perfect.   Pros - Beautiful - Massive - Fun  Cons - Lies - Repetative - Irritating - Space combat is terrible. - Inventory is terrible. - Crafting is terrible. - Didn't I already mention this? Well either way they lied.  This game is fine but I would only get it if it was on sale.  This game to me in its current state is a 6/10. There is a lot to do for this game to be 60 dollars but hopefully the team can do it.",

Dumb AI While in your ship you don't see the weather outside of it besides clouds Forced flight correction which makes navigating the surface of a planet extremely tedious    Verdict: I recomend getting the game at $60 despite its flaws if you want a massive and beautiful procedurally generated universe to survive and explore.

I think it is in fact a marvel, a pocket universe running on my humble machine, I get a small thrill being the first, whatever I am, on an unknown virtual planet. Fun? That’s where it gets tricky, it’s most fun if you find science fun, there is some violence, don’t worry but it probably will be unsatisfactory if you thought no to the former.  There are goals, although not rigidly enforced but if you need structure, there is some. I’m a long way off from the “End-Game” but I do know where I might find it, centre of the galaxy, probably.  Now, the heart of the matter $€60. Is it worth that? I think it’s 100% inflated but I knew that when I pressed the buy button. Is it worth it if geeky science led exploration is your thing? Again no, there needs to be deeper tools to gain more information and insight from your surroundings. Hopefully they’ll add to the science sandbox but 10-1 they’ll add to the combat side of things and nobody gets the game they want.   I’m going to vote yes because there’s no middle ground to this voting system but if your pockets are deep and your curiosity insatiable then buy, if not wait for half the price.  **Edit - Couple of hours later : **  Changed to the experimental patch and wow, that's made a difference. Graphics are 100% smooth as silk, I got the occasional rare glitch before, they also seem better even though I was running at max before.  The most important thing though, I was suffering a bug with my scanner, it rarely worked but I didn't realise, now I can tag everything, rocks, trees, plants, so one of my major gripes is no more.  The more I play (and bugs squashed, features added), the happier I am with the purchase. Universe is massive, beautiful and strange.

This game is about exploration, and discovery, both concrete and abstract. It’s for people like me who enjoy discovering a cave that wasn’t put there by developers, feeling the beginnings of panic as you realize you’re getting lost in that cave, feeling relieved at finding the exit, but realizing it wasn’t the place you originally entered. Then finding a mountain range that wasn’t placed intentionally to prevent you overtaking its heights, then after reaching its peak, seeing a vast, beautiful, and untouched landscape stretch to the horizon, knowing that you can explore every bit of it...or none of it, and spotting a river or lake that isn’t taunting you to never cross its borders, but rather to explore its challenging depths and mysteries. It’s for those who appreciate the slightest variations in color and style of grass that make an environment unique. And having that character enhanced by a unique atmosphere, weather, and wildlife. It’s for people with enough curiosity to find the difference in animals that look very similar but your analysis visor classifies them as different species. This, for me, is No Man’s Sky. And as if that wasn’t enough, there are gentle --and at times, not so gentle-- game mechanics to enhance the journey. Death avoidance (not survival) pushes you to explore and find resources in a respectful manner, not to abuse the land and fill a bottomless inventory. This game is for people who feel a twinge of remorse for destroying the beautiful column of Heridium, or who, after collecting Platinum from the manmade silos by blowing them up, wonder, is it really my right to take this, or am i in the wrong? Then hearing the hum of sentries approaching, watching them scan the wreckage of your deed, realizing that you’ll have to answer for your actions, and deciding weather to run from the consequences, or to fight back and answer violence with violence. I’ve begun to make the moral decisions for the player at this point, but No Man’s Sky is your story as you explore the universe that is the closest man has ever come (speaking in terms of real-life-history-making) to replicating the beautiful, varied--and for those who don’t take the time to “smell the roses”-- mundane, reality that we live in.  10/10 for making the best game i have ever played!",

Multiplayer, people want to play together with their friends because it's not cool to travel th ewhole galaxy alone talking to npcs, space battles with allies would be so much better  5. Cities and more special planets, planets are just rocks with resources and some buildings that you will see everywhere you go, please add more buildings or even cities  6. More sentinel types, i hate building the perfect weapon just to kill a small RC helicopter and some crazy robot hounds, I couldn't find the 'T-rex'  7. Nerf those carriers, it's impossible to raid big ships if they keep spawning sentinels, you disable their guns and some fancy robots appear (if you kill them, more will teleport to you) and eventually kill you.  8. Spaceship collision, the game doesn't let you crash on planets and that makes it boring  9. Not immersive, the game hasn't gas giants, planets without atmosphere and life (which were supposed to appear more than planets with life and -51 C with liquid water), also it's missing the composition of the planet and exotic flora for different planets.  10. The galaxy is enourmous, maybe the problem is that the game is too big, galaxies aren't infinite for all it's sides (you can fly up infinitly).   It can be a good game, it just needs more time to be fixed, No man's Sky is not for everyone now, but I recommend it for those like me.",

First of all, I need to say - at the moment this game doesn't worth that much money. Yet it doesn't mean that No Man's Sky is a bad game. It's more like an Early Access game.   This game is not for everybody. Literally. You can compare it to walking in the park. Some people enjoy looking around, exploring, searching for new stuff without any point or actual end. Some people don't. Same is with this game. It's all about exploring, walking, listening and such stuff. It's an awesome game for taking epic and awesome screenshots. It's a nice game to chill after a hard day. It's a perfect game for dreamers. And it's a terrible game for those who are waiting for action all the way, storyline and the gameplay like in CoD.   You have a freedom to explore all the planets, all species. Some people say that random makes animals to look ugly, unreal, stupid. However, we can't know for sure if those creations can't be real. Moreover, random doesn't always make them that unlucky. Sometimes you can find something really nice looking.   Another problem that everybody complains about is that there are no those super epic space battles. Again, this game wasn't made for action. The main point of it is a calm exploration. Not the destruction of everything, killing the evil guy and living happily with a lady. In this game you have your own adventure and only you decide what do you want to do.   So fast cons and pros:  + Nice graphics (not for everybody but really unusual) + Really a lot of stuff to explore. (if you are not looking for fast running point-to-point) + Epic space + You can be first to discover one of the best planets + There are probably going to be some updates to this game  + Lots of freedom for modding. + Awesome ambient.  - Mostly all animals have a same colour - Animal's sounds may become annoying - Some colours are too toxic.  - Can be a bit too grindy (however, mostly all games have grind. At least you don't see here standart 'I need eggs. Go kill hens and bring me eggs') - No real point. You are free. You need to find what to do.    A pretty but overhyped game. Too high price for the current stage but maybe we'll get something more in the end.",

Sure, it had a few issues here and there. But I have never jumped into any game, ever, that I didn't experience some problems.  The game is beautiful. The design is beautiful. The idea is outstanding.  I would give the game, in its current state, a 7/10. It is definitely lacking in a few departments, but that doesn't take away from the overall experience. It needs some work and it needs some love, but it is still a fun adventure in its current state.   Don't take everyones review at face value. Do some research on your own. I look forward to coming across some planets and systems you all have discovered.",

            "review_text": "No Man's Sky is a strange game to say the least. I'll get into that later but let me get one point across; this game isn't for everyone. This game if for a group of people who find enjoyment in exploring a universe and finding a perfect scene straight from 'A Sci-Fi novel cover'.    Ok with that out of the way No Man's Sky is flawed in a lot of ways, it's inventory system is the perfect mix of pure pain and horror, a lot of assets pop up constantly, and it's very very slow at the beginning; at 9 hours in I'm still struggling to progress. You also have to bare the bugs and slowdown, some people have claimed to crash on startup and some have claimed to be perfectly fine. I find myself having some slowdown but I've never crashing. Also it's very Alt-Tab unfriendly but you can bring it back up in a second in task manager.   It may start slow but it speeds up a lot. The game is completely RNG so you might take a bit longer or shorter depending on how lucky you are with your spawn point but you will progress. With an Atlas Pass v1, you can start picking up upgrades for your inventory and all around better loot. With a better multi-tool you can start hitting harder and mining quicker making grinding a bit easier. As you learn alien languages (Yes you have to learn every word by finding the words at monoliths) you can pass speech checks with more certainty because you know what they are asking you to give or do.   If you plan to buy this game please be aware it is all RNG, you may be the luckiest person and only find banger planets or you might for squatt. And make sure you give it a bit because there is a story, there is progression, and there is a great game under all the day one problems, give the game a few more weeks and Hello Games has a chance of making the game they set out for it to be.  TL;DR It's good if you want to explore but it's a slow start and kinda buggy ATM.",

No Man's Sky is an Exploration game, pushing procedural generation into the main light. There is elements, there is collecting, there is a little bit of combat, but the main thing you do in this game is ask what is on the next planet. If you are after a relaxing couple of hours where you play a game while listening to music and don't pay much attention, this is wonderful.  One issue, this game is glitchy at times.

            "review_text": "Note that I am marking this as Recommended, but I am recommending it for a very select group of people.  The very first thing I will say is that No Man's Sky is definitely not meant for everyone, there is a very niche group of people that will enjoy it, and if you are not in that group, you will likely hate it, or find it immensely boring. That said, if you are part of the group the game is intended for, you will find a lot to love. Not to say the game isn't without problems.  First off, if you don't find the idea of a game focused purely on exploration exciting, this game is most definitely not for you. Wandering onto a planet for the first time and touching down on a hill top, getting out of your ship to see the sun rising over vast plants of grass flowing in the winds with strange, and sometimes beautiful creatures wandering across the hills can be very exhilarating. And if you're like me, when you find one of these planets, you'll spent many hours on it just trying to analyse and name every thing on that planet, tracking down all of the knowledge stones, and finding as many new blueprints as you are able.  On the flip side, you need to visit the rarer systems (The color of the stars matter FYI) to ever find planets that are arguably worth exploring. Early in the game, you will find a lot of planets that just seem like barren wastelands with underwhelming, or non-existent creatures. It really takes many hours of exploration off the beaten path before you are truly rewarded with the beautiful sights you were likely expecting from the E3 trailers. And while I, personally, have not found creatures quite on the scale of beauty of those found in the E3 trailers, others have. They are out there, you just have to be dedicated to finding them. After all, this is a game about exploration, the whole purpose of your existence in this literal universe is to explore, and seek out these amazing sights.  As for gripes, I do have a few, my largest one being that you are not free to fly around while in a planets atmosphere as you please, you are locked at a certain altitude above ground level, and the game strictly enforces it. This is immensely irritating, especially when trying to land near a certain landmark or building, and trust me... on certain planets with extreme weather or hazards, you will want to land as close as possible to those if you haven't installed any hazard protection in your suit. This is coupled by the annoyance of there being no method of free looking while in your ship on PC without plugging in a controller. I'm no programmer, but I'd imagine it can't be that complicated to bind a toggle to a button to allow the mouse free look while flying. After all, this is a game about exploration... let me look around while I'm in my ship.  Inventory management is 50:50 for me, in the beginning, it is the most irritating thing in the universe. But once you start finding drop pods with exosuit upgrades, or a ship with a fairly large inventory, it becomes a lot more manageable.  Overall, I do recommend the game, but as I said in the beginning of my review, I only recommend it for a very select group of people. If you are expecting an action packed adventure, this game is not for you. If you are expecting an epic story, this game is not for you. This game was designed from the ground up for people who enjoy the thrill of exploration, and finding new and exciting landscapes, creatures, or flora. For those that enjoy being a virtual photographer.  If you are a part of that group, you will greatly enjoy this game, despite the flaws.  A note on performance, as has been brought up in many reviews. I have had little to no problems on max settings with performance overall, despite a little bit of hitching in the first half hour or so when I booted up the game the very first time, my specs are listed below: GTX 1070 32 GB RAM i7-6700K 500 GB SSD",

Not too mention trying to understand the Atlas and the other races languages interactions, there's tonnes of ships and i don't even know what happens when i reach the centre of the galaxy.

The planet just never ends, and it delights me to know that my 2nd planet is just one of 18 Quintilian in the No Man's Sky universe.   The creatures may not change too much. The planet design itself may look similar to the last one you visited. BUT, you will keep finding new discoveries and new reasons to keep playing. The game is beautiful, and runs perfectly for me with an i7 4790K CPU and an Nvidia GTX 980 Ti GFX card (120-140+ FPS on MAX 1080p).   Overall, I have had no performance issues OR crashes, but I am aware that many have. This game is definitely going to be excellent for those with a good CPU and/or good GPU.

Overall: The game is incredibly fun as it stands (if you can run it) and has a ton of potential if they continue to update it but I'm not sure I would have kept my preorder if I would have known that I would have so many performance issues and would have ot try and troubleshoot crashes for my friends too. It's entirely unacceptable to launch a game that doesn't run for a huge amount of people when you had so long to playtest it. Can be somewhat lonely if you don't talk to others (I was playing at the same time as friends on teamspeak so I had company).  Pros:  - Very unique and calming experience that looks pretty good. - Extensive options menu - Exploring is fairly rewarding and somehow doesnt really seem to get repetitive even if some of the planets feel similar.  Cons: - The UI literally feels copy and pasted from PS4 (long pressing with mouse click?) and could seriously use some work. - The optimization at launch was attrocious and still needs some serious work(thankfully there are a lot of workarounds available on reddit to help with performance) - Changing fullscreen modes requires a full game restart which makes no sense whatsoever - No multiplayer (I didn't care for it but I don't like the dishonesty/lack of communication surrounding this) - Serious lack of communication by HG overall despite having a bigger PR team than dev team. - A lot of things are just very unintuitive and easy to miss if you don't know to look for them. - The game has some serious quality issues with the audio and uses white noise for atmosphere WAYYYY too much.  Now that I've hit 100 hours I'd like to add a few things: - Almost every mechanic and system within the game goes entirely unexplained and you need to look reddit for stats and general game knowledge. - The inability to move upgrades and parts around within the ship makes no sense at all and adds unnecessary difficulty to the game that literally shouldn't exist.  - As someone used to Elite Dangerous' flight mechanics, I really really don't like the space combat in this game. It just doesn't feel good to me.",

I recently read a review were someone said: Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle. Well. Kind of. However, the shallow game is the smoke-screen. In reality it is so wide, and so shallow that it eclipses the very concept of our lives and circles back around to become the most deep game that has ever, and can ever be produced by humans on a transistor based computer system. To understand the game you must consider 'what is a game'. For the past decade and a half we have moved away from the roots of gaming, from epic classics like populus and qubit. Todays games have hand-holding, constant rewards, and a pat on the back even if you do poorly. Todays game has exposition of how important your actions in the game are. They have action and insane experiences that take the post-real narrative found in movies and turn them up to 11.  Take a game like CS:GO. In reality it is not about skills, it is not about getting ranks. It is about playing, finnishing, and, win or loose, start queing again.  No manssky does away with all that and return to the foundation of what a game is. Sure, the game has a samey-feel to it. Sure, the animations are very stilted and immersion-breaking. Sure, the AI is JUST passing the nightmare found in Alien: Colonian Marines. And yea, sure, whoever coded space-combat and its companion systems; should be shot, quartered, and forced to grow potatoes in Greenland. But, as you play, you realize that were there is need for after-thought and a deft hand in design, nomanssky has you covered.  Different upgrades to your warp-drive allowes you to go from mostly dreary and booring systems, to dreary and booring planets with more grass. At the highest tier you get to go to blue systems, and by then, you will be longing for a grass-less and foilage-less planet. If only as a change of pace. Different colored back-drops indicate what type of resources you are most likely to find in the system space, and perhaps even on the planets. Different systems are not explained to you, you learn them by spending hours in game and slowly seeing patterns.  Industry standards are turned on their head all through the game. As an example:  Money does not matter, since you simply will have no chance to pass the ever rising cost of new ships. Once you finally grind to max itemization, money is used for buying items so you can get back on the road rather than spend hours looking for that one shit♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ resource you are missing to repair your hyper-drive..  Because that is what the game is about. It is about staying on the road.  The end goal does not matter, it is the journey that gives life meaning.   Noamnsky is ♥♥♥♥ing philosophy!  So, awards time. Do I reccomend it to the gamers of today? Hell No. I'd be hardpressed to reccommend this game to ANYONE. Still: Do I think you should all buy it and play it, ♥♥♥♥ yes.  /Noam Chomsky.  &lt;EDIT&gt; It needs to be said that the marketing of this game was EXTREAMLY misleading. And that is something we need to combat. Through legal means, low sales, and refunds. Sadly, I cannot get a refund because I stand by the words I have written above. The scary thing is that if NMS ends up doing really well economically, then we will see in move towards NMS type marketing. And if we have that, then gaming will die eventually.",

They have action and insane experiences that take the post-real narrative found in movies and turn them up to 11.  Take a game like CS:GO. In reality it is not about skills, it is not about getting ranks. It is about playing, finnishing, and, win or loose, start queing again.  No manssky does away with all that and return to the foundation of what a game is. Sure, the game has a samey-feel to it. Sure, the animations are very stilted and immersion-breaking. Sure, the AI is JUST passing the nightmare found in Alien: Colonian Marines. And yea, sure, whoever coded space-combat and its companion systems; should be shot, quartered, and forced to grow potatoes in Greenland. But, as you play, you realize that were there is need for after-thought and a deft hand in design, nomanssky has you covered.  Different upgrades to your warp-drive allowes you to go from mostly dreary and booring systems, to dreary and booring planets with more grass. At the highest tier you get to go to blue systems, and by then, you will be longing for a grass-less and foilage-less planet. If only as a change of pace. Different colored back-drops indicate what type of resources you are most likely to find in the system space, and perhaps even on the planets. Different systems are not explained to you, you learn them by spending hours in game and slowly seeing patterns.  Industry standards are turned on their head all through the game. As an example:  Money does not matter, since you simply will have no chance to pass the ever rising cost of new ships. Once you finally grind to max itemization, money is used for buying items so you can get back on the road rather than spend hours looking for that one shit♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ resource you are missing to repair your hyper-drive..  Because that is what the game is about. It is about staying on the road.  The end goal does not matter, it is the journey that gives life meaning.   Noamnsky is ♥♥♥♥ing philosophy!  So, awards time. Do I reccomend it to the gamers of today? Hell No. I'd be hardpressed to reccommend this game to ANYONE. Still: Do I think you should all buy it and play it, ♥♥♥♥ yes.  /Noam Chomsky.  &lt;EDIT&gt; It needs to be said that the marketing of this game was EXTREAMLY misleading. And that is something we need to combat. Through legal means, low sales, and refunds. Sadly, I cannot get a refund because I stand by the words I have written above. The scary thing is that if NMS ends up doing really well economically, then we will see in move towards NMS type marketing. And if we have that, then gaming will die eventually.",

Personally i loved the whole ' mysterious ' and cryptic slow incoming of it through the years, it kept me interested for more yet patient as well. There was no reason to fill any gaps since i simply went by what i seen from trailers, introductions and interviews and that alone got me by all means on its side.  Sean Murray deserves big warm hugs along with his whole team for making this gem come true and creating amazing universe for all of us to have fun in. I personally understand that not everyone might enjoy the game the same way because they do not understand what it is to actually ' Follow your dream ' if you do not live by this quote or do not really feel the need to at least try to understand the way Sean wants people to take this game as, then i sincerely feel sad for ya, i really do, because this is quite literally a lifetime journey. I do not remember a game where i could just stand in nowhere being enveloped in beauty all around, whether its dangerous or not, every place i visit in this game is worth a picture, worth a share... It is suppose to bring community together and not push it against each other by saying ' oh he promised this or that ' Whatever is not in the game will be there in future, but i personally LOVE this game on highest level possible.  Highly recommended and may Sean and his team keep it nurished for as long as time allows.",

            "review_text": "I don't normally post a lot of reviews, but wanted to take a moment and give my $.02 on No Man's Sky.  I understand there's been a lot of hype on this game and quite honestly, a lot of it was unwarranted. It was always built as a gargantuan space sand box. It was never billed as being an action-heavy shoot-em up. So, I puzzle at the high number of negative reviews, all of them seeming to hinge on the game being 'boring.' Well, boring to you might be paradise to others.  I'm an old gamer and was looking forward to this one because it was laid back. What I read about it over the past six months or so, told me that this was going to be in a very similar vein of the old Starflight game that came out back in the mid 80's. I played the heck out of that and enjoyed it immensely. When NMS opened, I was greatly pleased to see that I was right. This is an open-universe sandbox where I can explore and do pretty much exactly what I want to do. I could not have been happier. That said, here's my 5X5 Pros and Cons:  5 PROS  1. You are completely on your own. Figure it out.   2. Incredibly vast. I'm only on my 2nd planet in my starting system. I don't want to leave.  3. Robust crafting system. Seriously, I don't even know how many blueprints I have now.  4. Planets have everything, from flora and fawna to aliens to crashed ships to all kinds of secrets. Hence, why I don't want to leave the planet surface.  5. It's wide open for you to play how you want to play. Do you want to linger on planets and explore? Do you want to get out into space and look for someone to scrap with? Do you want to get to the center of the universe as fast as you can? Do you want to study the aliens and learn their language so you know what they're saying--currently this is what I am working on and it's quite entertaining? Whatever you want to do, it's all up to you.  5 CONS  1. I'd like to see more textures introduced in the future. At the moment, there are a lot of similarities to aliens and ships.  2. On that subject, I'd love to see some love given to player-allowed cosmetic upgrades. Letting players customize their ships with colors and decals would be a wonderful addition.   3. I like the trade network, but there needs to be more variety. There also needs to be some randomness in the buying and selling. If you do a little studying on how it works, you'll see it's pretty easy to make money. Find out what the network is buying and then visit all the ships that dock and buy low, so you can sell high. I spent about an hour in the space station working the network and was able to upgrade my ship significantly.  4. I'd like to see a little more wildness to the planets, at least in terms of hostile aliens. While the fire pit I'm on right now forces me to stay near my ship or I'll cook to death, it would be nice to have some random T-Rex like creature come and try to have me for dinner.   5. It would be nice to see them rework the slot system with ships. As it stands, every slot can have equipment upgrades or cargo. They could improve the ship building piece of this game by seperating it out to have X number of equipment slots and X number of cargo slots. It would also add for different variations to similar skins, more so that exists now.  Overall, this is a definite 7 or 8/10 game and worth the money. Some improvements going forward will push that higher and I have no doubt it will continue to be refined. I, for one, could not be happier with my purchase.  Oh, as as far as people ragging on the PC port? I have an older PC...granted, it's an Alienware and I keep it in good shape, but it's not a brutally fast gaming rig like a lot of people have these days. With my PC, I have had absolutely ZERO problems playing the game. No Frame Rate Issues and NO crashes.   ",

With that in mind going into the game as an open world percedularly generated single player game I've had a blast and will probably get another 30-40 hours out of it. Compared to triple A releases i'd say its just as good if not better than many other $60 games out there whail its not an amazing game thats going to last me hundereds upon hundreds of hours its far better than something like say destiny or other hped up releases. I think the majority of the negative reviews are people who played the game due to the hype created by the designers and media before the game released and they are probably right to be a bit miffed. But if your looking for a single player open world game with about 60 to 100 hours of fun gameplay then this is a great game to get. If your looking for a story based game that focus on quests and completing tasks you will definitly not enjoy this game. For me its a 4 out of 5 game.",

That being said, I've not experienced any performace, lag, FPS drops, crashing or bugs. My game runs amazingly at around 110 FPS steady.  The game itself, can be repatitive, but what game doesn't have repatition? The fun of the game, is upgrading, crafting, and exploring, as well as being able to find and name your own planets, locations, and solar systems.  There are different languages for you to learn, and aliens for you to gain knowledge on, trade with, and learn about.  I look forward to this game becoming something more, once it has undergone more growth, and patches,  As a whole, if you dont like exploring games, dont like procedurally generated, and don't like hours of fun finding your own unique worlds, then don't play it.

            "review_text": "I don't usually write reviews for games, but I know a lot of people have been on the fence with buying this game because of how expensive it is. I've played games like minecraft, space engineers, kerbal space program, spore etc. All of them never really did it for me. I wanted to spend less time on creating the thing I'm flying, and more time exploring and building other things/ surviving. I remember when I played spore I was begging for someone to create a mod that allowed me to get out of my spaceship on different planets and walk around the cities and explore the planets themselves. Yea it had a hollogram thing but it just wasnt the same.   I digress, this game really hits that spot for me that none of the other games did. I really enjoy being able to explore different planets, pilot my ship in and out of space whenever I want, interacting with different alien races.   I think it's easy to be tempted into flying into a planet quickly checking out what resources it has, maybe mining a few, and then leave the planet to check out the next one. Then people complain that the game gets boring after a while, when they aren't seeing the point. You can fly at high speed in your space craft for 20 minutes straight and still not be to the other side of the planet. There is so much exploring that can be done just on 1 planet. The past 2 days I've spent all my time on 1 planet, excavating important resources for maintaining my ship, interacting with the alien species, finding monoliths, learning the language of the species to build relationships with the race. This has led to me finding an ancient pool of resources/technologies from a tribe, finding a downed spaceship that had hyperdrive installed on it, and gaining artifacts worth tons of cash. This is all just on 1 planet. I feel like I'm playing out a sci fi movie on 1 planet and I still don't feel like I'm done.  I think if you are a disciplined explorer/survivor enthusiast, you will thoroughly enjoy this game.",

Gameplay is survival, but it is quite hard to actually die, only time I have died so far is when I allerted drones who called in bigger allies which I ignored until the volume of fire was overwhelming. Respawn and find my death marker to reclaim my gear.  I think the gathering/trading is a stronger element than survival. I am about 15-20 hours in and have my suit up to 22 slots and am flying a 25 slot ship. Going to cost about $4-million to get the next stage of ship at about the 27 slot size.  Exploration is fun and the biggest element of the game currently, finding a planet that is rich in rare materials helps grinding for bigger ships with more storage capacity, sometimes just mining asteroids around a spacestation is a quick way to grind a bit of extra cash.  Overall I am enjoying the game and woud recommend it to anyone who likes the exploration/gathering side of games at the moment and any additions/expantion of the game in the future will hopefully add in aspects that appeal to a wider audience.  7.5/10",

            "review_text": "So far this has exceeded my expectations. I've only visited 3 planets, but each has been completely different, the third being a lush paradise planet with awesome land and undersea locations...lucky I guess (I'm still looking for an ingame camera...if there isn't one there should be!). With changing day/night lighting, scenes morph constantly, so it would have been nice to stand and capture the atmosphere...truly beautiful! (edit: I suppose I can use the steam camera instead...didn't think of that!)  Standing in the entrance to a coral encrusted sea cave, looking out on a blue sky with some kind of alien pumping station standing in a glistening sea...that's all I was hoping for (easily pleased! :D). Diving down through the atmosphere of an alien world from space is a wonderful experience. I've played many spaceship sims over the years and nothing has been as much fun as this - smooth and unbroken from deep space right down to a detailed and lush landscape. Hop out the ship, run down to the shore and dive down to the depths of a crystal clear ocean. I commend Hello games for this achievement alone. It's a shame ship controls don't allow me a little more freedom to skim over the surface at a lower altitude, but I guess that's the payoff for having such a detailed landscape. We are made to fly at a height that limits detailed inspection and thus not bog FPS to a crawl.  I generally prefer to play/explore/construct alone and I hate to admit that I loved Minecraft from the start (still do) for the same reasons I wanted this game...relative infinity and no-one else to spoil things.  Gameplaywise and graphically this is everything I expected it to be and more. I wasn't interested in multiplayer, I didn't expect to be able to build an intergalactic empire and didn't get caught up in the hype...I just wanted to relax and explore a procedurally generated universe.   Not one crash so far. Worked silky smooth at 90fps with all settings set to max from start with a few ingame graphic option changes. My PC is pretty average now at i7, Geforce 970, 32Gigs internal memory.  I'm sorry there are so many who wanted/expected there to be more to NMS and I can completely understand the frustration and disappointment for those experiencing technical problems...hopefully the majority of these 'will' get sorted. However, IMHO too many people who would not normally like this type of game got caught up in the media hype. This started as an Indie game that had such an incredible launch trailer that everybody jumped on the bandwagon and as a small company Hello lost control of the weight of expectations.   I agree with the majority here that this should never have been billed as a triple 'A' game and £39 is overpriced if it's not 'your' sort of game, but this probably wasn't Hello's fault. However, with updates and add-ons, I think it could achieve this status. I'm excited for the next update, that this is early days still, and the game has enormous potential, but there's still so many good surprises, even at this stage. Personally £39 was money well spent as I love it so far. Hopefully updates will extend that satisfaction for a sufficent number of hours that I won't eventually feel I paid too much.  After seeing such a huge wave of early negative comments I nearly didn't buy the game, but just over 6 hrs in-game I realize what a mistake that would have been and feel the need to add a positive review. I'm excited that this is early days still and the game has enormous potential.   I can't wait to get back in, to explore and wander around on worlds I only used to dream about as a kid reading paperback sci-fi.",

Don't believe in all the thumbs down. If you understand that you're getting into a game that is single player, mostly about exploration through a massive amount of worlds that are similar in ways but different in others. It's procedural generation people. You think they could fit unique content 18 quintillion times? Your fault for hyping it up too much.  However if you like exploration, cataloguing stuff, solving small logic puzzles and exploring a never ending sandbox, then enjoy. Think of it as Diablo, people run the same rifts and greater rifts over and over and over with little to no variation. Now apply that logic to space travel and you have No Man's Sky.   Pros:  It's awesome Loading times are gone unless you account for the time it takes to enter and exit a planet's atmosphere or warping to another system. Graphics aren't bad. Lots of little things to check out and sink your teeth into. Good soundtrack Good ship variation  Cons:  Feels a bit empty but then again with so much to play with it's going to feel empty....it's space. Could use a bit more variety in terms of things to do. Could benefit from a mission or two or maybe factions besides 'Reach the center of the galaxy' Could use more variation on elements to gather and more craftables.   That's a pretty basic review but it's a thumbs up for me. When you wanna relax and just aimlessly wander around a giant sandbox getting upgrades and checking out all the quirks the game has to offer.....then it's a definite must have. If you're expecting a structured journey with someone holding your hand the whole way or to have every single planet be entirely unique then you're going to be disappointed. You can't have unique and 18 quintillion in the same game. It's just not gonna happen. Now if you consider unique as 'Hey that animal has wings now and on the last planet they were purple with only 4 legs', then you will eat this game up.  P.S. My favorite thing to do so far is find the language stones as it automatically translates once found during dialogue with an alien. Knowing what they're saying and which thing to give them goes A LONG WAY towards getting blueprints and multitools worth having (3 hours in and I have a 14 slot multitool that only cost me 100 carbon)  So yeah, that's my review.

New species, new planets, new aliens, new languages, new trees, plants, fish, oceans, terrains, atmospheres, it's all about finding new things.  Trade, survival, civilizations, combat, all give your discovery context and meaning, but lead back to the roots of discovery for the sake of discovery, and what a lot there is to discover.  In my hours with No Man's Sky, I have been more immersed that any other game I've ever played, and I have an extensive library. Further, No Man's Sky technical marvels are beyond what I can possibly imagine.  If you have ANY sense of discovery, wonder, and adventure, then this game is for you. If you find that boring, or a silly premise for a game, then, by all means, don't play.  As far as technical issues go, I have faced none and the game plays around 40-60 fps in 1080p with an i7 3770k and a factory 980. Tips and tricks, try turning down the settings to Medium, still looks great and is very smooth, and also make sure your frame limited is set to Max in game.  TL;DR  If you have any wanderlust or adventure within yourself, I can recommend this game wholeheartedly.

            "review_text": "Kalosia, the planet that I had named after the Greek word for 'beautiful' and 'good', was my first planet in No Man's Sky. Unlike most of my friends who were excited to take their pre order ships into space right away, from the beginning I was absolutely enthralled by my planet and couldn't imagine leaving it so soon. I clumsily fumbled my way through my ship's repairations and, once finished, decided that it could wait. I was worried at what I'd miss on the ground while gliding through the skies, and so my journey began.  On foot, I turned myself in the opposite direction of my ship and started out. It was overwhelming at first. There were so many things to scan and creatures to chase and admire. While my goal was to 100% my planet, I also very much understood that I may not be able to. The only direction I knew to go was away from my ship, but occasionally markers would pop up on my screen of the direction of an undiscovered sight and I would head there before moving on with my journey. Quickly the feeling of being overwhelmed was replaced by excitement with each new discovery I unveiled. I walked, I explored, all while sustaining my life support and thermal protection from the plants and minerals I came across on my way. I turned to look at where my ship was and noticed I was 48 minutes walking distance from it, but had been traveling for over two hours, never going longer than 20-30 minutes without a new discovery.   When I was ready to move on, I realized with dismay how absolutely far I'd gone away from my ship and did not have the energy to travel all the way back. My goal then became to find a site with a beacon to summon my ship to me and then I could take my exploration to the stars. Not 20 minutes later, I came across a site with just that and as I got my arrangements in order for space flight, I realized I had ended up with a 100% on my planet. I claimed my large credit reward, but to me the real reward was being able to complete it without traveling to every corner of my planet, desperately looking for that final unidentified creature to fill my log. It all just happened as I walked in one direction, never going long without discovering something that to me made the entire trip worth while.  I don't know what it is about No Man's Sky. You're reading the review of a person who sticks usually to theme park MMO's or competitive multiplayer experiences, games with clear goals and directions in mind. I've tried unsuccessfully to get into other games where the point is to make your own way but they've never appealed to me in the slightest. This couldn't be more different with No Man's Sky. I feel like the wonder of being a kid and discovering video games for the first time can and is being relived with this game.   I'm very thankful to have had this experience at 7.4 hours in and am very much looking forward to many, many more.",

Think about the number of copies sold, look at the negative review numbers on Steam (and the other place) and you'll see that less than 5% of folks who have the game don't like it and a lot of folks posting about it don't have it, or couldn't understand/ run it and refunded.  Don't be dissuaded by the sheeple trying to trash the game; it is very deep, has a lot of strategies for playing, requires zero grinding &amp; may refresh your mathematical skills solving some of the puzzles.  Don't spoil it for yourself by watching any 'how to play' videos; just jump in, learn and enjoy the experience.  I'd say it does need a mature outlook to get the full enjoyment out of it, since there may be a lot of reading conversations and background lore (and nodding to Sci-Fi themes) in the quest paths.

I made sure I played my $60 worth but it was a dull and redundant experience after a while. It felt like an 'Early Access' game that cost as much as a AAA. And in truth- that's exactly what happened just different from any others I've played.   They now have added SO MUCH to the game... This update gives so many things that I cannot write it all, it's like reading Elite Dangerous patch notes except tehy're legible and you understand what they mean with out a degree in computer forensics. The best part is that they said it's the first of many free updates. So instead of charging $30 and then charging for Early Acces DLC (AHEM Ark: Survival Evolved) or instead of raising base-game price as new content is added (Osiris New Dawn).... they charged the AAA price without tellign anyone there would be extra added in the futuure for free.   I am now truly greatful I stuck it out and didn't refund. I'm glad I now have a compltely new game to play just when i had 'the itch' (I'm blaming my new Strix OC RX480 for said itch)   READ THE ADDED FEATURES; especially if you refunded. Buy the game.   No Man's Sky = Elite Dangerous + Subnautica...   If you enjoyed either of those games you should enjoy this as much as I do. I'm not a usual $60 game spender. I waited 8 months to get Fallout 4 even though I clocked over 600 hours in Skyrim. And though I'm not entirely sure yet that it's worth $60... Time will tell. But I already have 20+ hours at the time of this review. Which is technically 36 hours after I bought it so...

It's very relaxing to be able to just sit down and explore space or planets, and find underground cave networks that go on and on and on.   Likes: Freedom - You can do what ever you want when you want (as long as resources allow), and if you want to spend 10 hours on 1 planet finding ruins, transmission towers, and more you can. Want to farm resources on a planet then go sell them for the best prices possible so you can get that big ship? Go do it. Want to just hit space and name as many planets as possible? Go for it. No load times - There's no loading, you can go from a planet to space with no loading and it's very seemless. It transitions very well, and easily. I find myself doing it a lot and bouncing between planets in a system and not once have I had an issue with it. Only real load times in my opinion, are warps, but those are fairly quick and you don't really see them as load times. Massive Scale - This game is huge, the planets and moons are huge, and space is huge. Literally endless areas to explore and visit and alien lifeforms to discover and resources to farm. Hours of fun are to be had here.  Dislikes - It honestly feels like somethings missing, maybe its lack of multiplayer in a world where we've grown so used to 99% of games having some form of being able to play with your friends, or maybe it's just the fact that planets feel empty aside from ruins, transmission towers, observatories, etc and few and far inbetween alien life forms. Perhaps it's the fact we have so much potential that we can't help but let our mind wander a bit with features we'd like added. Either way it just feels like something is missing.   Don't get me wrong, I will be playing this game quite a bit. It will help me through down times at work, give me something to do in my free time, and even if I'm gaming with friends it'll be fun to play and compare what we're finding as we're playing. Just sucks we wont be able to join up together.   8/10",

Having amnesia I couldn't figure whether I'd taken a large of enough dose of acid to send a bull elephant on a week long trip or I actually did find an alien space craft parked ambiguously next to an alien themed park across the street from the deli. Well, my sense of deduction (among my other half functioning senses) told me things were just a bit too real.  It's been a few days, wandering around with a helmet eternally attached to my head and not one reflective surface to at least see what's been jammed on my head. I keep getting transmissions on what to do and all I know once I'm off this planet I'm going to jam my foot so far up their ♥♥♥ I'll find that left to get to Timbuktu. Or wherever. I've gotten all the parts necessary to repair my ship installed and am ready to leave this world, which I'm now convinced IS NOT a bad trip from some shady acid.  It's been about two weeks. Jumping planet to planet. Saw a creature that suspiciously looked like a flying ♥♥♥♥. And I don't mean from a lude minded standpoint. A giant flying one eyed male member fluttering through the sky against high hot winds on some other hell planet infested by those god damned flying robots. Found some of what I have dubbed 'space weed' after some deliberation and jerry rigging my suit to *ahem* 'process' some unusually familiar specimens on a planet I have dubbed 'Snoopy Droopy Dogg.' I'm sure that'll teach those dirty beak faced Gek. Trying to Gek my out of my units. 130K for a 18 slot multi-tool, I sure wish I could attack their little space station trading post. Let Space God 2.0 sort 'em out.  All in all so far I've enjoyed myself on this voyage. Not even sure if I'm in the Milky Way. Haven't found any alien hotties yet, that's a bummer. I guess I'd give this voyage so far a rating of of a smooth shave with a few knicks, not as clean as promised but presentable and I somehow expect that barber to continue improving on that shave, getting a bit cleaner with each knick over time.  Update 11/30/16-- after foundation update.  I built a small base today. Slapped on a flat clearing just West of a craggy ravine. Hot wind blows fierce during the day, while the night is plagued with cold winds which cut to the thermal inner layer of my suit. Wasn't to incredibly difficult, most of hubs, halls, bits and pieces could be built from local raw material. I hired a Gek craftsman and a one of those gear-heads as a scientist as residence in my new base.  Day two on this base. Running errands to get things set up with my new staff, hoping to see what new challenges await in this escapade. I found earlier during a storm I could transport between a space station and my base anywhere in the galaxy. I can craft beacons now to mark locations of interest on varying planets. I see these changes and say they are good.  Hopefully No Man's Pie will truly be served and we can eat it too.",

No substantial story to keep a lot of people hooked. Just a few tid bits of lore sprinkled here and there. You have to explore a lot to be able to fill in the lore for each race. Most of the animals all look like terrible creations made from a crazy mad scientist. Once and a while you will come across an animal that could be plausible. Sadly I havent run across a planet like the one from the original preview. One big let down was the reveal of no multiplayer. That was one of the main driving force for me to play.

I understand the game has a few bugs, though I've only found one game breaking bug where one multi-tool upgrade module on one planet in one building at one waypoint caused the game to crash. Other than that, the game lives up to what it was marketed to be.  If you do your research before buying this game (or any game), as you should, you'd see the metaphorical small print under where it says '18 quintillion unique planets' and that small print says 'procedurally generated'. Essentially, that means every planet is different on the surface but the same at its core. It would be nearly impossible for any game creator to design a game engine that would create a procedurally generated world as vast as this one AND have every aspect of that world be truly different in such a way that every new discovery would 'wow' you.  I have 33.4 hours on record for a reason. This game is chock full of wonders that, for me, never get old. Yes, you have to grind a bit to survive at first. Want to fix that? Upgrade your multi-tool. Get more slots, install more modules to destroy terrain faster, mine faster, reduce cooldown. That way you can make a 20 minute pit stop and have fuel for hours. You can also make money accumulation less 'grindy' by doing that, leaving loads of free time to EXPLORE.   In Summary: If you like to nit-pick irrelevant issues, this game is not for you. If you have the attention span of a humming bird, this game is not for you. If you expect more than what Hello Games says is in the game (e.g. more storyline depth, more alien races, more things in general), this game is not for you. If you feel entitled to everything and don't believe you should have to WORK to get materials, upgrade your equipment, etc. to a point where you don't have to grind anymore, this game is not for you.  However, if you like the videos and screen shots you see about No Man's Sky and you don't fit into one of the categories above, you will love this game. You will love the beautiful views on serene planets. You will love the sheer vastness of the game. You will love the fact that there are things to do every 20 feet on every one of the 18 quintillion planets available for you to explore at will (and in space), even if these things seem mildly repetitive because they are still fun. You will love the fact that you are truly free to do whatever you want, to BE whoever you want. You can spend your entire time being a botanist, zoologist, or geologist and document everything on every planet. You can be a scientist and focus on finding new technology and upgrading what you have. You can be a miner or farmer and trade vast quantities of materials. You can be a hunter or bounty hunter and hunt animals, kill sentinels, and destroy enemy starships. You can be a trader and hunt down rare materials, items, etc. and get rich. You can even be a pirate, friend of no one, and hunt friendly star ships for their loot. Or, you could follow Atlas's directive and travel to the center of the universe.

Now I wont try and draw attention away from the fact that the devs lied about alot of aspects of this game. the game does have some online features (just not multiplayer). if you wanted this game for high impact combat or action I would recomend a different game, at least at the moment. right now it is a fun way to waste a few hours. it is a calm adventure game that is mainly about discovering new spiecies of animals and plants. They say they might implement base building which would be very cool. The game feels like it has potential to be good, maybe through future updates they will add more features/objectives to keep the game interesting for longer. But I do not think it is as bad as some people are claiming. Just dont get this expecting CoD level action shooter or anything like that. this is a calm crafting/adventure game at the moment.",

The game is everything that was promised and more, IE. a gargantuan playspace filled with procedurally generated content. Sure some of it looks repetative, but then that's how the real world works too. Most of the differences are fairly subtle, and I'm fine with that. The game is about the experience of your journey, not about fulfilling objectives and reaching a finish line. If you're the kind of person who's sunk a respectable amount of time into games like Elite Dangerous, odds are you'll enjoy No Man's Sky. If you're the kind of person who needs someone to hold their hand to complete even the most basic of tasks, look elsewhere for your entertainment.  There's enough to do and see that no one will be able to see all of it in one lifetime.  Too many people have overhyped the game to themselves, and now that it isn't the second coming of Christ, but a reasonably well-made indie game on a larger budget, they're burning the house down.   Be aware however, that the combat is terrible. Once you get used to how it works you'll be able to hold your own, but it's a plodding and loose shooter both in space and on land. The flight controls are clunky if you're coming from a game like Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous. It's not a sim, so don't expect to fly like one.   The first hours are also difficult given the lack of tutorial or real explanation on how the different game systems work. You'll need to figure a lot of it out for yourself, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.   This game takes some getting used to, but once you do it's a fantastic experience. All in all, I highly recommend No Man's Sky to anyone with an interest in survival games (there is a survival element to this) or exploration/adventure games.",

As for people complaining that there is no multiplayer Hello Games isnt to blame they didnt promise multiplayer at all they said they will try to implement it and that said if they where successful you wouldnt see much of a diffrence because on how BIG the game is, you will barely if at all see any other players.

No Man's Sky fits the definition of an open world better than any game I've seen yet. Many of the planets that I have visited have felt unique. The size of each planet probably is larger than most maps made for other open world games such as Fallout 4 and GTA5. Combine that with thousands or millions of systems, and you have a world that is never going to be completely explored by you. You will leave a small mark on it by discoveries, viewable by all players should you upload them, and continue on your journey.  Your journey is open ended, and you can go wherever you feel like. No Man's Sky does give waypoints, but they are free for you to ignore and go back to later. The game will even provide new waypoints should you go a little bit too far from one, and it would be too hard to go back. Wherever your journey takes you, it will be a grind. You will find yourself repeating an action to fufill a blueprint technology, learning words to speak to aliens and gain from them better, fighting enemies that want to hinder your path, or simply mining to repair a broken part, or make something new. It is impossible to just do something; you must work and maintain to reach your goals.  No Man's Sky is the biggest endgame I've played, so big it didn't need to include the originial story, because the original story stopped mattering when it ended.

Yeah, and while playing I've had moments of boredom while visiting another bleak 'shades of brown' planet, but I've also visited planets where I've just stood still and stared in amazement at the incredibly vivid and varied landscapes.

When you find rare materials where if you harvest them the galactic police will come after you, that is a lot of fun to see how many you can grab quickly and get away without dying. I have only encountered 2 such planets that have these rare materials but it allowed me to accumulate a lot of credits and buy a nice ship.

This is one of the most unique games that I have ever experienced and it deserves merit for it's ridiculously large sense of scale. I have never seen an exploration/survival game that makes you feel like you are jumping galaxies and traversing new terrain.  The beating heart of this game is mining and collecting resources...so if you don't like that mechanic than this game isn't for you. Sure, there is a vague, over-arching purpose of finding the center of the universe, but this game is about exploration and looting. The exploration in this game is at-your-own-pace--it is relaxing and it's what sets it apart from other games. To me that is the most rewarding part. If you were looking for a linear story to guide you to every point of the game, well...you won't find that here.   Many people are complaining that this game is monotonous and boring because they aren't seeing enough variance in the biodiversity and the topography. Well. I have some advice for you. Don't sit on one planet and go to every waypoint. Hyperdrive to other solar systems where you can mine rare minerals and discover new species of wildlife. I discovered a snow-covered planet with many mult-tiered docking stations that offered many rare items I was seeking. I've also seen deserts, plains, and planets with nuclear storms as well as woodlands.   The alien and animal life is procedural just as the terrain is. The interaction between the sentient aliens is similar to Mass Effect where you are given a dialogue tree and a certain response will illicit greater rewards. The animal interaction is real-time. I've seen gliding animals that you can befriend or kill for Carbon, cattle-like creatures with horns that attacked me so I bolcasted them and was rewarded with resources. I have yet to see giant wildlife but perhaps I will find something in another star sytem.  Before the game came out for PC I was reading reviews by Kotaku and Polygon stating that the game 'wasn't what they thought'--that they wished it was more about exploration and less about survival. Well, what would the game be without the survival element? If there is no danger can the game be fun at all? I'm sure if they had taken away that aspect of the game people would complain that they wished it were more difficult.  After pumping more than 20hrs in looting and collecting resources as well as upgrading my ship and my tools I can say that this game will become more about exploration as you progress further. Folks have been whining that the inventory management is a pain. Well, guess what? You get to upgrade the inventory space of your ship as well as your Multi-tool and your Exo suit. As you progress forward there are moments where you must decide what is the most valuable item or resource and what you can do without. That is part of the challenge of the game and this style of inventory management is nothing new in crafting games or any open-world RPG for that matter. The more upgraded space you have mid-game the more resources you will be able to hold which will yield longer periods of exploration. Oh dear, people just love to complain.  I am surprised by all of the negativity surrounding this game. Hello Games did not try to please the casual gamer but perhaps the truly die-hard survival fans. They have created an addicting mining/resource management game with a focus on survival and exploration. This is what they said the game was before its release date and that is exactly what they have delivered.",

When you play World of Warcraft and go to a new place, or finish a quest, you know that thousands, maybe millions of people have done the same before you.  In no Man's Sky, so far as far as is known, only two players have ever been to the same planet. Looking over the horizon and seeing something no-one ever saw before... there is something essentially human about that which has almost been lost. It gives you a sweet pang of loneliness, isolation, pride, joy.

            "review_text": "UPDATE: so, a little update after passing my 100-hour mark. The game has obviously lost a bit of addictiveness after the 40-50-hour mark, but it''s still going strong in my gaming-day. It has definitely changed from the run to the upgrade that was before, now it's more like a veeery relaxing, very calm experience where I get to jump from system to system, finish the things I have to finish (achievements, languages, a couple of rare crafting blueprints), check out the world around me, mine some eridium, etc. Performace has been a bit up and down with the updates, it started okay, it went down quickly in the subsequent weeks and just last week got back up with the last update (the devs are doing a hell of a job working non-stop to fix all the performance issues). I still experience stuttering when moving quickly, I'm starting to think my processor (AMD A8 5600) might not be up to the task because I see it 100%-ing all the time when I get framerate drops.  The story, or better, the lore it's getting clearer now, especially reading Reddit daily. It feels like a huge jigsaw puzzle where the whole internet needs to put everything together in order to find the right key in which to read the great amount of informations and stories left around in this universe. Definitely something to keep you even more addicted. For example, the abandoned buildings stories didn't make much sense to me at the beginning and they felt like some sort of collateral, secondary stories, while now that I'm getting the big picture they DEFINITELY feel like the pivotal point of the whole history of our character.  One last thing I feel very different about my previous review is that I was critiquing the soundtrack to be underused. I have to say that, after 100 hours, I can still hear music that I haven't heard before! Sometimes a song starts and I'm like 'wait -- this one is new'. All the subtleties of the sounds are amazing, the footsteps when you run, the breath when you run out of stamina that has a deeper, helmet-like ambience, the bleeps and boops that sometimes you hear while you cruise into space, the animal voices, everything in the sound compartment is INCREDIBLE. Not only from the amazing band which is 65daysofstatic but also from all the ambience that surrounds you. Amazing job!  Now, to the question. Do I recommend this game?  There's been quite some hate on this game, a lot of very contrasting opinions and so the only thing I can say is that this game is EXCELLENT in the first 15 hours, then it gets a bit more subtle. The game switches quickly from what you can do to what you can see, and I feel like the latter part hasn't been appreciated by most.  If you decide to buy this game, do so expecting a very subtle, relaxing experience that will bring you into a parallel universe. It won't always be exciting, it won't always be funny, but it will definitely be worth living.   If you get this game right, it can potentially walk with you through a large part of your life, kind of what Minecraft or World of Warcraft do.  I obviously recommend you to get it if you're into this mood, but if you're expecting big blows, explosions, fights runs and action, then stay away from it because it has basically none.  ------  After three years of patient (and unpatient) wait, I've finally had my chance to play my first 5-hours session in No Man's Sky, a game that I've dreamed about since I was a kid in the '80s. This game is absolutely what I was waiting for: a space traveller sim, a minecraft in weird exoplanets, a chill game and a survival-inspired experience.  I won't stay long on why you should or should not buy this game, you'll read plenty of better reviews on the media in the next few days, so I'll just address something that I haven't seen addressed around so far: don't buy this game if you don't like the survival games.   In fact, NMS is inspired by the likes of not only the survival section of Minecraft, but also to the slow-paced feeling of that masterpiece called The Long Dark, which the developers openly admitted to have partly gained inspiration from (even though NMS is not as hardcore and difficult as TLD is). Inventory management is absolutely a huge part of the game, and as I can understand people hating to do that, I feel - being part of the survival-lovers audience, that the inventory management is absolutely spot-on and give that challenge that most of us are looking into modern gaming.   So be advised: NMS is flying with ships, is mining resources, is upping your tools, and NMS is also managing your inventory and put a brake to your hoarding syndrome.   Another tip: there's a great little game called Out There, from a couple of years ago, that was some sort of pacifist FTL spinoff. Well, Hello Games must have played Out There a long time because EVERYTHING in No Man's Sky is a 3D reenacting of the 2D interface of Out There, from the inventory slots shared between tech and elements, monoliths, the language-learning sub-game, mining, etc. Which is great, because Out There is a small gem.

With that, many people won't like this game, but if you can sit back and enjoy the beautiful scenery and exploration, you'll enjoy it.  Pros: -Constant Progression -Open ended decision making (through exploration and NPC communication) -Beautiful scenery and overall aesthetic -Broad and great color scheme  -Easy to pick up -Quality sound effects -Decent ground combat -Terrific space combat -Fun and 'Star Wars' like space travel mechanics -You get to name everything you discover  Cons:  -Repetitive -Virtually all planets have life so it's not as special to come across -Spaceship feels clunky on planet -Constant mining simulator -Most plant, animal, NPC, and ship designs are repetitive -No good way to traverse land on foot -Every solar system has a handful of  NPCs and a handful of NPCs only. There are no larger civilizations to find -Every 'quest' is essentially the same, there is no diversity -Not much NPC communications outside of trading or one lined confrontations.

As I said, people should read description before buying. It is NOT a game for everyone, as the developers in fact had already clearly said. This is not fast paced action, it is not a shooter, mmorpg or competitive PvP. It is single player, sci-fi space exploration/survival set in a procedurally generated open practically endless open world/universe.  It has very old-school touch to it, both in terms of gameplay (very arcade-like), as well as in terms of artistic style, sound. etc. It has kind of retrofuturist feel to it. The game manages to capture the classical 20th century sci-fi aesthetics.  NMS is definately already an important part of video gaming history, it is superoriginal in both gameplay and visuals. But before buying you definately need to read the description. The game is exactly what has been promised.

The only comment on development I'll make, besides that I kept myself in near radio silence on it's hype machine, is that this game would have been better served as not a PS4 retail game AND have released as an Early Access title.   Overall, I've greatly enjoyed No Man's Sky. There are definitely some ups and down to the experience, but this feels firmly in the realm of survival type games I have played before with the added benefit of gorgeous vistas. I solely play this game to check the boxes of the things offered as a part, but really enjoy the framing and making screenshots. Yea, it's not really the game persay, but it's what I enjoy; the vast display of various vistas, animals, and plants you can find. I've only explored a few systems in my initial 20 hours, but I can say it's been enjoyable. Peaking over hills, under rocks, and hunting down good shots is definitely something I love.   So basically, as an experience, it's great. As a light game, it's good. What is was hyped to be? Not even close. Largely incomplete at the time of this writing. That said, I would still buy it.

            "review_text": "I bought this game twice - once for PS4, once for PC. The negative reviews here have some truth to them, there are bugs. The PC version here on Steam is definitely a port, and it's got downsides and glitches. I didn't experience the '10fps' or crashes that others did, but I know that porting these things can be a real science unto itself, and I believe that others have those problems, and that you might too. But having lived through gaming in the 2000's, I can tell you that it's not a horrific port. It's not a great port, but trust me, this is just 'mediocre', it's not 'terrible'.  But i think that detractors miss the fact that this is a fantastic game. I enjoy singleplayer games, I like exploration and combat and crafting. I'm a huge space fan. And I'm alright with the game not being 100% astronomically accurate when it comes to things like not being able to fly into the sun or the planets not orbiting. These are gameplay decisions that I think make sense. What would you -do- with a gas giant or a sun anyway? Can't land on them. If i wanted Spaceship Simulator, I'd play Kerbal. The focus of this game is complete, seamless freedom of movement. And it accomplishes that beautifully - i expected that there'd be some fake loading sequence as you enter or leave a planet; some kind of 'reentry' mode where you're not actually moving while it loads. But it truly is a seamless transition. (jumping between solar systems is, regrettably, a loading screen, though).  There are multiple ways to progress in the game, too. You can craft upgrades for suit, ship, and gun. Fuel for your ship is a goal, parts for crafting, exploring the lore, learning new words in alien languages, it's got a variety of things to do. Some people complained about being bored - I don't know how. I found myself constantly feeling like I had _too much_ to do, too many things to collect, discover, name, learn, buy, sell, and craft.  And while you may notice patterns after a while (I found nearly-identical creatures on two planets, once), that's a limitation of our expectations. True alien life may not even look like life to us at all - so complaining that the depiction of alien life in NMS is reptative ignores that life on earth is reptative. NMS sets out to make animals and plants that we can usually identify as an animal or plant - not to create 18 quintillion evolutionary histories.  I think the people complaining about the game were ones who didn't know what to expect. Who wanted some kind of space MMO, or a ripoff of Elite: Dangerous where you can fight on planets too. That's not what this game is, there are other games like that, and you can play them. This doesn't have to follow that formula.  As of writing, I have about 25 hours on PS4 (in addition to steam hours). I don't regret it, I love this game. Maybe it'll get old soon, maybe I'll figure out how it works and not be surprised or interested in exploring anymore. But that's every game ever. I have a steam library full of games that I once enjoyed, but wouldn't play today because I've already been there and done that. This game doesn't have to last you for the rest of your life, you just have to enjoy it for $60 worth of your time to make it worth it. And for me, it's definitely made up that pricetag.",

The thrill of going to a new planet and seeing what's on it is the main point of this game, and everything else is just extra. I've been playing for almost 30 hours already and it's felt like only a few. I don't mind the grindey nature of upgrading your stuff, and it feels like if Destiny + Minecraft were combined. With that being said, the game isn't perfect. The crafting UI could use some automation, and there could be more to talking with NPCs than a riddle or math question with an instant reward. I'm okay with the game not having much story or quests, but at some point after grinding my way up to the top, the exploration might seem repetitive. If HG adds content with updates I see myself continuing to explore. The hype train was huge, and for me it is scratching that space exploration itch I've wanted for awhile. I don't fault Hello Games for selling out to Sony at all. The game wouldn't even be close to this sucessful if they had released it as an alpha on greenlight so they clearly made the right decision. It's debatable whether or not the price of the game justifies its amount of content, but I'm not regretting my purchase at all so far.",

I will recommend this game even if price is too high (for ppl who don't want to buy, you have to wait some time until price will go to 50 %)  I'm enjoying this game cause is something new and I love exploring planets and new entities even if it's a little repetitive sometimes.  So my rating for this game is 9/10. I was going to give it 10/10 if those bugs weren't in game.",

NMS provides the feeling of awe and wonder when you first jump in your ship and hit that pluse drive or when you discover a big beautiful planet with different variety of plants and animals along with different minerals and resources. With all that in mind this game was way over hyped and expectation was blown way out of proportion. This game, at first, disappointed me in a bad way. I wanted a refund, uninstalled the game and was upset. I had my fair share of bugs and glitches but this game took the cake, at first. Then I took a deeper look as to why the game wasn't loading at all and fixed it with a friend's help. Then the game took me by storm, I couldn't match the trailer and how that looked to the 'T. But i still got pretty damn close. SO.... Overall the game still was fun and wonderful, but sometimes you can get burnt out on it, pick it up later and you will still find something brand new you haven't seen before and it will take you back to the same wonder and amazement that made me and many more players fall in love. Disclaimer: this game is not for everyone!!!!! For example those who don't like FPS or adventure/exploring, but i still implore to give it a chance even though it's not your cup of tea.... I give No Man's Sky a 4/5 rating!!! I hope all of you find this review helpful.",

It's an amazing concept, it has so much to explore and do, but on the other hand it is endless grind to get resources to do it. After a while the resources become patterns of movement on a planet to achieve a goal. But that is exactly what the producers said the game would be, exploration based game so a lot of opinions out there that the game is not what it was set out to be is wrong. I have 11 hours so far, and in this time I have, without rushing, managed to explore 4 planets and 1 moon quite thoroughly, warped once to another cluster of planets and bought a new ship for roughly 2m units. That's only 11 hours. If you are the kind of person that enjoyed Ark, Mincraft and other resource grinders you will love this. If you are a COD kid with an adrenaline addiction you will give it a bad review. You don't go around fightinging everythign that walks, it's not even remotely on the same par with violence as Ark is. Things usually don't want to kill you, and even if they do, you have enough time to get away. I understand that I have not spawn on a planet that is very violent, something I will most likely experience, but so far it has been nothing but pleasurable.  To address people's comment on performance issues. I have played this game since about 6 hours after it came out. PC Specs (i7-6700k, GTX 970 SLI, DDR4 3200mhz ram 32GB) and I run the game maxed out on every setting. So far the only time I had frame drop to around 60 was on a planet with extreme amounts of grass, water and snowy patches. Other than that the game has run smoothly nearby the 100 fps mark.  So overall, I'm leaning towards recommending the game.",

Yes you still have to gather recources to keep upgrading and to keep yourself allive, but it is a space exploration game and that was to be expected. Next to that, the 'keeping allive' part only has a marginal impact on your time since it is extremely easy to keep your suit etc. powered.  Performance wise: runs great on my machine, got everything on ultra, running a smooth 60fps without problems. Only graphical issue is the steam overlay while in stations, this seems to result in flickering of the screen while a steam notification is open in the bottom right.

            "review_text": "UPDATE: so, a little update after passing my 100-hour mark. The game has obviously lost a bit of addictiveness after the 40-50-hour mark, but it''s still going strong in my gaming-day. It has definitely changed from the run to the upgrade that was before, now it's more like a veeery relaxing, very calm experience where I get to jump from system to system, finish the things I have to finish (achievements, languages, a couple of rare crafting blueprints), check out the world around me, mine some eridium, etc. Performace has been a bit up and down with the updates, it started okay, it went down quickly in the subsequent weeks and just last week got back up with the last update (the devs are doing a hell of a job working non-stop to fix all the performance issues). I still experience stuttering when moving quickly, I'm starting to think my processor (AMD A8 5600) might not be up to the task because I see it 100%-ing all the time when I get framerate drops.  The story, or better, the lore it's getting clearer now, especially reading Reddit daily. It feels like a huge jigsaw puzzle where the whole internet needs to put everything together in order to find the right key in which to read the great amount of informations and stories left around in this universe. Definitely something to keep you even more addicted. For example, the abandoned buildings stories didn't make much sense to me at the beginning and they felt like some sort of collateral, secondary stories, while now that I'm getting the big picture they DEFINITELY feel like the pivotal point of the whole history of our character.  One last thing I feel very different about my previous review is that I was critiquing the soundtrack to be underused. I have to say that, after 100 hours, I can still hear music that I haven't heard before! Sometimes a song starts and I'm like 'wait -- this one is new'. All the subtleties of the sounds are amazing, the footsteps when you run, the breath when you run out of stamina that has a deeper, helmet-like ambience, the bleeps and boops that sometimes you hear while you cruise into space, the animal voices, everything in the sound compartment is INCREDIBLE. Not only from the amazing band which is 65daysofstatic but also from all the ambience that surrounds you. Amazing job!  Now, to the question. Do I recommend this game?  There's been quite some hate on this game, a lot of very contrasting opinions and so the only thing I can say is that this game is EXCELLENT in the first 15 hours, then it gets a bit more subtle. The game switches quickly from what you can do to what you can see, and I feel like the latter part hasn't been appreciated by most.  If you decide to buy this game, do so expecting a very subtle, relaxing experience that will bring you into a parallel universe. It won't always be exciting, it won't always be funny, but it will definitely be worth living.   If you get this game right, it can potentially walk with you through a large part of your life, kind of what Minecraft or World of Warcraft do.  I obviously recommend you to get it if you're into this mood, but if you're expecting big blows, explosions, fights runs and action, then stay away from it because it has basically none.  ------  After three years of patient (and unpatient) wait, I've finally had my chance to play my first 5-hours session in No Man's Sky, a game that I've dreamed about since I was a kid in the '80s. This game is absolutely what I was waiting for: a space traveller sim, a minecraft in weird exoplanets, a chill game and a survival-inspired experience.  I won't stay long on why you should or should not buy this game, you'll read plenty of better reviews on the media in the next few days, so I'll just address something that I haven't seen addressed around so far: don't buy this game if you don't like the survival games.   In fact, NMS is inspired by the likes of not only the survival section of Minecraft, but also to the slow-paced feeling of that masterpiece called The Long Dark, which the developers openly admitted to have partly gained inspiration from (even though NMS is not as hardcore and difficult as TLD is). Inventory management is absolutely a huge part of the game, and as I can understand people hating to do that, I feel - being part of the survival-lovers audience, that the inventory management is absolutely spot-on and give that challenge that most of us are looking into modern gaming.   So be advised: NMS is flying with ships, is mining resources, is upping your tools, and NMS is also managing your inventory and put a brake to your hoarding syndrome.   Another tip: there's a great little game called Out There, from a couple of years ago, that was some sort of pacifist FTL spinoff. Well, Hello Games must have played Out There a long time because EVERYTHING in No Man's Sky is a 3D reenacting of the 2D interface of Out There, from the inventory slots shared between tech and elements, monoliths, the language-learning sub-game, mining, etc. Which is great, because Out There is a small gem.

Yes, the graphics aren't quite as great as they were in the trailers and I had to play around with the settings a little to get good fps, but still, I am completely sucked into this game. I have no lag whatsoever and I quite like the graphics, actually. It's all Sean Murray ever promised and I assume that a lot of people were immensely hyped for the game, expecting things it was never said to have. Its what always happens when a game is overhyped. Okay, Murray did say that we would be able to meet other players, which we are not, apparently, but as he always said that we should think of it as - essentially - a single player game, I don't really care.   Then again, No Man's Sky is not a game for everyone. Its for the kind of people who like playing Minecraft in Single-Player mode, without mods. Its for people who like taking their time, exploring, who don't need tons of action in order to enjoy a game. If that sounds like you, buy the game. You won't regret it.",

I do have things I wish were different but nothing that I would use to claim someone should not get the game.

Specificlly the control settings are lacking in that some keys seem to not be able to be reassigned and like 99% of all games this one seems to not realize i have a 7 button mouse.  The only other thing I dislike is how the game keeps you from crashing into the planet when flying around on the planet (in other words the flight on planet is not like in space and the game trys to keep you flat along the same plane of the planets surface)  The only issue I had was the game was I had to change the resolution to 1280x720 and sometimes I click to run the game and after a few sec nothing happens so I simply run it again and it starts.  As for graphics settings I did not change. I dont know what my FPS is at but it feels smooth and look ok when taking into account how this game is rendering the game differently from other games.

I doubt there's much middle ground.   The graphics are gorgeous. The universe is alive and varied. And it can be very fun. But the actual mechanics of the game are highly repetitive and there's aspects that seemingly try to work against you (piloting the ship, for example). Really, the only big hook here is the vast universe, as the gameplay isn't terribly inspired or deep.  Ultimately, your enjoyment of the game will hinge on whether or not you can lose yourself in the nearly endless universe. If spending hours scouring an obscure planet to find one more bizarre lifeform, one more hidden station, one more blueprint tucked away in some terminal can suck you in, then you can easily forgive the basic and repetitive gameplay. If not, or if you're looking for something more action-packed, this ain't a game for you.  This is a lonely, contemplative exploration game with a weak crafting system and a lot of tasks repeated ad nauseum. But when it works, it's spectacular in its immersion.",

However, I pushed on and suddenly realized that upgrading was fairly easy to do. I increased my inventory, purchased a new ship with more space and better hyperspace drives and moved onto the next galaxy. I saw some life on planets along with exploring and finding some crazy rare items to sell at trade centers. I was so into it I forgot about the fact that I was seeing fairly similar planets, even though the amount of systems are supposed to be virtually endless. Sure, there are some with different toxicity levels, arctic levels or ones that will give you heat stroke. The absolute vastness alone is what drives you, not knowing what's next or the curiosity of what's still out there to explore. At times you feel like you've seen it all. Other times you feel like you are mining resources on this random planet for no other purpose than to answer that question of, 'Well maybe there is something so unique or crazy out there that all my time will be worth it.' I still can't answer that question.  13 hours in and I really am enjoying the experience. That's what this is though, I wouldn't label it a game in any sort of means. It's an experience. I think behind the visuals and algorithms to blend the experience together took a lot of work and by no means was it an easy process. I never really desired this game for more than what it is right now, considering there is so much to still discover and so much potential for this artform to become an actual game someday.  Is it for everyone? No, absolutely not. Only people who enjoy the idea of exploration. Is it worth $60? No. If there was more substance built into the other elements then maybe.  My only complaint. In playing this now and for however long I plan on doing so. The idea behind No Mans Sky is exploration. They have created something so massive that they lost the ability to design anything with substance. Why bother creating a true to size planet if each planet follows a fairly similar patern or elements or general rules. There should have been a higher degree of randomization in each system and planet. The idea of discovery begins to fade for almost everyone once you hit a threshold of limitation in what is supposed to be a virtually endless world.  The only way I can compare this game is that they created something too big for such a small purpose. Exploration should be that sense of the uknown. I feel as if in my journey, there are still some of those uknowns. However, in the grand scale of this project... I feel as if i'm looking at uniformity where chaos should reign.

Discovery is the main objective and there's a hell of a lot to find, which is great if that's what you want in this game. If you're expecting much more than that, you'll be disappointed. The aliens you meet add to the universe but they are too spread out for it to feel like a functioning universe. Completely empty planets would be an interesting mix but I haven't run into any yet. There don't seem to be populated areas, just one alien at an outpost or space station, and if you're lucky you'll run into a few aliens who dock at the station while you're there.  The audio is absolutely a highlight of NMS. Mellow exploration music quickly transitions to up-tempo rock music during combat. If you paid attention to just the music, you could find yourself flying around for hours just to hear the soundtrack.  The framerate issues are well-documented and the reason is a bad console port. The spaceship movement feels very wrong if you want to do precision flying. The ship seems to just do what it wants instead of what you want. The mouse feels floaty, especially during combat. The discovery screen takes 10 or 12 seconds to go away, in which you can do very little. It wouldn't be an issue if it didn't happen every time you did something the game deems remarkable, but it happens way too often and pulls you out of the immersion. They needed more time to fix not only the bad port but the questionable choices (such as the bad field of view, which feels claustrophobic even when set to maximum).  Hopefully they can fix the big issues soon and make this game better. I think they also need to drop the price but if you can get it on a good sale, give it a go.  TL;DR: fun, shallow, pick up if you want to fly in space and explore planets. Great music. Wait for a good discount and for them to fix the glaring issues.",

Hell have a developer starter planet you launch off from the explore new worlds, hell have it be everyones homeworld with metropolis' and what not.

There's a reasonable amount of incentive to explore with flora and fauna to catalogue for a monetary reward, upgrade blueprints to discover, crashed ships to restore and a vague but somewhat compelling story to uncover. In all honesty I'm sure the novelty will be quick to wear off but as this is procedurally generated using a limited number of conditions I don't know why people were expecting a unique experience on every planet. It would have been nice if there were more assets to at least maintain the illusion of variety for a little longer, but the veil would still have been lifted at some point.  It would however be nice if there were more career paths than 'get to the centre of the universe' but again expectations should perhaps be adjusted.  With that said this game is definitely over-priced for the content available and may have received more favourable reviews if sold at a price more reflective of this. It's still worth a play but I'd recommend waiting for it to depreciate if you need to be careful with your money.",

If you are expecting a shoot em up, high action MMORPG, or a scientifically accurate space simulator, this is not the game.   If you do want a sci-fi, fantasy, exporation game, with some space combat rolled in that you can take at your own pace while seeing and naming things no one has ever seen before, then this game is for you! I have seen some absoultely stunning sunsets, landscapes, and definately enjoy flying seamlessly from surface to space and back.   It also isn't so complicated you can't play it without learning a bible of controls like many space games. It is a bit lonesome and desolate, but with the mining, crafting, and upgrading you begin to see how the game is largely designed to take you on a journey and the more you put into the exporation and discovery, the faster you will be able to get to the center, which seems to be the overarching goal.  I feel like the game was ambitious and groundbreaking in some ways, and it will probably garner a healthy following once people settle in to what the game is and what it isn't. I may never finish it, but I am already having fun which is this goal of any game!",

After a weekend of playing No Man's Sky I can say that despite the problems i'm enjoying it, and some of those problems have cleared up with the experimental patch fix. I have found that for some strange reason playing the game in 'Bordered' mode halves the loading time and reduces the performance stuttering, however I have a 2gb graphics card and after about an hour memory problems reduce the frame rate to a standstill forcing me to restart (Hello Games say they are working to fix this). This all seems very curable so I look forward to big improvements over the next few weeks. Shame Hello Games couldn't sort this out from the start but given the game underneath I am prepared to cut them some slack.  There is a lot of resource collecting so keep that in mind if you don't enjoy looking for crafting ingredients that you need to progress or improve. If you've not felt the need to purchase the game just yet but are still interested, do yourself a favour and hold off until more patches have been released to fix the problems. Hopefully some of the fixes will include improvements to the interface which just aren't suited to mouse and keyboard (if nothing else, just let me type in quantities I wish to buy and sell).  Top Tip: If you accept the help of Atlas at the beginning don't ignore their messages for too long, if you do there will be questions you keep asking that are unlikely to be answered.",

Unfortunally, people love to ♥♥♥♥♥ about that stuff and give the game a negative review. The PC port got off to a shaky start, but now it has seem to have stablize a little bit, and I can only expect better performance to come with later updates. Hello Games has stated that more content is coming in the future after they address the most immediate problems.  The game offers a great amount of exploration and survival aspects, again dispite some promised features being not included at the moment, the game is setup to offer lots of hours of exploration. Trading is ok, you can sell some items for more with certain people at outposts or at space stations. Space battles leaves something to be desired, since you cannot chose which side you directly fight for, which leads to both fighting parties shooting at you. So far in my adventures, Planets are pretty subpar. Planets are cool and scale really well, but animal life is sparse and doesn't show up as much. Elements are abundant, but the game doesn't tell you that you can destroy terrian with a multi-tool mod. Monoliths offer the player to earn Alien languages, and on some planets they're alot of them. Combat is straight stupid I'm afraid. Sentinals are push overs and don't offer much of a challenge. Wildlife can attack you as well but still leaves some to be desired.   I love the idea of travelling from multiple systems and planets, and being able to name them adds some fun to the game. The one thing I would love to see is the ability to rename your spacecraft. I'm suprised it wasn't there at first. Mods are a life saver to be honest. I quickly removed the Chromatic Abboration and scanlines and that has greatly improved my experience. They're lots of mods that offer performance improvement, so if you need it, they're there for you to fiddle with. I wait to see more feature rich mods come to the table.  No Man's Sky is fun. I recommend it to anyone that likes survival or exploration games. I'm more of a FPS player, but this game has stolen my time where is was mostly taken up by DOOM. However, I don't believe it is worth the $60 price tag. I would either wait for a Steam Sale or go on key sites like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Intial Thoughts: Since I have been following the development of this game for a considerable time I purchased it based on the what I had read and seen pre-release. Pre-release reviews are very hard to guage considering the title has been in development for five years and many things with regard to game play and styling changed throughout development, however as I like the game style and the genre (I play elite and I enjoy Sci-fi) I was going to buy it anyway regardless.  Play Style: Just like in Elite Dangerous there is grind, it's unavoidable if you want to craft, buy a better ship or purchase items through the market. The crafting system is straighforward and eases you into more complex recipes as you progress through the game. You have to hunt for elements and manage inventory slots in order to create the more complicated stuff like warp fuel (this can also be puchased from traders). You gain credits from selling discovered items, places or materials on the market or by selling to traders either on the planets or on space stations. The markets are very simple and cannot be compared to the likes of elite or eve, however they are functional.   The flight model is basic with simplified controls but fits in with the styling of the game. Don't expect a DCS is space this was not what the game was designed to be like. Combat on the surface and in space is pretty basic. I could find no way of locking a particular target (unless I missed this control somewhere) however I could stand my ground easily against a few targets at once. Weapons like everything else in the game can be upgraded and added to through the crafting system.  Closing thoughts: There seems to be a large number of negative reviews about this game, many are as a result of the game either crashing, poor frame rates or just not starting at all. Some reviews have been made with 30 mins of gameplay, how a proper view of a game can be made in so little time I just cant understand?? Many of the issues seem to be linked to AMD chips. As I run on an Intel i7 clocked to 4.7Mhz, 32gb of ram and use a GTX 980Ti I have experienced no problems with regard to frame rates or crashes. There was some stuttering to begin with but this dissapeared after the day one patch.  Overall I like this game, If you like crafting, Trading, exploring and the Sci-Fi genre then you will enjoy this game go buy it!",

Why did you buy the game then? If you didn't know exactly what it was, if you weren't following the releases of game play and updates, if you never saw Sean (the creator) talk about what the game is, then buying the game and then being dissapointed in it is ridiculous. Of course I'd be disappointed too if I bought lego star wars expecting to buy a game akin to Battlefront. Yeah, I'd hate the Minecraft if I was expecting Skyrim out of it. Seriously, all the bad reviews I've read, the people obviously didn't know what they were buying.  Here's the thing, go watch some gameplay, watch the trailers and E3 demos, read what Sean has said about his vision for the game, and if you think you'd be down for that, then buy it. This game delivers everything it said in would, and more in my opinion. I think the game is vast in its beauty, not just aesthetically. What the game is is a masterpiece, honestly one of the funnest games I've played ever. But I like this kind of stuff out of a game. If you don't, then of course I'm not going to recommend it. Sean himself has said that this game is certainlly not going to be for everyone.

I have to say I'm blown away it does everything I expected and since launch I've spent 10 hours in the gane and plan on spending alot more.  I've explored two systems so far and about 9 planets and each felt very individual, some assets are reused but this is to be expected in such a large game. I find myself landing on a planet for a quick look then getting carried away exploring all the waypoints and doing my best to document the flora and fauna.  Performance wise I'm running a reasonable PC with a below average graphic card and getting a smooth gameplay experience, certainly it's very playable.  The game I feel is not for everyone it your looking for a fast action packed experience then you may need to give it a miss but if you like to play relaxed games were you set your own objectives and move forward at a steady pace exploring and discovering as you go then give it a shot.  Finally I have to mention the music and sound which really adds to the atmosphere, exploring a planet as nightfalls is a real experience and the screenshots I've taken are amazing.  Hope this review helps as I feel the game is not getting treated fairly due to all the hype surrounding it. Go in with an open mind and see where the game takes you hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

Not for the reason that it may be badly optomized for many people, nor for the fact that people believe that this game is just repetitive exploration. I would not recommend this for most gamers out there because No Man's Sky is not a game that was meant to appeal to everyone's tastes. It is a simple game that came from the collective creativity of those at Hello Games.   Hello Games had a vision with No Man's Sky, and they wanted to do everything in their power to keep the final product as close to that vision as they could. Sure, they may have been a bit secretive about No Man's Sky, but that does not mean that they did not create a great game. They created something that may even revolutionize how the gaming industry sees their products.   With so many delays and such a great amount ambiguity surrounding the game before its launch, It's no wonder gamer's were disappointed. We began to artificially hype this game to more than it was ever supposed to be. We disappointed ourselves with our own delusions. Hello Games did not develop a bad game, we as a community imagined a game that was not developed. We will continue to disappoint ourselves as long as we keep hyping up games as we did this one. Personally, I enjoy this game, but it has its fair share of flaws. It may not be worth $60, but it is a game I do not regret trying.   Game developers should learn from Hello Games. While appeasing everyone is the safest route for a game developer to take, maybe it's time to try something a little risky despite the fact that it may end in failure. How else will our generations shape the world. Will we continue to throw our money at the Call of Dutys and Battlefields of the future, or will we be the generations that defines the gaming industry for generations to come.  I will not recommend this game for everyone because not everyone will enjoy it. As a game, it is pretty mediocre, but it has the potential to open people's minds to a new era of gaming.",

I will fall into a minority with my reasoning, but I'm ok with that. As it turns out, having 'cheated' and alterned the universe to peek behind the curtains and look at the elements that can be found, I can see that what I was looking for is there. If I would be patient. I suspect that this game's percieved short comings come, in part, from it's scale. Most current games are built on a much shorter time to reward. And this is not. Things have been shown in the gameplay videos and discussions of the play after putting in many, many hours. This game is offering needles in vast haystacks. And if you take your time, the journey through the haystack is beautiful and pretty interesting. In such a vast space, created largely algorithmically, even the things they show in the videos are only going to be found on a very few of so many quintillion of planets. Some other things, more often. but magic combinations that are the needles are very rare. So I don't blame people for being frustrated. I hope the next weeks allow those who want to go, to go ahead and head on to other experiences. Once that drama has settled, I hope Hello Games has the chance to keep enriching the math to bury more needles out there to be found for those hoping to spend a lot of time lost in the endless haystack.",

The game has never crashed on me and runs great maxed out (AMD FX-6300, GTX 960).  I started out really confused but excited as I entered this strange new world as my character wakes up along side their crashed ship. You spawn on a random planet out in the middle of a random system (in my experience, I did start over because I had to restart the program to change the graphic settings). I then met some spiky, red, pulsating, levitating dog toy called 'The Atlas' that told me a bunch of stuff I didn't understand in the confusion of the new game. I took some time to learn the controls they don't really teach you (it's mostly very basic, and they give tool tips for the less obvious). I then walked for 10 minutes to reach a deposite of rare resources I needed to repair my ship. While I was annoyed at first, I was glad they gave me the chance to explore the plannet on foot and discover outpost and fight enemies. Once I collected the cache of materials, I called in my ship to a nearby trading post with a bypass chip so I didn't need another 10 minutes to walk back. I was a little concerned seeing the reviews early on, but I stuck with the game long enough and explored as much as I could and learning about the game and all the mechanics they probably should have taught you (bypasses have one use and can be used to open special containers and call in your ship to your location, flying requires no fuel but take-off will, save stations). I did have complaints at this point. The way you saved seemed completely unnessecary and annoying, a lot of my quest and objectives were unclear, and I had to look up how to progress frequently because the game never taught me even the basics of upgrades, naming and uploading discoveries, ships, alien languages, or sentinels. Also, the game is not multiplayer like it was said to be, which was disapointing, but I surprisingly didn't mind becasue I felt this game would probably be best enjoyed solo, at least for me. Though being to fight space pirates, explore planets, and discover wouls be amazing to do with friends. And the graphics were a little eh, even maxed out. Objects also had to be surprisingly close to render sometimes, but I can understand seeing how the game generates such a huge, seamless space all at once. I also had difficulty flying, as often the ship would not turn or dive properly, and many times I found myself trying to land at a specific location, but ended up infintely rolling across the planet head-first. Or I sometimes would not be able to enter a space station because I would just bounce off some sort of invisible barrier. I also ran out of fuel mid-space travel a few times, and the game did not tell my I could mine astroids for it, so I drifted slowly back to the nearest planet over the course of 10-15 minutes just so I could gather a few plants. Another note that won't apply to most, but I thought I should add: The steam controller does NOT work well with No Man's Sky. At the highest sensitivity it feels like a slow drag, which forced me to just give up on it for how bad it was for flying and combat (half the game). Although, I would like to hear an opinion from someone who know show to mess around with the controller settings and has came up with moddifications for it.  I also have read many reviews stating how each plannet feels a copy and paste of another with a slightly different layout. While this is certanly not an insane idea by any means, I do not fully argee with it. Yes, most of the planets share the look of just a few templates of forest, tundra, desert, etc. No, not every planet really does have any huge reasons to visit them all. You wouldn't miss out on much if you passed up a few planets that didn't seem interesting. I'll admit, I did eventually start skipping more and more planets as I played, becasue I only needed certain things from certain places. But, every planet has different wildlife, locations (monoliths, observitories, etc), alien words to learn, and even special treasure. On one planet I discovered, I was about to leave because not only did it seem a little bland is it's veriety of resources I could get anywhere but also it's horrible -98 degree flash-floods, I found arguably the best thing so far. There was a completely massive cave system through most of the planet, and the halls were completely filled with rare artifacts I sold for a total around 2 million Units before I realized I needed to leave because there were so many I would be carrying them back for days worth of trips if I wanted to get all of them.   VERDICT: No Man's Sky gave me the same feeling I got the first time I ever played Skyrim. Like I was truly in a real world I could explore forever. And my love for space really did make it a great experience, and that thankfully I was able to enjoy this game without crashes or lag. While I unfortunetly I could never recommend this game to any die-hard action game fans, this is THE perfect game to just relax and enjoy the beautiful soundtrack and visuals as you upgrade your ship and explore the vast No Man's Sky.",

Unlike a lot of you folks, I did not follow the hype of NMS. I don't tend to believe things unless I see them for myself, and I was just not seeing a lot of what was being claimed. And I think that may be why I'm enjoying the game.  Originally, I did have some frame rate issues. So I looked in the options and realised that for some odd reason, the game is set at 30 fps out of the box. Probably something to do with it's console origins. Once I'd changed this to 60, and maxed everything out, the game runs beautifully. I also really like the way it looks.  As for the early game experience, the lack of hand holding is actually quite refreshing. Like the rest of you, I had no idea what was going on at first, so I just noodled around, trying things out. Within my first hour, I had worked out how the game worked, and what it wanted me to do, and was leaving my first planet. I would say that was a design win.  The tagline - this is not for everyone - is very true with this game. If you like to be led in games; to be told where to go, what to do; you will not enjoy this. You will find it frustrating at best. If you like digging around in sandboxes to see what you can find, then you will love NMS.  I personally have had no issues running the game; but I imagine that has something to do with the fact that I have many games already installed, and hence all the redists that a game like this might require. Not shipping the game with the redists it requires is a pretty egregious error if you ask me; and one that shows Hello Games' newness to PC gaming. I hope they fix that in future patches.  I should note that the game didn't cost me anything. I got Steam cards for my birthday, and kept them aside for the release. If I'd have paid £40 GBP for NMS - especially on the strength of the supposed multiplayer stuff, I would probably not be as happy as I am.",

            "review_text": "This game has had a pretty poor launch on PC, but now that I've worked out the kinks it's actually pretty cool. Initially it was incredibly choppy and the FOV being so low by default made it feel very claustrophobic. But after tinkering with the graphics settings (I disabled vsync, changed the FPS cap and resolution, and turned the FOV up) it runs considerably better and I can now run it fairly smoothly on maximum settings. A lot of people are reporting crashes to the desktop but I guess I'm lucky enough to have not experienced that. Also there are still sudden FPS drops that usually last a second or two every once in a while which is a little annoying, but nothng that discourages me from playing.   As for the game itself, it's a dream come true if you're an explorer or an adventurer at heart. I haven't gotten very far yet but it seems so far to mainly consist of discovering plant/animal species and landmarks on whatever planets you fly to, and then optionally naming them and uploading them to NMS's servers for in-game currency. You can then use this currency to do things such as buy new starships or upgrade your existing gear. You can also mine stuff both on planets and in space, which is quite simplistic though satisfying, and then use the stuff you mine to upgrade or repair your equipment or sell it for more credits. My main gripes with this include the lackluster combat (it is by no means bad, but it's not really remarkable either) and the tiny amount of inventory space you have. This results in often juggling around stuff you've mined to be able to carry it all without having to dispose of anything. It can be a little tedious.  The best part by far is the exploration. Each planet is quite markedly different from the last in general, and the atmosphere is almost always really breathtaking. Recently I landed on a mostly barren, hostile world with deep red skies. Looking off into the distance staring at the rocky plains and hills while the howling wind sfx played over the lonely piano music is really quite an experience. Not only that but knowing that if I want, I can walk over to that horizon and discover whatever may be there. It's more than likely going to be more barren plains, but just knowing you have the chance to explore whatever you can see if you want to is really amazing.   Flying in your starship from planet to planet is absolutely breathtaking and seamless too. If there are loading screens, they're hidden under one of the many space flight animations very discreetly. Hello Games really nailed the sound effects too. The whooshing when you accelerate, the sudden rumbling when you hit a planet's atmosphere, the earthy thud when your starship touches down. Really one of the main strengths of this game is the audiovisual experience it creates.  So, despite this game's shaky launch and currently slightly shallow game mechanics, I would definitely recommend it if you, like me, enjoy exploration for the sake of exploration itself. No Man's Sky really makes you feel that sense of awe and deep curiosity about what you could possibly discover next.",

When asking a friend if the game lived up to expectations, he replied 'Probably depends on what you want out of it' which was very accurate.  Coming into the game with the mindset of it being solely an exploration game, I was pleased. It has a share of combat and trading, but it really takes a backseat to the core of the game - which is exploration.  I always hate the term 'walking simulator', but that's a pretty good description of what I've seen so far. The draw of the game is to get in, walk (or fly) around the planet and see the different structures and sights; while discovering new flora and fauna.  If you're looking for a combat or trading game, then you'll probably be better off getting one of the X-series games. If you like to walk around and explore places, then No Man's Sky doesn't dissappoint. Everything is different on different planets - be it wildlife, terrain, or weather systems.",

Yes, I'm one of the luckier ones: my single MSI GTX 970 4G Gaming (4GB VRAM) manages a fairly stable 60fps on medium settings, and gets jerky, though hovers at around 40 on Ultra. I'm OK with that. The game still looks fairly good on medium.  For those of you talking about their high-end GPU's not working well with the game, I think your issues could possibly be your CPU's. Similar to Cities: Skylines, it could be a more CPU-intensive game. Graphics are a big part, yes (and my GPU stress pushes it to a stable 66C, which is the temperature it usually reaches when playing any high-standard-graphics game), though due to the high-quality continuous procedural generation (definitely a CPU-intensive task), it's worth a decent amount of speculation.  For reference, I have an intel i5-6600K, OC'd to 4.0GHz stable.  I haven't actually seen a review highlighting the game. How about a short one of those, just in case you wanted to wait for all the patches? That'd be nice, right?  (OPINIONS INCOMING)  Pros: - The graphics, on ultra or high, are actually freaking amazing. I love them, even if they're not up to everyone else's standards. I've seen 4K as well, and it's incredible at the massive resolution those monitors and systems provide. - The gameplay, while not diverse enough for some people, is wholly engaging and actually often fairly challenging. Admittedly, I'm not too good at space games, but I find them extremely fun, and the challenge adds to my enjoyment. - The concept - a space game based almost purely on exploration - is probably the best I have ever seen. I sat eagerly at my computer for 2 hours waiting for the release simply because I couldn't wait to waste my days away exploring seemingly endless, procedurally-generated... Everything. It blows my mind. - It's easy to lose yourself in the game. The immersion, for me at least, is intense. I love that in a game - when I enjoy it so much that it's easy to picture myself in the place of the protagonist(?), I know that I'm going to have a good time. - The system itself, once you understand it enough, becomes very intuitive. You need to look up button prompts now and then, but everything soon becomes almost second nature. - It's just damn fun to play. I hate to sound cliché, but 'the possibilities are endless'. There's a certain goal to the game that I won't spoil (well, more than one), but you can just disappear off into the distance like I did. It really is that easy to break the system - there is no cemented rule for what to do. The game even starts by giving you an option to run away and do whatever. It's great.  Cons - No coherent direction at the beginning of the game. You're left to work out what everything does. The beginning is fairly simplistic, yes, but my first run ended with me getting lost in a huge, hollowed-out cave in a mountain. I just had to restart. I had spent almost 2 hours on that file as well. It was frustrating, but I got over it. - Inventory, sizes, and item stacking. In your starter ship (I pre-ordered, so I got the special ship (18 INV slots, but I'm not sure how it compares to not pre-ordering), 18 is enough for a while. You can send items to your ship inventory from your suit, but can't retrieve them or craft with them unless you're really close by. It fills up so quickly unless you only take stuff that you need. I have tons of gold and iridium lying around in INV slots 'just in case', and it's becoming a problem. The good news is that you can sell it all off. Markets are easy to trade with, and it's not often that the expected rate is much of a big deal. On item stacking... You can stack twice as much of the materials in one space when in your ship, so you need to search your suit INV for anything you can put in your ship without losing space in it. It's tedious. - The timed cursor click is weird. You need to hold down on menu options for a single click to register. It's understandable in-game, but just goes against all common sense for it to be in the menus too. It's called a 'click' for a reason. It's mildly annoying to click multiple times, momentarily forgetting the mechanic. - Crashes, bugs and optimisation. Not really much to be said here. Just be patient and wait for the patches. If an infinite exploration game is what you want, then it'll be worth the wait if it doesn't work for you now.  That's all I can think about now. I'll add more if I think of any when I wake up. And go back onto it. I have relinquished my days and nights to No Man's Sky. There is no turning back.  I recommend the game. It's just an opinion. I enjoy it.",

It might not for everyone, but take all the bad reviews with a grain of salt, okay?  Now onto the main review!  It's just what I was expecting. A lonely space exploration game. Gameplay elements hint at a greater galactic history that we, as players, have yet to discover. There are several named races of spacefaring aliens and I'm not sure if those are procedural or not. I can't wait to learn their languages and be able to communicate better with them! Discovering the lore is going to be really fun!  I've traipsed through several toxic and/or irradiated planets, scanning plants, animals, and minerals as I go. Each is fun to name and catalog. I've made friends with some of the fauna on my way - a bouncing mushroom jellyfish who pooped copper because we were friends, a saber-toothed chicken cow who howled at me and followed me like a dog, and a diseased-looking desert fox which scampered away until I fed it some minerals.  This game is not going to hold your hand. It will give you hints as to how you progress in the small beginning quests, but at times I felt it was difficult (learning to fly the space ship, figuring out how to craft items, etc.)  Now, as for the things that could see improvement (keep in mind that the devs are already working on patches -- this game is still HELLA fun even as it is now!). I noticed a few glitches with the lighting and textures in the Discovery menu. Talking to aliens sometimes makes my textures flicker. Nothing too crazy.  Probably the worst thing so far is that I can't alt-tab in and out of the game properly yet. Once I alt-tab out, I have to go into Steam and click the 'Play' button again to get it to switch back to the game properly (no progress lost or anything by doing this, don't worry).  That being said, it is now 4 AM and I've played this game for at least 7 or 8 hours straight. So I think it's a good game, and I'd recommend it. If it doesn't work for you yet, guess what? You can refund the game and try it later when it's more stable. Or maybe it isn't for you? That's okay too!  SIDE NOTE: I'm really glad the devs pushed the release date to a Friday... my work schedule would have been ruined if this came out on a Tuesday...

I really want more control over my height above the ground and the ability to hover would be great.  Storyline (or whatever you want to call it) is interesting.

Plus the sounds and mystic music really are a good fit.  I'm glad I didnt read any of the steam reviews before I bought it because honestly I probably wouldnt have bought it. I really feel bad for the devs of this game because of all the people saying it is boring trash, or the ones saying its not what they were expecting-- therefore trash, or the ones having tercnical issues so they give it a bad review.   Nobody said this was an intense action fighting game with an intense storyline. Did you not watch any gameplay before buying? You should have known what type of game this was going to be. So if you dont like the style of exploring and crafting upgrades, why did you even buy it? We all knew what it would be, hell there was dev gameplay out months ago. Thats fine if this type of game isnt for you, so play a different game. Unless you bought it for the soul purpose of playing for an hour and giving a bad review.  I said it many times before and Ill say it again; just because a game doesnt play EXACTLY like you thought it would, it doesnt make it a bad game.  Also, wtf is up with people complaining about the inventory system? One even said you had to be a 'inventory master' just to play without going crazy. Really? Its not that hard people. Infact I think it adds somehing to the game, because you have to decide what is impoirtant to keep on your person or to leave on your ship depending on the situation. (Edit: Also you can upgrade ship inventory size by getting a better ship.)  Also im pretty sure people dont realize that, yes, there is a main objetive to this game. reach the center of the univirse. It even gives you a path to follow by warping to lead you in the right direction. So the people who say they are 'wandering around aimlessly' must be idiots. Its not like you HAVE to visit every planet, space station and system along the way.  BTW, regarding the performance issues, they released a patch that adressed many issues with performance and crashing literally hours after its initial release, so props to them. I will admit that it could still use some performance optmizations because I dont really think a person running min specs listed on the store page would have a good time playing.

If you don't like a grinding resource gathering centrist type of game play then don't get this game. But don't listen to all those reviews that are upset at the game cause it didn't live up to the hype. Honestly, nothing lives up to the pre release hype so you gotta over look it and judge it for what it is, not what the expectations were.   Personally i love the game. I have over 20 hours in and i see where a lot of the complaints of the game play are coming from. Things do get repetitive. The seeming unlimited universe is rather more limited then the hype lead us to believe. But i still love exploring things. I am certainly getting my $60 out of the game. However there are some short comings.   The UI is a bit clunky with the constant press/click and hold to get anything done. I think some parts of the UI could do without this. Diversity of ship handling needs to become a thing. Space combat is a joke at this point and i would love to see it improved. Likewise the handling of ship slots needs improvement. I wish limitations where set as to what the various slots can be used for. Most of all i want to see some side missions introduced. Let me pick up missions to escort shipments, raid shipments, hunt down pirates, and transport people to different locations. Lets have some more interactions with the species of each and get some more faction style interplay between the species. If i gain status with one i should lose status with another. Make us choose a side.   There is so much more this game can become. I look forward to seeing what future updates bring. All i have to say is that most of them should be made free. Cause right now this is a $30 to $40 game at best. I do recommend the game but you may want to wait for a sale before picking it up.",

I'm having a blast playing No Man's Sky. It's one of those games I can zone out and get lost in as I wander around and gather stuff, like Salt or Skyrim. Or, if you've played Rodina, then it is perhaps somewhat comparable to that, except without the narrative and on a much grander scale. Anyway, so far I've explored 3 planets in my own little corner of the galaxy, and it was actually hard for me to even want to get into my spaceship to leave the first one after walking around for about 3 hours.  I guess I just really like the idea of standing on an alien mountaintop or lake shore knowing that not even the developer has gazed over this vista (much less, meticulously hand-placed every rock and piece of foliage).. That instead the place emerged naturally from rules, and not from a human touch. And that you're not moving from one region to another through a series of load screens- instead it is one big continuous sandbox. To me all of that makes the discovery and exploration even more fulfilling.  Not sure where people got the impression that it was a MMO or something. It is single player game, folks. It says it right here in the Steam page. I heard the dev state that it was single player forever ago, although granted maybe they said other stuff since that confused the issue.  So if you're confused about what this game is, let me try to clear some things up for you-    -IT IS SINGLE PLAYER.  -It is massive a procedurally generated galaxy of countless planets, stars, life forms, etc  -When you find an undiscovered star system or planet or planetary location you can claim discovery credit and even rename it, and this gets uploaded so other players can see that you in fact discovered it. So I could be mistaken, but this is the only thing that I understand to be even remotely multiplayer about the game- that in the unlikely even that you happen to make it to one of my planets, you will be able to see that I was there FIRST SUCKA.  -You gather resources so you can fix, fuel and upgrade your spaceship, then you fly your spaceship around  -Resources are also required to protect you from the environment and sustain your life support systems  -You discover technology blueprints to upgrade your ship, suit, mining tool/weapon, and then from your resources you craft these upgrades  -Outposts are scattered around the planets, some with trade terminals where you can buy and sell stuff. Some have alien NPCs, but they speak in a language unknown to you. You can discover language clues that let you unlock the language 1 word at a time   -You can pick fights with robotic drones or creatures on the planet surface. I understand there is space combat as well, but I haven't gone looking for any of that kind if trouble yet  -You can also feed some of the local wildlife, and they will become happy and poop out rare resources for you  -ICYMI- IT IS SINGLE PLAYER  -It is NOT a simulator of the Milky Way galaxy, or even an astrophysics simulator as far as I'm aware  -It is not a hardcore flight simulator either. Landing is automatic. To compare, the stuff I'd seemingly spend the most amount of time and effort doing in Elite Dangerous (aligning my ship with a landing pad) is what I spend the least on in No Man's Sky, and I like that about this game.  -And if you need a strong story or narrative, then be aware that you probably won't find it here in No Man's Sky   If I am forced to offer a critique of the game at this point, I would be that the character models for the NPC aliens look rudimentary compared to the other creatures and environment overall- that is to say the NPCs are not 2016 AAA quality. But since that wasn't really at all what I was looking for in this game, it really isn't a complaint that I have.  Not something I anticipate, but perhaps there is a chance that after playing 70-100 hours the sense of discovery will have worn off and I'll find the game a bit boring and repetitive. Who knows, and I can surely update my review later if that is the case. But even so, I'm pretty sure I'd still recommend this game even after I got tired of it, because I think it is something really cool to experience.  Basically, if you are like me and you saw the first video and said 'Yep, that looks like a neat game,' then I believe your expectations are reasonably set and that you will enjoy No Man's Sky. If you're looking for something else, then you should probably move along.  Also- I read some complaints about performance issues, but I haven't had any kind of problems like that myself. In about 8 hours of gameplay the game crash 1 time, but other than that it is running 100% smooth. I am playing on a 1.5 year old Alienware Alpha, so it's not like I have a high end custom build either. Maybe folks need to update those Nvidia drivers or something...",

            "review_text": "No Man's Sky is a really sad story of miscommunication and misinterpretation. Sean Murray was vague but was never outright lying. This world is so giant that if there were conventional multiplayer it would be rendered useless. I invite you to play for a month straight and see if you even run into anything that's already been discovered. That's just things that other players have seen, the chances of seeing an actual human even if it were implemented are (pardon the pun) astronomical. To insist that some server should be sending and receiving packets constantly for the jackpot millionaire powerball snowflake chance in hell you cross paths with another human is insane. This is the logical conclusion for multiplayer in a game where there is next to no chance in running into other people.  Moving on, the game itself is extremely enjoyable in my opinion. If you are expecting a campaign story to hold your hand this is not it. If you want space minecraft this is not it. If you want an unlimited space game with the same complexity as something like Elite this is not the game for you. If you want to explore alien worlds and be in constant awe at the procedurally curated environments before you this is the game for you. If you want to meet new spacefarers and become victim to galactic misunderstandings this is the game for you. If you want to paint the stars red with pirate blood or become a pirate yourself, this is the game for you. There is something for everyone once you get situated. Anybody complaining about how there's nothing to do haven't been playing long enough to see the wide range of encounters available. Also saying that each planet is just a recolor is ♥♥♥♥ing dishonest and you're either an idiot or lying on purpose if you think that. Some are burning, some are freezing. Some have cave networks, some have giant outcroppings of rocks and minerals. Some are devoid of life and others are full of angry creatures that will rarely bear resemblence to anything else you've seen yet.  I completely understand if you hate this game for it's rocky launch. It's a five man studio, you try releasing a single game ever in your life and find out how easy it is. Studios with hundreds of people who have whole departments specifically for QA still release broken games on release. To hold Hello Games to the same standards as AAA studios is intellectually dishonest and intentionally misleading.  tl;dr This is a game about watching an empty absurd world and carving meaning into it through your actions. It will not hold your hand or direct you any more than suggesing one of three paths. One of which is to remain a free explorer forever.  Possibly GoTY? I need to see if it's worth playing through to completion, and how well content scales through to the end.  Keep in mind this is all my opinion, no need to get pissy about it. If you hate the game I'm totally fine with you hating it as long as you're fine with me having the time of my life. I still can't believe five people were able to make this game.",

I am going to leave and come back later and give it a shot when there is more to do. It was a fun 50-60 hours though and I feel like I got my moneys worth.

            "review_text": "*new review after 80+ hours*  Pros: - Best planet generation in a game EVER - Literally endless planets with beautiful scenery that you can spend many hours in each one - Flying low across the landscapes scanning and looking for POIs - Stunning space scenes with planets/stars/staships/asteroids etc. quite 'realistic' - Fun to find all species on a planet (and get a good reward) - Interesting to gradually learn the lore and languages through ruins, monoliths, etc. - Ship combat in space is quite fun - Very few issues encountered in 80+ hours - Performance on my average-good system is fine at 1080  Cons: - 'Plot' runs thin fairly quickly. In fact I messed up one of the few goals in the game - Not enough artefacts. Tired of seeing the same half dozen things - Flying over terrain is limited by auto-hover. Would like more control e.g. hovering - Difficult to land where you want due to above - Can't look around starship windows with keyboard/mouse - Ship combat over planets virtually impossible due to above issues - Ship combat in space could do with more fleshing out, e.g. scanning ships, more weapons - Too many installations/buildings/POS's on planets. They are too easy to find; unrewarding - You pretty soon run out of 'tech' blueprints to find, making most alien interactions pointless - Wandering around on planets, while great, could be helped with a ground vehicle of some kind - Some inevitable repetition, main culprit being space stations. Everything else quite ok. - Fade-in (rather than pop-in) of landscape might bother some - Price; I had no issues paying full price, but realistically it could've been $10-15 cheaper  For me the first pro outweighs all the cons, so I can recommend the game. For me, as soon as I hit 10-15 hours I'd had my money's worth, so the extra 65+ since then is the icing on the cake, and I'm still going :)  Get it if: - You can appreciate walking simulators - You can appreciate the tour-de-force of the planet generation - You can put up with a bit of a grind (mining, find species) - You can pay full price - You want to support a small team that could do bigger and better things in the future  Don't get it if: - You must have multiplayer (you can see other players' named planets, that's about it) - You got into the hype and your expectations exceed all reality   *old review follows*  Loving the game, put 16 hours into it in first 2 days which is a lot for me. At first the performance was horrible but after updating NVidia drivers it runs great although my GTX970 can be pushed back as low as 30 FPS on more demanding terrains. A lot of fun, lots to discover for those of us who haven't ruined their experience with spoilers, videos etc.  No spoilers below IMO.  To be balanced, here's the issues I've had.  - bad performance UNTIL upgrading to latest driver AND turning off shader cache in NVidia panel - I'm still a *bit* surprised at my 970 not having better performance especially at 1080 but it's not bad - one CTD (actually 2. After reloading from the first it CTD'd again at the same spot but then has been fine)  Don't expect a flight sim type game when you're flying around. It's definitely on 'easy' mode where you can't really crash; auto-landings; auto-docking at space stations, etc. The space ship is really just a way of getting you around, it's not the focus itself at all. Cockpit is very basic and nonfunctional really. Which is all fine with me. I *definitely* would like to be able to look around to the sides though! [edit: you can't look around with mouse/keyboard but can with some controllers ]. And down wouldn't hurt either. The views would be spectacular, but as it is you kind of have to bank over to the side to see down below you. Would like a VR-type cockpit like flight sims have had for decades now [edit: as I said, only with controllers]. Locking onto a target (destination) would also be nice. I haven't had any space battles yet.  [update: I've had quite a few space battles by now. Don't expect Elite Dangerous, but they are exciting enough. Really only 2 types of weapon, and recharging shields means going into your inventory! I haven't tried attacking large ships as yet.]  The menus are pretty annoying as you can't just click an option, you have to hold the mouse button down for a second, VR-menu-style. Not sure why. It took me a few minutes to work this out and gets a bit tedious but hardly an issue.  I'll update as I visit more worlds (about 5 so far) but I'll be happy to slowly eke out the goodies this game has in store for some time to come.  [update: 77 hours in and still enjoying it. Haven't even tried to advance to the core yet but might start doing that. Have identified species on 2 worlds. Have also earned quite a bit of cash mining and selling rare resources. Upgrading you ship is the most difficult (expensive) part. Unless I'm missing something, you don't get any 'trade' value on your existing ship. You just pay the asking price, move across anything in your inventory, and job done. So if you have an 18 slot ship you might pay $1.5m for a 21 slot ship. But then if you buy a 22 slot ship you might pay $2m! I could be wrong on this though as I haven't bought more than 1 ship (and then I re-loaded anyway).You can also disassemble your ship's tech to recover some of the resources before you do the deal. Dogfights above planet surfaces are basically impossible due to the auto-height feature. You can't really point where you want to go/aim.]",

I'm not sure what the expectation everyone had about this game was, but it is certainly no Minecraft, though right now, I'd say it's like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Minecraft and Subnautica. I'm sure there are others it's like, but these two come to mind.  If you can get past the issue, then for sure you have a diamond in the rough, but it is certainly deep in the rough. Hopefully they can implement the multiplayer, and it'd be neat if they could bet base/ship/weapon building in there as well. For now though, buy it at your own risk.",

It is currently having some optimization issues. For me the framerate is high but with frequent stuttering. Tons of people have been complaining about performance issues so this seems to vary from person to person.  This game has been the victim of overmarketing, hype, and a bit of a hate bandwagon.

That first 7 hours was actually 1 continuous session, no restarting or anything else required.   This game isn't for everyone , I understand that. It isn't a first person shooter, it isn't an action game at all really. It definitely isn't what most would consider multiplayer even though we are all on there together. If you want these things look somewhere else, this game was made to be different from the clones.   But this game is for me.  I love the exploration and like having to piece a story together. Beautiful relaxing experiences punctuated by periods of intense desperation. I know I will probably never see another player, and I'm ok with that. The process was well explained ahead of time, so the only people who will be disappointed are the ones who go in with false expectations because they didn't bother to learn what the game is before plopping down their $60.

As far as all the problems people are experiencing, give the devs some time to tweak and adjust. My GPU is actually UNDER the reccomended and it runs fine. I have to lower settings and there's still occasional .5 sec hangups or stalls but it's playable. Been meaning to update my graphics card anyway. Just make sure your stuff is updated.  Multiplayer? Who cares? Multiplayer would get in the way. Sure it might be fun to explore a planet with a buddy but when there's so much to see what happens when you want to go one way and your friend wants to go the other way? You wanna move on to Blazorpazorp-27 but buddy wants to look for more creatures? I know people want base-building too but that encourages settling down. If you want to build a space colony try Starbound.  If I absolutely had to give it a score I'd say 8/10. Not perfect by any means (I mean, what game is?) but it shows the possibility of what could come to pass.  I will agree that $60 is a bit much for what is here now. If it were up to me I'd of priced it at $40 but I paid the $60 cuz I want Hello to keep doing and creating and showing us what they're capable of.

The time it takes for you to get to different planets can be long (like actual space travel), but I like that so far. It was honestly nice surprise. I am a sucker for space though. You can speed it up quite a bit, but I still enjoy taking that time to soak in the vastness of space. I do see myself possibly wanting to decrease that time between locations as I move further into the game, so there's that.  I'm currently playing on a computer that is just under the minimum specs, so all my settings are low, my resolution is at 1280x720 and I'm averaging 28 fps most of the time. I imagine that a lot of people will scoff at how the game looks for me, but for right now, I'm fine. Only major problem is after extended play time the framrate will drop drastically to 10 fps or lower. Quitting and loading it back up seems to fix it, but I'm not too worried about them fixing it. I am playing on below minimum specs after all.  If you enjoy relaxing, slow paced exploration, collecting rock samples and catalouging new life forms, No Man's Sky is a decent ride.

            "review_text": "Ok, so unlike the rest of the world i have not been living the past 2 years of my life waiting for No Mans Sky. Also, unlike the rest of the world i actually enjoy this game. I like the exploration, and massive scale, and just the fact that they were able to teach a computer to generate all of this, along with zero loading screens in an only 2GB game. I love how little by little I am learning more about the three main sentient species you encounter whether it be their history, ideals, or language. However, like many others here have already stated, the game has a lot of repetitive qualities. Constant mining and upgrading is what you spend most of your time doing, but even in this case it is lacking. There is little variation in the ships, which i find truly saddening, and even the environments so far have been repetitive in many cases. I think the game has a lot of potential though. Frequent patching over the next couple years (NO DLC PLEASE) and maybe some limited mod support could make this game very exciting. Adding some more variation in the capability of the ship design, more sentitent beings, and more variation in the planets (gas giants, planets that don't have random bases when its all barren) could really make the game alot more interesting. I don't know the limitation of the game because I'm not very far, but maybe more galaxies you can go to? These galaxies will have different sentient species to interact with, because i mean 3 in the whole galaxy? And what species are we? What happened to our species?   By the way, my rig has little to no issues running this game in high settings 1080p, with a i7 5820k and a gtx 970, but i can see how many would have trouble running the game as mine dips below 50 on some occasions.   So I only recomend this game if you can see yourself exploring, and if you have a pretty good rig or are ok with playing on lower settings.   I do feel however that many people would not be interested in this game. There isn't really a storyline, there isn't mulitplayer, there is some action in space, but on the surfaces of the planets there are just weak animals and robots.  More customization of your ship and blaster would add a lot to the game  This game cannot be rated out of ten because it is really a game that certain people will enjoy and others will hate. I suggest waiting for a sale if you are lenient, and if you are lenient I doubt you will enjoy the game.",

After reading excited 'game to end all games' super game hyperbole and and watching hundreds of people shout out premature acclaim for this game, and seeing the resulting aggrandized hype ballon like an overstuffed teddy bear I began to worry.  Now, finally after playing for about 5 hours on my PC, I can confidently say that I'm very happy with NMS! The game is exactly what Sean and the other talent over at Hello Games always said it would be. Mainly an exploration game with light survival within a beautiful procedural universe.  What some might call rudimentary game objectives I see as ingeniously crafted procedural story content. These objectives are fun and do provide a sense of accomplishment and help you feel like you are the story, or at least that there's a continuum that you are in and can learn about if you care to. And that's the key...    If you care to.    This game does not lead you by the nose in any way, and because NMS doesn't offer you tutorials and hold your hand tightly like a mother holds their child's in a crowd, it takes a bit of time to figure out exactly how to interact meaninfully with the universe. Once again, I take this as a credit to Hello Games for not treating their audience like a bunch of dribbling nincompoops. Instead, I feel that Hello Games is expecting you to draw from your many hours of time spent on all sorts of other games to get into stride in NMS. Very refreshing!   With many pleasing game objectives that keep coming as you explore, although a little sparse to start, I'm beginning to feel like I'm my own master in NMS, like I can make the choices on where to go, what to do. And because I can ignore everything if I want just to see what's on the other side of the next rise, or on the next planet up there hovering in the sky, I also feel like I'm the master of my own rewards. I love it!  Because in No Man's Sky you not only can choose your own pace, but are required to, I have found myself relaxedly exploring an area, just seeing what is out there, and also found myself in the heat of combat with the crazy, ultra-conservationalist sentinels who keep calling in reinforcements.  I strongly believe that No Man's Sky is a Gamer's Game. Not some sort of ultra accessible 'story driven' (read 'on the rails') shoooter like the masses seem to crave. This is what I believe to be the biggest reason that people have for their unfairly derogotory stance and disappointment with NMS.  So, if you're available to take a deep breath and quit expecting a 'massively cinematic convoluted story with hundreds of hours of hand crafted objectives' as conjectured by excited fans on top of the 'Sandbox Survival Exploration game within the framework of a finely tweaked and excellently balanced procedural universe full of billions of star systems to investigate at your own pace' as Hello Games has always defined NMS to be...  No Man's Sky may be the title for you!",

            "review_text": "Forgetting all the hype, rumors, conjecture, and flat out bullcrap that was was flying around about this game, it must be said that the game delivers EXACTLY what was promised. The Universe is mind-bogglingly huge, and drab. The sense of scale and space makes one feel completely insignificant.   But this isn't a detraction--it's what was promised, and it's what makes finding something truly bizarre or cool that much more rewarding. In fact, if I have any specific complaint about the game itself, it's that the universe is perhaps a bit TOO populated; I was expecting more barren rocks, but life abounds everywhere I've been yet.   The game is what you make of it--no more, no less. It's lonely as hell in space, which makes getting mauled by a deer with antlers growing out of it's ♥♥♥ all the more interesting.   That all said, I have to be honest when I say that the game wasn't ready for release. I have been lucky enough not to have the stability/crashing/launch issues many, MANY others have reported, but I do have several specific gripes: - The User interface is abysmal. Like, REALLY bad. Crafting is clumsy, everything is counter-intuitive.  - The galactic map is practically unusable. there is no sense of scale, and distances between objects have no reference so might as well be arbitrary. Planning routes is best done by closing your eyes and throwing a suction dart at your screen for all the UI will help you - The Atlas is useless. Mouse-over a 'discovery' to see a static animation of your discovery that's in the worst possible angle. You can't examine, rotate or otherwise inspect it. You might as well start collecting Windows 95 desktop icons and show them off to your friends.   Really though, the game is a spectacle, and well worth a look. I really hope the Devs decide to rework the UI.   Bottom line: It's an unpolished gem. rough/gritty/dirty patches, but the sparkle is there.",

            "review_text": "After playing the game for over 12 hours I can say that it's a pretty good game, a bit repeatitive but good. At first when I started playing all I did was farm minerals to sell and try to upgrade my gear and I thought that was very boring and wished to get a refund but after grinding it out a bit longer I realized it's a pretty good game.   Regarding the matter with Sean Murray saying the game is multiplayer... I think it's a total no, since the game pauses when ever you tab out of the game it makes me think this is a singleplayer game only since any kind of multiplayer game would not do that. The only online component of the game is that any discoveries by players are all shared, so don't expect the game to be multiplayer in the future.   As to what the game is about....... think of it as Far Cry but on a massive intergalatic scale. You run around like crazy gathering resources, scanning and tagging wildlife, as well as pillage outposts of all loot. All while trying to improve your gear as much as possible. And just like how in FC4 if you sat at the table for 30 mins and finish the game instantly, you can just head towards the centre of the galaxy and finish instantly as well. Not that I have done this, I seemed to have made Atlas mad and it won't guide me.  Anyways if you think exploring and just spending time doing different things on a planet and then repeating the same process but on a different planet with different things then this is the game for you.  P.S. - All the same npcs flying out of the space station but with same ship, amount of slots and different slot layout really bothers me, I spend so long waiting for a ship with a good layout.",

Is this game perfect?- No Does it have all the features that it should at launch?- No. Is it fun? -yes for me. You will have to like exploration games and know your not getting a combat game.  I will say I can totally see this game not being for everyone and the $60 price tag is a bit much for what you get. If the features it should have were fully implemented I would think $60, but not in the current state.  As of the latest patch the game is running much better and completely smooth with no more crashes.  Pros: -Very nice looking game. I have had several 'wow' moments while exploring planets. -It's fun for me to see new planets and new creatures. -Mining system is fun and upgrading the ship and multitool is cool. -Learning new words and seeing the results when you talk to aliens is fun. -Upgrading your ship and getting to go further and visit different new types of stars is fun -In general getting to pick what I do and where I go. There are no rails here! -Learning little pieces of lore over time and slowly getting the picture of the history and context of the alien races.(just wish there were more variation)  Cons: -Not the best PC port overall. UI is geared for console in general and you can tell. -General UI complaints and 'oddness' in how inventory works -Unable to put custom waypoints on planets us a huge negative for an exploration game. -Inventory system needs work. I should be able to have a separate tab for upgrades to my suit and ship that isn't in the main inventory. No way to really organize things well. -Ship space combat is not fun and is very frustrating at the moment. This includes not able to fly myself while on the planet. The game forces you to 'hover' above the ground at a set altitude.  Overall I like this game and still having fun nearly 30 hours in. I would have more fun if some of the quality of life things were fixed and some features implemented. There are already several threads on reddit talking about feature requests and most of them are spot on.  Overall: Good game but could be much better. If your on the fence wait for more features to be released or a price drop.",

It seems every game I've taken the time to play has already had countless reviews reflecting every possible opinion and verdict on them, and hence there is little point adding my voice to the mix.   But I feel compelled to do so with NMS, as whilst all current reviews seem to be overwhelmed with the obvious and understandable outcries of 'It's broken', 'It gets boring/repetitive', 'It's not what was promised' etc, my experience with the game has been something else entirely. My review boils down to a simple, single part of my play time so far.  My defining moment with this game came when I first flew into space and went into the galactic map, which does just that: it shows a map of the galaxy around you. The centre shows the star of the system you are currently at, and in every possible direction there are neighbouring stars.   By default, the map wants to show you the route to the 'centre of the galaxy', the loose goal of the game. But after a few minutes I realised I was able to switch to a 'free exploration' mode, which allows you to search the map as you please. You can strafe, you can rotate, and...you can ZOOM. So I zoomed out.  Then I kept on zooming out.  Over the next few seconds, the true scale of this in-game universe hit me. It was such a powerful moment. Hundreds and hundreds of stars filling the screen as my own star and I faded into lonely insignificance. All of them undiscovered. All of them playable. I literally stared wide-eyed for a few seconds and then quietly uttered: 'Woah.'  It's a gaming moment that I know I will not be forgetting anytime soon.",

There are those that don't much care for train sets and find them boring, those who think train sets are neat and will mess with them for a little bit before moving on to something else, and others who think train sets are the one and only medium for entertainment in their lives.   Which ever you are, I would reccomend playing no man's sky a little just to get an idea of the vast scale of which the universe and the planets hold. It will try to keep you entertained by othering 'side objectives' and random ambushes, but you can't deny the feeling you get when you first fly into space and activate your hyperdrive. Oh, and let's not forget that creepy tingling feeling I got when I flew into the mouth of a black hole.   Issues: The game starts at medium settings locked at 30 FPS. The game isn't exactly graphiclly intensive (Maybe a bit more CPU intensive seeing as how it has to calulate the size of everything), but locking us at 30 FPS from the start felt like an insult. Even lower end systems can probably get over 40 FPS on this.   Grinding. Now, you may read other reviews that say the game is only about grinding, but it isn't. The objective is to explore and see the different types of creatures, fauna and wildlife. While exploaring you're supposed to stumble upon new items and technology. However, to get around you need to find supplies for Hyperdrive fuel, and that takes time. Considering a full charge on your hyperdrive drains after 4-5 warps, you'll be scavaging supplies for a while.  Overall: 7.5/10",

This is especially true if you have an AMD graphics set. Go to AMD's website and get the latest drivers from there; I recommend the Crimson management software if you have Radeon chipsets. Reason this is important: my drivers were up to date, according to Catalyst, but the game would not load. When I did this (went to AMD directly and got the Crimson graphics management software) the game loaded without a problem.   2. Exploration. That's what it's all about. There is no 'end game' so far as I can tell.   3. Getting off planet. When you start out you can't necessarily get off planet right away, because you will need to gather resources. Caves are good, but you can easily find resources you need without going into them. On the other hand, fully exploring the planet you start on can be fun too.  4. Tech. There are a lot of tech enhancements which take up slots. You find them by exploring various sites.   5. There's no multiplayer yet in the traditional sense.",

In fact, I watched a stream (PS4 version) yesterday, I liked it and I decided to get it on PC today.  You may wonder: is this game really good? Is it for me?  The answer: it depends on your likes.  I personally love it because I enjoy exploring the world, taking your time, with no hurries, creating your own way. Don’t expect an epic story here. Well, the truth is the story can be as epic as you want. It’s up to you.  It’s basically a survivor game but it offers an unique experience (not seen before in any other survivor game). NMS does not have an explicit goal but encourage you to attempt to reach the center of the galaxy. Of course you can totally forget about that ‘goal’ and visit as many planets as you want. Inside of them you have to find elements to power and repair your spacesuit, tools and ship. You then craft bigger and better weapons, tools and engines to reach more remote locations. Also, actions like analyzing the animals and plants of each planet reward you with credits (you can use them with vendors to get more resources).  In theory, NMS can be a multiplayer game but in the practice the game is so huge that there is a low chance that 2 players are in the same planet. It’s possible but the experience is single player right now. According to the devs, more multiplayer features can be added in the future though.  Finally, technically the game is simply correct. It is worth mentioning that the game does not have any loading screen and the size of the terrain to explore is almost infinite. NMS runs well on my rig, definitely much better than on a PS4 (it also looks better). It’s truth that my rig is quite powerful (you can check it out on my profile) and maybe the game has to be more optimized in order to run better on lower systems. They also need to fix some annoying bugs like random crashes (permanent black screen) after exiting the game or alt-tabbing.  I also think that the price is pretty high and this can be one of the main reasons that some users don’t get it.",

I've played 14 hours today and am now forcing myself to go to sleep and give my computer a rest. The game runs the CPU hot so seems pretty CPU bound to me. I haven't had any real problems running the game. One crash and one instance of a sudden drop in fps over the 14 hours I've played it. Restarting the game solved the fps drop. It runs at 45-60 fps on my Alienware 15 R2 which has a GTX 980m video card and an i7 6820HK CPU and running the game from an SSD drive and WIN 10. It's vital that the OS and video drivers are fully up to date. I like the game, it's fun and absorbing especially if you're a little OCD (like if you're the person that ran around Witcher 3 picking every flower you came across). The only thing I found a little frustrating is the small number of inventory slots in your suit and on the ship. I always want to keep everything. What can I say, I'm a hoarder. You do find upgrades scattered on planets in the game that add slots but still not enough. The possibilities for adding more content and features to the base game are as endless as the Universe. I think this game will be around for a long time. Just my opinion. We all have one. I recommend it. Praise Hirk.",

I haven't had any real issues with the game. It does get a little laggy at times, but usually if I save and restart the game that fixes things. I've had one or two crashes, but since the game saves so often, it hasn't really been a problem. Considering the game is still pretty new, I have experienced much worse game launches.  Since the game is still brand new, they are focusing on making sure any game breaking bugs are fixed for all players, like all game do in the beginning, but after that they have talked about adding new and interesting features into the game. I am excited for those.  For people who enjoy lots of action and combat, this probably isn't a game you will enjoy for very long, but if you are like me and have a crazy schedule and enjoy a game to relax to and enjoy collecting things, then you will probably find yourself having a lot of fun with this game.",

For the scope of the game, billions of planets (mile wide), there is very little difference from point to point in the game (Inch deep). The planets do come in all types of environments that you have to deal with. The atlas pass thing is personally killing me. One mystery is the huge ships that keep warping into the systems and just basically sit there, sometimes getting attacked.  The lack of a clear and defined direction in the game is hostile to the playing environment. Many things could be improved upon to include more diverse visuals.  Is the game worth 60 bucks as it stands, No...Am I sorry i bought it? No...I have and will enjoy it more to come. Hopefully with updates or DLC.",

I did restart the PC as soon as I installed it.   Anyhow I wasn't sure what to expect with this game but my expectations were extremely high none the less. I definitely haven't been let down. It's crazy how big it actually is. I've spent 8 hours within a spec of dust that truly felt like one heck of a journey.  Through it all though, nothing compares to landing on your first planet with trees. It was pretty magical. I'm not the smartest guy in the world so the menu was terrifying for the first 20 minutes but I quickly realized just how simple it is. From the very start, the red orb thing offers you a choice between guidance and no guidance. I chose guidance and still have no idea what I'm doing (even after 8 hours). I've kinda convinced myself that there is no real objective (even though there is) and I just jump from planet to planet hoping to stumble upon something that'll guide my way but it hasn't happened yet. The game definitely feels unlike anything I've ever played. It's not super fast, multiplayer, action packed dog fights in the sky like some folks were hoping for. But it is a game where you can really lose track of time. You'll name a few animals on your first few planets but after that you'll never name another. I'd say get it if you weren't expecting what I mention above. If you were expecting that, don't get it. All that I can guarantee is you've never played  anything like it 9/10",

The game is still very buggy at this point. It is not multiplayer either, causing controversy over the developers very vague hints that it would be multiplayer. The early game is somewhat annoying, with milestones every few seconds taking up the screen, but no real explanation for how to do things. I had to google many times over how to do things, and how to fix bugs. The space exploration side of things can be quite fun though, and the creatures are still cool. My family and I play the game, and show off the cool things we have found. This is the best aspect of the game in my opinion. Just disappointed I can't meet up with them.

I honestly feel that the one way this would pull my interest back or keep me going is if the following happens.   1. They need to put some value on ships, give me the ability to sell  2. I would love to be able to build an HQ or somthing that i can store items in.  3. A better managed item system, I would like to stack non-resource items.. like if i have 6 atlas stones let me stack them  4. More dynamics to ship battles... make it a bit more intersting  5. Let me dock with or fly frieghters  6. More in space discoveries, Singularities, Life... Ship debris ?? somthing along those lines.   I Could say add multiplayer lol but i wont, cause people will shred me to peices. lol   All in all, the game is worth the $60 for what they have done and achieved .. id buy a painting for more and put it in my house, and thats what this game is ..

It's science fiction, and I don't expect them to adhere to every astronomical law and theory known to man. For a small indie team to pull off a game like this, even with the multiple delays, is astounding. Every planet I've visited so far has felt different, and unique. There's been ocean worlds, barren scorched worlds, and intimidating toxic-rain filled worlds. Each with different wildlife, somewhat different flora, and unique day/night cycles and atmospheric effects to match. The vastness of the game is constantly reminding me that I'm almost certainly the first person to ever see a particular planet or system, and it's so satisfying.  I consider this game a technological marvel, and enjoy the immersive feeling of being on an alien planet that every planet and moon I've been on has given.

It is a game for explorers, plain and simple. Following the loosely guided I’ve been researching one particular alien race, the Dek. Learning their history, studying their language, it’s very rewarding for the time you put into exploration and discovery.

            "review_text": "All right, this game community is surrounded by hate, people feeling cheated, and, of course, the usual 'game does not have a feature I like, so I dislike the game' argument, but I'll try to make a positive review with valid criticism, hoping it to be useful to whoever has any intentions to play it. Here we go:    Overview    NMS's main features are: - Planet and space exploring; - Alien language learning; - Procedural generation (pretty much everything in the game is procedurally generated, with a few exceptions);  NMS is about trading, In order to improve your character with abilities and extra backpack slots, and your ship with technologies and extra cargo slots, you must gather resources in the planets you visit. You then sell everything, make your improvements and go back to resource gathering again. But it doesn't mean all you can do is trading.  NMS is also about exploration. Each planet can come with several different stats, which determine how your gameplay is going to be. The main ones are: - Hazards: e.g. radiation, low/high temperatures, toxic atmosphere...all of these will gradually deteriorate exosuit armor; - Wild life: most living creatures you find will be docile, but others will attack you on sight if you get too close. Some planets are completely absent of wild life; - Sentinel behavior: sentinels are little floating robots that roam the game's universe, and can become aggressive and attack you with if you try to obtain too many resources from a specific place in the surface of a planet, they are the main enemies during on-foot exploration.  Besides these stats, planet generation includes many structures, like: - Ancient alien buildings and data banks, where you can obtain knowledge of certain alien languages; - Outposts and spaceports, where you can obtain technology upgrades, replenish your health and shield, trade, upgrade your multitool, and interact with alien sentient races; - Drop pods, where you can buy extra slots for your backpack; - Downed ships, which can be scavenged for resources or be repaired and used; - Landmark towers, where you can save your game; - Beacons, which create waypoints to points of interest in the planet when activated; - Ore veins, which vary according to the planet and are usually exposed in surface, and can be mined for money or upgrades; - Abandoned outposts, which can be used to discover new locations, obtain alien language knowledge or find new upgrades.  Star systems, galaxies, etc, are also procedurally generated, including asteroid fields, huge fleets with star cruisers, space stations, etc.  Finally, there is an array of ways you can interact with life forms: - documenting wildlife you see; - finding knowledge of wildlife species in databanks; - learning words of alien languages (which gradually translates conversations between you and sentient aliens); - increasing or decreasing your standing towards sentient alien races through different actions.    Gameplay    In order to keep your character healthy, you must constantly obtain materials to repair your exosuit and recharge your life support system. Your starship also demands constant maintenance, specially if you plan to use it to quickly explore planets. The idea of grinding for resources might feel very annoying and repetitive, but as you make enough money to upgrade your stats, it will, eventually, pay off.  There is a single tool in the game, the multitool, that features four functions: laser miner, bolt caster, scanner and grenade launcher. The laser miner is the function you are going to use most. It is capable of destroying rocks, plants, ore veins and crystals and obtain their base materials, and it can also be used as a weapon if needed. The bolt caster is a blaster weapon, used primarily for defense. The grenade launcher is a digging tool that can easily create tunnels, and eventually used to mine or attack. Finally, the scanner helps you find useful items, highlighting anything it finds within its radius. Multitools have their own inventory, with a fixed number of slots, and the purpose of it is to install upgrades that improve its functions. Better multitools, with more upgrades/slots can be bought, but there is no way to equip multiple multitools at the same time, meaning once you replace your current one, the previous one is lost forever.  The backpack is the personal inventory of the player. It starts with a limited number of slots, which can be improved with extra slots as you explore. Items are sorted in, basically, two types: stackable and non-stackable. In the backpack, stackable items will stack up to 250 units per slot, which is not bad. The bad part is that exosuit upgrades also need free slots to be installed, and you can't see what upgrade you can or cannot build unless there is at least one free slot available. This design decision is really dubious, since there could be another set of slots dedicated just for upgrades. It gets even worse because three of these slots are always taken by the jetpack, life support system and exosuit armor, which are the basic functions of exosuit. They shouldn't take space in the same place you are going to use to store collected items, it doesn't make sense.  Now, for the starships. They work pretty much like the multitool, having their own inventory and upgrades, and being permanently replaced whenever you buy or activate a new ship. Ship inventory suffers from the same lack of logic of the backpack inventory: upgrades take the same space used by stored items (which, unlike player backpack, can stack up to 500 units per slot) and the basic functions of the ship (blaster cannon, take-off thruster, etc) also take spaces of its inventory. Ship control is very basic, pretty much like any arcade flight simulator, but when flying too close to the surface of a planet, the game automatically adjusts the angle and height of the ship according to the relief of where you currently are, meaning you don't have absolute control over your ship's movement. This causes your vision of the surface to be limited, and can make your life harder if you eventually enter into a dogfight with other ships. It can get worse: once you activate landing sequence, the game calculates the best place for your ship to land and the ship then begins to descend until it reaches the calculated position in the ground, and, sometimes, this can produce unexpected results, such as the ship ending up landing inside a cave, or in front of a big obstacle. This caused my ship to get destroyed twice when I tried to take-off, which in turn had me waste resources to fix damaged parts. This was definitely a terrible design choice. No problems when navigating through space, though.    UI    Exploration usually feels rewarding and immersive, but there are a few downsides: while all systems and planets you visit become listed in the menu, there is no easy way to find them again, should you ever plan to go back and finish discovering all landmarks in a planet, for instance. Also, you can not bring up the universe map when inside the atmosphere of a planet, only being able to when in space. Another dubious design choice.  Some actions you perform, such as unlocking a computer, helping a sentient alien or activating a beacon, create waypoints while you explore the planet. These waypoints can not be controlled in any way by the player. Also they, sometimes, disappear and reappear for no reason. The lack of some kind of local map also helps make it confusing. The only waypoint guaranteed to stay where it is if the starship one. In this context, UI needs to be reworked.  Beyond that, everything works fine.    Performance    Game runs smoothly on high end hardware, and in 16 hours, I got only two CTDs, which is usually not a bad number. Game code could still be improved to prevent such occasional crashes.  That said, I give it a 9/10.",

As far as I know this is the first game to take it this far.  2) The updates and new content are free. They will add all the things they promised in time. Just go play somthing else until then.  3) Update 1.1 is Awesome!  4) Even without ALL the content the game is still a great exploration/survival game. I already put over 100 hours into it and I can see there's a lot of potential for the future. ",

Aliens are quacking ducks unless you learn to talk to them, which is a really interesting goal of exploration. My character is less of an explorer and more of a scavenger.

The procedural generation feels organic for the most part, sprinkling in civilization as well as plants and animals. The interactions with NPCs are simple but dynamic and the technology discovery system has the potential to be a deep meta-game all on its own. Cataloging plants and animals certainly is, and is surprisingly addictive.

            "review_text": "First of all: This game is not for everyone! Some people love it, others hate it. I'm here to give my honest opinion on the good, the bad, and the annoying.  Second of all, my general feeling towards the game: I loved it! It's great to just roam around, see new places, new creatures, admire the sights, etc... Even if after a few dozen hours playing it starts to feel similar to places you've been before, it's a great experience. And, if you're patitient enough, you will eventually find something unique to that one planet, unlike anything you've seen before. Overall, it is almost exactly what I expected, but there is a lot of room for improvement. And I mean, A LOT! On with the review then!  The good: - Graphics are nice, but don't expect ultra-realistic stuff here. It has a unique art style, and on that context, I think it's great, leading to some breath taking scenes at times. For example, I was on a mostly barren planet once, duriong the day. It was ok, and seeing the sun set was a really beautiful experience. But when the night came... I literally lost my breath when I saw it. Lots of small dragonfly-like things, not sure if 'insects' or some other type of life form, or even some chemical thing. But it was beautiful. Lots of red dots filling the air a few feet above me. Sometimes they would form a big sphere around me, sometimes they just looked like stars, until I moved and realized they were a lot closer. Simply amazing. - The sounds. The sound effects are simply amazing! But what really shines is the ambient sounds. A lot of small details make you actually feel like you are exploring an alien planet. Distant aniamal cries, small animals squeaking about, insects (?) doing their stuff, the wind, the water, the cave sounds... Everything sounds so beliavable! Even if you're on a completely lifeless planet and hear something, you get that chill up your spine and the first thing you think is 'I must hide!', that's also awesome! Not sure if it's a bug, but if it is, I hope they keep it!  - The music: Not much to say here, just... AMAZING! 65DOS did a great job here, and the procedural coding perfected the context aware music! It's like you know how the song will be when you start combat, for example, but it's never quite the same! It's like when you recognize a song and think 'Oh, that song! I love that one!', but it's not quit that one, and still awesome to hear. - All this lead me to... The atmosphere. Oh, the atmosphere!!! They nailed it on this department!!!! All of the above work beautifuly together to create one of the most immersing atmosphere I ever experienced on a game! - The crazy stuff. Sometimes you'll see mundane things, recognizable animals, and landscapes similar to Earth's. But sometimes... You'll see a crazy horse-like thing with a worm head. A big primate with small butterfly wings. A floating island (not that uncommon). A really unique land formation, sometimes with a regular, almost crafted shape. And so many more things! Some may even be considered errors, but when you encounter stuff like that, it makes for a unique and joyful experience.  The bad: - The ship flying part. Overall, the ship controls feel very clunky. It's like it's either move or don't move. You move your mouse a bit, and nothing happens. You move a little more, and suddenly you went too far. Sensitivity settings don't really help here. But the really bad part here is flying on a planet. It's really, really, really bad. You can't go too close to the surface, because the 'autopilot' will move you back up, and keep you on some kind of rails. This really kills the flying experience. Also, it makes it nearly impossible to know where you'll land, which in turn may lead to some dangerous situations when taking off. Oh, and also makes dogfighting on a planet nearly impossible, because NPCs are not limited by this. I don't know if it's also because of this, but rolling is almost impossible on planets. If you roll and the pitch up to turn, as you would with a fighter plane, you just get lost because of the autopilot insisting that you make a different movement. It's weird, and takes a lot away of an otherwise joyful flying experience. - The sentinels. They are everywhere. Every. Single. Place. I think this really kills part of the 'into the unknown' experience. You won't find a single empty place where you can gather resources alone and in peace. (Except for some really deep caves). You can go to the most barren and with the lowest security possible planet, and when you land and start mining that big Emeril vein, there it is, a stupid sentinel scanning and getting mad at you. That is just awful, because I can't go anywhere to simply relax. Eventually I'll need supplies, and as soon as I start mining, I have to let the serenity go away, and start worring about not being seen by those f-ing flying robots. Yes, there are ways to escape them, but it kills the experience. I wish there was a way to just turn them off entirely, or at least make the low security planets really low security, without those things flying around everywhere. - Lack of maps. It's common to venture very far on a planet, and then want to return to a trading station you found a while ago. But it's simply impossible to backtrack, once you leave a place, it disappears from your HUD, unless you're very close to it again. And, sometimes you just found a gorgeous place, want to return there again later, maybe to show it to someone, or whatever. You can't, because once you leave it, you'll probably never find it again. So, a planet map would be really really great. But, of course, not only a planet map. A better galactic map would also be good, with a way to really know where you came from, a way to easily find on it a system you left behind a while ago. Or even find systems a friend discovered. Something like 'Search for X system. There it is, it'll take... 385 jumps to get there. Ok, at least I know it's there.'. This would also enable personal journeys to be created. Like 'I went through a black hole, ended up here. My objective is to get back to the X System.'. It'd be so much better... Oh, and a system map, where you can easily see all the planets there, of course.  The annoying: - Every planet is already explored. Well, not by players, but every planet has a lot of places with aliens on them. Every system has a space station. Everywhere one of those 3 races have a big presence. It's weird. It's one thing to only find ruins and abandoned places somewhere. It's another to go inside a building and meet an intelligent creature there, just waiting for me. This and the sentinels everywhere makes it impossible to feel truly alone and helpless. - The slots. Everything is about them slots, and there's NEVER enough of them. You only advance by getting more slots, and it's just annoying. More starting slots, please! Oh, and more stacking! - The survival. Well, it makes sense that there must be a challenge to get things going, but everything just decreases too fast, and instead of just exploring and searching for cool stuff, you always find yourself having to search for resources and manually reload everything (and with sentinels everywhere). Make it so everything decreases slower (or at least an option?) and automatically recharges if you have the right 'ammo'. A very simple fix. - The combat is shallow. It's not bad, but it's not satisfying either. It's just there, both on the ground and in space. - With all that, it feels like the only way to trully enjoy the game is to max everything out in the beggining, before leaving for your journey. That's the only way to 'feel safe' and be able to actually relax while exploring. That leads to people taking advange of exploits to progress faster. Well, at least that's what I did.  I think that's it. Like I said, this game is not for everyone! But even if you feel it should be for you, but you still on the fence, wait a bit. It'll get better!",

Somehow it manages be fun even while fighting my terrifically short attention span, so that's great. I enjoyed showing my kids the silhouette of a space station in orbit over a planet and then being able to go there to sell some crap for 'units', then head back to the planet to hit a winged-hippo-lizard in the face. Big fun for all of us.  It can be tedious and samey; you see the same animations a lot and those seconds all add up. Bases and outpost and other locations have limited variety.  That's all window-dressing, though. The good stuff is the lore that it's bottle-feeding you, sometimes one sentence at a time. It's pretentious and fun, and makes it worth staying on a single planet for hours. It's also the fun of looking at a distant mountain and saying 'I can go there, and in fact have to because that's where I left my ship which is the way I can leave this barren hellscape / lush rainforest'. Then, after emptying your inventory 6 times to ditch all the ♥♥♥♥ you'd thought was rare but keep tripping over piles of, you reach your ship, blast off into space, and hyperjump to your next adventure.",

I feel there is a large contingency of fanboys, forcing themselves to see a perfect game where it does not exist, alongside a large contingency of trolling flamers, hellbent on seeing this game fail for some odd reason (hi half of reddit). I find myself in the middle, with tempered expectations and expecting just about what we got: a flawed but interesting space exploration game.  A simple tweak vastly improved my performance. In the graphics options, set to MAX FPS cap. The default for some reason is the lowest possible setting, and reality caps your experience about 10 fps lower than whatever it's set at. A stupid error, but easily fixable. I installed later in the day, and have had zero crashing problems. I'm running 24GB of RAM, and a new 1080, with an i7-2600 @ 3.6. The game looks good on ultra settings, however the draw distance is a bit disappointing - I have a feeling this is a reality driven by the procedural nature of the code. Never the less, it would be nice to see textures further out. Looking out the cockpit of your ship while flying low over hillsides can yield some pretty impressive landscapes.  As an aside, dropping in and out of atmospheric flight ocassionally shows some graphical bugs as textures render at different draw distances from the player.  The UI is clunky, and takes getting used to. It reminds me of my limited time playing Destiny, long ago.  I've found so far, that the &lt; 10 planets I've visited all have life, are fairly similar in construct, and differ only by color at this point. I am curious to see if this changes as I approach the center (I've been avoiding reddit and gameplay footage to discover for myself). I worry that the gameplay will get slightly repetitive as I continue my trek towards the center; I can already feel a pattern of resource gathering and travel.  The language aspect of the game keeps interactions fresh, and spending some time looking for the monoliths to learn the various languages is an interesting sidequest that can drive a lot of exploration on each planet. I also wouldn't call these 'planet-sized planets', as the devs mentioned so many times. Some planets are large, but I wouldn't put them at Earth sized planets by any means. Maybe Lunar sized, or Pluto sized.  A big complaint of mine is the inventory capacities of your ship and suit. I understand the design choices behind it, but it does get frustrating running out of space when a huge stack of an element occupies the same amount of physical space as an orb or trinket. Having some customizable inventory management would be a nice addition.  Will this game keep me occupied after twenty, thirty hours? I'm unsure. However, very few games do any more. I feel this game has a fairly casual feel to it, and is accessible for an hour to two hour session at any time.   I'm not sure if I've been fortunate, or if a majority of players having success are staying silent (although, I think this might be unlikely), but I've had a fairly positive experience. This is a good casual exploration game with interesting scenery and a slightly intriguing lore. If you're looking for a shooter, stay away. If you're looking for Elite's better, shiny-er cousin, stay away. If you're looking for MULTIPLAYER, stay the hell away. This really is a single player experience. The combat and trading elements are quite secondary to the survival and exploration elements of the game. As designed, the player is driven into a nomadic lifestyle. I've heard rumors of basebuilding being a possible patch onto this game, but I honestly can't see how it fits into the experience. Maybe I'll understand the motivation as I get closer to the center of the galaxy (but, I'm not really expecting much change).  As a bit of a disclaimer towards the price, this casual space exploration genre is something I've been waiting for since I was a kid, so I'm a bit predisposed to enjoying the game, it fits me well. I'm not terribly upset at spending $60 on this game, as most AAA titles that run for this price have utterly disappointed me anyways. However, I'm at a point in my life where $60 for 30ish hours of entertainment over a month or two is an acceptable return. I'm hoping that I can get that longevity out of this experience. We'll see what the next couple of sessions bring.  TL;DR: 7/10, plenty of room for improvement, but not close to the dumpsterfire reddit and metacritic users reviews would have you believe (if you can get it installed and playing).",

            "review_text": "After countless delays and riding a huge hype wave, No Man's Sky was finally released this August and it is fair to say that, throughout time, not many games managed to divide opinion as much as this one.  In No Man's Sky, you explore a procedurally created universe full with 18 quintillion unique planets. Starting on a randomly allocated planet with your ship wrecked to bits, your first goal is gathering materials in order to repair it. After that, the universe is yours to freely do what you like among what seems like an infinite number of solar systems which you can 'warp' between.  In the short aftermath of the game's release, players have criticised it and developer Hello Games for countless things including lying about features the game was supposed to offer and didn't. For the avid fan who had huge expectations from this title, No Man's Sky can become repetitive and boring after a few hours. But looking on the bright side of things, it still offers a unique experience that for some manages to hide its flaws.   The vastness of the world available to discover is astonishing. This fact alone contributes on both sides of the coin. You can very easily find a similar repeating pattern upon travelling from planet to planet and from one star system to another, mining and trading your way towards some random objective you set out to complete. But on the other hand, the vastness in itself can lead to some amazing discoveries, beautiful sights and adventurous gameplay moments.  Some people may find not having an end-goal that is set in stone demoralizing. Sure, there is the centre of the Universe there to discover, but you may find the game more fun when setting out to do your own stuff. For those of you who truly just want to explore new worlds and to live childhood dreams of travelling through the universe, this game may captivate you fully.   Three different sized planets, one moon and a spaceship - the game offers numerous breathtaking moments like this. Exploring is the key word here. Sure, there are space fights, mining and searching for resources, learning alien languages, some sort of dialogue interaction with said aliens, fending off that pesky weird looking animal/monster that keeps attacking you, fighting sentinel drones, escaping storms and blizzards and hoarding money to buy that beautiful spaceship you desperately want to have.   But when the line is drawn, this game is all about exploring new worlds and living the experience of travelling through space with relative freedom and finding out what's out there. Although it can feel boring at times after a while, it can get better if one keeps playing because of certain features that one can only unlock after some good hours of playtime. That and the chance of meeting something new and rare add to the excitement.  The apparent lack of multiplayer options can cause a headache, especially since the developers stated that it will be available. This being said, if you want to buy the game for some cool playtime with your friends, this is not the title for you. No Man's Sky is best enjoyed alone - just you and the stars and planets above. The small chance of you stumbling upon a planet or system that was already discovered by another player can add to the 'so I am not alone after all' feeling, but don't count on that.  65daysofstatic's soundtrack for the game is worth buying alone. One of the biggest positive aspects of the game must be the sounds that accompany you on your journey. The sound effects are very well done, starting with the robotic voice that constantly bugs your ear with information, going through the various spaceship sounds you hear while flying and ending with the overall atmosphere that animals, wind, rain, various technologies and all other elements create during the time spent on a planet.   The music is also magnificent. 65daysofstatic managed to create an imersive score that is generated as you play the game, and the actual soundtrack album is absolutely perfect - one of the best albums of the year if you ask me.  The game's graphics don't seem to be out of this world for 2016 standards, but somehow, No Man's Sky manages to procedurally generate some amazing sights that you can only try and screenshot every time you witness them. It is a title for casual gamers and romantics that love to take slow walks in nature, not for the hardcore achievement-hungry competitive players. Because of this, the 60€ price tag may scare off some people, and it can be understandable.  All in all, No Man's Sky is a glorious game that has the downside of having to deal with the fact that it can get a lot better in time, if certain features make it into the game. Hopefully, they will. Hello Games has stated that it will constantly improve the game with their small team, and although many people will say otherwise, their accomplishment in releasing a game this big and interesting is reason enough to buy it.  No Man's Sky could just be the start of a whole new game subgenre and it can only get better.  Rating: 7/10, 3.5*",

Just a couple of irritating issues for me.   (1) I have to exit and restart the game every two hours or so, because the frame rate drops to 9-10 for no reason. (2) I'm fed up with the auto landing computer setting my ship down on top of cacti and skinny rocks - I keep losing half my health getting out of the ship !  I also did some experimenting with GFX settings and there is not an awful lot of difference between lowest settings and highest settings. The frame rates are not far apart either.

I've not had to 'hack' my settings to get better performance, I was getting a solid 40-60 fps, after attemping one or two performance 'hacks' I get up to 85fps, which isn't much of an improvement overall as I'm still enjoying the game just as much.  Gameplay has it's challenges, and I don't mean understanding how to do things. An upgrade needs a resource? Go find it, You're getting attacked by space pirates, bloody well shoot them down.

I have been itching to play this game ever since, watching interview after interview and becoming a fan of a game I haven't even played. Needless to say, when I was at work on Friday, August 12th, I was crushed when I got word of the game not even loading for some people. There were reports of severe hitching that made the game unplayable, people with $2,000 rigs complaining that performance was so bad they couldn't navigate the world properly, etc. With my humble $750 rig, I was immediately afraid that I wouldn't be able to run it.  So, when I got home, I was surprised when I turned on my PC and found that it... ran. FPS was pretty bad, but I resolved it by first lowering all of the graphics settings, restarting, and then bumping them all back up to high. Performance immediately improved. I experience hitching, but it's not bad enough to prevent me from playing.   My absolute biggest issue are the controls. Frankly, they're a joke considering this game was $60. The flight controls are completely counter intuitive; the ship has a mind of its own and tries to veer off in random directions. Leaving and entering the atmosphere is difficult. Again, for $60, I expect these things to be polished on release. I'm very disappointed with the inabillity to Alt Tab. The options to adjust graphic settings are very bare bones. The menues are not at all optimized for PC, which creates a frustrating experience at times. The inventory system is terrible, I'm constantly juggling between materials and found cargo. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that the PC release isn't finished. There's still a lot of work to be done and I HOPE that the devs address these things immediately. If they claim to love the game as much as they do, they should make these things a priority.  Now, onto the GOOD things. I'm very happy with the survival aspects. The game challenges you, you need to be aware of the condition your technology is in at all times. You'll occasionally find creatures that want to murder you on sight. It's pretty much exactly what I was hoping for. Some people aren't pleased with the grind for resources, but personally, I enjoy it. It's relaxing rather than frustrating.   The explorations aspects are what I enjoy most. I love discovering the creatures and even the plant life I come across. You're rewarded via currency when you upload your discoveries, so you can literally make a career in this game as just a plain old explorer. Each variety of life I've encountered is unique, some you can even befriend into following you.   Generally, I'm enjoying this game, which is why I'm saying I recommend this. However, the issues absolutely need to be addressed for me to feel as if it's worth the $60 investment. If you're experiencing issues that make the game unplayable, please, do not just sit around ♥♥♥♥♥ing on forums. Actually submit your issues to Hello Games so they can review and set to work on resolving them.",

No other human will have seen what you are seeing, and that adds a whole new level of awesome to the game. This game won't be for everyone, I do feel many people will tire of it rather quickly, but for anyone who has ever dreamed of exploring the stars this game is the closest I've seen to a game that fulfills that dream.

Please don't waste your time pandering to all the people that asked for planetary base building. The aim of the game is to explore. Base building can still be a thing but you should be adding it in the form of ships that we can customize internally.   We need different sized ships that can be decorated inside using materials gathered from all the planets we visit. There could be collectibles, furniture etc  All that is going to happen if you add base building on a planets surface is people will start complaining about the fact they have to do it all over again whenever they decide to stick on one planet for a while.",

The only negatives I have to say about it are it needs a larger viewing circle or better distance textures on planets, could use a bit more variety in the looks of everything on planets, and the mouse position resetting when flipping between menu and inventory screens is annoying.

They want to be led by the hand and feel overpowered immediately.   If you have no sense of imagination and need constant action this game is not for you. It's for those of us that love to wander and discover, to uncover a story of our own with a little helpful hint now and again along the way.   It's a universe to play in and it's excellent.

Hopefully HG will add more skeletons to their generation list) Interact with Aliens races and learn their languages (Limited for now.) Pick fights with sentinals (Planetary police force a-la GTA) Free roam! (Following the main path will give you relatively similar planets on your way to the center of the Galaxy. I recommend forging your own path to the center as you can run across more extreme star systems.)  If the three core ideas present in this game don't interest you, then move on. While it has other things to do in game, it's the three core mechanics that really drive the game. This is not a game you try to beat in X amount of hours by getting to the center of the galaxy. You can play it that way, but don't expect something grand and different. It will be more of the same. It's repetition at its finest. Gather X resource for X upgrade. Run out of inventory, sell, gather more resource, sell, upgrade inventory, sell. Again, if that's not for you, then move on, this is not your game.  There was a lot of gameplay ideas that did not make it to the launch, which encompasses half the negative reviews. The game is indeed a mile wide and an inch thick. But HG has expressed their plans to add to the depth in the coming weeks, so there is still hope. The other half of negative reviews deal with performance issues. People with top end machines couldn't run the game and people with potatos could play it just fine. Most of these performance issues have been fixed or have work arounds. You'll probably have to spend around 10 minutes to configure your settings for the game, however.  I have 20 hrs so far, and still find myself enjoying the game. I don't mind the game for what it is and what it offers now and didn't follow the two year hype around this game. I'll certainly get my $60 out of it and hope for future improvements. Again, if you don't like repetitive gameplay, this is not for you. But if you are interested in the game but on the fence from all the negative reviews, I'd say wait awhile and see what updates HG will push out. If they start to add more non dlc content, it would be worth the buy. If not, it's your call.   6/10 At Launch with no content update",

            "review_text": "TLDR: If you like exploration and (mostly) solo survival games on an epic scale, I recommend it. If you want action packed fighting, linear story lines, or lots of friends to play with, this is obviously not the game for you. While I worked fine on day one, all the issues other are experiencing obviously indicate it may be worth waiting for a little bit to buy. Don't worry, there will still be plenty of virgin planets to call your own when you log in.  Longer version:  Lot of hate and vitriol, damn few game reviews.  Put in some time today and overall, I like the game. I like the concept of exploring new planets, finding a hundred different kind of plants, animals and minerals, and uploading them all to some galatic guidebook. I went for a swim in a radiactive sea to find some submerged ruins. Took 4 minutes to get there and back and the only question was if I'd run out of oxegyn or rad shielding first. I've been attacked by a droid, a plant, a prehisoric sabertooth looking guy, that damned ocean and sometimes the air around me.   The complete lack of tutorial threw me at first (I couldn't figure out how to use the Atlas so that may have helped) but most of the game is pretty intuitive. The crafting setup is not instinctive so I findmyself dropping out of the window I want pretty regularly, but hitting Tab to reopen it is hardly the end of the world. It's a little frustraing to deal with really limited inventory while trying to gather the things you need to build and fuel your first hyperdrive. The ability to swap from inventory to ship (when close enough) is helpful but overall the lack of stacking, lack of bags and sheer number of items (mineral, fuel, trade goods, upgrades, etc.) and limited ability to sell or convert items has made this part of the game a little annoying.  Biggest current performance downside for me is an apparent memory issue. After about a couple hours in game things slow down. Not frame rate stutter, just everything you do. You run like you're in molasses, you shoot slower, open inventory slow and need 3 times as long for the alien interaction text to come up. I'm certain it's on the list of things to address after all the crashing issues are resolved. For now I'll consider it a built in indicator that I need to go take a break.  All in all, it's a recommend for me. Hopefully I'll be able to meet up with friends some day but if not I'm still enjoying the game.",

There seems to be little reason to follow a particular path or focus other than your own interest. would be nice if things were a bit more of a challenge.  Pros: Very easy to just hang out and wander space and the planets, no pressure, no external quest lines you have to follow, some very nice settings out there.

Since the game is online they will probable be adding more content. It would be nice if there was an overlay in the galactic map or search feature which would make it easier to refind worlds. Additionally, it would be nice if there was a planetary map or a way of marking say tradeposts to revisit them more easily, as the planets are vast. The modules which upgrade the spacesuit, spaceship, an weapon seem to be generic an have a maximum number of slots, I dont know why they would have a maximumm number of slots in an infinite universe, or be generic across all alien races planets, hopefully they will add alien race specific procedurally generated blueprint modules an remove the maximum caps on number of possible modules.

The game isn't perfect however, as even with a quite expensive and high performance MSI gaming laptop, it was certainly playable, but definitely not optimized. I experienced a stuttering, but acceptable game for about an hour or two per session and then it started to get slower quite rapidly, even becoming unplayable after only 3 hours game time. This contrasts quite heavily to a friend of mine, for whom the game ran smoothly on max settings, clocking in at 60+ fps average (I advise you check with a friend owning a similar pc build in advance of purchasing it, whether or not it will run on your pc).  Unfortunately the biggest turnoff was the clutter of hype and misinformation from the pre-release community, making me think I bought a multiplayer game that would allow me to explore with friends... Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. This game is, and will for quite a while remain, a singleplayer ONLY game. This is not necesarily a bad thing in my opinion, but I would not have payed the 60 euros for it had I known in advance. This cannot really be blamed on the devoloper however, but rather on too many people likening it to other titles such as Dangerous Elite and confusion arising from this comparison.  tl;dr: -Good game -Infinite 'replayability' -Currently poorly optimized for many systems -Singeplayer only (for a time at least)",

The space combat is atrocious so far in my opinion, and past the procedurall generation is great, but the game lacks most depth past this. The game can also be really fun if you do progress quickly like I did, and when I mean progress I mean finding the things you need to move from system to system. I started by fixing my ship, then I found leads of creating antimatter, the game told those can be found at manufacturing plants, I go and break into a manufacturing plan and BREAK IN TO IT payday style and get the the recipe I need, then I found did this again to find the recipe of electron vapour. This is all great but then the game stagnated with trying to find somewhere where i could buy the recipe for suspension fluid, which need to make warp cells which are needed to get from star system to system.   So all in all the game is fun and can be exciting, but if you stop making progress the game can seriously stagnate.

Leas favorite moment: Realizing I screwed up from the start, so I had to basically restart to get a firm grasp of the tutorials.  All-in-all, this game was most of what was promised and all of what I expected. People who expected mor eweren't paying attention to thr message frm day 1 or were looking for another experience all-together. Highly recommend this for the adventurous and patient.",

I agree there are many design issues and plenty of bugs (not just the alien kind). For instance i strongly suggest you dont start the Atlas Path untill you are ready to do it to the end (have 10 slots ready for it). I am personaly stuck now and until they fix the waypoints clearing system i wont be able to find the Atlas again :( Even so, im sure this will be patched, and if it isnt ill jut play it all over again, IMHO its worth it. Get into it with the will to explore and enjoy the galaxy and take your time and you will have a wonderful time. At any rate there is more fun and content in this game that most others, might not have the depth we would like it to have but its still a masterpiece, even in this unpolished format. So even with all its flaws and me being kinda/sort stuck on the story progression i still love it and play it as much as i can. Congratz Hello Games, i was really waiting for something like this :)",

I run the game on an i7 4770 with the amd radeon r9 290x.  Performance out of the way I'll tell you my thoughts on the game. I have played the game for a total of 22 hours and just finished my ~11 hour session. I think I'm addicted haha. But when you sit there eleven hours straight you start realising the potential problems for the game, for example - the grind is real. I mean really, really, really real. It's insane. From my playtime I have achived one ship worth ~1.2 million and have an additional 3.7 million on me. For a really good ship you need 17 million.   But the thing is, it's okay because this is sort of the purpose of the game - exploring, mining, trading. You get more resources, blueprints and additional units by exploring, it's all in the exploring. Sometimes you get lost in the 'story' and you don't really know what to do, because the narrative isn't the focus. It's frustrating at times but is really rewarding at it's best.   As you make your way through the galaxy you get to explore planet sized planets (as Shaun Murray says all the time) and they are really unique and interesting most of the time. But as much as I love seeing new planets and animals it starts to get repetetive. You see the same skeleton structure of animals over and over again and you start seeing through the games algorythmes. I tried to change things up mid- play by becoming a pirate, to change things up a bit, but I got shot down right away. This game really plays with risk reward, but doesn't really encourage the player to do anything but mining, because it's the safest and most rewarding way of play.   Summary: You maybe shouldn't be listening to me, because I might be going insane and I should probably eat something, but the game is fun. Really fun in fact. But it gets repetitive, it really does and i guess it comes down to what sort of person you are. Set your own goals, push the limits and No Man's Sky might just be the best game you'll ever play. But then again, it's repetitive and needs FREE, not paid because then I will litteraly visist Shauns house at night and stab him, content updates. If not I'll stop playing when I get to the center of the universe, and i suspect you will to.",

You have to be the type who enjoys sandbox adventures, where you create your own story, your own adventure, and don't need to be lead by the hand. While there is a story in No Man's Sky, it is not one that is easy to follow and you have to hunt for the answers. I am 12 hours in and I still have so many questions with only a few answers I have come to solve.  Such as the alien race I am with are against the sentientals, due to some old reason. There is this Atlas calling to me to follow its directions, and a strange alien spore that seems to consume life, but yet to all this, I have yet to solve some of the answers as to why, but I know, bit by bit, it will be explained and this is also why the game is not for everyone. You have to enjoy the hunt, the search, and wonder what is around every corner.  It is a game about adventure, your OWN adventure, not the path everyone else walks, but how you, yourself, walk that path. To sit back and compare stories with friends, who, like you, are also trying to survive in a mysterious galaxy.  For those who do not like this type of gameplay, they will find the game boring fast. For those who like a direction given to them, they will find themselves lost, confused, and frustrated. This though, is alright, because again, this game is NOT for everyone and I would not recommend it to everyone, but only to those who love the things I have stated.  It is also not about the latest graphics or realistic combat, as you have games like Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous for those, both which I have played, both which I respect, but no. This game is not like those. It is more relaxed, more colorful, and more fitting of its art style that mimics the older days of sci-fi. If you want real, you will not find it here either.  Now, do I believe the game is worth 60? That is hard to say. I have no regrets spending the money for this game or supporting a small Indie company, but that price tag is one you have to decide if YOU think it is worth it, for me, it was, but for others, they may desire to wait for the sell, or for things like Base Building to come into exsistance, and that is fine as well.  In the end, I do enjoy this game greatly. I find it has breath taking moments, mysteries to be pondrered over, and a video game experience I have no felt since the early days of Minecraft and even harkening back to older games where things felt like a true adventure. I give this game an 8/10 and I know I'll be playing it for years to come.  As for you reading, go check some Youtube streams, twitch streams, maybe Let's Plays, and make your own choice if you believe this game is for you.",

            "review_text": "It's breathtaking, enormous, gorgeous and packed with amazing adventures. Problem is, the adventures to be had are so white-washed and thin that everything this game promises only about 50% are truly achievable and remarkable. Crafting is so bland and unremarkable that everything it is now needs to be upgraded, rehabbed and made better by the devs. We, as gamers, need more to chew on. The story is so veil thin and unremarkable that a game of this magnitude absolutely DEMANDS more and much, much better. There are so many 'No's' but also so many 'Yes's' that this game deserves a chance to be made better by the devs. It truly does.    So, what exactly is wrong with this game? I'm sure you've read all the 'haters' reviews. 5 minutes of game time and they're bashing the game because it won't work properly, run properly or even at all. Thing is, Hello Games has even stated publicly that over 1/3 of all the tickets inputted into their ticket system have well BELOW the marked specs for the game. BELOW the specs. Head scratcher? Nah? Common ♥♥♥♥ing sense. Listen, if you're pc or laptop does NOT meet the specs, don't complain when it doesn't run properly. Period. That's common ♥♥♥♥ing sense.    What else is wrong? Well, travel is fantastic. Exhilarating even at times. There's a few things that annoy me personally. One, the distance from entering a planet's stratosphere to meeting the ground takes a whopping 30 seconds, if that. I KNOW this game isn't based on realism, but c'mon. From outerspace to ground in less than 30 seconds is not 'believable'. Equipment degradation happens way to quick. Personally, your life support shouldn't need 'fixed' every minute. Makes no sense. These ♥♥♥♥ing drones. Seriously. If you happen to be extracting minerals and one of these ♥♥♥♥ers happens to come too close it'll set off the whole bunch of em against you. While easy at first, the fact you can visit planets that you will get swarmed in 30 seconds by a dozen or so. Just, not fair. Also, what is their purpose? Why are they even scanning everything that you seem to want to extract?   There's no real cement to the story. No real reason you seem to want to travel, to extract, to help. We get some written dialogue, no spoken. Even aliens don't really beep or moan or anything. You get written 'dialogue' pertaining to the alien thoughts and spoken word. While I do like the fact you can 'learn' the language it takes a LOT of time to know enough words to understand even 1 alien. Needs some work to make a little better.     All in all, there are probably too many things to nitpick about. The game does a LOT right. It really does. Travel, the many, many accessible upgrades you'll get for your mining tool and ship. It all adds up to a lot of fun. We need more and a lot different randomizations for each planet and camps. Too many look identical in their make-up. Aliens all look the same. 'Puzzles', ie, random objects you need to solve in order to accomplish some kind of goal are entirely all too easy. They're also all the exact same in the end. You have, maybe half a dozen or so random puzzles you'll have to solve over and over and over again. Needs more randomization and some harder puzzles implemented.    The game looks gorgeous. There's some really annoying pop-in that happens and no amount of graphical distance spacing seems to help. I believe it's the tech and NOT a GPU intensive job. The tech is just making assumptions based on your distance from the objects and THIS needs fixed as well. Badly. It happens ALL THE TIME. You'll notice it. It doesn't neccessarily take away from the immersion but it can be annoying when you're playing with everything on 'high' and nothing helps. While the game looks amazing at times, stupid things that people like to see are not available. You're just a floating arm. Looking down reveals you have no legs. Getting in and out of the cockpit could have a really cool cut scene that can happen showing your entire body. It does not. In fact, you don't even get to pick if you're a man or a woman. You're just a human, I'm assuming.    Sound design is wonderful but can be weird at times. You might notice some sound 'lag' when shooting asteroids or whatnot. It rarely happens, but again, should be fixed.    The game NEEDS some kind of mapping allowable while you're adventuring on a planet. That would be handy dandy. Star maps are okay but can get tedious accessing and trying to figure out where you're going because it doesn't auto align itself.    All in all, it's a good game that can be great. If the devs really follow through and fix what's missing and/or broken this will evolve into an epic space/adventure sim that will just OWN the genre.",

No Man's Sky is for people  who enjoyed 2001, The Martian Chronicles, Cosmos by Carl Sagan,  and anything that just opens the mind up to whatever might come.  First of all, it's a procedural game. What does that mean? Well,  not even the creators know exactly what you might find since  everything is created with mathematical procedures that they  developed. It's an amazing experience, diving you into a world of  colors, creatures and the unknown. That is the key to the game,  not the center of the universe. The unknown. Every time you play,  you don't know what might happen or not, see or experience, hear  or explore. It's not linear. Space is open, endless, boundless,  empty at points and most of all, who knows. No Man's Sky gives  you the opportunity to let go, dive in, who cares about score or  what you have, there's no competition besides what your mind and  eye might find. It's an explorer's game, for fun and excitement  of roaming around a world that could be whatever it might be at  that given time.   If you want to be pampered and want it easy, things to kill,  stuff to buy, right away, this isn't a game for you. But, I would  let my kids play this game in a second, truly mellow and immense  environment where perhaps they might learn something about being  passive. I play games and enjoy all kinds but No Man's Sky is  trying to introduce you to an game that wants you to come inside,  explore, open it up and see. You can play at your own pace,  explore the entire planet you're on, see, feed, make friends with  the creatures and relax. The music is great, the ambient sounds  really throw into where you're at the time and some action,  shooting things, ships, gathering items, for those with the itchy  trigger finger. Yes, you can run around shooting everything but  not the point. And what is the point, well, perhaps there isn't  one. I think it's about immersion, taking you mind for a while on  a small journey into your ship, investigating worlds like they  once were perhaps for travelers back in the day on this planet,  very unknown.   I highly recommend you try this game and just sit back, have a  drink, rest, turn the lights off, put on a podcast or some music  and enjoy. Leave the shooting for another day.",

If you are only into twitch games (first person shooters or real-time strategy games) or story-deep games-on-rails (where you truly are not the master of your own destiny), you're going to have a bad time with NMS. This game is not going to spoon feed satisfaction to a weak imagination.  However, if you are a sci-fi fan who has always wanted to fly all sorts of spaceships, explore gorgeous alien vistas, and find exotic exotic lifeforms then this game hits the bulls-eye. Just existing in the NMS universe, stories will just happen. Go for a walk and adventure will find you. Set your own goals and be surprised what twists and turns naturally unfold before you. I personally enjoy the laid-back play-style.   If you are in the mood for a more challenging experience then make harder goals for yourself. For example, try walking around the equator of a small moon that has a hazardous atmosphere and is prone to punishing storms. The mods for this game are amazing. Pick the right collection of mods and you will have a brutal survival game. This game is has the potential to be anything you want it to be.

Getting 60 fps without issue in space flight, but on planet it runs mostly stable at 30. In space station rooms it dips into the 30s from 60, which is unfortunate, but this machine was new for me in 2011 and has been upgraded over the years since. No crashes, no gsync flag edit (I tried, but had no discernable effect for me). I did try to run it at 4K, but that just wasn't playable. Bumped it back down to 1080 and restarted the game. Ran great. I hope for others' sakes they get the game working for them.  I wouldn't call the game fun or amazing, but I'm compelled to keep playing it. It's calming for me and I enjoy it. Played it on PS4 earlier this week and on the PC for me it feels about the same in terms of graphics, but I'm on medium settings for textures and such. As for actually playing it and how that goes, it's great for me.",

I was told it would be great and so I said, 'Well, might as well wait for the PS4 release and if I like what I see on youtube, I'll preorder for the preorder exclusives.  Well, I'll say what I think now, and you can keep reading if you want to know why. This game is a work of art. I don't mean like a 5 year old's art, or my grandmothers (pretty good) art. I mean, Da Vinci art.   How I enjoy these sort of games ====================== I love Sci-fi, especially in games. I don't really like survival games, because half the game is grinding. I hate overhyped games I like random generation.   The good ======= -The random generation is nice and (mostly) smooth.  -The language system is unique and original, giving even MORE goals  -You can be a SPACE PIRATE (to bad you cant be a ninja, oh well, we got warfarm for that.  -The gameplay is smooth  -You can upgrade EVERYTHING  -More inventory can be obtained (Suck it minecraft)  -This game will always have new things and things you may never have seen.  -You really feel how small you are  -Scanning and naming is really fun  -There are cactus shaped like that manly part down below.    The bad ====== -This game is sort of laggy for all of the snobs who have always used good computers. I am used to mid-tier computers so 30 FPS is totally fine in my opinion  -You don't have much inventory space and upgrades take up inventory. Luckily you can upgrade all of your inventories (Now I have an OP shotgun multitools with 7 slots.  -You don't learn words fast enough  -Some resources are much too hard to get  -Warp cells are harder to get than the freaking dragon balls.  -No multiplayer D':     The 'please fix oh my god game breaker' =============================  -Sometimes disappears revealing the desktop and I lose all my progress since my last save which is anywhere frome 10 minutes to a half an hour.  -You can't fly close to the ground so you cant reinact your favorite star wars scenes.  -You can't skip the milestone alerts.    So long story short, if you're not a rich snob who likes sci-fi and sandbox, this game is for you. If you are, GO PLAY MINECRAFT YOU RICH PIECE OF-",

            "review_text": "It's a game about exploration, awe, and science fiction. IMHO.  There are better space ship management sims, far better. Better dogfighting and shooting games, far better. More graphically impressive space games, more realistic space games, games with greater depth in just about every area that No Man's Sky could concievably contain.  Other than exploration. While it may not have 'lived up to the hype' for a lot of people, it's worth remembering that people way over hyped this game. It was a cool idea and exciting, it was never going to be the second universe everyone seems to want. My biggest disappointment wasn't actually with the game, but I wasn't expecting the impractical or obscenely detailed. It was the design choices.  So, here's my list of why this game is totally awful;  1. Removal of control from the player. Find a save spot? Welcome to several seconds of disembodied head floating and staring off into a cliff for no reason while you'd rather be sandpapering off your face. 2. Achievement widescreen. Why? Why do I care if I walked a bunch of arbitrary units? No what I care about is the giant monster growling up my backside but I can't shoot and my hud is gone and there is a giant medal flashing in my face for no reason. I get the feeling whoever had this idea has walls and walls of trophys for dumb sports and showing up and walking arbitrary numbers of units and they just had to share their joy of shiny objects with everyone.  ....Here's a tip; stay away from that person they're dangerously stupid.  3. Inventory management. Hundreds of units of iron? Or one small access card. Seems legit. Sept for the part where I want to gouge out my eyes with my thumbs because when have you ever left a huge square area of empty space around your bank card when you store it in the trunk of your car. Is a wallet too much to ask for? What about a cargo upgrade for my ship so I don't have to cram all my minerals next to the engine and systems. Who does that? Do you tape your luggage to the bottom of your car? Under the hood? WTF.  4. Some of the POIs will rip your head off your body, hurtle it into the air, and then suck you back down. Presumably to remind you that pop-in exists. And by remind I mean grab the back of your head and bash it into pop-in until your teeth bleed.  K.  But I like it a lot. In the moments in between all that, it's actually not all bad. If you prioritize resource farming to high value, and plan out your routes and upgrades, take it one thing at a time, most of the issues with inventory go away. Surprisingly I enjoy the farming, it's more difficult to manage space for resources than it is to find them, and some rare materials pay well enough that you can cram your inventory with that for quick money.  Edit;  People tearing into the game should probably check their own expectations first. I watched this game get hyped to the point of insanity. Go watch peoples youtube videos and listen to the theories put out there by people before the game was released. The kinds of stuff people expected from this game weren't always reasonable, and sometimes they were down right insane. Stuff that makes you wonder if they didn't confuse 'Procedural Generation' with magic.  Here, take this analogy. Tesla released a car with an auto-pilot feature. It explicitly states in the handbook to keep your hands on the wheel and be at attention at all times even when auto-pilot is active. Someone has already died from not following that simple direction.  It wasn't a missing feature, it wasn't a false promise, it wasn't the worse thing that ever happened. It was someone who had expectations that far exceeded their reality. Just like many critics have with this game.  Oh and I wouldn't be surprised if a fair number of people bought it thinking it was going to be like call of duty but with space ships and were sorely disappointed when the game didn't immediately start cramming explosions and scripted cutscenes at them.",

It's got a small, hugely dedicated team.  There WILL be FPS drops on the first day of release, of course there will.  It's a multi platform game where obviously the consoles would have had more attention to begin with. I mean, let's compare this to Black Ops 3 for example,.. I bought that on release day and insta-refund. The drops were so high it was unplayable. And that's from a triple A studio. It's fine now, but it took some time and several patches.  I don't have a great system by any means (intel i5 4460 3.2ghz Nvidia 750 TI ) but it is running fine on mine with MINOR lag, and the game is of course, BEAUTIFUL. I may have annoyed a few sentinels and died within 15 minutes, but I love the feature where you can recover your inventory by going back to your 'grave'.  So far so good, and I know it's only going to get better. Instead of leaving unhelpful 'not recommends' leave your issues on the forum boards where the team will no doubt be reading people's issues. :)   Hello Games should be proud, it seems stunning. Future updates will no doubt fix the lag issues, it certainly seems like it'll be worth the wait.  - I'll add more with more game time, but for now I'm gonna go immerse myself! Don't let the bad reviews put you off people!  EDIT: Also just found out that (and correct me if I'm wrong but I got these figures off their website) this game was made in less that 3 years... by 15 people. = Mind Blown.",

I was a little disappointed when I discovered some of the limitations, but I made the most of the game, nonetheless.  The game is mostly procedurally generated. This means that you'll find most planets have a different terrain, weather, certain minerals, type of Flora (Plant life), number of Creatures, Alien NPCs, etc.  Pros: -The story revealed through the relics and the abandoned structures is actually quite interesting. -You may find some of the scariest or majestic creatures out there. -The landscape can make for some breathtaking images (wallpapers Cover pictures / etc.) -You cannot crash your ship into anything but asteroids. -Shows lots of promise.  Cons: -Due to the randomness of it, you may actually see a bit of repetition. -No real risk, unless you're really trying to die. And even then, it's pretty difficult. -You may find some of the stupidest creatures out there. -You cannot crash your ship into anything but asteroids. -No real specialization, yet. -A lot of the content that was show to or otherwise revealed to us before launch was not in game. -Finding that last species, just to name it Waldo or Carmin Sandiego. -lots of grinding just to earn enough for a new ship or exosuit upgrade.  Overall: If you enjoy (randomness, pseudo-exploring space, collecting, or just looking for an experience), this game's for you. But if you're looking for action, a simpler EVE, or the giant snakes from the previews. This game is not for you... Yet. :P  P.S.

Ignore the reviews from people complaining after playing for 5 minutes. If your game crashes after the intro, use Google and debug the issue (No Man's Sky Twitter even has some suggestions). If you can't handle that, go buy a PS4.  As for the game, I don't pay attention to hype. I don't read reviews from people paid to write reviews. I let the game come out, then I watch people on Twitch play. If it looks like something I'd enjoy, I buy it. It's that simple. I can't believe how many people are complaining about what the game should or could have been. Unless a game is the third or fourth game in a series, it's silly to think you know what the game will be based on previews and demos.  That said, the game is a ton of fun for those of us that love exploration, management, and western RPGs. In the Elder Scrolls games, if you're the type to say 'F the main quest' and go wandering into the wilderness, then you'll enjoy this. If you're the type that favored combat and questing, then this won't be your cup of tea. The 'quest' in NMS is extremely vague and only serves to push you onward.  As for repetition, the worlds and creatures are programmatically created, so they won't all be winners. If you don't like a world though, you're just a little plutonium away from the next.

I feel like there are a lot of mechanical and ecenomic components to the game that make it slow going to aquire new ships and equipment. Id like to see future updates allow users to destroy their ship and take it apart for materials or at least have the ability to sell that 115,000,000unit ship... Also the Atlas passes should be found earlier in game play and I think that algorithm is somewhat broken...Other than that this game has kept me entertained for 200 hours the Amino android app has made it even funner... Hopefully we will see some updates soon or many people will quit playing...  15 hours in and I have been to three planets I have already ditched my preorder ship for a better one and I have learned over 100 words of an Alien language which was a pretty cool addition to the game.  Pros: 1. It has beautiful artistry the color scheme reminds me of classic scifi novel covers like Forest of The Night. 2. Planet falls without cut scenes are just breath taking and mind blowing. 3. Alien interaction is awesome you litterally have to learn their langauge word for word...Bad ♥♥♥ lol (Dogdo) 4. Runs rather smoothly after tweeking gfx settings.  Cons: 1. I can't seem to figure out how to plot a course to an alien colonial settlement or place I've already been to. 2. There doesn't seem to be a planet map generated which makes you get lost trying to find your way back to that Alien that didnt smack you upside the head for accidentally insulting his ancestors. 3. The initial set up for GFX settings doesnt work and people experience Frame rate drops or lag this is remedied by setting all GFX settings to low restarting the game then setting all GFX settings to high FPS to 60 V-sync on FXAA on if you gottem and restarting the game again...Pain in the ♥♥♥ but the game runs smoothly after following these steps...Not a huge deal really in the scheme of things. 4. And in my opinion the worst thing about this game is Ding Ding Ding The trolls who know nothing about programming slamming the creators of such a brilliantly produced and implemented super algorithm of epic proportions...God forbid you have to do some configuring to get your game running smoothly if you dont like that aspect of PC gaming then get a console otherwise it just makes you look weak.",

The actual game itself?  It's beautiful. Every planet, every thing you do feels unique. You can look off into the horizon, a purple mist settling over view, see dusky stars and a far-off planet. You wonder what's going on there. That planet you see, so very far away? Well guess what, jump in your ship and go!   There's too much to say about the game, and I've only played for three hours. It rewards exploration, and doesn't get too needy with what little of a questline it has. It gives you the tools to accomplish your own things at your own pace. Go out, explore. Don't mind the negative reviews. Buy it; If it doesn't work, return it. It's one of the most amazing games I've ever played, and like I said, only three hours in! I can't wait to explore everything it has to offer.  ",

            "review_text": "Unlike most people, I enjoyed No Man's Sky. Now, this review will probably get a lot of hate, especially since I'm going to address many claims people made about the game.  1. Multiplayer Yes, multiplayer was promised for the game, but it wasn't completed at the time of release. And with this big of a universe in a game, it would be nearly impossible to find other people anyway.  2. Performance issues This one is easy, and it happens with almost every new game like this.  There are millions of different combinations for PC hardware, and developers can't test them all, so sometimes they have to assume how the game will perform on hardware that they don't own.  3. Advertising and hype Well, I don't even know where to begin here. The hype for this game was unbeleiveable. And that's mostly to do with the fact that the videos that were shown of the game were pre-rendered, and not actually in game footage. You guys do realize that almost every developer uses pre-rendered materials for trailers and promotions right?  4. False claims When people say that false claims were made about the game, I agree. But, you do have to realize, these developers were probably just as excited, if not more, as us for this game.  It's their baby, so of course they're going to brag about planned features, and things that they want this game to become!  Overall, this is not a terrible game if you like grinding and tedious repetetive tasks. Even though the game is not all it's cracked up to be, it's still not terrible, especially with the new base building update that gives you more to do than just explore. If you were expecting the game to look like the trailers above, don't get your hopes up. The game does a good job of making every planet look the same, and sometimes that's not a bad thing. It means you'll always be near resources that you need to make your ship go. The only lack-luster things that need improvements on planets is weather. Trading is one area of the game that could be improved. I would love to see the ability to create an intergalactic business where you sell the materials you mine from planets. I would also love to see automatic mining and crafting, and maybe farming. This would maybe be an end-game thing, but it would be something to sell on you intergalactic business. I can't wait to see what this game will bring in the future, but for now, it lives in infamy.",

So sorted all that, game runs perfctly well, no crashes.    Gameplay: it has lived up to my expectations; exactly what I was hoping. Nice and chill, no direction and simply exploring. I found a better ship, repaired it, upgraded my multi tool, my jump jets I feel pretty rocking. Already hit 1mill units, saving up for one of them fancy ships :D   THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! This game is chilled out, you can end up do nothing but achieve a lot. Like I am learning the Korvax language and discovering my first planet, its at 87% currently. Been doing a lot of trading. Not touched on fighting ships right now, will wait until I get a better ship to try that out :D  Music and sound affects are nice, easy on the ears and very chill. I feel like I will play this game a lot just to explore, I really enjoy flying, and multi tool mining, well worth the wait for me. I recommend this game to people who don't need to follow a set storyline, those who have a big imagination that can utilise this giant playground of a game.   Disappointed: They need a bigger FOV, its a bit of an annoyance if you like to see a bit more around you. Apparently if you did find another playeer you wont see them, so hopefully they patch that in, cos that would be nice. They should also not fix FPS, and V sync upon initial start was just annoying having to change it, and you HAVE to reset for changes to take place.

I did pick it up on the Foundation update. This added a lot to the game and made it more my style. Not to mention, I was able to get it at the discounted price of $35.99. If it were still $59.99, I wouldn't get it unless they add Multi Payer. Then in a second. As of writing this review I've put 3.7 hours into the game. A far cry from what I will be putting into it I'm sure.  The base building is sweet.  The exploration is well done.  Ground combat is a bit simple.  Haven't gotten into space combat yet, so can't comment there.  Crafting seems pretty deep now.  And now you can hire aliens to work for you in your base, and they give quests! True, it's a sandbox game, but a little direction from time to time tied to new schmatics is just what this game needed. I do hope they introduce full multiplayer to the game. I think the little message bots you can leave is them dipping thier toes into it. If you enjoy games like Ark, Osiris and Rust I would check this game out for your self now. Now, the ending to the game is pretty lame. I've seen the youtube vidoes of it and not really going to try to get to that point. I'm playing it to explorer and just live inside this universe for a while to escape from the pressures of today.   If you can get it at a discount, get it.

I personally have no idea why so many people thought the game would:  a) have meaningful multiplayer b) have good space combat  I didn't see any evidence of either in what I saw before hand. IMO the game did exactly what it said on the tin because I didn't read between the lines and naivly expected things that were just not going to happen.

Game: Single player exploration with few enemies to make life hard. Trading with language barriers but typically positive. Worlds are not vastly different but what do you expect of life producing planets? It's not difficult but if I want challenges I'll walk out my front door.

I remember watching the original trailer for the game when it was revealed about two years ago and having my doubts, and while a large number of features that were promised don't seem to have made it into the product we received at launch, I'm still very happy that we received as much as we did.  It's one thing to go into something like Subnautica and swim around for a bit in something hand-crafted by the developers. But to go into No Man's Sky, and have just the moon of a planet be larger than anything most other games could ever hope to achieve is incredible to me, and with hardly any loading in between.   Minecraft might be massive, but when I'm travelling around the limitless world at a fraction of the speed I'm capable of travelling in No Man's Sky, the game still runs into caching issues, throwing me at large masses of blocks that haven't even loaded into the game yet. This is even disregarding the game's incredibly long initial loading screen. And despite being in development for as long as it has, vanilla Minecraft is still lacking much substance. It relies on the community to create its content for it.  While I'm hoping that No Man's Sky will one day have the community support other games in the genre have, at the moment, the vanilla content is quite significant. I'm not simply trying to survive like in Subnautica, or crafting my way to the Ender Dragon. I'm trying to reach the center of the universe.  It almost feels like what I'd hoped Starbound would eventually become. Each type of planet feels unique. And as you progress further into the game, you need to be prepared before stepping out onto the surface of some of the harsher but more rewarding planets.   Ignore the reviews from those who've played less than 10 hours. Games get more difficult as you progress through them, everybody knows that. No Man's Sky isn't Dark Souls where your first few moments will leave you dead. The game eases you into the deep end so by the time you get there you're actually ready, and if you can't deal with not having everything thrown at you at once, maybe this isn't the game for you.  Early on I stepped onto a planet that claimed its sentinels were on high security. As soon as I stepped out of my ship, I found some various items that were worth more individually than a stack of anything I'd ever picked up before. Not long after picking them up, I was being chased by sentinels of all shapes and sizes. On another planet the regular temperature was -200°C, with storms that brought that down to -300°C. Like I said, you need to show up prepared to fight off whatever it is that some of these more extreme planets will throw at you.  Reading other reviews, I'm not entirely sure what other people wanted from this game that it didn't deliver on. You wanted multiplayer? As disappointed as I am that it doesn't have multiplayer, that's simply not the game it was advertised as. Sean Murray may have made some things out to seem like they would be better than they are. But at no point did he stress that this game would be focused on multiplayer aspects. You can name discovered planets, systems, plants, animals, etc... And other players will see that you named these things.  And the reviews regarding performance? Ark doesn't run at 30fps on some of the beefiest computers you can make. Subnautica has performance dips all over the place and has the added benefit of little to no visibility that comes with being a game taking place underwater. Grand Theft Auto V, one of the most popular games on Steam, didn't even run until a week after launch on most computers because of an issue with people having the '@' symbol in their Windows sign-in username. This small team behind No Man's Sky not only pulled off a game that performs better than the two previously mentioned, but it also has an appealing aesthetic and is running on an engine that they created from the ground up.

That might color the fact that I have enjoyed the game for what it is, rather than what it is not.  That said, if you like exploration games with a hint of minecraft/OCD collection of resource games, its a great title. There are nearly endless places to explore, name and experience. Yes, the planets and fauna get a bit tiresome being made up of similar components/body parts, but I still get a kick out of seeing animals even the greeks would have had trouble imagining.  I nearly walked away from the game an hour in or so when my ship decided to land on, and by land I mean violently collide with, a copper node which was (as they all currently seem to do) floating a hundred feet off the ground. I nearly killed myself trying to jet pack up, inevitably taking tons of damage when I failed to get up high enough. That said, perserverance pays divdends in the game. Clearly, I got back up there eventually. It was rewarding in the end.  The resource collection element of the game can be a touch tedious as well, but you are always driven by the endless need to upgrade your ship/multi tool to get that one extra (or two ... ♥♥♥♥ or three) spot(s) to perfectly synergize your modifications. And of course all that comes at the cost of having to farm up a ton more resources to rebuild for the Nth time. For an OCSD riddled person like myself, thats part of the fun though. Probably not for everyone.  TL:DR No Man's Sky delivers on many of it's core conceptual promises, but will not please everyone. Its also quirky in terms of some game play, which makes it fun if given the chance.",

Is it a time devouring monster that keeps you awake at 3am because you want to find the missing piece for your brand new ship ? definately.   Pros of the game:  - Space !  - Lost of space !  - Meet interesting huh.. people ..  - Animals are just fun !  - allows for the strangest discussion with friends (I'm missing some plutonium i cannot go the bar right now ... )   Cons of the game:  - interface on pc is a nightmare. It was focused for PS4 ( well with 13 developpers it could be understood but i would have delayed the launch in PC). Loof for fast actions mod it will save your sanity trust me !  - Who on earth decided to put Exit game in the options menu? He should be sent streight to ToxicLand ( 92% toxicity planet i visited!) - If you want a linear scripted game , this is not for you. Forget the main story, just enjoy the ride, the visits to new places.   Update after 72h:  Am i enjoying the game ? a little less. took me 60h to master de Vykeen language. Now i have nothing to do in Vykeen systems except scan for fauna, get some money and look for new crashed ships.  Some bugs are really annoying, fully water planets where markers lead to nowhere are specially frustrating.  Enjoyment increased after getting the low flight mod. Now i'm hoping to get some other race systems. Got 99% Vykeen so far ..  60 euros for 70+ hours of gaming. I do not feel 100% betrayed but wish the developper would at least react. Some bugs were very obvious, some communication about the future and some explanations would be nice. Still recommand if you like but maybe wait for the 50% discount.",

I'm actually giving it a chance and enjoying it (so far, lets see how long that lasts). Gamepad Controls, sound effects, music and visuals are great. Has a decent immersion factor, lots of unique model, creature, and ship designs. Flight controls caught me off guard at first (you can't crash into the surface, it's like the ship has a minimum flight hover distance which is kinda lame). Space and high altitude controls are normal. Space combat is arcade like. Every planet, solar system is repetitive in way. (E.g. same structures, robots and ships in every solar system, except for story related elements) but not so bad if you figure it's part of the universes story somehow. Definitely overpriced. $20 sounds about right. Let's see how long I can like it for before I get bored.",

            "review_text": "No Man's Sky had a lot more hype and expectation than I had imagined - and why not? For such a small development team to create a universe with such incredible scale, discovery and exploration speaks volumes of Hello Games. It is the fundamentals on the ground that are seriously lacking. Coupled with frustrating bugs and issues, the sense of wonder this game offers quickly fades.  Hello Games is partly responsible for the hype, as is Sony, but we too are held accountable. For every new trailer we brought with it our own expectations, interpretations and demands. It wasm't until the few months leading up to launch that we finally had an idea of what this game actually is.   It's a survival game. A chance to explore 18 quintillion planets, scrambling for resources and battling against oppressive sentinel forces, fighting off pirates and bounty hunters in space and discovering and naming a plethora of procedurally generated creatues, phallic-looking flora and some funny looking fauna. In my first few hours with the game, it was all this and more.  Starting on my first planet, I begin searching for resources and materials to repair my ship. Everything is new, everything is exciting. Lush colors and landscape is awash with new experiences, chances to learn how No Man's Sky works. Within an hour, I have learned that Sentinels are mean, how to mine resources, learned new words to an Alien language, which resources are beneficial, my backpack is absolutely small, all while exploring this gorgeous new world.  After repairing the ship, I set out to the stars into the galaxy, and it is undoubtedly a 'wow' moment. The first time you break through the clouds, reach the stars, planets are all around you waiting to be visited, explored, plundered, your mind boggles with all the possibilities that lay ahead.  Once again, No Man's Sky is a survival game, with many different things that are out to end you. Depending on the planet, the climate can be extremely harsh, sentinels can be more aggressive and the indigenous creatures are just as equally fierce. At first, you'll stick it out, thinking of ways to defy the odds, and get the vital materials you need until you realise that, with the number of planets this game has to offer, it's much easier to jet off in search of a more hospitable environment.  It's difficult to consider No Man's Sky a survival game when there is very little reason to 'stick it out'. When a planet just isn't welcoming, there will be dozens more within the solar system that will welcome you with open arms.  On the subject of planets, while they certainly look gorgeous at a distance, up close, the textures can appear blurry. Land patterns repeat, rock formations look bland, and any patch of water will be completely still. The consequence of procedural generation is, ironically a lack of uniqueness and detail. Additionally, you won't have to explore many planets before you get the sense of deja vu.  When on a planet, you'll spend a lot of time mining, which is fine, but the creativity is lacking. It won't be long before you know what materials you need, and where to find them. The fact that you simply have to grab them and shove them into your spaceship's engine or combine them to craft an element to add to the hyperdrive. It lacks a certain connectivity and drive that Minecraft has in chunks.  The only reason you keep collecting is because of the main objective; the journey to the center of the galaxy - the Atlas quest - but the path to completion is a strain on my patience as the monotony kicks in.  To move to new planetary systems, you need to upgrade the aforementioned hyperdrive, doing so by combining certain elements to craft components to create energy cells. In the beginning, I was strolling, wandering around every planet, picking up the materials as I found them. But as teh objective became more and more pressing, the sense of discovery no longer seemed to intrigue me.  How long you choose to chase Atlas will simply be how much patience you have with the gameplay, or how long before the immersion breaks and the realisation that you've done the same four basic tasks for the past ten hours hits.   Unlike a numerous amount of others who suffered from bugs or crashing, I was fortunate to have suffered the occasional framerate hiccup here and there - before referring to reddit for the fixes we as a community who purchased the game had to discover for ourselves. Before any of the patches, including the latest patch this month in August, this game suffered from the aforementioned crashes, bugs, and framerate loss. Since the patches however, I haven't experience any problems with the game, and have not suffered a loss of immersion because of any bugs.  That isn't to say however that this game is perfect. It is far from. No Man's Sky is a good game. Sean Murray and Hello Games' vision of creating a vast universe on a scale unseen in video games hs no doubt been achieved, and it will certainly provide anyone who plays it with sopmething unique.  However, the fundamental gameplay isn't deep, or rewarding enough for me to stick around and explore many of the planets the game has to offer. With a basic combat and inventory management, it quickly wears thin, and you'll feel like you're dragging yourself from system to system in search of Atlas.  Does it luve up to the hype? For anyone who has been following this game for years now, probably not. But, if you can appreciate this game for what it is - a technical marvel that will no doubt vastly improve over the coming months, then there is certainly plenty of fun and a sense of wonder to be had. It's just a case of how long before the fun stops.  I can't in all good consciousness recommend this game, especially at its current price. I can however, recommend you to follow this game as it is further developed, whether good or bad, and to ask yourself if you want to play it - regardless of reviews, good or bad.",

Yes, things can get repetetive and that is unfortunate, but until proven wrong, I believe there is a bigger puzzle going on in this game than most people realize, and that the refunders/complainers can't even see exists. Those people want instant gratification and thsi game definitely does not provide that.  I am quite happy with having spent the $67 on this along with the couple hundred in all the upgrades I had to do to my computer to be able to run it.  If you like exploring and giant difficult puzzles, this could be for you. If you need instant gratification and bloody battles, avoid this cerebral treat.",

            "review_text": "PRO TIP: there is a game in here, it's just hard to find amidst all the sightseeing. If you're looking for the game, here's the deal: go to planets with 'frenzied' sentinels, empty your inventory, and collect Gravitinio balls. Don't try to fight the enemies you'll aggro, you'll end up killing them and spoiling the fun; instead, use long jumps to run from them, keeping the pace up as you collect more Gravitinio balls and lose yourself in the planet you're visiting. It's actually a decently fun bit; you just have to seek it out on your own, and therein lies No Man's Sky's greatest weakness.  Apart from finding the (relatively rare) activities within the game that are either challenging or exciting, there is little to do in No Man's Sky that fits the traditional definitions of a game. Rather, No Man's Sky is a tech demo, and it demos some very impressive tech. I knew it was a tech demo when I bought it, so I was not dismayed to discover that the veneer of gameplay was paper thin throughout most of the experience.  If you go into the purchase knowing that you're buying an exhibition, not a game, then I doubt you'll be disappointed. However, if you go in hoping for a good story, polished gameplay, elegant controls, interesting characters, or anything else other than a 'space bumbling simulator,' then you will likely end up among the many others in these reviews who were tricked by a rampant hype machine into purchasing a 'game' that is fascinating to think about, but often very dull to play.",

Yeah, I'm just writing this for the Steam Awards so I can tick that box off, but I am at least going to put down my thoughts on this and try no to fall into the GAME IS BAD AVOID trap.  I mean, yeah, its bad. But it tried so hard. It is kinda amazing that such a small studio managed to pull a game of this scope off. The game is huge, probably one of the largest game worlds I've ever seen.  Sure, promises where made, and ultimately, broken.  But, I went into this game not knowing those things. I managed to stay away from the trailers and hype.  From the aspirations of marketing and players 'head in the clouds' dreams of space battles and trading. And..  ...yeah, That didn't help.  Game still feels empty.  Am I mad that I bought this and feel ripped off? A little. But that's only after seeing the marketing and the imitated backlash thereof after I played it.  Exploring, collecting, finding. The game does that well. Just.. Kinda that's all there is to do, nothing new, or as far as I saw, comes up. And I played it for 16 hours. All the fun gets lost as its just 'do that again'.  The game sorely needs an update, just at least to add a bit more to the game. Base building, more ships, active NPC's, better random quests, more populated worlds, anything. I can only hope that Hello Games is taking what people are saying, well, taking the opinions from those with constructive ideas, and working on adding those.  Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. Check it out, its a blast for the first few hours. Should be cheep enough that you can find it at a good price.   Space is empty. This game shows that off perfectly.",

This game simulates a universe. The game mechanics are as follows. Your measurement from the center of the galaxy. A solar system that has 1-8ish planets and moons. 1-2 space station like objects. A handfull of a.i. ships, big and small. Planets consist of small number of plants, resorces, small buildings, animals, and boxes. The game does a great job of the illusion of traveling to different solar systems. They look different on the surface, but after a while you don't notice that. The only thing you will notice is the grind of maxing out your ship, suit, and multi-tool. The buildings all look the same. I haven't seen any buildings from the trailers, which could have been easily put into the game. Not sure why they are absent so far. The game has alot of potential. I recomend waiting for the price to drop to 20-30 dollars. Of coarse if your like me and don't care about 60 bucks and want to try it out, have a blast. As always I recomend watching gameplay on youtube and twitch first. After a couple hours you have seen everything you will need to play. This review is like playing this game for the 31st hour... It is what you make of it. Have a good day.",

I don't like games where your life expectancy is all of 5-10 seconds. I LOVE open world exploring games with a dose of survival thrown in. I logged 300+ hours playing Skyrim and is my favorite game of all time (so far). I prefer single-player games.  That being said, I waited patiently for NMS (even pre-ordered it). Installed it the 1st day and started exploring! My home planet was a radiation nightmare, but it taught me vital survival skills. I can say with all honesty that I NEVER Googled any tips/tricks etc. Everything I learned was by hard knocks, and had no problem figuring things out as I went without tutorials. I eventually made it off-planet after repairing a couple crashed ships (for more slots) and moved out into the Cosmos.  I am in love with NMS! I come home from a stressful day, and it is very relaxing booting up and taking off. Last night I landed on a veritable Garden of Eden planet. I'm planning on surveying this planet 100% for the 1st time. Sentries are forgiving and flora/fauna are abundant. Nothing is trying to eat me as I stroll the surface.  Sure there are physics and glitches that can be tweaked, but my experience has been solid out of the box. Give Hello Games a break and be patient. You try staring at code all day.  I also love the fact that I have no idea who I am. Am I Male or Female? Am I Alien or Human? I can read English or can I? All I am sure of is I am ambulatory and can die :(  If you are looking to rack up the largest body count possible, then this game is probably not for you. If you like exploration and the fantasy of planet discovery by all means give it a try!  Keep up the nice work HG! ",

            "review_text": "So I thought I needed to write this review. I really like this game despite the shortcomings and shortfall of features that where suggested by Hello Games. It needs further work to fill out the game but the procedurally generated system is awesome in what it achieves.  I get that the Planet Flora and Fauna generation are repetitive, but of course that can be fixed by Hello Games adding more assets and I hope they will be, the modding community on the PC I suspect will also add to the pot...  I get the inventory management is a pain, Hello Games could fix that easily with Exosuit, Multi Tool and Ship 'Capacity Modules' (at a price in game of course) that could be added to increase the default stack sizes (no pain no gain). I also believe all items should be stackable. these of course in line with the current upgrades could be scaled. - I currently use a NMSE Mod to fix this part.  I get there are only three races, but hang on they have a whole language each and again this could be enhanced by Hello Games via new DLC Content.  I get that tracking back from whence one came is an ordeal unless you adopt some form of numerical naming system for systems discovered. Not sure this should be changed but the ability to set cross galaxy waypoints might be a solution…?  I get loading resources in battle both on the ground and in space is a “real pain”, this could be fixed by Hello Games by introducing 'Automated Resource Loading Modules', again at a price and again scalable in keeping with the game. These modules when clicked could perhaps have 5 slots in which to specify resource load preference and of course would only work if you had the required resources in your inventory. It would be great if in game warnings told you when your resources where depleted with respect to these modules.  I get flying low is a bit hit and miss, Hello Games could easily fix this with both the ability to look down and hover (perhaps Look Down/Hover could be another Technology Module ...... this has been easily fixed at present by the modding community but what of the PS4 players no such luck …  I get the achievement screens pop up and get you killed potentially, these should be disabled if you are in combat, Hello Games should fix this …  However, when all said and done I am really enjoying this game and the challenge of collecting, analysing, fighting and exploring and hope Hello Games enhance it as they have promised to do so.",

Jump in and out of your spaceship on endless planets, discovering interesting ancient ruins with cool messages, fight off sentinel drones as you loot resources, engage in space dog fights, hang out in space station hangars and watch a variety of ships come and go, trade with aliens and watch market prices, buy new ships, upgrade your tech and gear, find and name lifeforms and planets and moons, find bases and crashed ships, explore caves and seek out valuable resources to mine. Then warp off into space and do it again in another system, following different paths through the universe based on storyline content, path to the center or fly into blackholes. One of the best things about the game is that you can pause it and deal with reality, then jump right back in, which you wouldn't be able to do if it was multiplayer. So it's comical that people are giving a single player exploration game negative reviews because they wish it had real time multiplayer. This game is designed to chill and spend time enjoying, rather than obsessively race through content or kill stuff mindlessly. Easily my favorite in a very long time. And the music is perfect. Once the patches fixed the release issues, and i updated my video driver and actually used optimized settings, the game runs smooth and looks great.",

My starting planet was brutally harsh, and you have to constantly watch your life support and protection levels and plan out your movements if you don't want to die and lose everything. survival mode makes it a brutal world, and when you finally lift off from your planet, after scouring for survival, that next step to the center actually feels kind of satisfying.  The initial release was trash that I regrettably bought for full price and later wept at my decision. However I've put it behind me at this point and am glad that I'm getting at least some return on this game now. while it still has a long way to go, if Hello Games keeps good on their promises to add buttloads of content, then I can definitely see this being worth the tag in the near future.",

            "review_text": "Final edit until further notice:  After more consideration and ten hours of play, I still recommend but with some strong reservations. The other reviews stating 'a mile wide but an inch deep' seem to nail what this game has achieved. The amount of travel and random encounters on planets is staggering, but the immersion is limited greatly by the lack of understanding who you are, why it is you're jumping from galaxy to galaxy, and who the various sentient races are that you rarely encounter. One would think that in the vastness of space, especially in areas where there are strong Gek, etc. presences that small towns would be on the planets with some various quest lines (e.g. need 500 plutonium for my ship, etc.) However, one rarely runs into another sentient creature, and if one does, the dialgoue is limited to very, very few choices of selling and buying items or charging shields. That being stated, it is fun to run around and find various artifact sites, observe the planets flora and fauna, and feel like a 'deep space' adventurer discovering new worlds. Part of the attraction with this comes from a desire to explore (we're all born too late to discover our own world's unknowns, too early to discover other worlds) and so we immerse ourselves in a game to do so. I have high hopes (they may be completely unfounded) that in further updates and patches to this game, some negatives will be fixed. As it stands I would still give this a 6/10 and recommend buying it, but probably only after a sale price.  ++ Art Style Exploration Open ended  + Crafting Immense space travel with no directions  - lack of multiplayer Limited inventory space  -- Unpopulated Space stations No background information on self/systems no character development tree (mining skills, trade, travel, etc.)  (Regarding system crashes on other rigs)  My specs are not that impressive and I'm having no problems so far. I do think it is ridiculous that a number of individuals are having difficulties even playing. With all settings maxed in fullscreen, I've experienced a few fps drops (usually when entering a planet's atmosphere for the first time) but other than that I've had a stable run)  win 7 x64 250gb ssd i5760 @3.3ghz (oc) evga gtx 750 (driver 372.54) corsair 16gb 1666mhz",

The plot is revealed in engimatic fragments from a variety of sources, all profiling the dominant three races of the galaxy: the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'Keen. Through the often poetic accounts of their histories, you gleam tiny bits of knowledge of creation and its creator. The further you explore, the more you discover.   Overall, this is an incredible single-player experience. Some worlds are stark and inhospitable, others are paradigms of alien beauty. The story is one of wonder and truth, tackling some pretty big questions in lovely prose. It's a marvelous experience that is enhanced by crafting, pirate combat, language research, and more.  My main complaint is that I can't go back to worlds I've enjoyed most. There's no current way to navigate back to previously discovered destinations (unless you have incredible memory and superb navigational skills in a contextless void of stars).  If you want a multiplayer experience, you're out of luck. If you want a singleplayer spirit journey through the stars and across alien heavens and hells, this is your game.",

            "review_text": "It's finally here, after all the unasked for hype, and surprise, there is a barrage of players who decided not to 'spoil' themselves by actually reading about the game and are complaining about its gameplay not living up to their wild expectations, or who can't get the game to launch or have issues with a day 1 release of a game that was frenetically worked on until the last minute.   -Want some honesty?-  The game is good. If you are fortunate enough to be able to run the game without anything outright egregious in the way of bugs, it's pretty solid thusfar. I haven't yet actually left the planet I started on just because it's as interesting as I expected and I'm having an awful lot of fun just roaming around finding monuments that teach me an alien language word by word. I knew what I was getting into, because I read all the previews and watched footage showing me that the main game loop was specifically gathering the resources you need to survive and persist, and exploring environments discovering new animals and cultures and the remnants of older cultures, across different planets. This is exactly the kind of game I've always wanted, and insofar as what Hello Games actually promised the game would be like, they've actually delivered. They're apparently working on new features to add to the game as time goes on to increase its scope even more, but you'll get the most from this game if that basic idea of exploration and curiosities is what sates you. If you're like me, and you start a character in an MMO just to run across the worldmap trying to avoid high level enemies and see the environment for fun, this game is probably right for you.  The launch was bad. Because of their cram to really polish the ingame features they had and the feeling of how to introduce you to this world, they didn't give QA the oversight a game of this size desperately needs on the PC platform in particular. I have confidence they're working on fixing it- they pushed out patch 1.3 within the set of days between platform launches, and another patch was pushed out almost immediately on release to try and contain the damage. Yes, crash on launch bugs suck, and so do many of the other bugs they hadn't caught yet. That said, while the price point may have made this look especially bad to us, they're a small team who dealt with a lot of constraints all along the way from the announcement of the game to its delivery, and it's to be expected that there's QA teething issues on a platform as diverse as PC. It will get better over time- the future of their studio is at stake on this one so I really doubt they plan on pulling a WB.   -Will I have technical issues?-  If you have an AMD processor, you may want to check if it supports the SSE4.1 instruction set, because if it doesn't, the game will likely crash on launch at the time of this writing. This isn't that uncommon a bug, I can think of at least one other game that had this issue on launch without using many brain cells (MGSV: Ground Zeroes). It probably won't take too long to fix it but there's no harm in waiting to be safe.  If you have a graphics card that isn't reasonably new, you're treading on unsafe ground. This game is ambitious and tries to use a lot of close-to-cutting-edge features to get off the ground. OpenGL 4.5 support has been cited on twitter as a necessary requirement- what does this mean in practical terms? I can run the game on an AMD HD 7950- high end a few years ago but long before the Fury cards and the new RX series released. You absolutely need something recent and you probably can't skate by with even a mid range card as old as the one I cited. Even with my setup (intel i7 3770k, 16GB ram, HIS AMD HD 7950) I had to turn AA off and shadows to low with frame rate uncapped before the game started humming at a reasonable speed. Welcome to the next hardware generation folks.   Otherwise- update your drivers, be ready to search the steam forums for bugfixes, but give it a shot. If the game itself as I described it still interests you and you think you're going to get your hours of gameplay out of it for the price, it's certainly worth the plunge. Ignore the outrage addicts all over the store page right now- some are understandably upset and a little impatient but others are practically buzzards demanding a carcass of a game.",

And I need to say that there is some redeeming value to the game. For me, enough to give it an up vote.  Does the game deserve all the negativity? Or is it worth buying and playing? Well, it depends.  The game was overly hyped to the extreme. To the point that there was just no way it was going to live up to expectations. If you bought into all that hype, then likely the answer is no. If you go in not expecting too much after reading reviews, comment threads, and watching video and you still think you would like to experience it, then the answer might be yes.  What there is to do in the game is explore. That is pretty much it. If you're excited about the idea of flying around to different systems and landing on different planets and hoping that you will come across a unique and really cool landscape or discover a really cool creature, then you will have many hours of fun. If that doesn't excite you, you will probably not like it. There are other things to do, but they are very basic and very repetitive. Basically, besides exploring and discovering (the things that for me make the game worth it), here's what you can do:  Upgrade your space suit, upgrade your weapon/mining multitool or buy new improved versions, and upgrade your ship or buy or find new improved versions. Basically, there are no differences in ships except for the way they look and the number of available upgrade slots they have. Same with weapons.   Buy and sell stuff. This is very, very basic.   Learn the language of the 3 or 4 alien intelligences in the game.   You will occasionally get attacked by space pirates. This is always the same and the combat is very lame.  There is supposedly some kind of story going on there which you will only discover, I guess, by learning more of the alien languages. This has failed to excite me anymore than shooting rocks does.  Basically, to be honest, except for the exploring, the game will get very boring quickly, probably in less than 20 hours. I have 71 hours in and I am still finding very cool new things. This takes a lot of patience. It's a slow and chill type of game.   That's about it for now, that's what the game is, love it or hate it, or somewhere in between.",

Fans put a LOT of faith into the developers at Hello Games, considering the prepurchase price was, and still remains, $60(United States).  I went into this game like every other fanboy/girl, expecting above and beyond amazingness from a game that is, for all intents and purposes, cutting edge. It's pretty much what Minecraft wants to be, without the shelter building.  That being said, after 17ish hours of non-stop gameplay, what is my personal verdict?  Honestly, it WAS(codeword, WAS) going to be negative. I walked into the game expecting to build a shelter and fly into cliff sides and fly into suns and generally being a complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the beginning of the game before I got serious, but to my stunned surprise, I was able to do none of these things! I also just generally felt the game was very linear and sort of uninspiring in terms of what your ultimate goal is! I mean, you start the game, and then you're on your own! The lack of tutorial is a very bitter/sweet concept, since it can leave one feeling very immersed, true, but also very hopeless. This game definitely caters more to the young adult - adult audience, whereas the younger preteen audience might get really annoyed really quickly due to the lack of how-to in the game.  However, after playing it a bit more, getting a hold of those pesky how-to ropes a bit more firmly, and experimenting a bit with where to go and how to do things, I've come to discover that this game is a definite diamond in the rough. It is an entirely new game, released just 2 days before this review was written, and it's already at only 58% positive out of 33.5k user reviews. That is INSANELY premature, and I wish people would lay off the thumbs down button until the developpers have had a chance to catch up with the demands being launched at them post-release. With all that considered, No Man's Sky does exactly what it advertises; you get to explore the biggest game world ever created, with over 18.6 quintillion(18.600.000.000.000.000.000) planets, and you get to name the things you discover. As of right now, the game is still incredibly early in its development, and as far as I've heard, the next major update is going to be somewhere around 22 gigabyte in size. As in, a TON of new stuff is gonna get added periodically.  That being said, the graphics are fantastic, a bit campy, but to be expected, considering how huge the game is and with no blatant in-your-face loading screens to speak of, and the game runs smooth as butter. I have yet to crash, even once, which to me is the telltale sign of a well put together, structurally sound game.  So please, ignore all of these premature naysayers who seem to complain about everything from lack of multiplayer, to lack of shelter building, to lack of content and lack of general fun and games. Take the game as it is, and realize that all of this and more will for sure be added in due time. Patience is a virtue! :)",

            "review_text": "***Potential Spoilers***  I was recently asked, 'How was Survival mode?' The following was my response:  Wonderfully humbling. At the end of two hours play, I found myself in a hollowed out chunk of Iridium, watching as the last 5% of my life support ticked away - praying that my toxic protection recharged fast enough to book it back to my broken ship (which, by the way, I started a 14 minute hike away from), hoping that a bug/crab wouldn't notice me and continue to eat my face. I managed to get to the hunk-of-junk with one piece of health, no supplies (if you die you lose all materials AND some piece of equipment breaks), no toxic protection, and no life support (you can sit in your cockpit and you don't need life support, but it doesn't recharge either). I finally decided I couldn't leave, repair my ship, or repair an equipment - so I popped the hatch and let the acid rain corrode my suit, falling to the ground and towards the waiting crab-a**holes.  It was the most fun I've had in NMS since the first few hours after unboxing it. One mistake can cost you dearly and every choice matters. I found myself leaving or ignoring Gold/Iridium/Emeril for desperate searches of Thamium9 (grab every piece you can!). Lastly, with the latest patch my PC went from being able to run the game on middling graphic settings and cranking out the heat, to all settings maxed out (excluding AA) and having my laptop purr. Great update, beautiful game, good work HG. At $60 I was happy with NMS - which met my $1/hour gameplay ratio and being one of the few games I could play with all members of the family. At the current price point(s) its hard not to recommend this game.   P.s. With three modes it gives our family multiple 'profiles' for people to play: my eldest - Normal, me - Survival, and my middle child - Creative. Thank you again to the Hello Games team!",

Basically, for some, who don't like games like this, they will never get over the initial mechanics and have enough patience to find anything.

The new HARDCORE survival* mode will put anyone to the test too!

Beautiful Sci-Fi Art everywhere  Blackholes  Endless Various Types of Planets, Moons, Space Stations, Buildings, Star Systems etc  Discovering Millions Of Random Out Of This World Plants, Trees, Rocks, Seaweed and Weird Looking Alien Types From Land,Air and Sealife etc  Endless Various Types of Empty Desert Type Of Planets With Huge Cave Systems   Endless Various Types Of Hazardous Weather/Sentinal Planet Types To Fight/Survive In  So Many Types Of Cool Space Ships to Choose From - Scientist/Warrior/Explorer etc  Gathering Resources of Different Types of Colored Crystals and Rock Formations Plus Finding Rare/Exotic Resources.  Huge Crafting System For Guns, Armor Exo Suit,Ship etc.  Invertory is very cool for ship, suit and weapon. The slots are few at start and finding/crafting upgrades are tough and a grind these concept are balanced well. Invertory also has colorful pictures, big and easy to work with. Ajusted and tweaked to be more user friendly with recent update.  Multiple Quests To Follow And Tons of Riddles,Puzzle Solving,Clues etc Along Your Endless Journey To The Center Of The Universe.  I could go on and on of what more there is to do it's a huge game tons of exploring to do and things to discover.  NMS is worth $60.00. No Man's Sky is a super deal on sale!  CONS:  False negative feedback and reviews  Not having a good PC gaming system with newer supported GPU/CPU that is close or above the recommended specs if not could cause crashing, light flickering, continuous errors etc.",

I've explored 10 or so different systems and around 20 planets, yet, always running into something new. Planets are amazing in terms of procedurally generated terrain. The caves I've entered so far aren't really in depth. Only go a few feet to the end. Nothing inside the caves so far that would make taking the time to explore them worth it. (Only caves I have been in, no idea on other players)  Creatures on the planets are interesting for lack of a better term. I've seen animals with a tail as their head. That's all I need to say about that.  Would I recommend? Yes, No Man's Sky is overall an excellent game in terms of things to do and exploration. However, do not go into the game expecting to see people everywhere. The chances of finding another player are slim considering there are 15 quintillion planets.

In my opinion the basic game mechanics are brilliant. The transitions from planet ground to orbit, from orbital space to other orbital space, from orbital space to different systems are remarkably well done. I see NMS as THE main engine which any SciFi game should have as a base engine.  I have spent 40+ hours right now on it and it actually was much fun to explore the mechanics, to develop a better ship and suit, to explore the given surroundings ... and just move on, when it starts to get boring. For me, s.th. interesting happens all the time.  Besides that NMS has its shortcomings, no doubt about it. There is almost no catchy mission system in there. Much relies on the little storage space your're given in the ship and suit. What I don't understand here is, that they did not implement some basics that, for instance, the original Elite (I mean the version for the C64 from some decades ago...) already has, like a tradechart, where you con compare prices of goods on other planets, or lootable wreckage after won dogfights and most of all, a tight, yet easy to embed storyline. Elite had all that, it was not that much of an effort to do that and made the major difference in terms of 'fun, playing a game'. The NMS engine virtually shouts 'hey here, put that in', as it was made for such enhancements. Even more not understandable why that is not in the first release.  Anyway, what should happen now in my opinion: They should bring the graphics to a current level. Any further NMS game would not be accepted, especially after the hype, w.o. any decent graphics. This would not bring any advantages, it would just make the engine fit for the next shot. Then the game should have at least a mission line as the original Elite has it. This should be piece of cake, since they humbly tried to embed such a thing (but failed). The latter also means, that those people, that did the current 'missions' should not be allowed to have a hand on such a mission redisign. Even if meant well, or done by people whose job is not usually to produce missions (I expect both to be true for the current release), it is obvious, that nothing good comes out of it. After that, bring NMS2. This should be the game, we all wanted.  Nevertheless and after such a critique, I keep with my upvote. Besides all the missing an lacking mechanics it is a good SciFi engine and 'playing' the game is soothing and nice to look at. It just has no real goal. But after 40+ hours it seems, that it still is enjoyable. If your're a fan of the genre you can buy the game without regret. ",

            "review_text": "I'll be totally honest with you, weary traveler of the review section...  This game is wonderful. Really unique and wonderful. However THIS IS ONLY IF YOU ENJOY IT FOR THE REASONS I DO.   These reasons are: infinite exploration, fairly simple mechanics, great for roleplaying as a pirate, or a merchant, whatever you like. Beautiful and lonely/desolate atmosphere that really creates a sense of loneliness.   A few basic cons: The combat is basic, nothing special, but I admit it's pretty fun to face off against a ♥♥♥♥ ton of sentinels when you're trying to grab rare items. Flying across planets can be a bit gimicky, your ship has a set level it has to be above the ground, it can go higher, but it cant go too low. Which can complicate landing precision. Meeting the various aliens in the universe is a pretty mundane task, either giving you resources or blueprints (or sometimes a slap). Learning the languages of the three species is a task that feels even more pointless and convoluted than the riddler challenges from the arkham series.  But I have to say, the thing that both causes me endless wonder, as well as endless depression/and/or/nostalgia/regret is leaving a system. Knowing I will probably NEVER return to those planets is honestly a pretty strange feeling that I both hate and enjoy.   Important note: I did NOT go into this game WANTING multiplayer, I did NOT go into this game wanting to be able to build houses. I did NOT climb aboard the hype train of this game. And because of that, I was satisfied. Was it worth the $60? eh, maybe not. But I have found possibly the best time-filling game of my entire career as a gamer. And for that, I'm grateful.",

This game is a programming marvelousity, the sheer size that can be explored compacted in 2.4GB is incredible. The aesthetics of every single planet are incredible, and walking around just to have a look at those wonderful and really different vistas, knowing that probably you are the only person in this world who witnessed this planet is an incredible feeling. This game is not for everyone. It is about exploration, curiousity and admiration. It's like going to a musem. An infinite musem. It's a perfect game to drop an hour in every day before going to sleep. And having a game that can fulfill this role is a really good thing.",

There is no dumb story to follow and you don’t RP a character they designed, you create your own unique story and RP.

What I like: peaceful exploring while discovering strange new worlds, interaction with animals, sense of alone time, not caring about anything... I find my self walking around on planets most of the time. I am not following any path or trying to get to the 'center' of the galaxy. I am just enjoin the ride.  More diversity for zinc, platinum could be added so I don't encounter same flowers on every planet. I don't like that I have to kill the 'bird' in order to scan it :( . I don't like that aggressive animals don't get the message when I shoot the warning shoot. ( I hate to kill anything ), that could probably get mended? I would love different gravitation on planets,more plant diversity, more of everything. I think you could make some planets even more lonely ( less buildings, less vegetation) or just make them without anything. Scale of planets - relief - could be even larger.  All in all, you probably don't need my advice but I like to share it anyways :).  This will be the game that I will be able to play for so many years to come. I can't wait for new patches.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Good game, great potential, overpriced, but if you have it to waste, a good place to waste it.  Disclaimer, I play this game via wine on a Linux box.   I saw NMS come up on the radar a while ago, but never really got into all the hype. I was not sitting on the eqge of my seat waiting for it to come out. But when it did launch I got it and played it. There are some really good parts and some really bad parts to the game. We shall start with the bad.  The Bad:  - No Liunx support. I mean come on. There is no reason for that these days.  - Keyboard controlls are odd. It took me a good 30 mins to figure out how to craft. Not because I has to find the resources, but because the controlls didn't really make sense. Same with landing and take off.  - Not much varation. Maybe this will change in patches, or the more I travel, but I don't get a large sense of going from planet A to planet B. Many of the things are the same. There's not a lot to discover in the 'ok wow that looks awesome' range. That deing said I have come across some cool things.   The Undecided:  - All the systems are simple. Crafting is simple, invintory is simple, combat is simple, scanning is simple, etc. After playing Ark though, it's a nice change of pace. I ofen loose intrest in late game Ark, because it's like logging in to do chores. This game everything is so simple. Now that may get boring as well. Only time will tell.   - Refule this, and that. You spend a lot of time exploring, and a lot of time refuling. If I ever crash land in a weird part of the galaxy, that's the gear I want. You can fule it with nearly anything. All the space ship is missing is a Mr Juicer. The down side is that you repeat a lot. Land, gather fuel, fill ship, take off to the next system.  The good:  - Even with the limited content, it's still a gerat exploration game. There are enoug things to do, that you feel like your exploration has purpose, and that your not just running around without cause. Your running around has cause.   - Resource gathering, while important enough, is almost a side task. There are times when you need that one resource, and you have to hunt it down, but most of the time, you just explore and gather as you go.   - Combat, it's simple like every other system, but it's enough that it adds moments of tense-ness to the game. It's not a FPS, but it's almost a mini game.  Final Notes:  The game has a lot of potential. If they add more content this will be an awesome game. They need to support Linux/Steam OS. They need more varity in their worlds. They planets need more 'population'. But all these things can be fixed with patches.   On the other side of the coin, the price is way off. Right now this is a $20 game. It could be a $60 game, it's just not right now. With the right patches this could be an awesome title, but $50 for what exists right now, is a bit much. It feels like a really good Tablet game. The kind where you see the download size and have to really decide if it's worth it. It does not feel like a $60 PC game.",

It is NOT an MMO. It is NOT a game with structure or direction. It does NOT have a 'story' to experience or an ending, though it does have a smattering lore that you can stumble upon.  No Man's Sky is often dismissively called a 'screenshot generator.' That's pretty true - and not necessarily a bad thing. What else is the game?  It's an exploration game that uses procedural generation. The best way to think of NMS's procgen is as 'riffs on a theme.' There's a cool looking hippo thing. On another planet, it might have horns. On another, it might be flying. On another, it might want to eat you. But all its creatures are variations of a base.  Same goes for the planets: there are dead planets and lush planets and toxic mushroom planets. Some have moons. Some are flat, some are not.  If you're thinking, 'Wow, that sounds boring...' then congratulations! This game is not for you.  But for those of you who think it might be cool to wander around on a toxic mushroom planet with weird flying hippo things for a little bit, No Man's Sky is an incredibly chill game.

I knew what this game was going to be, and I'm not at all disappointed, apart from the odd bug and procedural generation artifacts like buildings lodged half-way inside a hill.  I'm also a fan of games like Dear Esther, which had a weak story, but a ton of atmosphere.  I just love the feeling of being lost and alone in a huge universe, trying to survive and discovering new, interesting and beautiful worlds to explore. It has definitely scratched that itch for me.  Time will only improve this game, and I don't regret taking the plunge into the game upon release. This game isn't for everyone, but it is for me.  Update1: I'm still plodding away at NMS, but at a reduced pace. I've upgraded everything, and now only have to 100% languages and finish the Atlas path before heading towards the centre of the galaxy to restart in another galaxy. I've now bought Elite Dangerous to fill the gaps that NMS currently is unable to. I'll head back to NMS more regularly once there are content updates.  Update2: I somehow find myself coming back again and again. It's just such a relaxing game that I can jump into for a short or long session. I'm also beginning to unravel more of the story and lore of NMS, particularly when talking with Nada and Polo, which is beginning to explain why there are a lot of things which apear the same throughout the universe. It's all fractal patterns. Sean built a game with fractal patterns built into the simulated universe and as part of the story that goes along with it. Whether this was intended from the beginning or they brought it into the story due to the limitations of the procedural technology, it's still beautifully crafted. To really appreciate the game you need to delve deep and unlock it's hidden mysteries.  Update3 - post 1.1 patch: Loving the changes to the game. Has provided some extra purpose for visiting planets.

Yes, it does get repeititve, but I keep searching for that awesome planet out there somewhere still.. lol. A lot of physics and scientific details are missing...and those things could have really made the game much more impressive. Basically, it's a VERY simple game with no problem solving required, and not much battle skill is needed either.  Aside from all of the corners that were cut in making it, and its simplicity...for some reason I stil like it. It could be because I had no set expectations for what it was... I did not know all of the features that were promised and not implemented. I just run around on different planets and explore derp around. I am sort of getting bored of it now sadly.   I can understand with all of the negative reviews now that I know what the game was SUPPOSED to be. I can't give it a negative myself, because I feel i've gotten enough hours of enjoyment to make it worth my while. I think it is overpriced for what it is, but I don't regret purchasing it...so that's  good...yeah?  lol   I don't know if I would recommend it or not, because it depends on the type of game player.

I am so glad the devs did not let those negative reviews deter them from continuing their historic achievement in what I feel in the future will be an accolade for changing computer gaming as we once knew it.  The new foundation update has gone far and above what I thought it would include, and with it, I can see the vision of No Mans Sky destination a bit clearer. Bravo on keeping with it guys, and I look forward to the future and many hours of survival. If you have not gotten this game yet, go ahead, don't let the bad reviews sway you from an excellent game. If you have the game but quit playing, pick it back up, the new update will astonish you with new game play tactics, especially in survival mode.

For what it is, I still enjoy coming back to No Man's Sky. This was my first day back after having not played for several weeks. Dropping back into it, I was surprised to find that I'm still driven to explore these worlds. I thought maybe after collecting all the achievements I'd be done with it, but I still enjoy fixing up my ship, and bouncing around the galaxy. For me, there are still things to do, and places to see.  If you like to wander and explore at your own pace, you might enjoy this game too. For me, the most exhilerating aspect of No Man's Sky would have to be the freedom of direction, and knowing that any place you go will never be quite like the places you've been.  At first, I was disapointed, like most people were when the game didn't hold up to the hype or match the quality of the screenshots and gameplay footage used in the marketing materials for the game. At the same time though, I have to admit that the environments in No Man's Sky are still just as stunning, if not as polished. Sometimes the details are subtle, and can be slow to surface. For instance, some of these worlds are more desolate than others. Given a chance though, even the most desolate of them have managed to surprise me in one way or another. In the end, if it turns out a planet just doesn't interest you, the next one is only a minute or two away.  Despite whatever shortcomings the game may have, I think No Man's Sky is a worthwhile experience. For the time I've sunk into it, I feel like I got my 60 bucks worth out of it.",

This is a universe that continually mutates and provides a story that doesn't end in ten or 20 hours of game play. I don't have to rush to finish it and move on to the next blockbuster. I can stay on the same planet for days and feel just as thrilled to make minuscule discoveries that will change my perception of this world and give me a sense of wonder that I cannot find in any other game universe. Or I can go back to my life for a few months, and be immerse in my own universe of work, responsibilities, fun and relationships,to then be reminded that if I want to, there is a parallel, infinite universe that still has some secrets for me to find.  NMS's appeal cannot be found in cinematic monsters and blood. Its appeal is found in the vast scale of a universe that strives to imitate life and simulate a world much like ours, only more primitive and young, and nevertheless worth of discovery.",

            "review_text": "First off, this isn't my final review I'll be doing on No man's sky. I've only got 20 glorious hours under my belt so far, even though I'm wearing shorts, and I'd like to come back to review it again at 100 hours, later in the future (Honestly, probably a week or two)  KNOWN ISSUES **IMPORTANT**: There are many issues as the game has been out only 6 days (from writing this first review), as to be expected for games like NMS. Please go check out the steam community and read up on work arounds to figure out if you even want to consider this game. I personally was lucky to be able to run it right off the bat, and hopefully these issues are fixed soon!   No mans sky is the incredibly hyped game created by HelloGames, a small team who generated a universe only costing the space of a whopping 2.5 gigabytes (with no updates or DLC included in this number). There isn't a forced goal in this game, only a guide towards the 'Center of the galaxy' in which a promising reward awaits to those who can travel there. You will be crafting, and mining resources very often to help aid your journey if you decide to either free roam and discover, or follow a very thin line between star systems similar to a GTA style GPS system to the center giving you the best calculated path. You will also be surviving in harsh conditions on both barren and flourishing planets while being careful of the wildlife including plants, and the dangerous sentinel race watching you almost constantly.   HYPE: Hype didn't kill the game, it just seriously hindered it. I've known of the game for a little over a year, maybe 2, and my appreciation for what Sean Murray and his team were doing grew as I read more and more about the game, watching Sean change words every so often or change his mind about features, this game has been a sort of placeholder in this year for me, as I looked forward to it's releasing so much. The thing about hype though is that, like old memories, some people put their own images in their heads and warp details about the game to their liking rather than accept it for what it is early on, and build on the image they've created, sometimes even sharing it and putting it into others minds. For No man's sky, possibly the most hyped game ever created in quite a long time, this was really dangerous.   GAMEPLAY: Collecting resources= A+ Trading= B- (Not a fan of switching things out of your ship into your inventory to sell) Crafting= B+ Exploration= A Quality/Graphics= A+ (This game if you can start it up, runs fairly smooth on high settings, and can run on most PCs I'd say made in the last 3 years) Movement= C+ (Moving can actually become quite bothersome and slow, but there are techs in the game to assist in this)  You'll be flying and spot things you want to visit on your way to visit something and end up visiting those things before visiting that other thing you originally had planned to visit. This is 99% of planet travel, you experience a lot of 'Ooo, shiny!' moments playing this game. The writing for events when arriving at certain places you can interact with, is genious and beautiful, reminding me of the writing for notes in the Amnesia series. There is also a large puzzle element in NMS that I'm sure players who like being given choices can appreciate.   PROMISES: I'll go and say right now that ever since being listed on steam, even before pre purchase, this game was considered a singleplayer when viewing the games details, even if Sean was saying players could see eachother. Maybe people took Seans word over steams which in all honesty makes sense, but I was fine with either outcome. Many people had valid resources stating that Sean changed what he said, and many did not, using websites that almost seemed like gossip rather than factual material. With multiplayer, I can agree it'd be nice to see others and show off your ship, and a few friends and I are hoping that at some point, the game does allow this. You should all know that from the looks of it, Sean seems to be a little bit of a softy for players ideas, and I'm sure with popular demand, things will be added in just like Construction and Freighter building will be in the near future (Confirmed by Sean Murray).    MY OPINION: The games incredible, exciting at times, and relaxing.  I can't say I've heard of people paying $60 dollars or more towards a game simply to experience these 3 things. Thats the issue with hype once again is that people expected it to be more, but it's really what you make of it, not what they give you. 'It's an experience to be had' has become a favorite quote of mine for the game, and I can agree that even while collecting and crafting can get frustrating, I haven't gone more than 8 hours without playing this game a good 2 inbetween without a break. I fully recommend the game for what it is and I congragulate HelloGames and creating a masterpiece in my eyes.   If you don't think you'll enjoy it, then check out the other similar options, no need to bash the developers seeing as floods, death threats, delays and lawsuits all in 3 years have already made them feel terrible I can assume. Find somewhere to post and send in ideas for the game, wait and see if they're added, drink some Tea or Coffee, and enjoy some other games while you wait.  I hope my review was of some help, sorry for the length, Enjoy.  ~Blue Jay",

            "review_text": "So i have played this game for about 100h+ now (i was offline for a long time, steam playtime is glitchy), and i think i am ready to write a review about it. So here i go  First of all, i enjoy playing this game in the current state, and i am one of the few that actually like it. Now the gameplay, people always confuse this as an mmo or a multiplayer game. It isn't. And it wasn't meant to be. If you followed hellogames, you would know that the chance of meeting another player is really rare. Like REALLY. And that scandal with two players meeting and not seeing each other can be simply explained. In a podcast, Sean Murray said that each player is put in a 4 person lobby, and those 4 players he is able to see, the others are not. Much like in elite dangerous, you are not able to see others, because you are on a different server or lobby, same goes here. If one of them might have logged of and back in i think in a few tries they would have able to see each other. So this theory is busted. Now the factions. I agree, it is a missing feature. But it is not a reason the quit the game, because it wasn't meant to be a faction vs faction war game. It was meant to be an exploration game. I do NOT doubt that factions WILL come in a few updates, but it is sad that they aren't already in the game. Epic space battles are a thing, it is called a distress signal, but you can only help out the freighters. And even if you kill almost all the pirates, a few missed shots that hit the freighters would turn that battle into a free-for-all deathmatch. I think it is just a bug really. Now, people always say this game is dull exploration wise. I can deny that, visited hundreds of planets and i never see anything anything very simmilar to each other. The more you explore, get close too the center, the more cool stuff you will see. And it is not the 'same sh!%' over and over, it's new all the time, trust me i know. Now ships never stop to amaze me. They are all different in their looks, that is the missing feature of most of the space games, ship variations that is. Ship classes maybie know as a missing feature, but if you look from an another perspective, it isn't. I have found out that most of the trade ships are slow, but their weapons are powerfull. Also they have more health then other ships. The fighters are fast and deadly, but have low health. Science ships are good for exploration, they are small and they are fast, good shields. And all of that are just natural things ships provide you without any upgrades on them. I dislike the fact that all types of ships can carry the same amount of resources, and have 48 slots, but maybie it will change in a few updates. Now when buying a ship, fighters do not get 48 slots, but the big traders do. So maybie ships are for buying, not found crashed. Capital vs capital ship combat might come when the ability to own a freighter is released. Hellogames are trying their hardest to work on these FREE updates, to include more content and have the missing features back in the game. Music of this game is the best i have ever seen, and i have to give a thanks for 65DOS for making such a great soundtrack. Portals aren't working, but HG said that they removed some features that caused crashing, maybie in the future we will see them. Also there are alot of people saying there aren't big dinosaurs and food chains. I can deny that, i have seen animals go up to water, drink the water, and then go explore with their herd. I have seen an animal almost the exact size of that dinosaur of the e3 2014 trailer, not to mention there is a mod to make animals even bigger. Now fish might be very small, other big fish are always preditors as far as i am concerned about this, but i haven't explored all of the planets, i can't say there aren't big herbivore fish. The caves are also a problem, because they are said to have rare resources in them, but are on every planet with only a few resources. I think the caves will be more usefull later, to find iron for the new base building feature coming up, so that fixes it. I can really say this game isn't a grind or a game with an ending. It's about exploration, you can't expect a game of this size to end. The universe is wast and unexplored, so go for it. I am putting my trust in hellogames and the community to resolve the missing features and lack of content, but for now i will give this game a 8/10. We will just have to wait and see how it will turn out with content added. Till then folks",

I understood this game was going to a space exploration game, made by a small development team, with some of the mechanics not being fully developed yet.   I was looking for a game that would allow me to waste some time exploring space, while gradually leveling in some form or another, sort of like when you explore fallout or skyrim for those extra locations to get some sort of progression, but find yourself wasting time doing the same ♥♥♥♥, I found this game filled it in a little better with the upgrades / learning words.   I come from Eve Online, where all the mechanics are there and there is a strong foundation from its much larger development team, my problem was, the space. In Eve there isn't alot of space to be alone in 'space', so I stopped playing, got too crowded. I enjoyed this game because it let me peacefully fly around and jerk off in space, with the expectations that maybe in 6 months or a year, more things will be added to emulate more of an Eve Online-like game, pvp, player owned stations, etc... Which they seem to suggest will happen. If all these extras end up costing more, then that is when I will choose to be dissapointed.  $60 is steep, but I considered it a decent investment, but my opinion is my own, many do not feel the same.",

I've bought both PC and PS4 versions of the game, due to only having access to my gaming PC for limited parts of the day. Therefore my review is solely of the game, and not specifically the PC version. This is honestly the best game I've ever owned or played for me personally. Now I'm not saying it's everyones cup of tea, or that it wouldn't benefit massively from some of the features that people expected from the interviews and the hype. But this is without any doubt for me, the best game I've played so far. I bought the PC version first, knowing that I'd enjoy it more on my PC, but then couldn't wait when it was released and bought it on the PS4 so I could play it just a couple of days early. I was super excited, and I'd even hyped the game massively, I was even expecting to be disappointed after seeing all of the reviews, but that's the thing, I still spend all my time playing it, I still have put about 70 hours into the PS4 version and have thoroughly enjoyed starting again on the PC with the higher framerates. If you are looking for a game with story, and that shows you how to play the game, then this game isn't for you, but if you want to spend time on a game, enjoying the scenery, with limitless posibility to the scenery on each planet you land on, and if you don't expect the game to be something it's not, then it will be the best game you have played!",

Ultimately, if you can get past the garbage thrown around by the 'fans', or rather, the ex-'fans', it's a perfectly workable game.

I believe that people who got dissapointed were gamers that didn't know what to expect from the game. Its a Game for starters! It's bound to have limitations. However most people actually wanted everything: They wanted to get the first proceduraly generated, acurately simulated, space exploration, flight simulator, Rpg MMO, first person shooter...  I mean... c'mon now!  For me the game was a my personal gamer's dream: An immense world to explore in and It feels like that: Immense.  Of course there are some inconsistencies: for example the developers claim that the world is so huge that it's improbable to meet another person, but the most planets that you come across have aliens and structures on them! In reality though, in an 18-Quantilion-planets-universe, it's really hard to find a planet that is suitable for life, let alone one that contains inteligent life, or even aliens. Take our solar system for instance. Only one out of the tens of significantly big celestial bodies that revolve around the sun actually carries life. Even at that analogy, life (or aliens) should be availabe only on one out of 50 planets available in no mans sky! And that is by taking for granted that at least one planet of each solar system contains life.  If you wanted to be that accurate though, you'd create a boring game. But it's a game. So game elements need to take priority here so that it's not boring.  Many people claim that Rodina is better but... Rodina has only 4 planets! The only thing proceduraly generated there is each planet's anaglyph. There is no vegetation or special surface stuff like water or rocks or similar. Rodina is nowhere close to NMS.  Having put that out of the way with all the Liars anti campain which I personally found annoying, I have to say that it's a great game! It's huge, and gives room for a lot of exploring which I personally love.  Improvements could be released of course. For example ship interriors could be added. That way you could get up and walk around in your ship (yes... that is the only part that Rodina is better than NMS)  I believe that part of the fact that I am happy with the game is due to the fact that I didn't follow all that pre-release hype. I learned about the game about a week after it had been released and watched a couple of in game review videos before buying... Maybe that's a good practice for people to follow when buying games. Wait till they are released and then watch a video or two before deciding...  Hope you enjoy the game. I did and still do.",

As a backer of Star Citizen, I initially found out about No Man's Sky through my two newphews who are up-to-date on all things gaming, on all platforms. Up until then, I was under the impression that SC was the only current space sim in development. With that game taking forever, I was intrigued about No Man's because I needed to scratch my space itch and fly some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space ships, or something.  I'm an older gamer, so I'm always on the look out for more chill games. Games that have less hand holding and direction and allow you to do, well, whatever you want; within the confines of the game's design, of course.  Since when is it a bad thing to have no hand holding in a game? No quests? No direction? No pressure.  Just an endless sense of wonder and exploration awaits you.

Every single animal, every single planet, every single solar system is unique. I've even started to wonder why people are so salty towards this game, and my conlusion is as follows: 1. People expected a lot more additional features, which had a domino effect, causing the bellow points: 2. People said Sean Murray lied about features he wanted to add to the game, which he announced a year and even earlier before the game's release, so they may have decided to change some of it while developing the game 3. People hate the game because of crashes and bugs Yeah sure, there are a few features I would have liked to see, and the game may be a bit on the pricey side, but overall I am fairly impressed by what Hello Games were able to accomplish in their short time limit of developing the game, and I am excited to see the features they will still add to the game.

When this was first advertised, the devs promised us huge creastures roaming around doing all sorts of things, with vast multiplayer action. However, what we got instead was a single player, space exploration simulator that gets a little repetitive, and no big creatures. Sure it's half as good as said was advertised, but I still think it's an alright game. However, because of the false advertising, this is a 6/10 which is a shame really, because it is a moderately good game.",

            "review_text": "Considering the size of the team which created this game it's pretty amazing they managed to create something of this magnitude. I think something a lot of people fail to appreciate is that the developers of No Man's Sky are pioneers in the field of procedurally generated environments. I'm sure many games in the future will learn from the model variation techniques used by NMS and now that a small development team has shown it's possible to generate an entire universe with procedural techniques we know it's not an impossible task.  Is the gameplay kind of shallow and repetitive? Sure, I wont deny that, and I was hoping it might have been a bit more detailed, but if you just want a fun exploration experience then I would recommend this game. Do I think it's worth the price? Until we get more updates to iron out all the bugs and add some more features to the game, I don't think the current price can be justified. But it's their game and I can't really blame them for cashing in on all the hype. I'm willing to pay the given price just because of the technical innovation it contains.  I think the main reason many people are annoyed with this game is because they were expecting something that wasn't such a single player experience. They were told they could at least see other players if they were in the same place but it turns out that isn't true. It's not shocking that isn't true since creating a MMO is never really what they set out to do and they never tried to portray the game that way. There's also a bunch of networking problems that come into play when you start turning it into a multi-player experience.  As it stands I'm not really sure that allowing players to see each other would really add anything to the game at the end of the day. I think the best development path for this game is to just accept it as a single player game and add features which help that single player experience. I heard something about the developers wanting to add base building, and my question to that is: wouldn't that completely go against the exploration nature of this game? Why would we want to settle down in one spot when we have the whole universe to explore?  One advantage of this game being a single player experience is that modders have a lot more freedom in what they can change about the game. Finally, I think people are exaggerating just how pointless this game seems. Players shouldn't expect hand holding in a huge open universe. Rust is an extremely popular game (and a another example of why procedural worlds are awesome), yet the progress of everyone is wiped away every few weeks and they all have to start over again. It's the most pointless thing I've ever seen yet I find myself continuing to play Rust.  Pros:  * Every planet is quite unique, I haven't come across similar looking creatures too many times and I still have the sense that I've only seen a small fraction of what the game has to offer after playing for 50 hours. * The color schemes are very beautiful and give the game a very fantasy sci-fi feel. If you prefer a realistic space experience then this feature may not appeal to you. * The algorithm which decides positions of grass and plants and things like that seems to be pretty well designed. Some planets, such as tropical planets, can look quite breath taking, and knowing you're the first person to see it makes it even better. * The terrain generation seems to be very well done apart from the odd floating land mass, although I think that is intentional in most cases because it's shown in the trailer and copper is commonly just floating in the air. * In particular, I find the cave systems to be very interesting and well positioned. Cave systems can be very large and complex, with multiple exits and entrances. I'm fairly sure they don't use any cave models, it's all procedurally generated. * Another nice feature about caves is that they protect you from harsh conditions. You can even blast holes in the terrain to create your own cave and the engine will still detect that you're under cover even though the cave is dynamically created. * The alien language system is fairly ingenious I think, I'm guessing they use a dictionary file to generate alien variants of every English word. Some people seem to think it takes too long to collect enough words, but I think it's a good challenge. * The music is very well done, it fits the game nicely and enhances the atmosphere a lot. I also read some of the music is procedurally generated, which is pretty cool. * The writing is pretty decent. That may seem like a strange thing to say since there's no real story line to speak of but there's actually quite a bit of reading in the game and it meshes well with the vibe of the game. * Overall I think NMS has done what it set out to do but it clearly has a lot of untapped potential. It's impossible to please everyone and some people simply don't enjoy exploration games. I'm sure it will get boring eventually but for now I'm still enjoying all the sights on my journey to the center of the galaxy.  Cons:  * Variety of structures is very limited, once you've seen a few buildings you've basically seen them all. Definitely needs some improvement here I think. * Too many structures on most planets imo. It shouldn't take 2 seconds before coming across another structure after just finding one. It takes the magic away from finding a structure when there's so damn many. * When it comes to structures, I think the type and amount of structures should depend on how civilized the planet is. For example some planets could have large cities with sky scrapers and large trading centers. * Sentinels do seem a bit too pervasive, I'm not sure if I've seen a single planet without them so far. Like structures, I don't think they should be so common, and should be non-existent on many planets, especially barren ones. * The physics doesn't seem as realistic as it should be. For example larger planets don't appear to have a stronger gravitational force which acts on the player or ship. * Many people seem to think that all starships behave exactly the same way despite size or shape, from what I can tell there does seem to be slight maneuvering advantages with better ships, I could be wrong though. * The fact that all alien NPC's just seem to stand there is kind of annoying. I mean there is AI for other ships but the inside of a space station could feel much more immersive if NPC's were walking around and doing stuff. It would also be kind of cool to see some aliens mining resources on planets rather than just flying around. * I've heard people say too many planets are barren and boring, but I think the opposite is true. Most planets have some form of life, which is completely opposite to real life and highly unbelievable. If planets with creatures were harder to find then it would make finding them much more thrilling. * When buying a new ship, you shouldn't have to pay the full price and then abandon your old ship, it makes no sense. You should be able to sell your old ship or exchange it for another ship. * Solar system mechanics are rather simplistic, I don't think planets can have rings around them and there isn't things like asteroid belts, asteroids are just everywhere in space.",

I found No Man's Sky to be quite relaxing but also entertaining with suprises as I discovered new planet types, species, plants and elements.  Learning about the Atlas and Korvax Primes definitely caught my scifi attention. Deciding on whether I wanted to continue learning how to speak GEK or Vy'keen was tough. GEK seem to have stupid but funny things to say, but the Vy'keen were talking to me about displaying honor to aliens and giving me tips in space combat.  As I continued to upgrade my exosuit and multi-tool, learning that the multi-tool could be a semi-auto, full auto or shotgun was quite cool. Maxing out my exosuit with all the weather conditions was awesome, being able to jetpack around on planets for so long, not having to worry, just exploring.  Reaching what appeared to be my destiny, the center of my galaxy. I was expecting something way out of the ordinary, a twist or something. But I was simply 're-born' upon another galaxy. I do recall reading Korvax passages about portals providing a second chance, maybe they meant the result of reaching the center of the galaxy?  Not being able to choose a side between GEK or Vy'keen and fly along side them protecting freighters was a bit of a let down. Only having the opportunity to take on up to 12 pirates at a time, which became to easy once I maxed out my Phase Beam. I would like to thank a Vy'keen Captain for that starship combat information.  No desert worms were sighted during my travels. Reaching every solar system type, I believe I have now seen it all. Mastering many planets and moons along the way, even a few black holes! Finishing off my max-slot starship as a fighter.  I was hoping that one day I meet Hirk, only to find out Hirk was killed before all this even began.  I am sure there are many more secrets and adventures through more content to be had. But until then, I would like to leave this review giving an honest opinion that I did enjoy almost every second.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Ignore the hype. Wait for it to go on sale.  This game bears many similarities in both theme and mechanics to a little mobile/PC game called 'Out There'. If you enjoyed that, you will probably enjoy No Man's Sky, as it's basically an immersive 3d-version of it.  The primary gameplay loop involves entering a system, exploring planets for blueprints, materials, derelicts, and attempting to communicate with aliens. It's a very chill game where you just sort of wander about looking at the procedurally generated sights, and slowly upgrading your equipment. There's a general questline for you to follow given to you by unknown entities, which is intruiging, but the payoff is somewhat disappointing.  Unfortunately, there is not really a lot of content variety here. You will probably see all there is to see in a dozen or so hours, and there's not much reason to keep playing after that. I would probably recommend waiting for it to go on sale for that reason alone.  If you followed the hype on this game until release, then you will be disappointed regardless on what the game actually ended up being... Hello Games did a VERY poor job of managing consumer expectations on this one. It got to the point where media outlets were calling it an MMO-minecraft-alike-in-space-with-EVE-elements, which is an impossible dream that couldn't be further from the truth. This is a solely single-player experience by an indy developer, and shouldn't be judged as anything but that.",

Here are the things that I enjoy and don't enjoy about No Man's Sky.    Pros:    Lots of planets. After exploring over 30 different planets, so far all of them have been unique in their own way. In a game with so many planets, it's entirely possible you could start out somewhere where the worlds around you all look the same. Maybe I just got lucky.    Relaxing. After a long day at work, it's nice to come home and jump in a spaceship and warp into a new system, or land on a new world. I like seeing a cave and wandering into it to find that it's a deep network of tunnels running through a large area of the planet. I like island-hopping on an ocean world, or running from the sentinels as I steal precious albumen pearls. I like exiting a world and seeing freighters and frigates warp in from another system, regardless of it happens pretty much all the time. It adds to the experience.    Great soundtrack. The music really adds to the atmosphere of this game.    Great sense of scale. Some mountains, and some rock formations, really make you feel puny on some worlds. There are also tiny moons that take a couple minutes to fly around, and planets that would take you a while day to fly around if you're flying at surface level.    Flying in your spaceship is pretty cool. Occasionally you'll get into dogfights in space. I've ran from a fight down to the surface of a world for a few hours, and then gone back into space and the pirates were still waiting for me, that was pretty neat.    Art direction. I like the attention to detail in the different alien races, the buildings, the different ruins, the little touches on certain plants or animals. Ship designs are also pretty cool.    Puzzles. I like the math puzzles that appear for some of the buildings you go into. Some of them you start to recognize after doing them a few times, but it's a nice touch and I hope they add more elaborate ones in the future.    No multiplayer. I don't need some brat following me world to world and trying to shoot me down and won't leave me alone.    Runs smoothly. I heard there were a lot of issues getting the game to work properly for lots of people. I have a GTX 950, 16 GB RAM, and 500 PSU. Haven't had one single issue with this game. Again, maybe I'm just lucky. Or maybe people thought they could play this on their Famicom.    Cons (suggestions really)    Can't board freighters and frigates.    I want to see the frigates and freighters get destroyed slowly by space pirates if I do nothing. I'd like to see the big ships fight back against the pirates. Which brings me to my main issue.    I'd like to see more life instilled into the game. I like exploring a world and getting that desolate feeling that I'm the only one there exploring it. But I don't like going to a space port where ships are arriving constantly, but no one gets out. The chairs in the lobby are empty. No one else walks in and makes small talk with the Gek at the front desk of a outpost. There are no aliens sleeping at one of the camps you'll find. The ships coming and going is a nice touch, as are the bigger ships warping in, or small ships flying overhead while you're exploring, but it doesn't go that extra mile that you'd find in a polished product, I believe.    More alien variety. This goes for the races you can talk to, and the ones you scan. Every once in a while you'll spot something unique, but usually they tend to follow a similar bone structure. This game could be any 3D modeler or texture artist's dream! But it doesn't push it enough.    No fights with the locals. Let me stir something up with the Gek that tries to pull a fast one on me with selling some cheap piece of junk. I don't care if the sentinels come in and torch me, but I would like more challenge. It's fun when you arrive on a high security world and get attacked for messing with anything or simply breathing in the vicinity of a sentinel. I'd like to see better AI and more versions of the sentinels. I'd like to see the alien races get up out of their chairs and pull out a gun and get into a fight with you, and maybe they have shields of their own.    More treasures and things you can sell, and maybe create some sort of hub where players can upload really rare artifacts they found while exploring that other players can look at when they access the trade network. You emphasize showing off discovered worlds and species, but how about the other things we find like trinkets, or camps or ruins even?    More technologies. Again, sky is the limit! A gun that sprays lasers in all directions, or shoots electricity, or turns into an underwater scooter that lets you swim faster, I don't know.    Learning the language should help you communicate with locals that are sitting around the trade port and maybe they point you in the direction of something interesting on the world you're on.   In the end, it doesn't feel finished. I wouldn't recommend it for $60 right now. I don't disagree with the 5/10 score, though I might rate it a 6 just because I find myself enjoying what's there so far. I do recommend it if you enjoy space games and flying around in your own ship and just landing on a new world to see what's there. Not every world will be a winner, but landing on the ones that are make the journey worth it.",

Like reading a book from Tolkien or Asimov. Yes, it could be more varied...but i'm a biologist and even in the real life variety i see the repetition. Yes it could be more streamlined...but Earth 2150 was blocky in every meaning and i love it. Just like NMS. (Maybe i am this positive towards the game because i have seen almost zero major bugs, and only had 2 or 3 crashes. No major FPS-drops either altough i play it on a Dell notebook.) While i have problems with the way HG (not) communicated with the would-be playerbase, i really don't think they lied more than any advertising does. It doesn't make it right...actions can make it right. Bugfixing, adding features for free, and listening to the diminished playerbase. And they seem to doing this. So, if you want a faster, more varied game, then wait. If you really like old Sci-fi cover art AND don't mind the snail-pace then give it a (long) try.",

            "review_text": "I've heard all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning about how this game isn't what it was supposed to be. After all of that one might wonder why I bothered with it at all but if I learned anything from my late Son it is this. Make up your own mind. Don't listen to critics or wannabes so here I am with my own opinion. Some may not like it. Even more may think I don't know what I'm talking about. Still others may consider me an idiot but I don't really give a rat's ♥♥♥. I am simply putting my two cents in the mix. With that said here is No Man's Sky the way I see it.  It must be hard to describe a game like this without coming off either as a lyer or stupid. The simple fact is nobody has ever done anything even remotely similar so no wonder the creators and spokesmen had such a hard time and have been the blame for everyone's gripes. 'No Man's Sky' is a multyplayer! No it's not! It has this issue! It has that problem It's nothing like those jerks said it would be! It's boring! I thought the graphics would be better. These are just a few of the complaints people have come up with troling the game before they've even played more than a few hours. I think like any open sandbox game there are going to be a few bugs the best way to get rid of is to let people play and stand back and watch. Maybe Hello Games could have spent a little more time fixing a few bugs but people were already ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it being delayed so who's to blame for it being released with a bug or two, certainly not Hello Games.   As far as bugs go most of those I've heard or read about have turned out to be simple fixes that had more to do with the capabilities of the pc or play station running it. My own pc isn't all that new and yet I've not had a single problem I wasn't capable of fixing myself with a little help from a friend and a bit of tweaking. The only bug I heard about that wasn't easily fixed was when a player complained a creature had a horn for a head and no way to feed it's self and no way to breathe. If your gonna be that picky go play Mario or some other of the like that won't over tax your high standards.   Other complaints were that the game didn't have everything the creators said it would . How does anyone know what the game has in store for them if they haven't even played more than a few hours and I wanna know how the guy who claimed to have beaten the game in what has got to be an impossiblly short amount of time managed to do that because I've been playing quite a few hours since friday August 12th at eleven am and I see no way it could have been done without cheating and if one is gonna do that before even bothering to give the game a chance he doesn't deserve to be heard in the first place. Oh,!, and by the way how much did he pay to get an early copy? I am reminded of the phrase 'More money than brains'.  'They talked the game up so much that it was no wonder people were disapointed' I'd like to ask those who said this do you have a life? I, myself have more important things to do than to waste my time in front of a pc reading, watching, listening to everything the web inundates us with concerning who knows how many new games out there. Do I think it may have been a bit over hyped, yeah, maybe but I didn't sit here on my pc sucking it all in. I have places to go and things to do.  'The game is boring.' Ok, it's not 'STALKER' It's not 'Metro', it isn't 'Doom' Wolfenstein' or 'Call Of Duty'. It wasn't meant to be and if you seriously thought it was then you need to go back and spend another useless forty or so hours watching listening and reading all the crap that is still out there. Only this time pay attention. No Man's Sky is an action, adventure, survival, exploration game and nowhere have I seen the words first person shooter. I admit I wasn't sure myself why the word action was used in describing this game but I have to say it has had it's moments and it does seem to have more of these moments as one explores deeper into the game.  Now I got to admit I've come down pretty hard on the armchair critics of this game but it is only because I feel it deserves more than a quick play and then being dumped on. There are people out there who like myself don't have a lot of money to spend. To them I would say check the game out maybe even play a little on a friends game if you can before you buy. If you're looking for something with a lot of action and shooting and all that. Don't spend your money but if again you are like me and love to see what's over the next batch of pixels then give it a try and don't let the armchair critics keep you from making up your own mind.   I highly recomend this game to dreamers, Sci fi lovers and adventurers everywhere.  To Hello Games I want to say this. Thank you. Thank you for giving me worlds to explore, a universe to find my way in, a story that never ends. I have only one request and it is this. I would, like the planets I explore be able to give my ship a name. I don't think that's too much to ask.   ",

No Man's Sky was something fresh, unique and different that piqued at the science I have interest in. The auto generation is quite remarkable and it is really neat to traverse across the different and serene varieties. Some of the scenery is simply astounding and you can become immersed by it. Stock piling different elements and materials that are needed, and solving the game in general was rewarding in the beginning. Gameplay became a little redundant (as it can with many games) and there was little to really do soon after, aside from upgrading your ship and multitool. After I completed those, I shelved the game for awhile. I knew they had mentioned updates, so I was going to just wait and see what was added. The overall premise at the core was a tremendous idea and achievement, it just needed more layering and depth.  After the update, I think they made a pretty big improvement and a step in the proverbial right direction. In my bias, the foundations that this game is built on play to my favorite interests. There is so much they could do with a game like this and no sky is the limit. I think that is what a lot of games lack these days, bold vision and creativity - something different. As long as the company improves with continuous additions to the gameplay with more customizational elements and variety, the better the game will become. Nothing good was ever accomplished without someone taking a chance.  It can still live up to its hype, and then some.  toodlez",

If they will improve this game further, as what customers are expecting, I am sure it will reach a point wherein it will be accepted and will most probably become a classic.   I encourage people to support NO MAN'S SKY by giving the developers more reasonable time to improve the game. For Hello Games, I suggest they provide customers constant updates/feedback to appease the people propagating negativity.

            "review_text": "I think this game is a decent framework for a game that I hope to see evolve over the coming months. Is it everything I hoped for? No. But it is a fun sandbox to play around in and definitely a pretty good achievement for an Indie Developer. I preordered and I didn't get what I hoped for, but it's silly to attempt to return a game just because it's not what you hoped for. If you buy a car and drive it off the lot, it's yours, period. No returns... A car is worth a lot more than a game. People need to take some responsibility for their choices. It's a game that had incredibly lofty goals. It's a sim game. Anybody who's ever played sim games would know that the developer ALWAYS has ambitious goals regarding the design of the game, but as it's developed they have to trash certain ideas to make up for time and money. Look up the entire history of Maxis. We bought it. Just play it or not. It's not the Note 7. Relax! Only time will tell if the developer eventually adds the tons of content and updates that they actually 'promised' as opposed to the 'concepts' they expressed during development. In the end, I would probably reccomend this game to avid simulation gamers the most. If you don't have a fair amount of patience and don't enjoy micromanagement at all, then just stay away. If you pre-ordered... grow up and deal with your choice. That's life. The game is not broken or truly incomplete like say Arkham Knight was at launch. It just falls a little short of expectation. Personally, I'm just gonna play once in a while now and wait for more updates to see where my investment goes.  Additionally, At least in America, if you buy a car from a dealership, the moment you drive it off the lot it's yours. You can sue all you want, but you signed a lengthy contract stating so. The comparison is that you could pay thousands of dollars for something and it's still up to YOU to be smart about your purchase; for instance, reading reviews like the ones we're reading and commenting on ad nauseum here. I was impatient, took a chance and personally give it a conservative 7/10, so I guess I'm one of a few mildly satisfied customers. Again, it was still our gamble for a Needless Thing. There's a difference between protection and entitlement. I watched tons of videos detaling what they're adding to the game and what they'd LIKE and TRY to add to the game. Also, you deserve a refund because of poor advertizing? I suggest you don't ever buy anything in a supermarket considering most all advertizing is slightly misleading. Gourmet, Homemade, Zesty, Natural... See 'George Carlin - Advertizing Lingo.' Regardless, it's not a car or a shirt or even some basic necessity. This is essentially a piece of art. So, like it, hate it, we still bought something we absolutely didn't NEED. I guess I just don't have enough moral ambiguity to attempt to return something I at least mildy enjoyed, so far. If I go to see a movie and decide I didn't like it and the movie trailer seemed misleading, I just go, 'Oh well... That sucked.' and go on with my life. I just learn, move on and hopefully never make the same mistake again. Also, for Christ's sake, have some patience. You bought a game that could potentially be explored for multiple lifetimes, yet so few are willing to wait a couple months to see if there will be any content update? Seriously!? Some cautious optimism would be wonderful.",

Then, its repetition ended overcoming the amazing feeling of exploring the unknown. I didn´t complain: 80 hrs of enjoyment was more than enough. But I left the game for some time.   Then I played it again yesterday, and I felt that exploration feeling all over again. Comparatively, I also played Skyrim again, which is a much greater game IMO. I admired again how amazing Skyrim was, but, I knew exactly what was behind every corner. It was amazing, but I already knew it all in high detail.   That did not happen when I replayed NMS: There I was, in a wonderful planet that I had never seen before. No idea what to expect, how the night would it be, how the sunset would it look like. Yes, I was still mining and doing all that repetitive stuff, but all what I was seeing was new in so many levels.   While, no doubt, with a lot of repetitive elements, there is no game in the world that can offer an infinite level of visual replayability as NMS does. Sure, I can get bored exploring similar planets, but once in a while, NMS suddenly offers you a true miracle of procedural generation. True art made not by people, but by math. I laugh at those moments, remembering I´m the first one appreciating that beautiful landscape, I´m truly an explorer of this universe.",

If you need to be wowed and amazed in the first 10 hours of gameplay, this isn't for you.   Space combat is in the game, though pretty easy once you get the hang of it, and not central to the gameplay, it was never supposed to be. Ground combat is there to, but not the focus of the game.   Awesome, beutiful planets with all manner of creatures are there, but you have to know what to look for to find them. You're not just going to go warping around randomly and find the rare planets. Creatures vary from realistic to downright goofy, and tiny to EPIC huge!  Plants and rock formations are kind of repeptive after awhile, but I don't find that it detracts from the overall experience, kind of helps when you are looking for elements.   Performance wise, you will want a pretty solid rig. Mine is a beast so I haven't had any problems with crashing, stuttering or anything.   From all the pre release vids I watached, pretty much seems as advertised. Like Sean said though, the awesome amazing planets with big huge amazing creatures ARE exceedingly rare, until you know how to find them. Then they are not so hard to find.

No stampedes, simple AI. -Barebones NPCs and repetitive alien outposts with a few easy puzzle types. -Varied but meaningless dialogue. Alien language learning system. -No real quests beyond pushing forward and exploring new places -No backtracking ever -No base creation -Surface, underwater and caverns only, don't waste your time tunneling for hidden stuff. -Ship stays away from land, landing is automated. -Combat is easy and avoidable.

You get paid game currency for discovering flora, fauna, and various outposts scattered on each planet. There are ancient alien ruins scattered on each planet that can be discovered. Each giving the player a little info into the lore of one of the races in the game as well as learning a few new words from that race's language.  There are survival elements in this as well. Your suit, ship, and multitool requires power which gradually decreases with use. They can be recharged with various items you can mine on each planet. All 3 can be upgraded to house more slots for upgrades/inventory space.  Space combat, while not as in-depth as some space sims can be quite entertaining once you get the hang of it. And deadly if you don't, as space pirates are unrelenting in some systems.  Ground combat is persay your classical fps. run, shoot, jump.  Each planet has a wanted system like that seen in the GTA series. Mine too much, kill too much fauna, or shoot the sentinels and it will riase your wanted level. The higher the wanted level the more powerfull the sentinels become ranging from flying annoyances to towering walkers that spew death in your general direction.  The visuals on some planets are utterly breathtaking.  So all in all I have found this game to be quite addictive and entertaining. I will be looking forward to what the developers have in store for us in the future.",

Generation is well paced and rarely generates errors(almost none after recent updates) Progression has a Skyrim-like feel to it, which is nice for a resource, gathering, crafting game so you dont blow out your brains from a mining overload but this is far from skyrim gameplay. But unlike most Resource gathering games it has a deep lore to learn and languages to learn so that you can understand what NPC say. Not a 10/10 but i would at least give it an 8/10 but I understand why the average critic rates it 6.5 to 7(rational ones). Recommended if you like Gathering/Crafting, procedural generation, and making your own adventure. Liking sci fi helps too. Edit:As for the price this not a AAA published game so the price-tag can be misleading. But its still a sleak and well polished procedurally generated game.

Build a empire across the stars, and maybe in five years time someone will follow the trail you left behind.

A few things to keep in mind:  First, you must update your video card. There were many compalints about the game not working 'out of the box'. I am using a 4 year old Alienware and after updating the video card driver, the game works great.  Second, this is a casual game (at least for me). It reminds me of a combination of the old 'Starflight' and 'Elite' games on the Commodore 64 (I am dating myself but those games were amazing back in the day).  I'm enjoying No Man's Sky immensely. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as other people, but I do not have buyer's remorse and I hope there is DLC in the future.",

I do not blame devs for doing the best they could, they are pushed by producers, and so sometimes games become over hyped, grow arms and legs and then suffer upon release, NMS was one such game, the devs being called liars etc,,, it's a game, who cares, All the things going on in world and people are becoming child like, toys out pram, pathetic opinionated morons, sorry, but it's true, its a game, it cost 11p a day if you played for a year, I enjoy the content, so let's list the things you can do here, You go to space, visit planets, make disoveries of plant and animals, meet aliens, learn four languages within the game, buy, build and repair your suit, multi tool and ship, gather resources to do this and make credits, I get to try and survive planets atmospheres, I get to battle pirates in space in my ship, I get to follow a storyline to the centre of the galaxy, however long that takes, as I said I'm in it for the long haul, the DLC and updates from the Dev's will come, so I'm being patient, playing and taking my time, oh by the way, you can name pretty much most things in game, the naming of things becoming associated to you as your name is on it, this can be seen by others, this is the multiplayer element within the game, it's more a solo game than anything else, you can't play along side friends in the true sense of multi player, but really what difference does that make, there are plenty of multiplayer games out there, the graphics are good, the soundtrack is good, you can walk away play something else then come back, no timescales to complete things, no rush, no hardcore in your face fast paced FPS here, yes you can shoot things if that's you bag, you don't have too, you can just enjoy the ride, think elements of Minecraft, Elite Dangerous, Arc for instance, it's colourful, it's relaxing, I'm not a fan boy, because let's face it, it's a single game, that in all honesty and reality didn't cost that much even as a triple A title, it's about the longevity of what's on offer, as I said , if you played on and off for a year. it's would cost you £0.11p sterling a day approximatley, at some point it'll go on sale, then it will cost you less, they say there are less than 1000 people still playing, so, I hope they're enjoying it, because I am, an I don't care what other folk think, I'm an individual with my own mind, and I can make my own mind up when it comes to what I choose to play..",

            "review_text": "First of all I would like to make an honest and unbiased review. I do like this game however as it is pretty much what I expected, yes a few features are missing (ie).  1. Can't see other people, well Sean Murray didn't actually promise this he only teased it, later views from him said you would see their results, ie planet names etc, but not people directly.  2. Large creatures? Well I've see seen some larger ones though not as big as E3 demo yet, give it more time.  3. Carnivore attacking other creatures, well I have seen this but very rarely so far.  4. Space battles, well I've seen quite a few, when jumping into a system you can sometimes see large ships being attacked by smaller ones and yes you can join in if you want, although recommend attacking small ones as large ships look pretty formidable. May have to take out roughly 10 or 12 of them though so don't try unless your equipped for it.  5. Orbits of planets, well yes this looks to be a no no, they look pretty static to me.  6. Hacking into trading post ship terminals to steal ship, No this doesn't happen, you can however buy that ship from trader but make sure you transfer items from inventory first, (not ship systems) Sean Murray said you can hack terminal to take ship in interview so may have meant this, although he didn't make that clear.  7. Planets closer to sun are warm and farther from planets are cold. Well this doesn't look correct so far not from my experience although some have no water and are very hot, not really taken much notice of this so far.  8. Play with your friends. No this is definitely a no no.  9. Fighting fighters on planets. Well this is possible I've done it, but you would have to attack them first as I've never been attacked yet by them. It is very tricky though as I found it hard to attack them from above especially because of the low flying restriction it's hard to hit them when they are directly below you.  10. Customising your character. Not physically no, but you can upgrade or change enhancements on back pack, ship and weapon.  11. Large Sentinels (2 legged). Not seen one so far but maybe these come later at very high levels or nearer to galactic core. Have seen many 4 legged ones if you take high value items from planet with rare items, ie. Gravitation ball or vortex cubes, then they will attack immediately.  12. Planets orbit suns and moons orbit planets. This is definitely a no. Have never seen the sun or a planet move across sky.  13. Landing on a comet No No. No comets seen so far. Maybe land on asteroid, will try this to confirm and let you know.  14. Portals, well these are definitely there, just nobody has found out how to activate one yet. Pretty sure that there is a way to do this but not sure how yet, has any one tried using dimensional matrix to activate one maybe 10 or more. Please let me know if you find out.  Okay I think that's enough of confirming certain elements that are or are not in the game, let get to review.  I have put over 140 hrs into this game so far, even restarted by deleting save because of no antimatter blueprint bug with pre-order, and so far I am enjoying it very much, yes things are becoming a little repetitive now as I have most of the blueprints now, but I'm still enjoying the exploration side of the game and renaming planets etc. The Survival element has improved since the storms have been added and taking on ships is a lot of fun (keep topping up shield often or you'll die). I have maxed out my inventory to 48 slots just need a bigger ship now, only have 20 slots on that. I've done plenty of mining especially gold, copper and Iridium so can make some good money there. Can make more money by trading at space stations with other ships just look out for items with a star on them, I get mostly dynamic resonator for 33,000 and sell for 54,000 to others that seems to be best, may have to wait sometimes for seller to turn up. Most plants and rocks and animal can be a bit samey but may get more diverse nearer the centre or if you go to another universe.  So overall I do recommend people buying this game as I've had a lot of fun playing it and have only now started heading toward the centre, I do love the lore of the game like reading the messages from monoliths, it's has a very old sci-novel feeling to it ie. A C Clarke, Asimov, Michel woodcraft, so love that. I like understanding the languages of the Korvax, Gek, Vy'keen and Sentinels. So if this is your thing then yeah buy it. If you want hard core fighting or survival or trading then no maybe it's not your bag. £40.00 is maybe slightly overpriced considering some stuff is missing all though not that much to be fair, when it's on sale then yes buy it you'll like it. Well I hope the helps anyone thinking of buying game or not, so thanks and have fun. I've got more stuff to do in this game so let's get back to it.",

Countless millions of simple minds offering themselves up to whatever notion is a trend or a fad at the time. Achieving perhaps an illusory sense of belonging and satisfaction in the process.  It's this extreme, overly emotional group reactions to things that really show rather than being a collection of individuals, the internet mostly consists of lemmings who's opinions and thoughts are unduly controlled or influenced by whatever circle jerk takes their fancy.  'Circle jerk' is derogatory and over-used yes, but it is still the perfect description. There's no independent or restrained thought going on here. There's no acceptance or realisation that the blame for this lies with everyone, from fans to sony to hello themselves.  Just mindless, obsessive, vitriolic bile and hatred directed at the game. Completely over the top reactions. As though this is some kind of moral crusade. Honestly, get a grip on yourselves.  It's over-priced I grant you, but if you actually put your pitchfork down for a moment and try to be rational, if you force yourself to try and focus on the things this game is alright at you will get some enjoyment out of it.  When you learn its awkward, clunky and user-unfriendly controls and systems like inventory management it becomes much more bearable. As well as when you learn what materials you need to keep on hand to avoid constant interruption to gather more specific resources.  After doing this I got about 50 hours of fun and entertainment out of this game in the end. Just relaxing, doing some exploring and getting as much out of the game as I could. 50 hours, whilst I still think it's over-priced I suppose I got my money's worth.  Beware of making a decision on the back of the huge amount of bad reviews - that is bitterly exaggerated by the dedicated and fanatical hate mob of this game. There are people who haven't even played it that make it their life's mission to slate it. Remember that it was premature hype and heightened emotions that made the stark reality of this game hit everyone so much harder. This is all just the rection to that.  The game's alight, not as bad as what people are making out in their endless spite. Educate yourself on how to play it efficiently, and if you like a bit of exploration and atmosphere, maybe a bit of resource collection and crafting and selling, the odd puzzle and bit of combat - it's probably worth getting on sale and will also probably be worth it's money in the end if you try to enjoy it without bias.  It didn't take me that long to get a 48 slot suit and then soon after a 48 slot ship. When you have that you don't worry about inventory management anymore really.  Hope the internet stops being a revolving circle jerk some day too.",

For me it is suffering right now the same problem that Star Wars Galaxies suffer at its beginning, where the history were almost entirely made by the players, but with some polishing, goals and history to discover, what an amazing game it could become. Then, I really think No man sky needs more polishing in future updates, adding more interesting content about the races we encounter and goals to achieve with them, forming alliances or enemies with an alien race.   Also it need more lore and epic content to captivate the players as the procedurally worlds already do, as more history involvements, goals and achievements, bosses to defeat and ancestry misteries to solve. Different paths in that history will give our grinding to upgrade our skills and ship a goal in the path we follow.That will make it a true jewel. I repeat, I think it's an amazing game that with more history, content, more goals and races to know and interact with, will achieve its real potential.   Please devs, make this happen, you have in your hands the potential to make No man Sky a true classic that will be played by more and more players in the years to come. I'm really enjoying it now, but it could be so much better!!! The playground is already set, it have a lot of potential, and with more epic quests it will be simply awesome.",

            "review_text": "No Man's Sky. A very simple title. Yet, it hides an enigma. There has been a lot of hype about this game. For a number of years we were teased with trailers and interviews and all sorts of marketing that heightened the expectations and raised a high bar. People expected a game that would in essence be 'The mother of all games'. Then, when it finally arrived, it seemed to not meet all of the expectations and hype. Some complained of technical issues, the UI, the controls, the lack of a storyline, and so forth.I read that some even had their money refunded to them. All of that seems silly to me. I have been playing games for a very, very long time. I come from a the generation with an Atari 2600 console, Apple II, and casette tapes, VHS video and the like. Instant gratification WAS NOT the order of the day. If you wanted FUN, then you had to go find it. In No Man's Sky, I found FUN. Yes, it might seem as if some things are repetitive, and seems the same all the time. Yes, maybe there is only a thin storyline or three. Yes, maybe the controls are a bit funny, and not like those of the newest space sims. BUT, when your goal is not instant gratification, but putting yourself in the shoes of an Explorer, as it was when this game was originally announced, and you set yourself other, smaller goals, then the game takes on a different perspective for me. Scanning and finding ALL the different animal species on a planet, AND in the process learning new alien languages, AND fixing your spacecraft, AND trading your minerals, AND finding ruins, AND upgrading your ship and Exosuit, AND travelling throughout a star system, are all, together, part of a process, a process of discovery. The problem I have with nearly all of the negative reviews of this game is that the reviewer inevitably tries to impose their perception of what they Thought it would be or should be, and in nearly all the cases, of all the ones I have read, focus on a very narrow set of goals. My challenge to you is this:  Do not limit yourself by only expecting or setting a small set of goals. Make it big, daring. Think of the game as a window into the near infinite possibilities that I think exist out there in the real Universe, and then play it as such.  You will find things that will surprise you. Take the time to read about that new animal you just scanned, or the plant you identified. Try giving each and every one you find, a unique name. Play the Botanist or Zoologist while you are also the Spaceman, the Explorer, the Archeologist. I do not think that anybody can give an honest opinion about this game untill they have played a few hundred hours. That includes me.  But I did feel that I needed to write about this game, given all the unfair comment, in my opinion, it was receiving from people that have not given it a fair chance, but was measuring it against completely different types of games, or even with the wrong measures. I am enjoying this game. The thrill of finding a new species of animal, or blasting open the door of some abandoned building keeps me coming back for more. If you want to wait for the price on the game to drop before buying it, then do so. The universe in the game will not disappear, and there will still be lots for you to discover once you decide to join us, and you could become a sort of Indiana Jones in Space.",

Exploring an almost endless universe on your own and deciding how you want your journey to be, I would like to thank Hello Games for the hard work and wish them good luck with the further development of this fantastic game. This is the first time I pre-ordered a game and I was first sceptical about it. But I can tell now that I am more than statisfied with the resulting product. Keep on the good work!!!  EDIT: I must admit after 55hrs that I dont think anymore that this game is worth 60 bucks. Even though I still like everything that has been done by Hello Games. The game becomes very repetitive after a certain amount of time. It is just to much focused on ressource grinding and you somehow start to miss some diversity in the gameplay. I still recommend the game...but unfortunately not for 60 bucks...until they add more content to the game.",

I played minecraft for 4 years and I loved mining and exploring, because of that ive gained an incredible desire to keep playing no mans sky. In the first day on launch I played for 11 hours and I suspect that I will be adding a 100 more. I actually quite enjoy mining a lot, and when people say that the planets aren't really that unique, they're all wrong. Every single planet will have 1 or 2 look a like structures and landscapes but they will look completely different, as you progress through different star systems youll notice changes into the building and camps youll find on planets. Youll notice that they are more complex and offer something more than just finding them and looting them. The sense of reward in this game if quite exciting.

The hype leading up to the game release is justified in my opinion.   With that said, I’ve experienced a few issues. When I first loaded the game for the first time I was getting a little stuttering. Sometimes when I launch the game I have to launch it a second time in order to have the game launch. The structures are repetitive, the NPCs are a little meh. Inventory management can be annoying because of the very limited slots you have when first start out. But I know that this will improve when I get a new ship and finally find increased inventory for my suit.   Specs: Intel i5 2500k stock 8 GB of DDR3 1600 EVGA GTX 970 240 GB SSD (I installed NMS on the SSD, this may help stuttering issues) ASUS Xonar DSX Windows 10 Home Latest Nvidia drivers  But that’s about it, everything else is fantastic! Every planet’s terrain, animal life, atmosphere, feel have been completely different. I’ve been in a few space fights and they were really cool! I’m loving the story so far, I’m enjoying the game mechanics, the mystery and the openness of the game. Fought a ton of sentential, explored a ton of caves, went diving, found a ton of alien relics, jumped to 9 different planetary systems. Crafted a ton of anti-matter. Exactly what I hoped for!  The game isn’t perfect and many have blown the idea of this game into unreasonable expectations. But I’ve watched enough game play and trailers to know they delivered exactly as promised. Bugs, performance issues will be resolved. More content will be added. Lets not freak out like many freaked out when the early leaked game play came out.   Give it time and you may find that you may really enjoy the game when reality sets in. Two thumbs up personally, it’s only going to get even better from here on out!

From the very beginning this was a game you were mostly going to have to play alone...the idea of coming across even ONE friend, let alone GROUPS of them in such a vast and endless playground was kind of a silly idea to begin with.   The graphics are wow-esque and the animals are mostly adorable and once I docked at the space station I was overcome with the urge to get enough money to buy one of these awesome ships from one of the strange little frog dudes.  SPEAKING of the little frog dudes...it's worthwhile to pay a bit of carbon and learn several words, as well as finding the little nodes all around to learn more, because the more you know about their language the more it starts to become interesting to talk to them. There's a plot in this exploration game. I was not expecting that.  While it WOULD be nice for them to fix the issue of not being able to see others at all, if only to enjoy those rare encounters, I don't know why so many people seem to have gotten a message that this was a multiplayer game. I certainly didn't.  The only area where this game fails, I believe, is in inclusiveness. My brother and I got this game, wanting to compare and share creatures and worlds, and found out that he can't even play the thing due to his graphics card not being compatible. This is not an old graphics card, which leads me to believe that the game isn't as nicely optimised as my computer makes it seem.",

You will see more space battles, you will see more diverse creatures, etc.  STOP BEING STUPID AND THINK FOR A SECOND!!!

I can run it on fullscreen, good resolution and most of the settings are on low (except generation thats medium) but i can run a solid 40-45 fps and only crashed once on an extreamly stormy planet. now that the specs are out of the way lets get into the good stuff. I saw this game on steam about 2 months before it came out and i didnt think to much of it. It looked pretty cool so i waited for it to come out. Once i play the first 5 hours of gameplay i didnt regret buying it for $60. You could spend hours on one planet just trying to scan every animal, And then spend more time finding buildings and ruins to figure out the launguage of the specis that lives there or gear upgrades to your stuff. when people say that they have been around and havnt found any water life or flying then there not looking hard enough i have found numerous planets with water and air animals. but you might be saying *they all look the same or have little diferneces* that may be true but sometimes you get different animals that look all new, and its more of the adventure to find all of the different combanations than to see things never seen before. From what i have read from other comments this game is made for a spesific mindset of people, the ones who live for adventure and finding all that you can find within the 18 quintillion stars. Now the trailers may not be all that they are hyped up to be but most of the stuff in the trailers is in the game like dogfighting with pirates to steal there loot or teaming up with them to steal from frieghters. Once you get loot you can sell it to traders to get bigger and better starships. Even though the game may get repetitive at times it dosnt even come close to comparing when the game isnt repetitive. The amount of effort theses devs put into the game is astonisishing considing there was so little of them. I can see why some people may not like the game but that is what reviews and videos are for, teaching people what the game is like before they buy it. From all the hate ive seen this game getting i thought i would have to write my first review on this one to try and help out this poorly misjudged game. For a rating on this game i would probally give it a 9/10.",

When I first launched, it had mediocre graphics and I was only getting about 20-25FPS with an AMD Radeon R9 280x and a i5 3.5 ghz processor. Then I turned off Vsync, anti-aliasing, turned UP the graphics to high, rebooted and it ran flawless with a steady 45-60 frames depending on what I'm doing, sometimes more. The pop-in is bad, but you get used to it and it's not that big of a deal. Then again, it's all procedurally generated, so you can kinda expect pop-in to be a factor.   The music is phenomenal, the concept is fantastic, and the POTENTIAL of NMS is limitless. I can't thank Hello Games enough for this title. I've put almost 10 hours in already today, and with so much content, I plan to add a few zeros to that. This is a very very chill game, like Sean said himself, and it's such a nice break from everything else out right now. The grind is real - if you want it to be. I've already got almost $2 million, and some decent ships will run you half that.   Anyways, this is one game that I paid full price for and do not regret whatsoever. I'm confident they will continue to update/patch this and make it even better than it is now. It has a few issues (fell through the map/planet while mining), SOME frame drop when entering planets at high speeds, and that's about it to be honest.   Also, to the idiots here saying they're stuck on the 'initialize' screen - try holding 'e', dumbasses.   Great work Sean and co. Can't wait to see what you guys have in-store for this wonderful title, and it was well worth the wait.",

The desk has dents in it and my fists hurt because the desk is made of metal. -Buggy audio is buggy. -My character has one eye, according to the FOV. It's so narrow it wouldn't be able to fit the entirety of a needle on the screen. -Stamina and the jetpack run out so quickly. I know there are upgrades for these, but it seems like the player has been eating way too many doughnuts and pies because he can't run 100m without having to take a break. -These legs are like Greece's economy. They break under the most delicate pressure. With a 10m jump, I keep forgetting to activate the jetpack, then I have to go on a quest for health. -The radiation protection runs out so quickly. Also, to protect myself from RADIATION I need to fill my tools with and carry around a massive quantity of RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS. I'm being a bit anal there, I admit. -My computer was brought into existence by God himself, and it still can't handle this game. -I swear these companies build everything for console, then dump it all into PC format without optimising it and hope that the better hardware on PCs will balance it out  I feel kinda mean making this list, but there are some things that could be improved with this game.

The game's barely been out for 2 days and there are already people giving it hate for such things as 'lag' or 'bad performance?' Sure, those exist. I'm not denying that, as I have massive lagspikes and framerate drops on my GTX 960 at low settings. But if that's the sole reason for a bad review, then the review is not helpful. Think about it, The Witcher 3 had day 1 problems, and look at the community's opinion of it now. My point here is, don't give a bad review on a game when it's barely been out for a day. Also, to the people who are saying that there's nothing to do, same thing. More content will be added eventually, as this isn't a game made by Activision or EA. There will be free expansions.

To name a few of my pros: Great background music, awesome concept with communicating with alien races and having to deal with expressions and body language to interact with them while trying to learn their language, finding and upgrading ships/gear, running into awesome/comical creatures both passive and aggressive. One slight con which happens with many games is it can get a little repetitious, however during this you’re learning about the story of all these foreign races and whatever lies at the end game!!

First things first: the multiplayer issue. Like a lot of you, I've been glued to news updates about this game for a long time. I've probably watched or read at least 2/3 of every interview Murray gave during development. I absolutely admit that things don't add up based on all the statements that were made, and they might have gotten caught with their pants down.  HOWEVER, if you're going to damn them, let's damn them for the right thing and not blow it out of proportion. In every statement ever made about what the game would be like at launch, it was NEVER billed as a multiplayer game. EVERY time the question was brought up as to whether or not you could see other players, it was said it was so incredibly unlikely to happen. Fine, it happened. But that's not multiplayer. Multiplayer is a built-in, intentional, RELIABLE ability to find others and/or play with your friends. They told people REPEATEDLY not to expect it. The only thing that doesn't fit with what we were told so far is that if and when people ever found themselves in the same spot, that they'd be able to see each other. People latched on to the statement that they would be able to and forced that into a definition of multiplayer, even when players themselves would have no control whatsoever to make it happen - no matter how likely or unlikely those meetings are, they are still chance encounters. Even if you *could* see other players, not having any control over it would mean over the course of your gameplay you'd encounter 0-2 other people. Woo!  They did say a few months ago, AFTER the missed launch date earlier this summer, that they would be adding some form of multiplayer at a later date - not at launch. So why the whole world is hung up on the fact that two people can't see each other on the highly unlikely chance it will happen - and decide to call that failure to deliver multiplayer that wasn't actually promised - is beyond me.   So with that out of the way, my opinion on the game itself.  They promised exploration, survival, trading, and combat. They absolutely delivered all four. Admittedly, some better than others, but I feel they lived up to what they advertised, and I've enjoyed it immensely so far.  First and foremost, it's an exploration game. If you don't think you're the type who is happy finding out what is over that next hill, this game most likely isn't for you. The same concept applies on foot, flying over a planet, moving throughout a star system, and going from star to star. You don't know what you're going to find, and some people enjoy that while others don't. But let's make no mistake - it's exactly what they told us the game would be.  Trading is probably the most understated of the areas. Yes, you can buy low and sell high all the live-long day if you want to, I even enjoy that kind of thing in some games, but it isn't terribly rewarding in NMS. More often than not you'll find yourself selling valuable resources you gathered in order to buy what you want/need, or buying resources that you can't find out in the wild. And that's about the extent of it. You'd really have to be into commodity trading sims to find what you are looking for in NMS, but it's another facet of the game that helps make it more well-rounded than just exploration and combat.  I personally lump survival and combat into the same category, at least in how it was put into NMS (yes, survival extends to keeping your life support running and fuel in your tank, but otherwise they both mean staying alive in the face of hostile forces). Some people want combat to be the central part of every game they play, and that's fine. NMS is not that game, and again, it wasn't billed as that. It's another aspect of the game. It comes in three flavors: (1) against mechanical constructs that /usually/ only attack you if you do certain things they don't like; (2) wildlife that /can/ be hostile - varies by species; and (3) space combat. In all three categories, you can be the victim or the instigator. In the first two situations, you can easily, reliably run away if combat isn't your thing or if you just aren't in the mood. Space combat, it's possible sometimes, but more often than not you're going to have to fight. For people who want the combat, they've given both variety and a chance to escalate things to a challenging level. You can focus on improving both your hand-held weapon and ship weapons if that's what you want your gameplay to be about. So even though this isn't the center of the game, it exists, and I think they did it well.  One complaint I see a lot is that it gets boring. In part I think this goes back to people who aren't really that keen on exploring. But there's no denying that operationally, there's a good deal of repetition to the gameplay too. When is that not true of any game though? Break it down to the fundamentals, and every game is repetitive. In the case of NMS, it's roughly: explore planets to gather resources, make fuel to jump to the next star, and upgrade your ship and equipment as you go. It's unfair to judge any game when boiled down to that level. What that doesn't take into account is the variety of places and situations you find yourself in along the way.  For people who are criticizing the graphics, I'll bow out of that argument. I've got a middle-of-the road system (it was high end but not bleeding-edge 2 years ago, now, not so much) and I'm quite content with how it looks and plays. People who expect the ZOMG latest and greatest as of 2 seconds ago might not be thrilled - not being one of those, I can't say.  What am I less than thrilled about?  1. Two crashes in my first 35 hours of play. For a brand new game, that's not unheard of, but crashes are never fun. The upside is that your game autosaves *every* time you exit your ship, and at least the way I play, it's rare for that to be more than 15 minutes at a time.  2. One bug - there's one objective I've been given (no details, 'cause spoilers) that I currently can't get past because of a game bug. Searching online confirms that there are others, but clearly not everyone, also having the same issue. If it wasn't an obstacle to continued progression, I'd care far less, but it is.  3. For lack of a better word, 'chunking'. In Minecraft the game loads the world around you in large pre-defined areas at a time. NMS seems to do something similar and an unfortunate side effect is that when you're in one area but close enough to see into the next, you can see things that aren't there anymore -like you're seeing the pristine version before you mined that mound of resources a few minutes ago. So when you walk away, it shows up again, but if you return, it's still gone because you mined it. I speculate that the game is showing you your own personalized 'instance' of that chunk for lack of better terminology. This could also explain why two people in the same location can't see each other - because they are both in their own personalized version of that space.  4. Its problematic to find your way back to previous star systems once you've left. Not impossible, just far more of a hassle than you'd expect. The purpose of the game is to keep moving onward, but there's no reason they can't allow you to go back too.  5. Lastly, the game sorely needs instructions or a better tutorial. It's not rocket science, but they made very little effort to teach you the controls.  So do I think it's perfect? No. But I do think they delivered on the promise of the game, and I enjoy it greatly. I think that anyone who can honestly say they enjoy exploring will think it's worth the price of admission. Keep in mind as well what they've already commented on adding in future patches - building bases, freighter ships, and yes, eventually multiplayer.",

So far it's been stable and I haven't experienced a single crash. Maybe I'm just lucky as there are thousands of reviews stating that they can't even get it to launch. If you do manage to get it to run, the game is quite beautiful and, in my opinion, it's delivered on what Hello Games promised; a vast universe with (mostly) unique planets to explore.   I'll start off by saying that the game isn't neccesarily 'exciting'. There is some combat but tou can avoid it most of the time. There is also a survival element (make sure you manage your inventory!), but it really does boil down to an immense walking simulator. It's kind of like roaming through a Minecraft world endlessly; constantly finding new resources, and interesting areas, but never creating an actual homestead. Sure you'll see very similar places, but nothing is exactly the same.  There are quite a variety off different types of planets, though so far lacking any gas giants, ringed planets, and a few other planetary bodies that make up the actual universe. Every planet I've encountered has life, some may be more barren than others however. There are also plenty of sentient Alien species that you can gain influenece with, trade with, and gather important upgrades from.   Another thing that came to mind while exploring was the Mako missions from Mass Effect. Some people really hated them, but personally I enjoyed driving around collecting resources and artifacts.   This game is definitely not for everyone, but if you do enjoy exploring, collecitng, and discovering new things, No Man's Sky will give you all those things.",

            "review_text": "So far, totally unplayable. It loads, and the long space drift takes forever, the whole time my screen is strobing. Game loads, I'm actually on a planet and user interface fully loads, but my screen is litterally flashing the whole time between totally black, and the game. Dropped the graphics down as far as I could, and my video card is above the minimum requirements, reloaded game for settings to take effect, and there was no visual change. Still strobing the whole time. So, I was about to rush to the store to buy a new Graphics card, then decided to check what the min reqs actually are, and find all these reviews and, that the min reqs are less than what I have.... So, at least all these -ve reviews just saved me a trip to the store. But, really, after a year or so of waiting for the game, and being benched for not owning a PS4 for the week, no preload or anything for the game, it far exceeded my expectations of failure. As I had absolutely no thought of this game being totally broken for, I'd guess half of it's playing audience....  Looking forward to wasting a load of time in this game, but if I had epilepsy, this game would have caused a siezure for me due to total graphics failure.  Will update review as the game develops. But, with this issue, feels worse than an open beta.  EDIT: After upgrading the RAM on my PC, as well as dropping the graphics settings, I've been able to play the game. Quite enjoyable at times. But, today, I started the game too soon after booting my computer, and a window that usually pops up after my computer being on for 5 min, popped up, and No mans Sky minimized itself and refused to come back. Later, after I restarted the game, plaaying for a while, game just flat out crashed. Now opting in for the experimental beta patch, hopefully it fixes my issues....   EDIT 2: After I believe 3 patches, as well as my graphics drivers getting updated and optimized. This game is totally playable and so much fun. Frustrating at times, ever more so after reading what others have gotten from random draws.   Great adventure game totally open to do whatever you want.  Found Ship to ship combat a bit hard to control with the PC for now, but I've not really focused on that, and have no practice of yet, hopefully I get better in time.  Not a fan of the limited tech tree, and how everything is labeled as Rare, yet I get multiple copies of everything I already have, and have yet to recieve a few of the other techs, namely the Atlas Passes. I've obtained the first one via non-random means, but others have gotten the next two via random selection from buildings, and I've visited every single one I can fin, and only receive the same crap over and over.... at least 30 visits/puzzles in, and I've yet to get a V2/3 pass.  Another point of frustration, is ship inventory size. Every freaking ship i come across has 1 less slot than my current, and all the ships piloted by NPCs are multiple millions, which i havn't bank-rolled yet. Some people are like, oh yeah, like every fourth ship you find will be amazing.... Where-as every ship I find, for the last 10 ships, has been smaller. My suit Inventory is maxed, my Multi-tool is maxed, my ship is only 3 bigger than my multi-tool...  So, I must say, very frustrating at times, due to the totally random nature of the game, and receiving the same freaking tech over and over and over with no benefit. I'm not sure if I have all the tech, or if I need to progress to get better tech, but I havn't gotten an actual new ship/tool tech since leaving my home world, and the only suit tech I hadn't maxed before leaving was protections.... which as far as I know I have all of now as well. Yet, in all this time, I still don't have all the recipes for crafting stuff, couple things I know for sure I don't have other than V2/3 passes....  So, Kind of wish it was less random, or that you could actually have some sort or blueprint trade depot, where you trade in like 5+ of the same tech to gain a tech of your choice. Or, each time you gain a duplicate, it lowers the crafting cost of the tech, stoping at like 50% of total cost, then, once you have aa 50% discount, maybe actually improve the tech slightly each time you receive it again, as your understanding of the tech should grow and evolve as you gain more blueprints for it, since potentially the same tech could be built in a variety of ways based on resourses of the planet you receive the blueprint from......  Also, is there not an Omega level tech for all the techs, or, is that something I need to progress further to receive..... if I chose to never proceed does that mean I'll never be able to obtain that tech.... The totally random and mysterious nature of the game is frustrating.  Also, not a fan of the total lack of a map, or waypoints or anything other than using your scanner to add a white dot as a refference. Like, I find a huge mineral deposit, but, I run out of storage space, my choices are: Leave my ship and take the stupid long walk to a trade port, where I can only sell whats on my person, only to have to walk all the way back..., or, take my ship, sell far more stuff, and, potentially lose the site forever, as I can't set a waypoint to return too.",

I look forward to where this game goes from here.  As for my recomendation, I have to say that I highly recomend it to anyone who's into exploring. If you want a major plot or lots of direction, linear progression, look elsewhere, you'll not find it here. This is exploration at its finest.

It takes literal, real life HOURS to fly to a planet at a percentage of the speed of light. So you accelerate. 45 Minutes. Pulse Drive, 5 Minutes 10 Seconds. Everything is huge, planets are huge, systems are huge, the galaxy is supermassive on a scale that dwarfs our own galaxy. Gigaparsecs of real, tangible distance and adventure separate you from whatever is ahead of you. You can move as quickly or as slowly as you want.  Planetside, the creeping loneliness of hostile worlds is ever present. Youre alone, the universe denies salvation, but you have tools. Survival bites at your heels every step you take on the surface of a radioactive paradise world, or a beautiful tundra world, or a world that is 92% ocean. Creatures and other wildlife are abundant but can start to feel similar after a while, but thats hard to focus on when you are busy doing 10 things at one, scanning, mining, fighting and flying among others. The seemless transition from planetside to space will never, ever get old. You can help but pull back in your chair as your ship pushes through a thick atmosphere into space above.  After only two hours with No Mans Sky, it has shown me things I had never seen in any game before, or in real life. Thats a ♥♥♥♥ing win in my books, good job HG.",

Once I do that, I imagine there's not enough 'game' left in the game to hook me. But I'm already 15 hours in and not there yet.   I think for most people, this isn't a $60 game. It has an amazing foundation of technology, but the 'game' layer is unpolished and lacking.

If you have seriously high expectations surrounding this game, and expect all of the bells and whistles, I'd suggest maybe watching some gameplay and making your own decision then. That being said, here's the review:  Good game that has something that I think a lot of reviewers leave out: Atmosphere. From the sound design to the true randomness of the planets, the game has the lonliness of space down. It's extemely relaxed while still keeping you on your toes when you burn through the atmosphere of another planet.   Personally, I really like the entire sandbox feel of the game and appreciate that there are more straightforward paths if you want a bit of hand holding (or simply prefer the direct route). That being said, the game can feel daunting at first, and doesn't give much of a primer of the mechanics of the game, and prefers that you discover these things on your own. I love the feel of the universe and how you can completely screw yourself and then at the same time work out of that bind with the resources around you.  Pros: Extremely open-ended  Nice sound design  Decent graphics at the moment  Does a good job of tempering the difficulty that randomness can provide  Cons: Odd bugs and glitches  Upscaled from 720p, hopefully this gets patched ASAP  Can be confusing if you don't read  All in all, if you are looking for a game that is about exploration, give it a shot. If you are looking for something with a hardcore edge, this is not for you, unless you enjoy handicapping yourself.  8/10",

The textures are rather ugly honestly and the environments on planet lack detail in my opinion. Planets can feel empty and lifeless at times (Even the Class-M planets) - The combat and flight in this game is clunky. Not attrocious... but nothing really appealing. - The game is very grindy. Go the system A... Gather ressources to refuel and be on your way... Go to System B... Repeat the process. For some pleople, this might not be an issue. But be warn that NMS requires you to farm for ressources a lot... It is not optional.  - The life forms look cool at first, but you quickly notice the 'lego' nature of their procedural generation... Which can break the immersion at times. the combinations work for some creatures... but for some... It really looks silly and breaks the immersion of the game. - If you are looking for a space simulation like Elite and Star citizen. Don't bother with NMS. THe game is really arcady/simplistic by nature. It can be a good thing for some, but if you want a detailed simulation, NMS is not the game for you.  Overall, NMS is not a bad game. It's an 'OK' indy game, and while i definitly recommend it... It can't say that it is worth 60 dollars. This is a 20 dollars games.. at best... 30 dollars. But not more.  So my advice, wait for the game to go on sale. Once it does. get it (if you really... and I mean REALLY love exploration games), and you will get a good chunk of fun out of it. ",

The only stuttering I have had is when I initially enter a planets atmosphere, the game will freeze for a about half a second, probably because the engine is generating the terrain and such. It is not enough to bother me - beats loading screens.  My only gripe with the game is that the flight controls while in a planets atmosphere are uncomfortable. The game tries to assist you and keep you from flying into rocks and such, but it makes it seem like I don't have control of the ship. Sometimes I'm trying to turn and it doesn't seem to respond.  The way you interact with menu's and such is different from most PC games. You can tell it was designed in such a way that they could use the same menu's for PS4 and for PC. With that said, it is not badly done - it just takes a few minutes to get used to.  The performance and crashing issues will likely be fixed soon (they already have been for many people).

The trading system works well, if emeril or something like that is a comodity in a space station, then I can go to a bright, living planet and find whatever mineral or ore is needed for the space station and I can mine it with my multi-tool and sell it for high prices. The game is so good it's just that it's not for every body. Some people like playing games that are more high octane or more co-op. I have heard that the game does have many bugs and for some people it's unplayable because it crashes every time they load it up. I haven't had problems like that. Reddit does have a solution to it. What I would say is; 'It's a fun game that SHOULD keep you on edge for houndreds of hours, but unfortunately it isn't for everyone, and you are intitled to a refund. But I personally really enjoy playing this game.' 8/10 'Great game but not for everyone'",

Had to end explorer process plus a few others for luck to run this game smoothly on a buddy's ASUS 12GB-RAM/64bit Win10Home,i3-4170CPU@3.7GHz, Played from the moment it became available until it crashed eleven and a half hours later, one jump away from that black hole I planned to harness... :( I don't know why it crashed but now every time I load it up again it spawns me slightly underground as if it started on no clip then I fall to the centre of the planet, which isn't actually that far aaand it registers as underwater in an extremely toxic and radioactive lake, the planets have solid invisible cores so I can walk around until I drown or melt and the jetpack doesn't quite reach the ground from this purgatory. I havn't saved yet once so I've have to load an old autosave and accept the loss, most recent autosave puts me back several hours, and several hundred thousand currency units, oh well. Was fun for a while... Other glitches I've noticed: Sand deposits on barren rocky worlds have blocky, discolored edges where they meet other materials. sentinel drones often become lodged on buildings they clearly cannot detect when trying to hover over non-featureless 90 degree walls. Ignore mining beam cooldown when almost overheating by simply releasing the mining button then press again and cooldown will instantly complete, does not work in ship. Tips: blueprints can still be looted when inventory is full. I died ten hours in and found that your grave holds the loot you dropped on death. All those tall canisters that require a v1 pass near save beacons contain suspension fluid. Every habitat overrun with pulsating red plants contains the same ships log and the same component module. Fly high to go faster. Sentinel drones cannot look up and are severely limited in altitude as they are hovering not flying. tap deccelerate when in boost to 'slow down' to 1000-2000 ks, tap deccelerate again to slow to 100-150 ks. mineral deposits appear to be seeded and programmed to expand and convert ground until value is reached, in my experience mineral critical mass limit is always divisible by 250 in large deposits that break apart little by little.  Conclusion; collision detection, AI, random seeding predictability and respawning need work.",

I don't see what all the negative reviews are talking about. Yeah, I was hyped for this game long before its release, and I even preordered it - something I rarely ever do, as I'm one to wait for huge discounts on any purchase - and downloaded it on its launch date. With the overwhelmingly negative reviews and complaints about instability and poor performance it was receiving, I was horribly afraid that I'd invested in a mistake.   Nope, worked perfectly. No crashing, no stuttering.  It's quite possible that there may be issues experienced by some people out there - few games are perfect, let alone on their initial launch. However, I get the impression that a lot of the negative reviews came from impatient whiners who were predisposed to seeking an excuse to hate because 'omg it was delayed for three more days after six years of development', or because '$60 is outrageous for a game made by team of only a dozen', and that sort of audience thinks it hip to dislike that which is popular. But what do I know.  Anyway, no, I'm really impressed by this game, especially as it  did  come from a dedicated indie studio, the likes of which I greatly admire and wish to support and encourage further. Admittedly, this isn't even entirely 'my kind of game', as I'm not much into the survival/crafting/time-sink genres, but I do enjoy exploration - my primary draw to this project - and am super impressed by the technology that this game demonstrates. Furthermore, the visual style, attention to detail, and streamlinedness (is that a word?) are all commendable as well. For me, that's what made it worthwhile. For you, I recommend it if any of the above features in this paragraph appeal to you.  I hope I've done justice with my first review. =)  PS:  My thoughts during exploration ",

Furthermore, the achievments, there should be more for example for the senitenal one, i got that a little bit to quick i wish it was more grindy, like upto 500 sentinals and that you would get something special for completing it, like a part so people would want to complete it  Also, the giant sentinals have a bug at 4 stars, i figured out that you can just climb a giant mountain and they cant shoot you and will just run in place  However, why do items you sell for are cheaper than what you pay to buy them? doesn't make sense in such a galatical market  I hope there will be a future update covering like a certain diseased plaguing planets and some have to go and cleanse it otherwise it spreads onto robots and they start getting crazy and attempt to take over the world, but in my 13 hrs since launch it was an outstanding time of gameplay, couldn't be better.

            "review_text": "This review is mostly a recap of my experience so far.  I've spent 10 hours so far in game, spending all of it on just two planets (and the space station.) I discovered every creature on both planets, because that's what was fun to me, not to mention the sweet 200-300k reward for each planet.  The scale of the game is really one of the biggest draws of the game. (I know, the 18 quintillion thing has been repeated 18 quintillion times, but for good reason.) It definitely creates a sense of aw for me. I went into the game not expecting some deep space sim with deep combat, but an exploration game. If you don't like exploration games, this game is not for you. If you aren't the kind of person who sees a mountain in the distance and wants to go climb it, there won't be much for you in this game.  Many of the flora and fauna are lackluster, but I wouldn't really want a procedural generation that made them all epic screenshot fodder. I've found a couple cool plants and a few cool animals so far, including one bear-shaped animal with anglerfish-like lights on it's back. But I also found a cactus that is literally just a cactusy plain cylinder.  Oh, and one of my favourite mechanics is the way you learn languages. One word at a time. And when you speak to aliens of that race, you will only understand bits and peices. It makes for some interesting, alarming, and confusing interactions, such as the alien who greeted me by chanting 'death! death! death! death! death' followed by something I couldn't understand. Also I'm pretty sure I accidentally accepted a dowry to marry somebody's child. I might be engaged. I'm pretty sure that happened. We'll see if that turns up again I guess.  There are definitely optimization issues, and the negative reviews saying they can't load the game are completely fair. That hasn't been my experience, but I've encountered a few annoying but not game breaking bugs. I had a problem in the beginning with not being able to launch my ship, but a restart fixed it fine. Expect to have to close and relauch the game every few hours because of bugs, or in my partner's experience, what appears to be memory leaks.  Gameplay wise, there are some things I dislike. The space station designs are pretty much all the same on the inside so far. It's not a huge deal, but a minor dissapointment. Inventory management is very frustrating. I see reasons why, like trying to get players to go interact with NPCs at space stations more often to sell their stuff, to not make it a game of 'how many hundreds of stacks of iron can I get'. But still, you're either going to be throwing away a lot of things or interrupting your exploring to go liquidate your resources.  Another thing that is dissapointing, so far, is that the starter planets are, generall, kind of boring to look at. My first had neat wave/tentacle things all over, but it was all grey with few plants, most of which are cactuses. I've heard that the planets get more interesting and pretty as you progress though, so the increase in pretty planets may make progression feel rewarding.  The game is really chill too, btw. Don't let the hype make you think you're going to be on the edge of your seat. That's not a negative for me, but it isn't a gameplay style everybody is going to like.  In short, if you like exploration, I recommend this game. If you don't, skip it.",

            "review_text": "Alright, here we go. First off, PC issues... the only issue I've had with the game is after about 1-2hrs of continious play the whole game goes into a 'slow-mo' kind of like TiDi on 'Eve Online'. A quick restart of the game fixes the problem. Before you say its spec related I have 16GB of ram (game barely uses 6GB) and a GTX 960 card with everything fully updated. Other than that a few bugs here and there. Sometimes when you enter your ship on a planet it will bounce out into space... this has happened about 5-6 times in 14hrs of gameplay. I also discovered buildings that spawned half buried and I had to blast my way around to find the door which was inside a hillside. In that particular area the drones / sentinels glitched through the walls and floor and continued to attack me.  Vegitation and animals on planets do seem to have similarities with just a few color changes / mixups here and there but I've only been on like 4 diff planets and 2 moons. The caves all seem about the same.. literally. However, the planets do have their own unique features. The main thing that's boring to me is all of the buildings are identical inside and out with very little differences except for 'Monoliths' they seem to vary the most with different designs(still some repitition). The first time you talk to any alien entity they usually have something they want or a question / event and you get to choose what to do from there and depending on your choice will decide on what your given / learn / gain or lose rep. After that it's usually the same 3 options when you talk to them( health restore, shield, learn a new word, or they can gift you a small amount of a resource).   Earning money is a grind. Personally I found a moon with plenty of 'Emeril' so I would go and farm until I filled my ship inventory... with about 6 full slots you can get about 1 mil out of it all. I did find a nice 20 slot multi-tool just by helping a Rogue Alien that wasn't doing what he was supposed to. I lost a little rep but gained a nice weapon for free and already modded up for mining(very nice). So there is an example of your choices having a little impact to what happens.   Overall I think the game is O.K. A lot of people are complaining about being 'lost' or unsure what to do.. it's simple... EXPLORE until you find what you need or desire. It wasn't designed to spoon feed you quests nor give every player the same experiences (other than some grinding) and you don't have to grind if you don't want to.. but if you really want something bad enough you'll grind until you get it(thats any game). You will spend a lot of time just searching for resources that you will need to keep moving forward.  I feel the game has a good canvas to add to. Mainly needs more textures / layouts for buildings and stations and just maybe fewer aliens... I wasn't expecting to find an alien in almost every single building I visited. Some planets are full of buildings and outposts which make me feel like I'm not the first one there. They probably need to be spread out more. It feels like a big waste when I take off in my ship and fly for 5 sec and already see like 3 more buildings within eye sight. I mean does the planet need explored or should I just check in to every building and see what the aliens want or left behind? I actually started skipping a lot of buildings and searching for specific ones since each type looks identical.  Decent game. A lot of potential. Needs work.",

It's definitely a survival/exploration game so if you're into that it's very good. Definitely not an action packed shooter so if you want that, you should probably avoid NMS. I'm looking forward to playing this game more and discovering more about it, it does seem like I've only seen the tip of the iceberg.  Looks like other people are having issues so hopefully that is taken care of because I think this game is better than the scores so far, if the tech issues can be resolved.",

I also found that maxing the frame rate and turning off xsync seems to have helped with these issues.   As for the game itself, it does have a wide scope for exploration (at the time of me writing this Ive explored two planets, learn a few words, made several upgrades, all without gaining a rather important piece of tech that the game directs you toward). Its not perfect, by any means, and I can see it becoming rather repetetive in its current state, but for now, Im actually finding myself wanting to play, despite the graphical and gameplay flaws.  If you enjoy Minecraft and similar games, I would definitely recommend the game, although maybe not at its full price. I can see myself exploring for many more hours, and for me, its a perfect game for kicking back with a beer or two and relaxing, and taking in the scale of it all.",

Either way, patience will shortly sort you out. I think you can get all that it offers for lower prices elsewhere. Want an endless universe to trek about in at your own pace? Buy Elite: Dangerous, for half the cost. Want to play meter-filling-simulator 2016? Go buy literally any survival game. Want to just look at infinite planets in 1:1 scale? Go download Space Engine. For free. Want to look at eye-watering psychadelic colour schemes and randomly created mobs? Go buy Spore. No, seriously.   The controls are not much to brag about. You'll be doing a lot of running around, and the eternal insistence upon stamina meters in games will haunt you and drive you insane in this game, but on the flipside you have a jetpack that recharges itself. Flight is what gets me though. I do play a lot of flight sims, so I guess it's just the fact that they've simplified it compared to the genre standard that's putting me off. You can't pitch down much, for whatever reason. Your ship just kind of veers uowards again. And the roll control is like driving on ice, but the yaw is so overpowered you probably don't need to roll.   Certain things are intuitive, others are not. The way the game handles travel in spaceship is elegant, with automated landing sequences, fairly smart warp-jumping controls, you have one tool for everything, etc. And on the other hand, I literally had to Google 'how to craft' because the game decided to only show me the tutorial tooltips when it wanted to.   In short: Not a bad game if you're the right kind of person, but I'd argue that there are better games to scratch this particular itch. I will in the end say I recommend it, /if/ you enjoy repetitive survival and exploration gameplay, and /if/ the premium price tag isn't too much for you. Or if you're willing to wait for a price reduction, but like I said, if price is an issue, Elite: Dangerous exists.",

It was hardly a thing, from the very start it was deemed nearly impossible. So wether or not it gets fixed/put in the game it should not make or break the game for you. Also, the game is mostly exploring. Having fun seeing stuff, upgrading stuff, mining stuff and hop around thousands of planets. If that's something you enjoy, this game is for you. It's not Skyrim, Witcher 3, gameplay is fairly thin in and of itself but you can make this game enjoyable. That said, some more gameplay might be in the work as they said they want to get basebuilding in the game. Never buy a game for future features tho.

There is something really great about exploring new worlds and leaving the old behind. This is a game that I found calm and peaceful most of the time, with moments of survival and combat. Its almost entirely about seeing what's beyond the horizon, and not a whole lot else. This game will not appeal to everyone, and if you are looking for multiplayer of ANY kind, intense and gritty combat, or making a significant mark on the worlds you've left behind, this is likely not the game for you.

I chose frames obviosly and since playing the game there were some other functions in the game that I didn't particularly enjoy such as the milestones preventing you from shooting while they're up because I was in a firefight with about lvl3 sentinals and barely survived. The pre-order ship is great... but it sucks that I can't find many ships I find better than it. Also, besides the first planet I am yet to find one with a decent climate, all I find are hell holes, frozen hell holes, places with more gas in the air than a busy Taco Bell or a planet that rains acid. I finally see a water planet from above only to find it is an acid planet and there just happens to be a large amount of it.

The game clearly knows they're the same species, but it gets confusing when I try to name them: am I naming the whole species right now, or just the one animal, and what's so special about this individual and how can I find it if I go hunting later?

            "review_text": "As someone who has played alot of triple A games, I do have to say I am disappointed just a bit but not enough to hate on this game. Yea performance can be better and even with a GTX 980M 8GB, it stutters (not frequently but enough to notice) though it does mostly stay at 60 fps. This means that while my more powerful laptop card could run this mostly well, anything below that would probably run worse so keep that in mind.   Now here is where I might diverge from the main crowd on this game, I do actually like it though I deliberately turned down my hype for it before release. In short, it feels like a more colorful, varied, expansive version of Elite Dangerous that is single player instead of online. Longer story- Well I like the gameplay, I like the interconnectivity between land, air, and space. I like exploring these random and beautiful planets. Even though I know they're cobbled together like random puzzle pieces, the landmarks, animals, and atmosphere looks so convincingly unique that I can get immersed into the new worlds I discover. Also naming worlds is a nice touch, of course being a Star Wars fan, I name my planets after all the Star Wars ones, especially if they look similar to ones you saw in the movies. I like the grind a little bit because of the variety of resources you can find and mine and how you can use them for many different purposes. I realize alot of people still won't like that which is fine but it was alright for me-I've played much worse grindy games for this to bother me. I also like traveling to space stations, talking with (the one) npc there and seeing other AI ships docking and flying away, doing their own thing. I also like it when fleets warp into or leave your area, makes the universe feel lived in (though it could be imrpoved)  So the gameplay is decent, the performance is mostly stable (though it could be better), controlls are mostly fine, but now I'll go into the 3 big things that I think need to be put in the game in order to make it the game people dreamed of.  1st: More Player Agency: I know that one of the points of this game is to make you feel like an insect in the great cosmic scheme but then why does the developer constantly promote player choice and agency? Sure you can follow a main story and make little dialogue choices that can affect the main story or your reputation with factions but why not more? Like building your own base? I know they said they will develop something like this but I would've been fine if they delayed the game in order to implement something like that in. Like building a space station, building a land base, maybe specializing in trade, ship building for your own personal fleets, or exploration! That would be amazing! I mean if we could at least own a massive starship that could be explorable, that would be enough for me because you could consider that home but you can only pilot small fighter like ships which, despite the varied amounts you could choose from, is still disappointing.   2nd: Add more npcs on land or space bases: It is cool that you can see random ships flying in and out of bases, it really is, It does make the world more alive. And seeing the plant and animal life interact with each other on worlds is also pretty neat. But then why can't we see more frequency in NPCs on land or space stations. I mean on little outposts, ok I understand why there might be just one but on big space stations or big land bases? That seems really ridiculous and it might not have been so bad if the one alien you find there was actually doing things but they always sit in one place doing nothing but looking on their Ipad probably playing Candy Crush. Having more NPCs, not necessarily to talk to or interact with, but just working/ wandering around these bases would exponentially increase immersion for the better. Maybe have some NPC land parties exploring these unknow nworlds with you, giving you that sense that you aren't the only explorer out there and if you save them from animal attacks or something, your reputation with them increases! I don't know, this was quite noticeable for me and I would like to see imrpovement  3rd: Pardon my French but I have to emphasize how much this particular issue bugs me- *cough cough* *deep breath*-INVENTORY, THE ♥♥♥♥ING INVENTORY! Expand it, just please for the love of God expand this ♥♥♥♥ing inventory space. I understand you can't carry unlimited amounts of items but when the biggest goal here is to explore, then having only 9-15 inventory slots is just ridiculous! And it wouldn't be so bad if I could transfer that stuff to my ship from far away but you have to be within like 500 feet of your ship in order to transfer anything which is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. This is the main gameplay feature in No Man's Sky that drove me bonkers and still does. It needs to be expanded or remove the necessity to recharge so many different parts to our ship and exosuit. Like I said, I wouldn't be bothered by constantly refueling/repairing parts to my ship or suit but with such a poor amount of inventory space, that nuisance is amplified to ridiculous levels. This should be the easiest and most prioritized thing to patch. Devs, make it happen PLEASE! If you don't intend to patch any other big features in the future even though you said you would, at the very least, ADDRESS THIS THIRD POINT!  In conclusion, this game is mostly what it promised. Mostly, however much that means to you will vary but I feel that they delivered the core of what they promised and really just need to refine it....alot. I feel like they released this too early simply because of the unstable performance many users experience, the lack of immersion in certain areas, and the fact that there simply isn't enough player agency for this to truly feel like the epic player driven game the devs were stressing this would be. If they gave it another month or two, perhaps it would've ascended to a higher status but it feels like they took this thing out of the oven right when it was about to be finished but now is a bit undercooked. Don't get me wrong, No Man's Sky is a good game but it won't appeal to alot of people not just because of the type of genre they chose to approach but because what they already have here might not be enough for players to jusitfy a purchase even if it was heavily discounted. If they addressed each of the points I made along with making the performance more stable, I feel like this would absolutely be worth the 60$ asking price and to some, it still will be despite what's missing.  The devs could add a significant amount of features that could make this game what it should've been at release so I wouldn't be one of the people that looks at it, decides not to buy it , then ignore it for good. Keep this on your wishlist, see what progress the devs are making. Their attitude towards the gaming community I think is great. Not only have they promised to patch in features like base building, more trade options, ,etc but they would be delivering all major features FOR FREE. No dlc at all even for big features that could justify a few dollars extra of a purchase. I think that is commendable and should be respected.   I give it a 6.5-7/10",

Now onto my opinions.  Pros: -exploration and discovery: there is so much to explore and discover. Sure, some planets are dull and plain, but that's ok. There are so many other planets thaat if you dont like one, just leave it. DIscovering new animals is also cool. I have found so many weird creatures. I enjoy doing this. -mystery: what is atlas? what is at the center? what are the aliens actually saying? idk any of these answers. I am slowly working my way down the atlas path as well as slowly learnign the languages of the aliens. But I am excited to see what lies ahead in this game that I have yet to discover.  cons: -inventory management: your inventory is so small. you can upgrade it, but you have to find the upgrades, then pay for them. -early dependence on the galactic trade market: in order to craft some of the early game items, you are required to buy stuff from the galactic market instead of craafting. I used to think of item markets as shortcuts for items that you can craft on your own, but I guess this game will force you to buy stuff from the market until you find blueprints.  -so many seperate fuels: launch thruster require one fuel, pulse thrusters a different fuel, mining laser something different, life support some other stuff, etc. do you get the idea?  other: -it feels a bit like minecraft with space: you are going around exploring, mining, and crafting. with the upcoming update that will add in base building, it becomes a bit more like it to. hopefully they implement base building in a good way.

The game doesn't hold your hand, you find yourself are on a planet, and your ship is damaged. You need to repair and refuel the engines. You must explore the planet and mine the required materials to craft the required parts. Once repaired you're good to go. The controls are simple and flying the ship is nice and easy.  There is an in-game currency and galactic marketplace. The minerals found on the surface are worth a certain price, this price can go up and down, but the game shows the galactic average. Anything you mine or craft can be sold on this marketplace. With your profits you can buy minerals or parts from the galactic marketplace or you can approach NPCs and offer them money for their ships.  I can see why people find the game repetitive, but I enjoy the grind. I enjoy the exploration and the challenge to keep my ship fueled and in working order, I haven't explored the various in-game races and NPCs yet but I look forward to this. I have only visited 5 planets but each one has been different, some are full of lifeforms and others have no life but are full of valuable minerals but with hostile environments.   I love the management of resources and having to calculate what and how much I can carry on each excursion. I am just enjoying the game in general, and I can't wait to upgrade my ship. If you enjoy exploration and resource management I would recommend this game, if you are after fast paced action game then from what I have seen this isn't the game for you.    Performance  I am running the game on a Pentium G3258 3.2Ghz dual core, 8GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 950 with Windows 10.   On high setting graphics setting, with max field of view at 720p the game runs at a steady 30fps with no issues. If I turn the resolution up-to 1080p the frame rate starts to fluctuate, between 24 and 28 fps, it turns to a steady 30fps if I change the settings to graphic settings to medium.   I hope helps.",

            "review_text": "Most important thing to note about this game is it has a very specific need for hardware compatibility, so here's my build: Nvidia GTX 970 FTW PLUS - Drivers are 368.81 (7/14/2015) - Highly compatible driver with the most games Intel i7 2700k quad-core @ 3.5ghz If you don't have a nice CPU, terrain loading will be very slugging. If you do not have either a 'decent'(even a low-end) Nvidia Graphics Card or a newer AMD, you will not be to play at all. I think all of the issues with drivers not being provided have been solved so not going to go into those details.  Compatibility seems to be the #1 reason this game gets down-voted but since I've been able to play from the start, let me give you some details on why this game is great, and what needs work... You start out with a broken down ship, and have to go look for resources. Planets vary in which resources are available and what the environment is like(extremely cold/hot/toxic, or if you're lucky.. earth-like), but it seems a guarantee that when you start, your planet is new-user friendly and contains all the needed resources to get your ship into space and maintain your exo-suit's life support and environmental protection. The game leaves out a few details here and there that you learn about later in play that are affected by early-play, so if you haven't started yet.. or... well, make sure you choose to follow the Atlas story line! It's extremely important that you do. It gives you access to unique features of the game such as the 'Atlas Card v1' which can unlock certain doors, and storage containers. Most notably, the v1 card opens a door at every space station that is guaranteed to contain a device you may use to upgrade your exosuit's inventory space and occasionally has other various devices in it(No clue what lies in the rooms beyond that as you need a higher-access Atlas Card for them). If you have started and didn't make that choice.. you can reset by (most easily uninstalling and reinstalling the game, and disabling cloud synchronization. With that summary out of way, the only things negative I've found is that when buying ships or multitools, you are given no refund based on the value &amp; contents of your current ship/multitool.. You can however dismantle items and move resources over when trading your ship(before accepting the purchase). And the other big negative is the limitation on inventory space, you start out with a tiny exosuit inventory, a tiny spaceship inventory, and a 5 slot multitool... it's enough to get started but I guess the big goal of the game is to get a bigger inventory. I also hear that there's a race to the center... anyway, if you can confirm your system is compatible with the game, then by all means, the purchase is worth it!",

There are games way smaller than this that take up 60gb. This is another game that could of blown the door right of the hinges. It had so much potencial but it didnt give it its all.

In scopee, the game offers more than any of us will ever see, and that is amazing once you start to play. From your starter planet, on, you start to realize that you will never see everything a planet has to offer. Then you finally launch into space, and once again you realize this. From pirate battles in space, to sentinels attacking you endlessly this game is both calming and a thrill.

The game is good, it's visually stunning enough to keep my eyes from going square, it runs smooth, there's no loading screen except for the first one, there's no objective, except getting to the core.

            "review_text": "The greatness of this game can be easily lost on impatient people, but for those willing to give it some time, this game will not disappoint. I now understand what the creator means when saying it is a game of moments, and will share with you one such moment. The moment that hooked me. A moment in space and time that only I witnessed, that will replay and resonate with me over and again.   It was near the early stages of the game, I was in the midst of exploring some planet in order to find some zinc to use to build my first hyperdrive fuel canister. I do not know what zinc looks like, and haven't the slightest clue where to find it, so I land my ship on some undiscovered planet and start trekking. Scanning everything I see, I ponder what form zinc might actually take in this alien land. Is it an element? a mineral? Its used in pimple creams, might it be white? I think its a metal, maybe its in some kind of rock? Where do you find rocks, in caves? Oh, what ho over yonder, A CAVE!!  Jetpacking towards the mouth of the cave, I spy a sentinel patrolling, but its passive, and I haven't been disturbing the wildlife, so I pay it no mind and begin spelunking. Deeper I penetrate, finding gold and plutonium, carbon and platinum, but no zinc. After scanning and searching for nearly ten minutes, I decide this must not be the cave I was looking for, so I turn to depart. On my way out to the entrance, I decide to scan the local plants, get some info for my logbook, and maybe find some useful something-or-other, when I spot an odd looking bulb.  The bulb could not be scanned, but can be interacted with, how odd. Upon closer inspection, it seems that there must be something inside it. I press the interact button, and lo-and-behold, it splits apart like a giant banana, revealing some sort of intergalactic space pearl!! The space pearl has a value of roughly 27,000 spacebucks, and there are about 5 more bulbs all nearby, SCORE!!! But alas, I have no room in my inventory, so I start clearing items, recharging consumables, transferring, and sorting stacks to make as much room as possible without wasting any of my valuables, and finally have created 6 open inventory slots, so I begin looting.  Upon picking up the first pearl, my computer chimes in with a warning that sentinels have been deployed. That was fast. Wait, what was that, computer? Elite sentinels, you say? Well that escalated quickly, but I've probably still got some time before they appear, right? Wrong. Emerging from the mouth of the cave, I see the normal drones, followed by a few vicious mechanical dogs. No biggie, dogs have melee atacks, I'll be fine, I think. Not these dogs though, they've got dual laser cannons strapped to their heads. They only stop chasing to fire at me, and are very quick to pick up pursuit once again. I have no recourse but to flee, as my sheilds start depleting at a very rapid pace. Luckily I have an extended sprint perk that I picked up a few stops ago, and boy am I glad I had it installed, because I make it back to my ship just as my sprint wears out. Huffing and puffing, I climb into the cockpit, with my sheilds at roughly 10%, I slam on the W key to take off as the cockpit door SLOWLY clicks into place, and its off into the sky with me, laughing the whole way as I point the ship straight up and breach atmosphere.  Crossing into the cold emptyness of space, I see the local space station in the distance. Safe at last, I think; or was I? Excuse me, computer, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just say that my cargo is being scanned? By whom? Hostile, you say? Targetting me? Why? I'm just a lowly space vagabond, trying to get fuel for my hyperdrive. What have I got that is so valuable? Oh, right, the intergalactic space pearls. And thus begins my first space dogfight, I'm pretty sure I'm going down. Bobbing and weaving, I think back to what I know about space dogfighting, and the only voice I can hear is Peppy from Starfox, telling me to do a barrel roll. Frantically, I roll, and aim for an asteroid feild, hoping that the rocks will smash my pursuer's ship to smithereens. I speed up, and flip on him, track him, and let loose with my photon cannons, scoring some hits. I take heavy fire head on as we pass each other, but I am quicker on the turn around this time, catching my assailant mid bank as he is crossing my T. His starboard side is riddled with laser fire, and he spins out of control, only to explode in a fiery death a few seconds later. Acting purely on instinct I point myself at the space staion, and engage impulse speed as fast as I can, watching my arrival time click down. These are the slowest 8 seconds of my life.  I reach the station coming at a slight angle to the entrance, but I make the curve, and coast to a stop in the landing bay. My cockpit opens, and I emerge, victorious. I push my keybard drawer into my desk, spin my office chair around, and fall to the carpeted floor of my apartment, nearly hyperventillating with the adrenaline rush. I crawl on hands and knees into my kitchen, pull myself up with the refridgerator door handle, and drink 16 oz. of water in one gulp. I eat a few cheetos, and replay the events in my mind. I begin adding up the profit I will have made from the sale of the space pearls, it should put my bankroll up to around 500,000 spacebucks, halfway to that new ship I wanted. Would it be worth it to go back to that cave? Oh, no! I have no idea where it is!!!  Yet I will return to the planet's surface. Not for the fame, not for the glory, not for the women, and not for the spacebucks. No, I will return for still another reason. I MUST return, because I never found that zinc I was looking for in the first place.",

I've just played 5 hrs straight and really enjoyed the experience so far however I have just logged out into the Steam comments and I'm really really surprised to see all of the issues, thats gutting and I totally get everyones anger, its really letting down what could be a fantastic experience  For whats its worth I'm playing its on a laptop with a 980m - things do get a bit glitchy when flying just above a planet or coming into land but on planets and in space its been running ok for me  Really hope they patch this soon and sort it out so we can all enjoy the game for what it really is  ",

Upon loading the game I was greeted by an assortment of different animals on the deserted planet that I was spawned on. I quickly found small statue that would teach me a word of the local language. I was able to repair my ship rather quickly and search the local area for an outpost. I was soon greeted by an alien race that was just as much savage as they were friendly. I have continued to comunicate, trade and learn the language of this speecies that inhabit the solar system where I was spawned. We have become, in a sense, allies with a generous amount of aggression in the middle somewhere. While the game is quite limited, I feel far from alone in the universe and love seeing the day to day life of the local inabitents. I also love out the species stays the same across the few planets in the system but the enviourment changes dramatically. I will continue my quest twards the center of the universe in the hopes of meeting more friendly species.   This is the kind of stuff I was looking forward to, a nice, friendly experience. I have been able to do everything that I wanted to, and more, when it comes to gameplay. I understand that the performance issues have really changed the experience of the game for alot of players but for me, It reminds me of an indie launch rather than a full title game. When I am playing Rust, if I see any of the same performance issues, I am not even slightly surprised. I find solace knowing that they will eventually address the performance issues. If you are on the fence about the game, I understand, but I suggest watching Firefly and giving the Dev's some time to put out the fires.   By the way, I am able to play this game on high settings without any crashing issues. My system config is as follows:  CPU: AMD FX-8350 MOBO: MSI 970 GAMING RAM: 16GB DDR3 1866 GPU: XFX R9 380X DD XXX 4GB HD/SSD: CRUCIAL M4 512GB  I will update my review once they address the perfomance issues.",

This game if played how I believe the designers intended has the potiential to be a 100+ hour game, The scenery is just breath taking. I rarely see this in games.   There is a lot of crafting, and rescource farming in this game but it makes since (at least to me). However, once you get used to the crafting and inventory system (which took me about an hour to completely understand) it becomes a breeze.   For those people who like combat and not really rescource farming, NO WORRIEs, your can buy the recouses at an Outpost and killing the Sentinels can be quite profitable. I have killed the roaming ones and the Dog looking ones both dropped Titanium and a debris container. The debris container yeilds a Coontrol Chip which sells for about (11k to 14k units) or an upgrade for your Multi-tool.   Interacting with the Aliens can provide interesting results. One just gave me one piece of Antimater, which is valued at about a Mil last i saw, just for giving him some rescources i found.   That said, this game is NO where near perfect, there are several places where it can be improved. But i am sure that will come with time.

Going on to the good points...  Wow. I wish my family would leave me alone to play.  Sounds and music are top drawer and graphics are good considering all the 'maths' going on under the hood.  Gameplay is for the most part smooth and learning new things is great.  I'm one of those that only watched the officially released vids and some of the vids from cobra TV.

I claimed it in the beginning before the game objective told me how to craft a hyperdrive (the pre-purchase starship already has a hyperdrive) , then the game skip this objective and i never learned how to craft it that's mean i got struck in another system and never know how to refuel the hyperdrive . That's mean i have to start a new game. Overall of the game is good pretty much give me a great experince to explore the universe.

PVP and a modern type of multiplayer. 2. straight line start to endgame path. 3. ability to play through from start to finish in 30 hours of game play. 4. Base building. 5. Multi system trade ability. 6. Clan / Guild support. 7. Misc amall stuff.  What it does have:  1. 100% open world. 2. Unique customazation of ship and equipment. 3. No huge zerg ganker guilds. 4. No path is the wrong path. 5. Every planet / system is unique. 6. Enjoy this place for you will never see it again adventure. 7. Totaly awesome and crazy Flora and Fauna. 8. A mulitplayer experance like no other. 9. No end Game, Like life you continue till your end, not the games end. and  10. Offers a very unique prespective on gaming that many have over looked or shuned.  All in all I would recomend No Mans Sky to every player that is tired of the statice quoe in the gaming world. For players that are looking for a breth of fresh air and a game style that while at first glance feels and looks weird, is in reality a much larger and complicated place to be.   The one Request I would have is that the AI should be 10X harder to kill and that there be no respawn, If you die you start over from scratch. Very much worth the $60. I paid.   Gibb",

            "review_text": "So I guess the big question is whether or not this is everything everyone ever dreamed of in a space exploration game or if this hype train, like so many others, has run off the rails and crashed into the perennial wall of gamer disappointment and the answer is probably more with the latter than the former. HOWEVER, just because this isn't the absolute epitome of a wet dream for everyone that's ever wanted to pilot their own intergalactic vessel into the distant expanse doesn't make this a bad game by any means. I don't think any game could have really lived up to the level of hype that this game built and quite honestly I went into this game ignoring the majority of it because people have this overwhelming tendency to want to make a things grander in their head than what they actually are. With that being said what does this game have to offer and what is it lacking??  Pros - This game is ENORMOUS in scale - Each planet is unique enough that it makes exploring them enjoyable for the most part - This game is absolutely stunning to look at, there's a grandness but also a simplicity to its graphics that is extremely pleasant to the eye. - Exploration is definitely encouraged as the more things you discover and name the more money you make which can be spent on various different things from new space ships to resources for those who don't feel like gathering them. - Equipment can be upgraded by finding new blueprints or interacting with the aliens at outposts and space stations - There are some elements of danger to keep you on your toes. Some planets have hostile or passive drones, some planets have acidic atmospheres or extreme temperatures and there are also roving gangs of pirates looking to steal resources which breaks the monotony of space travel.  Cons - The game is extremely repetitive. Pretty much gather resources so you can upgrade to make it to the center of the universe...that's pretty much the point. Much of the flora on every planet is similar as well, the real unique aspect is the animals and some of the different location types.  - Resources are extremely easy to gather and the majority of your equipment is run off of common isotopes that are found on EVERY single planet regardless if it says resources are sparce. This makes survival a bit TOO easy when you can simply shoot a few trees and refuel your life support or shoot a few drones or various other metals to refuel your suit to keep out extreme temperature. - Combat is wonky. Space combat in particular is probably the worst in my opinion. Most ships that fight you are faster than you which makes catching up with them and shooting them down a pain, and with super sensitive controls it feels like I'm trying to fight someone while slipping on a block of ice which is a shame because bands of marrauding ships are probably one of the most interesting aspects of the combat system. I found myself dying to space ships more than anything. Drones are also pretty easy to defeat and serve as a threat mainly to someone who doesn't have much in the way of upgrades. - The language system is interesting but terrible in execution. I mean I get that they didn't want people to learn a language right away and I think it adds a layer of immersion to meet aliens you can't communicate with clearly BUT after close to ten hours I'm literally almost 0% closer to knowing what any particular person is saying despite unlocking multiple relics and monoliths because most of the monoliths I unlock have uncommon words that are almost NEVER used in the virtually simple dialogue of the aliens. It reminds me too much of the language system in FF10 and that's not really a good thing.    Overall If you're looking for the best of everything you won't get it here. This game tries to be a jack of all trades but ultimately masters none BUT honestly despite that I still like this game. I find the exploring and traveling extremely cathartic whether I'm checking out a pristine body of water on a lush green planet and documenting its varied animal life or searching through old colonial buildings destroyed by some odd plant life. I think this is the kind of game where mileage may vary, some people will see it as too repetititious with not enough variety on each planet BUT I found that even if I visited 4 planets in a system that were alike it made it that much better when I found a moon of a planet in a neighboring system teeming with a variety of creatures and colors. Is it worth the full retail $60??? probably not, it's more of a $30 to $40 type of game in my opinion BUT I would say when it goes on sale give it a shot but don't go into it with the impression that it will live up to even half the hype people created, examine the game for what it is and not what you think it should have been and you might enjoy yourself.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: take a bad space shooter, a bad space trader, and mix it with a bad survival game to come up with a surprisingly OK game that has tremendous potential.   The non-ADHD crowd please read on:  + It's a great concept, and nicely executed. Hat's off to the developers who managed to pull this off: no (or rather: well concealed) loading time + Incredible scale. Yeah, a couple of thousand stars would have sufficed, and after a million it becomes meaningless.. 18 Quintillion? Overkill, But in a good way.  + Performancewise it's OK - I'm running it on an iMac in Boot Camp, and everyone knows Macs are %ç@#! for gaming. Still don't understand some folk's fixation on fps, though. A good game is good, as long as it's fps are bearable, and no amount of fps can make a crap game good. + this game has potential, more so than many others I have played in a long time  The game looks nice. Cartoonish in many respects, especially off-planet, but still nice. But then, I guess, we get into the decidedly mixed bag territory: gameplay, or rather: the substance beneath it. What do you expect, what do you want from a game. I'm an average guy - I want to be entertained. I expected a mix between Minecraft (survival type) and Elite:Dangerous (space combat/trader). The sad thing is - I got it.   Like when you describe someone a mix of Einstein and Schwarzenegger, it's the mix that makes or breaks it. An in this case, the game got something along the lines of Einstein's muscles, and Schwarzenegger's linguistic prowess. The space sim part is downright apalling. I'm aware that this game is designed for Console controls, but something that handles this badly is disappointing. Also (and I'm decidedly trying NOT being silly arguing how 'realistic' this is), I'm somwhat put off by the depiction of space flight and scale. In NMS, the planets float around, close to each other like large meat balls in a thick soup of asteroid spaghetti. IMHO, E:D has it right with immense stretches of nothing and a few gigantic balls of rock strewn in-between. The space stations are cartoonish, with (what appears to me) identical lay-out (this includes the poted plants) and nothing to do. Well, at least you can get out of your ship and walk about, so take that, Elite! Space combat is not something I enjoyed, which is probably due to the bad handling characteristics of the space craft, and its next to non-existing configuration options (if this was a space shooter, you'd have oodles of weapons, shields, sensors and other stuff). So OK, it's not a space shooter. Trading, on the other hand, is abysmally implemented (you have no storage to speak of, no market inteligence, and since the game continually drives you forward to the center of the galaxy, you don't exploit trading routes). So it would seem that space travel is not the focus of this game  Then there is the survival aspect. The core game loop of NMS is coming down to a planet, gather resources, explore an anomaly or structure, build some stuff to sell or re-fill your systems, leave planet, warp to next system, loop. The variety of theplanets is great, but after a couple of hours, they all blend into each other. The problem here is that the alien planets are all derived from an algorithm, and after a while you see the formula, no longer the result. Yes, the things are beautiful to look at. Winged cows are funny. Essentially, though, all this alieness derives from the same formula. But is *IS* entertaining, and I'll give full marks for that.  You go down-planet to harvest resources with some kind of mining gun, and use this to destruct the environment. This part is extremely well executed and stays fresh all the way. I wish Minecraft had such a tool. But here's the missed opportunity: NMS's goal is to get to the center of the universe, so you don't stay on any of the planets. I think NMS could have greatly profited from ditching the 'ST:VOY' premise (which killed that series for me) in favor of allowing you to build a base. Because although everything is there, it's not. Currently it's Minecraft without the crafting part. Great promise, though. I hear the developers are thinking abot adding base building, so here's hoping.  Some people habe criticized Elite: Dangerous as 'a mile wide, an inch thick'. NMS currently seems somewhat thinner. It's not a space shooter/trader. But it's also not a Minecraft type of game. Einstein's brawns, I'm afraid.  Then again, I've had fun playing NMS, and even though I feel that the space shooter (which I somehow thought it would be) is likely a complete write-off, the Survival part has a chance to become nice one NMS adds base building: Build stuff, fly to other planets to get tech and rare materials, and finally, add multiplayer (that was left on the cutting floor, it currently doen't work).

No issues what so ever accessing the game btw. Furthermore, the game runs smoothly on my somewhat dated system. Now, the sense of exploration is unreal. Highly recommended. The scale exceeds the fairly high expectations I had. Other than the interface, which is frankly awful, other game systems are actually well polished. Do not expect a great deal of story or a variety of things to do. The core of it is exploration and resource gathering and trading. If that is to your liking, you will love this game. I found myself exploring a large cave system to a point I had to backtrack in order not to be lost in its vastness. Planets are absolutely huge, I was not expecting them to be this large. I wish that the game would give you more detial on them such as composition of the athmosphere, size, ets. Finding a planet which is dead but then finding it is rich in expensive resources is a moment that is hard to forget. I have now made it to another star system (galaxy map needs some work for sure). I chose to warp to a system with 5 varied planets and 1 moon.  ",

Before I started playing I updated the drivers for my gtx 970. I got in the game and the menu with the stars seemed to be stuttering frequently. I got into the game and I was getting about 30 fps. Well I went into options and I turned shadows to low (I don't care about shadows in any game tbh.) I also raised the max fps to 90. Now I get a 60 fps with it occasionally dipping down to 55 fps. The biggest fps drop I encountered was when I stood next to a huge deposit of minerals and used my local scanner. This causes the huge deposit to light up like a Tron themed Christmas tree. That fps drop would go down to about 35-40 fps for a few seconds.   I Notice some stuttering occasionally but it was definitely playable for me.   I encountered my first crash to desktop after playing for about 10 hours.    The gameplay seems like it could get really repetitive and kind of a grind feeling. This is definitely not a shooter like cod or a space fighter game like x-wing vs tie fighter. It's just a chill exploration game.   The price is pretty steep to be honest. I like the game but I think $30-$40 would have been ideal. I suspect Sony making it $60.   I think the game works as single player but I would really like to explore the galaxy with my friends.",

It was EXCITING when I rose off the ground for the first time, I took to the sky with a smile, although I dislike the awkward mouse/keyboard flight controls and the ship's inability to get close enough to the ground to land manually (I prefer the flight sim approach!), and you should have seen the grin on my face when I turned the ship skyward and shot for the stars! That visually incredible sensation of hurtling through space at a million miles an hour, watching the planet I had called home for a full day-night cycle...knowing I'd never see it again, was probably the most emotive experience I've had from a game this year. It was everything I had hoped Destiny's ship mechanic would be.  I'm 25 hours in, or therabouts, at the time of writing this...still searching for some important 'Passes' that let me access locked doors and the goodies behind them. For 25 hours i've been staring these doors down and walking away empty-handed (the explorer in me is in agony!). It's disappointing that these 'Passes' are so difficult to obtain (or do they just take AGES to find thanks to RNG? Also a cheap tactic IMHO).   I recommend referring to the wiki whilst playing this game...sparingly. As much as I prefer to learn a game's ins and outs without external help, a few little things like where to find some minerals and what certain crafted products do can't hurt. The game seems very stable alt-tabbing between it and a web browser. I daresay I'd have returned the game if it was anything as terrible at alt-tabbing as say Skyrim or Mirrors Edge. I can guarantee sci-fi nerds will either love or hate the game's art style. I see BSG/Star Wars in the ship designs, a lot of Mass Effect and Destiny in the Monolith/Atlas stuff...there's even a bit of the Half Life 2's citadel core in the Atlas Sphere design. Overall though, the game seems more a mashup of other things rather than a game of its own. NPCs are Morrowind-esque, they just stand there and give you dialog boxes. To be expected with this genre of game? I would have liked a little more substance there. There was that one funny moment when an alien warrior exchanged nudes with me and bam, suddenly I was betrothed to it, so there was that. The game does a good job of making you feel like you've genuinely stumbled across a galaxy full of sentient creatures with their own cultures, languages, and all the barriers of misunderstanding that brings. You may find yourself enjoying the quest to discover new words; each word learned can lead to a better understanding of their emotions, their struggles, their trade deals, it's fascinating in that regard.  But now the bad... I have to admit I would have liked it if it weren't so big. If we were given one single open galaxy to explore, and the ability to commune with other players on space stations (think Destiny's Tower social server system) to trade/interact with each other. Imagine if we were given a Mass Effect style galaxy map and we could see hotspots of activity that are actual players streaking through the galaxy toward the centre. I guess that's another idea for another game, some other time... I can respect that instead of an MMO, they took the Journey approach in the sense that the game is 'online' and you are sharing a universe with other people! One of the things i enjoyed the most about Journey was the fleeting touch of wordless communication between players. If you just happened to be in the same place at the same time, there you both were, and it was glorious.   Sadly this game is too big, too expansive, for me to ever hope to meet another real player. The Starbound player in me wants to jump on a server with a group of friends and go exploring the infinite universe together. Every time I stood on the planet's surface hacking away at plutonium shards and hear an engine overhead, I looked up with hope, but alas it's not that type of game. They said we'd theoretically be able to see other players coming and going from trading posts around the planets. I now understand what they meant by theoretically: they mean it's possible, but likely never to happen.  If exploration is your kind of thing, the procedural generation doesn't get old too quick. The worlds are genuinely incredible and space is immensely enjoyable to swirl around in, dodging asteroids, blasting them open for fuel... I still like this game, I still listen for the engines and look up just in case that ship is flying erratically, desperate to wrestle with the clumsy flight controls in order to land beside me. There are no gestures in this game, but if somehow we find ourselves on a planet together, you'll see me waving in spirit.",

Probably not in the most conventional way, since this game triggers the crap out of my OCD's both in a good and negative way that its noticable. I can see why the reviews are mixed, why half the people are hating itand why half like it. This game is a mixed bag of stuff. Its very Spore like but at 1000 times Spores scale in terms randomly generated worlds and creatures. It is repetitive in its basic ideas, yet its still rewarding in many ways. NMS is actually quite educational and keeps the mind sharp. It does show and teach you a bit about the periodic table of elements and what entities, living or not, they come from. Which ever planet you start on or explore, you'll learn (not you personally, but your character) faux alien languages word by word, very similar to how you learn the Al-bhed language in Final Fantasy X letter by letter, except more vastly. You also solve different kinds of puzzles from math/algebra patterns to word phrases. Most are pretty simple, at least to me. As I meantioned my OCD above as well as having ADD/ADOS, the inventory and resource gathering is the really obnoxious part, especially with how you are limited on what you can carry. By limited I mean youll have to sacrifice resources (delete them) if you need to carry/farm another the repair/craft/reload your exo/ship/tool. But! If you figure out the pattern of how you want to play, then its less of a hassel but still remains tedious. I hate the 'Destiny' inventory system, especially how you can carry more than you can store in your ship for a long while till you find better ships.  Im not going to list pros or cons because I feel it would probably be to biased. The only thing I will say is that just because this game has 18+ Quintillion randomly generated planets, it doesnt justify the $59.99 price tag. This should've had a $39.99 price tag at most, especially being an indie kickstarter title that made tons. I wasnt part of the kickstart or even a preorder purchaser. Besides the price point, I am enjoying the game. Just remember, its not for everyone.  **TIPS** Stay on your starting planet as long as you can endure it. Dont waste your time and resources adding upgrades to your ship or tool as they are not transferable to any ship or tool you wish to upgrade to.  Just collect the blue prints until you are satisfied with whichever ship/tool you found or bought that has a lot of slots in it, then go resource hunting for the upgrades. Hunt for resources for 1 or 2 upgrades at a time or if you're OCD with ADOS like me you'll be over clutter and not want to get rid of anything.  You have less than 0.0001% chance in ever bumping into another player, but is possible!",

I do admit that I'm one of the older gaming crowd that doesn't give a toss about the fps as long as the gameplay is fine, and for the most part it is. It was a bit of a rocky start at first because there aren't a lot of directions or explanations of what is going on, but about 30 minutes into the game I had figured out most of the basics. Finding some of the rarer resources can be a pain, especially when all you want is more antimatter to make hyperdrive fuel, but I suppose that's all part of the game. I honestly spent most of my first couple hours just wandering about on foot, scanning all the lifeforms and mineral deposits. It must be fun because I didn't even realize how much time had passed until I looked at my phone. It would be nice to actually meet people, and I'm seeing posts that indicate that was a lie but honestly, I've had my fill of online multiplayers where I get 'graped' by more dedicated (ie. people without real jobs or social lives) players so that I can't get a good start in unless I beg some guild or group to let me join them.

I notice textures load in over time, as I explore foward I find that the world (at least the one I am in) is pretty flat and seems a bit empty. So I continue on, collecting materials and sorting out what I wan to keep and throw away, I eventually find abandon structures, and some with other alien lifeforms. As I have progressed so far, I am finding easier ways to gather materials whether through upgrades or just knowing what plants or rocks give what. As I help out the other aliens as well as trade with them I then find myself with far more knowledge about my environment as well as the game.

If you're looking for an overarching story, branching story paths and multiple endings (I'm assuming), this isn't your game.

If you're looking for something that is unique, then this is your game.   Admittedly, there are some launch foibles. I have *not* had the game crash once, not once. I have, however, had some graphical glitches and frame-rate issues, a lot of camera jumping. It is highly likely these issues will be addressed, and quickly. Everyone attacking Hello Games here needs to have a good long look at themselves - look at what they've accomplished with a small team! They will sort these issues, quickly, and why? Because they believe in the game and they look after their gamers. There were bound to be launch issues, it was inevitable. Expecting otherwise was just unreasonable.   Listen, for those of you on the fence, read my second and third paragraphs. See what you're after. If you take the leap, or if you wait for the sales, you will be enriched by the experience in this game. That first planet you see? That's yours. All of it. The creatures were generated by code and you're the first to see the result. That sunset is for your eyes alone, for now. I can't convey quite strongly enough - this game is a marvel, if you can forgive certain preconceptions.

            "review_text": "I'd like to start off by saying that I don't think I am one of the unlucky customers that is having issues with performance. When I first started the game, it seemed a bit shaky. However, once I changed the FPS Settings a bit and the map had a minute to generate, things ran very smoothly. Therefor, keep in mind that this review is from the perspective of someone without many of the issues that has plagues other players.  Now, I'll begin with the games opening sequence. I found that immediately throwing the player into the world without providing them with an opportunity to tinker with settings was a double-edged sword. On one hand, this cinematic opening experience allowed players to become more immersed in the game. Instead of letting the players' brain get switched into the 'this is a game' mode that settings tend to do, the game forces you into the opening sequence while the player's brain is still in the 'this is exciting as hell' state of mind it usually is when you run the game for the first time.  On the other hand, I can imagine that cinematic opening experience could be ruined quite easily if the game is running at 5 frames per second because the player hasn't optimized the graphical settings (although that player probably shouldn't have bought the game in the first place then). This is only made more frustrating when you do get the chance to tinker settings and you get a message saying you need to restart the game for those changes to take place. I understand that this is likely implemented for a reason, however that does not change the fact that it is frustrating.   Now we move onto the actual gameplay. Putting the technical quirks to the side, this game is gorgeous. It is not every day that so early on in a game, you can fly up a hillside and be left speechless by digital landscape complete with starship souring overhead and weird bipedal turtles awkwardly trotting in a field. Joking aside, this game truly is breathtaking. Even on the ugliest of planets, the color scheme manages to balance nicely and the somewhat almost cartoony art style masks the comically flat grass textures well.   However, there are times when you are really trying to progress in the game where you begin to wonder if maybe a bit too much time was put into the visuals and not enough was put into planning out the player's experience. An example of this is the plant life. Countless times you are drawn long distances to inspect a pretty glow only to find that it's just another source of coal. In games like this, it is better to provide a concrete way of telling if a resource is worth their time or not. It is not sources of coal that should be pretty and eye-catching but rather sources of rarer materials (I can't name any because I haven't really found any yet, not eye-catching enough).   Similarly, the game manages to throw just enough information at the player at once for that player not to be able to comprehend everything. Usually that information is just a menu or two away but the player shouldn't have to look something up when it was in their face 15 seconds ago. This translates into the crafting system as well, the same problem of too much information causes the player to miss instructions on simple tasks like crafting. It took me way too long to figure out how to craft the materials to repair my launch thrusters.   Believe it or not, all that I just complained about are actually pretty minor things. Once the player experiments and figures out what they need to on their own, they are off to the races. In a way, the way the player unintentionally has to figure things out on their helps to give that player a sense of freedom that really drives to beauty of this game home. There is a great sense of accomplishment when you figure out how to travel around a planet faster and a great sense of relief when you find out the hard way that you can smack into the asteroids.   In the end, when you get past the quirks and rocky launch of No Man's Sky and put in the time get learn the basics, playing the game becomes a blast. I would recommend this game to anyone so long as I can offer them my services as some kind of tech support when they need it.",

I will say though, a friend who played on PS4 recommended that I explore the first planet I land on thoroughly to 'git gud' and understand the game dynamics, and I feel like that was the right decision to get into it all.   I think the part that is really interesting to me is just the sheer number of NPCs and weird little interactions throughout the planets. Yeah, I think there are certain repetitive elements to the game, but I think some people have underplayed that there are very surprising elements that pop up frequently. It would be cool if later they added more variation to planet physical properties like gas planets and things like that, but for day 1 I'm very impressed.   Would I say it's worth the 60? Yeah, but I feel like I was the intended audience from the beginning. It's sort of like the Minecraft for people that get bored playing minecraft and want something that is more of an open ended adventure than a limitless sandbox. It's an extremely meditative experience and forces you to think about what you want your role in this universe to be. I'm extremely excited to see how things are updated in the future and I think this would be a game that will actually benefit from future DLC (especially since they didn't open with a season pass or anything dumb like that).",

Maybe I missed the manual somewhere (I am old enough to enjoy reading manuals, at very least it gives me something to do while the game downloads/installs). I haven't encountered any of the problems I have heard about with this game. My computer is robust, but the build is a couple years old, and was not a top of the line build back then.     I basically just fly from planet to planet exploring. I sell stuff when I don't have a use for it, or when I don't have room. I think I would need some kind of sub program to track values through all the planets I have explored to do much real trading. I upgrade my ship/suit/tool as I have the resources or as I find upgrades. Every once in a while I get killed by pirates. Would be nice to have a ship capable of fighting them, or a scanner that could scan other ships so I can be one. My character is apparently learning a new language, possibly three, one word at a time. When I get bored of a planet/solar system I jump to a different one, usually chosen randomly. The controls for chosing which solar system to jump to are best described as vague. Whereas I have no reason to pick one over another, this is fine. The most challenging part of the game (it is difficult for anything to be a challenge when you have no goal), is actually landing on landing pads. Landing where you want is difficult, actually hitting one of those pads, in my experience, takes several attempts. I have heard consternation about this game not actually having multiplayer. I bought this game because steam said it was single player. I want to explore/shoot things, I do not however want to land on planet Dickbutt300523.   Things I would like to see in this game:  Typical 'magic' hangar/base. I want to keep my old ships/weapons somewhere. I want to be able to go look at them/use them. I don't want to lose them forever when I find a new one.  I would like upgrades for my ship/suit to not take up cargo room.  Some kind of automated landing system. I should be able to pick a point and tell my ship to land there. We have cars that can drive themselves, do they expect me to believe these people can't build a space ship than can land itself on a landing pad?    I really hope this game never gets multiplayer.",

Impressions at 7hrs: Game is fun, not too serious and could be played as a casual as long as you don't stray too far from your ship. (it acts as a save point) If you don't like exploring, this game is not for you. The biggest action so far is chasing the unknown point of interest. There is a metaplot but I haven't gotten into it yet, too much other stuff to do first. I could make a fortune if I wanted to mine minerals and ferry them back and forth to the space station but thats a maybe later thing.

I do have the 1060 so that may play a good part in it. Next the gameplay. Yes they misled us about it being multiplayer. For me that wasnt an issue because I enjoy the exploration concept. The gun play isn't bad even though its such a small part and the space battles are fun for the most part. I think they had planned on a more interactive multiplayer, or a multiplayer at all. Overall I'm only about 5 hours in and haven't gotten my hyperdrive maxed out to go anywhere far away because I keep getting my attention lost on these planets that are enormous. I'll spend more time than i thought i would on each planet but i really do have an enjoyable time. For 60 bucks though I'd hope to get at least 30 hours, in the case of a never ending game 100s of hours.

            "review_text": "Let me preface everything by saying that I actually bought this game on impulse before watching the trailers.  I like space, I like exploration, some of the early reviews were positive, so I bought it.  I regret that impulsive decision.    Take it from a 5 year veteran of Eve: Online this game is BORING.  Imagine Eve minus the hordes of players trying to kill you, it's more boring than that.    There is supposed to be septillions of stars and planets generated, but their algorithm is poor. This results in maybe 12 different planet types and 30 animal species. I'm being very generous with the planets, for the most part they are just different colors with a different icon showing you what is killing you today.   Now I wasn't expecting Spore like creature variety, but this is insulting. All of them look the same. There might be some slight variation between the crab like species trying to kill me, but I honestly couldn't tell.   The entire game is far too easy, in my trek from the start to the center of the galaxy my shields dropped a total of maybe 10 times, I still don't know what the death screen looks like.   The interface is utterly terrible. You have to hold to click EVERYTHING. I cannot fathom a reason this has to be for literally EVERYTHING. The galaxy map is the single worst aspect of the UI, a rather galaring flaw for something that wants to do space exploration. The path to the center is utterly useless, as I got close to the center it literally got stuck in a dead end. It ignores your hyperdrive upgrades meaning it's course will take you through about a dozen short hops and then abruptly stop, while you can reach the end in one jump or infact go much futher. There is a total disconnect between 'Distance from Center' and 'Linear Distance', 500ly for the former is about 1,500ly for the latter. You are down to luck for finding any particular location, even ones you've visited before.   The game play is more or less a resource grind, you land on a planet, shoot at a rock with a mining laser, you leave the planet to go shoot at a different rock. There are NPC, they are of three races, all of which just stand or sit alone in one place. They never do anything, you can talk to them and maybe get a blue print or something, but thats it, there is no personality, not even real interaction.   There was an Atlas quest line, that brought you to 10 admittedly rather spiffy looking space stations. Actually I lied, there are 4 rather spiffy looking space stations that are repeated a couple of times in no particular order. It starts no where and ends in a non ending. This may last you a couple of hours (or however long it takes you to realize the map system is trash and just jump to the end). But it pales in comparison to reaching the Galactic Center.   Thats the final insult, what happens at the center. I'll rant in a spoilerific manner after the next paragraph. Suffice to say if we reached the center and had a planet sized MIDDLE FINGER to explore, this would still be less of a ♥♥♥♥ YOU than what we got. Because at least the Flipping Bird of God would be an object of interest and discussion.    It was after I had played for a while that I went out and watched the trailers, holy ♥♥♥♥ I wanted to play that game, too bad it's not what I bought. I'm angry I wasted money buying this, I would have been furious if my expectations were that high. This isn't a case of a fandom hyping in a vacuum, the developers were outright lying to us. Not just in the trailers, but in the words they were speaking. ♥♥♥♥ this game.    SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER    You start jumping to the center, the game silently says 'nope', plays prog rock as it holds the scroll backwards button on the map screen, fade to black and dumps you at the start of a new practically identical galaxy with all you stuff broken. I think it might even have gotten the color on my ship wrong. I can't tell because my game bugged out and put me in slow mo, and I was already fighting the urge to just toss my computer out a window. So no, you don't even get to see what is so shiny at the center of the universe, you just start over again.    Seriously ♥♥♥♥ this game.",

I started to follow the development of the game one or two years ago and i liked every bit of the game. but now after i saw the final product and many posts on Reddit and videos on youtube, i am disappointed. I think that Sean Murray had many Ideas and when the release date came closer the team realized that they ♥♥♥♥ed up. The developers lied about the game, even things like on the E3, where Sean Murray played the game on completely 'random' planets have been proved scripted. In the whole game after 20 hours of gameplay i haven't found planets nearly as beautiful than the planets shown by Murray. Everyone who bought this game because of the features shown by Hello Games in the last few months, has bought an product which was wrong advertised. It's just the same thing every time, the Terrain on the planets are not worth exploring because everything looks the same and in Bases or 'Houses' you will always find the same stuff over and over. now about the missing features: If i order a Pizza with extra-cheese and i pay for a Pizza with extra-cheese but i just get a Pizza without extra-cheese i have paid for a different product than i got, and this is also the case for everyone who preordered No Man's Sky, it has been advertised as a different product than it is. and this is pure scamming of people who are ready to pay for the features named by the developer.

For the first 24 hours in the game, I can say I really did love it, anyone who asked me about the game I’d recommend they buy it. Around the 25 hour mark I started to notice just how repetitive the game is, not in what you do, as I always knew that was the case. However the planets were all the same. Every planet class has certain materials you’ll find on it, and those materials won't be found on another planet of a different class, even if it has the same characteristics of that other planet.. Ex: Planet X is cold, it has Element X in abundance, however Planet Y is inhabited by hostile sentinels, it has Element Y in abundance, Planet Z is cold, and inhabited by hostile sentinels, it has neither Element X nor Element Y, instead it has Element Z, which is found on all planets. That’s not me just being unlucky, In my 30 hours I’ve gone to 19 star systems and over 50 planets. This along with the massive list of features shown in the trailers which simply aren't in the game has made me realize that me wanting to like this game made me blind to the obvious issues that plague the experience for me.  This will be a game I’ll reluctantly go back to after major updates, but that’s only because I can't get a refund. I believe it still has potential, but no longer will I listen to anything Sean Murray says that hasn't gone through a PR department.   Thanks.",

The game feels very relaxed and enjoyable. It could be a lot of fun. But.  As of today, this is why I would suggest to wait for at least the next two or three patches before buying this game (aka: 3 months or so):  * the storyline feels a little 'thin' and is easy to miss alltogether. * (FIXED!) the game stutters and lags like hell, even with the latest 'No Man's Sky optimzed' drivers. * the 'radar' is basically a hoax / dummy and does not help you in any way. It is just a waste of GUI-space. * your ships' scanner looks neat but thats it. * your personal scanner is very picky about what it revaels to you. While it tends to miss ressources you are needing, it keeps pointing out others you already depleted (espec. platinum flowers, for example.) The scanner won't tell you about animals / aliens. * buildings you see don't necessarily get flagged. * (probably fixed) Locations you discover as a tag on screen will be lost on reload, espec. operation centers and factories which really sucks, since you need to invest ressources to discover them. * The chance of not getting the antimatter recipe is stellar and if that happens to you, you are grounded for ages (two real days now in my case). * landing on landingpatches or generally anywhere close to where you intend to land is a matter of pure luck. * many important functions and features of the game are not explained anywhere (are recipes for the multitool consumed? why does one sometimes launch from ground to orbit, sometimes not? etc. etc.) * avoid space/air combat vs small ships. they will outmaneuver you no matter what. * Why aren't there personal notes (saved locally, not uploaded) to a discovery? Like 'Is hostile' or 'Rich on copper' or whatever?  Due to the fact that you need antimatter to do interstellar travel, getting the recipe for creating antimatter is a cornerstone in the game. Unfortunately it is very very very easy to miss that step. There is no second chance in case of a blunder   . Same will possibly be true with other 'story milestones', which feels like the game was not really thought through. Sadly, this is true for many detials throughout the game.     One can actually find the missed recipes, but it takes some serious time and effort. In my case it took more than two days of grinding only factories and operation centers to finally get antimatter. The game itself does not exactly help you there.  All this cobined: To some degree No Man's Sky is exactly the game that at the same time I always wanted and never wanted to play. No Man's Sky has a lot of potential and many shortcomings and bugs. It sure is a lot of fun and a lot of frustration.  As said above: Wait till the first two patches went into the game before buying.  The first patch helped with most of the technical issues (stuttering, lag).  ",

The game is a really nice work of art, its really well coded, it didn't crash once, and for the most part ran at 25-30 FPS, so playable at min settings.. But as a game, doing the same thing over and over, making slight improvements to fairly useless ship/inventory/guns, like, why?    There is no carrot here, no reward, just keep going to the middle of the map, and about the whole 'quintillions of planets', the game has an optimal path for you to follow, and I can't see any reason I'd ever leave the path, and considering I'm only one person, I can't see what real difference it would make if everyone was on the same exact path, with people never meant to be able to ever cross paths, why not just make it purely single player, with everyone doing the exact same path, like in theory we wouldn't even tell the difference unless we watched someone elses gameplay- Without a multiplayer the only point of a different planet layout is replayability, and I can't see any reason I'd ever reset this game after putting in the effort of leveling it up etc, like there is no real different paths, its all about making cash and upgrades.  Maybe in a few years after they add some actual gameplay and not just eye candy it could be awesome, but by then something else pretty would come along, lets be real.  I'd reccomend watching someone stream that already has made it to the middle of the first galaxy AT LEAST, so you have some idea of how repetitive/samey/pointless the gameplay is, and if you really think that's enough to keep your attention, buy it.",

Sean arrogantly scoffed at the notion of sky boxes and fake day/night cycles, saying his game will be different. Well thats exactly how he built the game, sky boxes and fake day/night cycles. All of the explanations about planets orbiting their stars and rotating on their axes to provide day and night were lies to peak your interest. This game uses the same technique to make day/night cycles as every other.. SKY BOXES!! FAKE SUNS!! YAY!! He talked of sophisticated mechanics that determined what type of planet it would be depending on how close or far it was from the star. Where elemets would be present on those planets because of their postion in the solar system. All elements are found on all planets, it doesn't matter how far or close you are to the sun to determine a hot or cold planet. Its just random, not procedural. There isn't even a true star in the system, just a fixed point of light which can never be reached. Sean Murray is a millionaire because of us buying his lies. ALL of the major features that he was hyping for the last year are not in the game.. 2/10, would shove down Sean Murray's throat if I could.",

            "review_text": "Alright, now I've only ever written a review for Life Is Strange. That game absolutely deserved it, and so does NMS, but for the exact opposite reason.    Look, I enjoy the game, and I like the idea, but jesus christ this is just pathetic, and I can't recommend it to anyone in its current state. It's playable, and has its fun moments, but really I wouldn't buy it unless you're dead set on it, in which a review wont change your mind. Definitely not for the price it's at either.      It's a space exploration game, but I have absolutely no desire to be in space or even in my ship. The controls for flying are HORRIBLE, the ship speeds are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying (basically like 1mph, 5mph, and 100mph), and space battles just ♥♥♥♥ me off and I can't imagine anyone finding them even the least bit fun. If you're flying in pulse mode (basically planet to planet warp speed) and hostile ships detect your 'rare items' (you can literally have nothing in your inventories and they'll still detect you...), it tears you out of pulse mode and forces you to fight them. You can't re-enter pulse or warp away to escape, and can't travel fast enough to ever escape unless you happen to be close enough to a planet or space station. Then with the pathetic controls, if there's a handful of ships attacking you you're basically screwed because they can somehow fly much faster than you and it's extremely difficult to even hit one. Oh, and your shield depletes way too quick and you have to sort through menus in real time to recharge it, with elements you either don't have or can't find in space, only on land. So you have no choice but to die basically.   And that happens a lot if you spend time in space.  Also I have a very highly upgraded ship that was like 47 million credits that has 46 inventory slots, so good luck with any ship.     So that leaves running around on planets as the only 'chill, relaxing' thing to do basically. Which I actually enjoy. Really, that part of the game is fun. However, there's a few things there that ♥♥♥♥ me off as well.    1. Literally every planet is inhabited. (Probably by other players too if you could actually see them) Theres some sort of sign of civilization every couple minutes of walking distance in every direction. Which is fine in terms of playing, it gives me something to head for and explore rather than just walking around on the dull landscapes. But when it's supposed to feel like you're exploring new territory, planets being overrun with shelters, trade stations, monoliths, etc. ruin that narrative.   2. About 95% of the planets I've visited have been some sort of barren hazardous bull ♥♥♥♥. Whether it's ice, radiation, heat, or poison, it's literally all the same. I have to run indoors or shoot my own shelter in a hill every 10-20 seconds to keep my hazard support from running out. That's not fun, that's just annoying and it makes me go to a different planet. And the nice planets I have found that I do want to explore are devoid of anything worth exploring. There's never any rare resources, hardly even any animals, and again I just go and find another planet.   3. Sentries are a decent concept, but honestly they should be removed completely. Again, it ruins that whole 'discovering planets for the first time' thing, and they do nothing but prevent me from doing what the game says I'm supposed to do.    4. When discount GLADoS from portal says 'incoming storm', you have straight up zero time to get anywhere. The storm hits as soon as it finishes warning you.   5. I like the idea of unique animals, but they could have actually just dedicated a couple weeks to designing the animals themselves so that they make sense, because most just look stupid. I don't care if that means theres only a few thousand animals versus however many there are, it would look better that way. An extension of that, some of the ships are ridiculous as well, but I am glad that inventory space is not related to size of the ship because I wanted a small ship not two sideways grain silos with a cockpit thrown on top.    6. Even though every planet is unique, it all seems the same. There's basically a handful of environments that all look and interact the same, the only difference is the shape of the landscape and where things are.        Really though, it is a bit of fun and it's worth trying, but not at 60 dollars. They have a lot of work to do to make this even a good game, and I do look foward to the updates they'll apparently be making (if they try to make any of it paid DLC though I wouldn't be suprised if they have to change their names and move to remote locations).    Bottom line is, don't expect to be blown away or even impressed, but it's a nice concept and might eventually evolve into something worth half its price.",

It's a fun 15$ game, but AAA price demands AAA content, and this is the mid-low tier of indie. I wish Hello Games would have been honest with it's customers.  Pros:  -I got a refund (took weeks, and a paypal dispute, but I got it)  -It was really really cool for the first 4 hours.  -Learning space languages could have been a little deeper (I expected proceedurally generated races, with similar languages) but was still really cool.     Cons:  -Only looks good if you don't look at anything closely (vanilla minecraft has better textures)  -No multimonitor support (no HUD rescale options, just stretches). Sean indicated on multiple occassions EVEN ON RELEASE DAY that this would be a feature.   -The default FOV is completely claustrophobia inducing. I imagine they force reduced it, so that your card is rendering less, and therefore 'magical better performance', leads into:  -Literal Aids optimization. I have a 1080 SC FTW and on ultra I got a whopping 70 fps. Mind you that was with frame drops/tears every 15 or seconds. I spent at least an hour trying to optimize.  -Jesus ♥♥♥♥ the spaghetti code. This game has more bugs than the Congo in it's peak of monsoon season. Hey, want to take off and move a mile or so forward to continue mining? WELL I HOPE YOU LIKE DEEP SPACE (when taking off, about 10% of the time you fly off planet; completely into space). Animals are often glitched: aquatic creatures stuck in air, spinning creatures, animals phasing through walls, teleporting animals, ect, ect, ect. I'm sure some of these bugs have/will be fixed, but these are too prevalent to be 'missed' in the final touchups of the game (which was supposedly why it was delayed for over a month, not because they were being sued)  -Lack of creature and resource diversity. The only resource that ever changes form is iron. Everything else is in basically the same form. I saw alot of LITERALLY IDENTICAL animals on different planets--most common were these little mushroom crab things that teleport along the ground.   -There are literally thousands of posts talking about the missing features/promised mechanics, my big ones are as follows: animals don't interact with eachother. At all. Space combat is garbage, and has little reward (also where are my wingmen for hire????). Flying is bad (literally if its going to have 10 hours of exploration gameplay, at least give me controls to my own ship). If I want to ram my ship face first into a planet, I should be able to. On the subject of ships--there aren't different ship classes, at all, only 'class' I can see is the individual a e s t h e t i c (which feels pretty Star Wars inspired). Multiplayer, where is it? If its not multiplayer, where are the advantages of singleplayer games (permadeath would be really cool).  -Currency is so unbalanced its disgusting. I had the highest tier ship in my first 5 hours.   -Puzzles that are one of 3 preformatted types, and zero difficulty.    Please don't buy this game.  Sean Murray, ♥♥♥♥ you.",

How is there not enough content in this endless universe? It has an upgrade, mine, repeat loop that will keep you interested for a little while but without things like base building, full multiplayer support, more customization options, avatars, etc, it is simply not enough to warrant the price tag, essentially everyone paid $60 to see what a truly endless universe looks like in a game as early as possible, and honestly it is something amazing to go through, but it just needs more, and who knows if it will ever get it.",

It is worth buying if it goes on sale for 50% off (until the updates are rolled out and we get the game we were promised), but right now the tutorial alone WILL take up the two hours of refund time Steam grants you. ---------------------------------WARNING: EXTREMELY LONG REVIEW AHEAD--------------------------------  I REALLY wanted to like this game....hell, I was excited for almost two years after I first heard about NMS. Then the interviews kept showing up on the air waves, promising this, promising that and made my excitement build to a point of almost buying a PS4 JUST TO PLAY IT THREE DAYS EARLY!  Alas, I waited for the PC release. Woke up early, brushed my teeth, threw on some jeans, my favorite Rick &amp; Morty T-Shirt (I even shouted SHOW ME THE MORTY a few times, out of sheer excitement) and took off on my adventure into the unknown.   The first hour and a half was pretty boring, but I expected nothing less from a tutorial. My second hour in was kind of a.....ship wreck. Pirates shot me down and I crash landed on a water based planet.....fun fact, I needed Zinc to repair my ship and there were no Zinc flowers to be found....so, I went about wondering the planet for almost three hours, going to points of interest in hopes of finding another lifeform who can help me. FINALLY I found one - an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment &amp; relief flooded my body and I was able to purchase some Zinc from the Galactic Trade Network (as well as a Bypass Chip, to get my ship back). With a loud 'WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!” I blasted off from that damned planet.   By now, I fixed my warp drive and was able to jump to different stars......and this is where things started to go downhill. I would go an entire three hour session not finding anything interesting (which, to be honest, was to be expected, based off of what Sean Murray said during many of his interviews)...but I never ran out of supplies, nor did I really have to do much mining. This was due to the abundance of Space Stations....like, literally, every star has a Space Station; anytime I was low on something, I could always hit up a Space Station, get the supplies I needed from the Trade Network (or an alien who happened to be visiting the same Space Station as me....which was always happening) and warp to my next star.   I don't want to be a ♥♥♥♥, so what you read next MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS    ----------- AGAIN, POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------    ---------- LAST CHANCE TO STOP READING -----------------------------        Okay then - making my way to the center of the galaxy (repeat, not Universe, you are working your way to the center of the current GALAXY you are in. Pretty big difference, Hello Games) became EXTREMELY redundant, until I found a Space Anomaly. Now, at this point you should have made a choice of staying on the 'Fixed Path of The Atlas' or doing your own thing. In my game, I said ♥♥♥♥ The Atlas and did my own thing (thug life)...but anytime you enter the Space Anomaly and speak with the High Priest, you are given a choice of getting back on the path of The Atlas, some resources (can't say I've picked either one of those choices), OR help getting to the center of the galaxy; I always asked for help to get to the center.  Now, here is where things get a little more.....strange. The Priest will open a black hole for you and you will travel XXXXXXXX lightyears toward the center...but if you look at your galactic map, it is almost as if your 'Distance to the Center' barely changes. For example, my overhead display said I travelled 699,400 lightyears, and my distance to the center before was 161,000 lightyears, but now it's only 160,800.....my warp drive can travel 300 lightyears each jump.....making the black hole useless and pointless. Now, this has turned into a grinding simulator. I'm nowhere near the center still....I've been playing for almost 38 hours and still, I am roughly 158,000 lightyears away from the center of the galaxy (again, not the universe, contrary to popular belief).  I may pick this game up and start playing it again, one day, but I can’t help but wonder what this game would have been like had all the features Sean Murray said were going to be in the game, were actually in the game at launch. The notion of “If you haven’t’ discovered it, it doesn’t mean it isn’t in the game” is overplayed so much that it is sickening: Once this game released on PC and folks started to monitor packets, it was quickly realized the only communication your game is doing with a central server, is when you name planets. That’s it. There is literally no way (contrary to what was said by Sean, multiple times) you can see another player, even if they stand right in front of you. There are not multiple “lobbies”, as the user can disconnect and reconnect as many times as he/she wants…the only packets that will be communicated with the NMS server is your save data, and planets in your area that may have been named…but that’s all that is being queried.  I won’t point out all of the other features that were left off of this “Full Release” version of NMS, you can look it up. All in all, this game is not worth the $60.00 price tag, primarily for the fact that this is more like a Beta Test of the actual game we will have in a year, after a slew of updates. Should this game ever go on sale for 50% off, then it would be worth it. But, again, I HIGHLY advise against buying this game in its current state – you WILL use up your 2 refund time just making it through the tutorial.   If you read this whole thing, thank you.",

Now, it's finally released with high expectations and enormeous preasure, which it couldn't overcome in the end. I jumped onto that hype-train like many others did.  Now as it's here it isn't nearly that what was promised over the years. Sean Murray and his team have pushed the game to such a high level. The promised features, 'every planet is so unique' and stuff. After a few hours you land on a new planet and seriously have nothing to do. I have to admit that this universe is enormeously big with 18 quintillion planets, but the problem is they are partly so similar. For instance, the caves look the same on every single planet. Then it comes to the creatures... After a while you clearly recognize a scheme Hello Games adapted on the fauna system. Animals have these and these legs, this and this head, this and this height, and thats it. This univere may be endless and stuff, but you can cram its content into a single pot, if you know what I mean.   No Man's Sky is my dissapointment of the year , although the year isn't over yet.

In fact, we sunk hours in trying to recharge our hyper drives so we could travel to new solar systems and see if that's where the fun was.

I liked the idea of an infinite universe to explore but the graphics were lacking on GTX 1080 and i7-5820k and latest drivers installed. It looked too console'ish and who wants to mine on every redundant planet? I would not be so critical if the price was not at a AAA level. I may buy again if it comes on sale. But was hesitant to invest 2 hours and not be able to refund. Most games take longer than 2 hours to make a final determination of quality. I just did not want to take the chance on a AAA priced title. ",

            "review_text": "Overall - Pretty Poor 90% of the planets are the same - and the ones that aren't are rare. In 15 hours of playtime, I found 2 planets that didn't fit into the same red-rock mould; 1 moon with some snow, and 1 flora planet. Fauna is nowhere near as complex as shown in game demos. Food chains don't exist as shown and animals have no noticable interactions with each other. Dinosaurs like those which are shown in the gameplay trailer, and there is very little difference between species on different planets - the same few appear everywhere. No massive fleets jump in to star systems like shown in the gameplay trailer, as well as no large scale space battles where you can pick a side. At most 2 or 3 do, and a couple of pirates attack them infinetely until you join in. Even then, you can in duck in and out of a space station until you eventually kill them. Speaking of space stations, they were talked about as if they would be hubs for trading and interactions. Instead, you have a space station the size of a moon inhabited by a single NPC, with a few ships appearing every now and then. It was also advertised that you could take multiple routes in terms of your ship, either opting to take an exploration, fighting, or trading ship. This simply isn't true. All of the ships handle the same, with the same speed and same weapons. The only thing you're really looking for in a ship is the inventory size. Other than that they are all the same with a slightly different model and paint-job. There is no multiplayer, another feature that was lied about. You could spend over 20 hours trying to reach the same planet as a friend, only to find that you can't see or interact with one another once you arrive.  By far the worst thing about No Man's Sky is the number of bugs. On multiple occasions I would explore a planet 100% completion at which point I would be prompted to claim a reward. At this point, I would then try and upload a planet only for the game to tell me that I hadn't found everything, even though all boxes were checked and the game said 100% complete. The game is also terribly optimised, so much so that even high-end gaming PCs struggle to run it at a constant FPS, not to mention crashes, which are far too abundant. I probably spent more time loading into the game than actually playing it. What made this even worse is that a lot of the time, No Man's Sky would ignore my restore points unless I saved multiple times, resulting in several insanely frustrating moments where a planet I had completed would be uncompleted within seconds. The only thing worse than this however, is not being able to fully research a planet at all. Often, I would reach a point where I only needed to find 1 species, only to then find that this species was perpetually locked into the floor, where I was completely unable to scan it. Clipping through objects is also much more common than it should be. Whether in an exosuit or a spaceship, you can move through various objects as if you were a ghost, further damaging your immersion in the game.  Other problems with No Man's Sky include the variation. The game is supposed to take place in a galaxy, but I feel like I'm exploring a loop, with the same unending rock planets. Planetery gravity, an addition that might have made planets feel more unique, is unsurprisingly absent as well as orbits. Planets sit stationary around a sun. Sentinels, the game's main antagonistic force, are always samey. Passive walker sentinels don't exist like they do in the gameplay trailer. If you see a two-legged sentinel it is hostile no exceptions.  One of the most anticlimactic and disappointing endings in videogame history.  Overall, even with promises of future updates, £40/$60 is too much for this game. Overhyping and flat-out lying has been used to lure in players in. Don't buy this game, even if the price drops.",

Watching this turn of events it makes me wonder, is this the only lie that the game served us or is it just the 'breakfast' of what we are going to see. After 35 hours of game I issued a refund Which I dont think I will ever receive and that breaks my hurt cause I see a company that I value, steam, taking the side of this company that missleaded people on buying an expensive game with 40% of the features that they promised to have. Even if people doesnt get their refunds, Hello-games is becoming Bye-ByeGames cause they lost their credibility to the gamers.   If Bye-ByeGames try to release a new game I believe it will be really interesting to see how they going to work it out.   Anyway, untill new updates come with some real content this time I will not touch the game and I will issue a refund til they stop anwsering to every single refund for No mans sky.

I even kept it going for twice that time, hoping that things would get better but they don't.   We were promised all sorts of great stuff such as factions to join in order to feel like you were taking part in the universe but it's more like you're just passing through it. The aliens you meet are extremely boring and repetative, leaving the universe feeling empty and dry. The ships look nice to start with but they don't have any variation at all in terms of how they feel to fly in.  The overall objective of the game was built up to be this amazing journey to the centre of the galaxy but in actuality, all you do is wander around for hours grinding for materials to build irrelevant upgrades for your suit, weapon and ship or wander from place to place to salvage ships in order to increase your inventory size. You pay £40 to grind resources to upgrade your inventory size so that you can grind more resources!  Granted the feel of the universe is great and it does have the feeling of enormity but this is certainly not enough to make the experience enjoyable and is certainly not worth the asking price.

Unfortunately i have more bad things looming in my mind preventing me playing this game over good things persuading me that a quick zap around a galaxy is a good thing to do with my time..  First 20 hours were cool. I took it slow and explored, made money from anything and everything, it was fun. The creatures you see were funny at times but mostly awesome and i really felt like i was discovering something. The panic to get back to my ship as i had been out too long in a storm was exhilarating, a real sense of 'PHEW! I made it!'  After this fun 20 hours of positive gameplay i saw that upgrading your inventory and ship were the most important things to do as it allowed you to cary more and visit cooler systems.   As soon as i realised this was the focus then the games appeal began to decline. It turned from an adventure into a grind because the game repeadedly restricted my enjoyment and forced me into ship hunting. I spent the next 20 hours dribblng on my keyboard and going from 1 transmission tower to the next. Going through 5-10 ships a day. Dealing with the horrible sound of broken shields just to waste less resources on the temporary ships i was powering through.  I'm sure you have seen many videos about the half-truths of the No Man's Sky development and release. My main gripe is the lack of content, it's simply not worth the asking price, as you can see by my hours, i, personally have gotten my moneys worth out of it but there are many, many others that simply haven't. Even with the 70 hours at the time of this review, i really had to try to enjoy my time in game. You shouldn't have to do that with a game, the sole purpose of it is to be fun.   The main reason why content is an issue is because we were sold on content that was very much glorified, made to look far deeper and refined than it has actually turned out to be.   Angry Joe can tell this part for me  because writing this review is something i really didn't see myself doing, it genuinely is making me feel rather deflated.   I'm done with this now, i will forever keep an eye open for the update that we all so desperately want. Nobody wanted to write negative things about this game.

If you are looking for a game with a robust and refined trading system, a game with a fast paced combat system with lots of weapon and shield variety, a game with lots of in depth player and npc interaction. Then please for the love of god do not buy this game. Go buy Elite Dangerous it has all that and more while No Mans's Sky has none of theses things.  The one thing about No Man's Sky that was slightly appealing to me was the promise that every planet l visit will be completely random and each creature and tree would look different... or at least that was what l thought, yes for the first 3 hours or so it did seem to me like it would be that way. However on my 4 planet l started noticing small similarity's to the other planets l had visited previously and by about my 8 planet l couldn't tell it apart. l was seeing repetition of weather systems, the fauna started looking the same and l was seeing repeats of animal parts making the creature look very similar to ones l had already seen. The problem with random generation in games is that it can become very repetitive fairly quickly because it relies on a pool of parts. For example when you land on a planet the game is going to pick hundreds of these pieces and mush them together to make random looking animals and random trees and a random planet. The problem lies with the depth of that pool of parts and the size of the universe. No Man's Sky is has an infinite universe and a fairly shallow pool of parts. This means you the main aim of the game 'Exploration' becomes very repetitive and in my opinion boring.  Finally, would l recommend this game? NO   Im editing this just to get the badge in that award thing.",

My machine is a monster compared to the minimum specs for this game, so there is no reason for this other than the program was released in a state of unreadiness. No excuse for that.   There is an astounding lack of content. Many of the creatures on world A look a lot like the creatures on world B.   Now lets talk about gameplay.   The flight model is ludicrously stupid. I should be able to fly my ship into the side of a mountain if I want, or if I make a mistake. Instead the game doesn't let you have anything but marginal control when you're near the ground. This makes landing the ship basically an exercise in luck. Will you get close to where you want to land? Maybe. You do get better at landing in time with practice, but not because you get to look at your landing spot. You simply watch it pass under the nose of your ship, count, and hope you hit the spot you want. This makes landing at trade depots and outposts just stupid.   I have no idea how to look anything but straight ahead on the PC while flying. Maybe there is a way. If there is, I have yet to figure it out. This stuff should be intuitive. The numerical keypad, for example, would have been a great choice for allowing you to look around in flight. But I guess your head gets locked into place once you're in the ship for your own protection.   I played a game and with the bonus ship, wound up losing my hyperdrive. After that trying to get a hyperdrive proved futile. I had to start over, which involved going into my computer's SSD and deleting certain files, and then shutting off and restarting steam cloud. WTH? What sort of game doesn't have a 'NEW GAME' feature?  So much potential here. So little of it fulfilled.  This all said, I will probably play this game as patches come out, content is added, bugs are patched, and the game gets some actual depth. For now I guess it's back to Rimworld.",

There is so much potential in this but as of writing this review it's not there.  What i was expecting from this game and what you actually get:   -  A Space exploration game   While yes the focus was mostly planet side in most of the videos and interviews we saw leading up to the release. In these videos however we see epic space dog fights, fighters flying in wing formations and a rather fun looking experiance.   What we got: something that feels tacked on, an after thought. The ship flies like a drunk pregnant hippo in glue. Its sluggish unresponsive, you can't fly close to the ground. The landing mechanics DO NOT WORK, you basically guess if you are close enough to land on the landing pan but often land RIGHT next to damn thing! The ships often do look awesome but they all fly the same, once you have maxed the cargo slot space then there is never a need to change your ship other than visually.   -  Procedurally generated universe    Ok so yeah technically we did get this. however simply changing a colour pallet and what (rather limited) assets the game uses often makes things a little boring, Honestly i have seen more interesting landscapes from Minecraft.  Also with this come procedurally generated creatures to inhabit your 18 bizzilion worlds. Pity most of them look so stupid it's hard to take it seriously. I have gotten creatures with MASSIVE top portions then supported on 2 toothpick sized legs and then a tiny shrunken head. It's a laugh the first 40 times but after a time you notice the limited assets that the animals are using, and then they begin to look much the same.   -  A Survival Crafting Game   Ok i do like this style of game. However with it being survival you would assume there is some sort of SURVIVAL aspect to the game. Nope none to be had, EVERY planet ever has so many resources that you can't run out of ANYTHING. Sure you may have to hunt for some rarer materials to build some of the things but honestly the “survival” part feels very much like how many games call it an “RPG” just because you level up and can improve your character.  The crafting is also seemingly tacked on like a forgotten mini game. You find blueprints (often the same ones you already had) all over the place, so it really does not feel special or unique when you find these, just more like you should have had them from the start but we needed a way to make you grind.  -  A Chilled Game Experience   Holy buthole batman you need to a gosh darn zen master not to rage at the frame rate drops that happen every 4 hours or so (if one happened in first 2 hours i would have done a request for a refund trust me). Or the crashes to desktop? Or your ship that you landed on the surface of a planet now somehow stuck deep inside the core of the planet and you can mine down any more to get to. Best part is i am one of the lucky few that had a “good” release. I now sort of wish i had not so i could have asked for my money back instead of playing more to hope it got better.   When all's said and done, i would say pick this up on a sale maybe (like a 60% or more, then the price point will be fine) or wait until some content is added to the game.

Back to the game itself; Pros - - Huge Number of explorable planets - fly to other 'Planets' - fly to other 'Galaxies'  Cons - - Galaxy's/solar systems are just a small 'skybox' - Space ships and their configurations are very repetitive - Space Ships are NOT upgradable, can only buy new ones..... - Resources grind fest(ever played WoW and killed 100 boars to ding, this is the same thing but no ding) - No Goals(except flying to centre of Universe with the worst ending) - No logging, by this I mean once you leave your starter planet you have no way of finding out what planet you started on.  Thats about all I have currently, except this-  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN THE CURRENT STATE! ! !",

Many of the things that were promised to us by the devs aren't even in game. You cannot forge alliances with different races and there is no huge variety in planets. Yes the planet's are different, but it feels they're lazily different... It's almost like on every planet the flora and minerals are the same but the colors change and that's it. Sometimes there's water, sometimes it's a purple wasteland. Heck, you can't even rename your ship like they've promised.  It was fun at first to explore and discover different star systems and upgrade your ship. I think I've even learned 200+ words of alien language in-game just to understand some kind of story better and it was fun to interact with the aliens. Even though they were just mindless drones sitting in one place. There are still those little things in the game that would make it worth buying BUT this is not a game for completionists. In this game you will not achieve, you will not compete to be the best and there is no score to tell you how well you've done.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but after getting to the center of the universe... after playing countless hours and just warpping from system to system and listening to your LIFE SUPPORT BEING CRITICAL the payout is not what is deserved. Infact, just because of the ending I'm going to try and issue a refund for this game but it will probably not go thru because I've already played the game for so long.

It looks great most of the time, the art direction is fantastic and the soundtrack is as immersive as it gets.  Sadly this game has two major problems: Gameplay and UX/UI. The marketing BS frankly bugged me the most about it, along with the blatant lies about multiplayer and Sean's evasive replies. I'm even more shocked that this old scheme worked: They built INSANE amounts of hype, underdelivered spectacularily, don't admit it and almost got away with it.  The way they sold NMS fell into the typical 'procedurally generated without meaning' category, other prime examples being TES: Daggerfall from 1996 (23,000 square kilometers! Over 15,000 towns, cities, villages! 750,000 NPCs! The size of Great Britain!) or Borderlands (17,750,000 different weapons!) which were both actually good games at the time which utilize procedural generation in slightly better ways than NMS.   A mere million things to explore wasn't sufficient enough for Hello Games: Here comes NMS with 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets to explore!   I guess their marketing department just came a little when they heard this magic number.  Unfortunately almost everything is in this game is either meaningless, as basic as it can be, has no context, or is incoherent. It tries to be the grandest of them all, but is actually the shallowest. There have also some really weird and sometimes outright bad design decisions been made for this game.  A few examples - You have seen everything there is to do on a planet after the second one you explore. - You will at most encounter one alien at any given time. - Obtaining Warp Drives and doing FTL jumps is easier than opening regular locked doors. You by the way need to talk to ancient alien beings to be blessed with the long forgotten art of opening doors. Behind these doors is mostly generic loot, btw. - Every space station looks the same on the inside. The layout is always exactly the same, with minimal randomized room layouts. - These HUGE stations literally contain zero or one alien(s).  - There are only three 'distinct' alien races. They all hold the same type of tablet. They all share the same type of alien artifacts you can discover. - Planets are LITTERED with man-made structures, but all of them are make-shift outposts, containing, again, zero to two aliens at most. No traces of forming civilizations or anything like that, no. Aliens apparently just randomly built thousands of outposts on every single planet, one alien at a time. They made sure to seal their doors too.  - You need Carbon(!) to talk to aliens multiple times. Why? I don't know! Even better, every room with an alien contains multiple indoor plants, containing carbon. - Everything in this game is a chore: Refilling fuel, unskippable/lengthy cutscene animations, exosuit notifications,  To add insult to injury, the UX is a crime. Often missing context-information and unnecessary click-journeys are just some of the problems. Why do I have to navigate through convoluted UIs to do basic actions as refilling fuel? If I want to liftoff but actually have it in my inventory refill it AUTOMATICALLY jesus christ.  It can't help but think the game would have been magnitudes better if they chose to A) hire proper gameplay and UI/UX designers and B) to invest their resources into hand-crafting a selection of distinct planets with richer, more meaningful content, alien races that are fleshed out, real colonies on planets.. the list of things that would have been the better focus than soulless palette-swaps is as big as the quintillions of planets you can potentially find in this game.   Anyway, I think NMS has it's charm but is way, WAY, smaller and more basic than it tries to be. This would be a great indie early access game release for 20 bucks.  Oh and Hello Games promised BASE BUILDING as additional content in the future. In a game that literally is about exploration and not being in one place all the time. Seems like they don't understand their own game's DNA. Good job!  No Man's Sky sometimes looks pretty good though and certainly has it's moments. It's a shame it was so overhyped.",

Everything else (combat, exploration, even the procedural generation) is just shallow and repetitive. Expect to see LOTS of similar looking plants, animals, planets, mineral veins, ships, etc.  Overall the game is fun for the first 10 or so hours, since everything feels new at first and you don't really find out about the false advertising until later. Personally, I flat out couldn't play it anymore after 22 hours because it's so damn repetitive.  The bottom line is that this game isn't early as enormous or complex as it was made out to be, and it shouldn't cost more than 20 dollars in its current form.",

If it offers a good game - great. If you can make a game without great technology - great. But if you use amazing technology but the game is no fun then that's just bad.

I found all three Atlas passes, I saw all the Atlas interfaces, explored every type of star. There just feels like there is so much squandered potential in No Man's Sky. At first, evrything just felt incomplete somehow. You find the first atlas pass, you get to unlock rooms with invetory upgrades. You find the second, you get to go into extra rooms in planetside buildings-and there is never anything good there, just some more carbon and maybe a box or two. The real joke is the 3rd level atlas pass, which is basically the same as the 2nd, but in a space station. The only good thing about this game is the scenery, and it's nice every now and then when you find something new to look at. But play long enough and you will start to see the same creatures generating on other planets. But as I said before, it all started feeling like things were just unfinished, but then ***SPOILER*** (not really) you get to the center of the galaxy! And guess what happens! You click to travel to it and the camera pans backwards through the galaxy and then the camera fades to black. This game is one the BIGGEST middle fingers to gamers ever pointed up towards the 'infinite' space above. My only regret is giving it a fair chance and not refunding in time. Save your money.

I didn't think that before but I recently found some old gameplays from before the game was released and some of the empty promises made by Sean Murray. I must say that this boring excuse of a video game looks nothing like the NMS we were promised and shown. You might want to watch AngryJoe's review, I thought he did a pretty good job gathering those in one video.   Other than that, the game could still have been good even if it didn't come out as expected but it didn't. Horrible visuals and extremely repetitive gameplay. I searched through a sh-t ton of planets for materials to build and recharge my hyperdrive and I finally did. Guess what the next objective was. Build another one. Really? I don't mean just the objectives. Gameplay itself is pretty repetitive as well. Mine, discover, get money, upgrade your ship. That's pretty much it. It just doesn't feel like a complete game.

No Man's Sky is a 'procedurally generated universe' that's about a few climates, some animals that seems like mixing dinosaurs and normal animals, plants, planets full of plutonium and the same borring pathers for the entire game. Your goal is to explore, to travel to any planet you can see in the sky, this is just a complete misoportunity to create a large universe to explore using the same assets over and over again, all npc have the same dialoges of trade, all huts and space station are the exact same, there are no npc outside huts, no civilizations, no space combat, all the ships are the same. NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, and yeah SPOILERS AHEAD: but seriously when you reach the center of the galaxy, the game takes you back to a starter planet and you have to do all over again, this game is honestly a sad depressing misleading bs from Hello Games that completly killed any chance of me buying any game from them ever again, they did and show a lot of promise for example free dlc, which is not going to happend, they lied to the player base and charge full price: 59.99 dollars for a barebone game that hardly cost 20 at this point, honestly the amount of frustration this game gave alongside with the TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE ON MY PC THAT NOT EVEN JUST CAUSE 3 CAN MATCH completly killed my mod to play this game, sadly i cannot refund this game, all i can do is warn you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, FOR ANY PRICE! this game is a lie straight to customers charged full price, missing most featured promesed with serious performance issues, don't be fouled by the positive reviews this game have, they are mostly fanboys thinking they can save the sinking ship Hello Games is, Sean Murray is a liar and to take a team of 15 for a project like this is a joke, hell knowing what this game is i won't take it as a gift.

Sure you can keep hopping from planet to planet and do some sightseeing but even that will lose its novelty.  In my orginal review I said I would check back once the first content patch came out but a little under 2 weeks after release Sean Murray and Hello Games just stopped all communication with its fan base. Sure the game was getting massively dunked by gamers and critics but they could still have saved it. This silence has killed the game and I would not be suprised the company that made it.

When I first started, I didn't care much about the low-res textures and 20-40 FPS I was getting, I was just excited to get off the planet and start exploring. Alas, the more I explored, the more I saw the similarities between each planet. Each planet has the exact same textures, just recolored. The flora is of a limited variety, and you'll find a lot of planets with the same exact mushroom sprite, just recolored to seem different. There may be 18 quintillion planets, but they all pretty much share the same basic resources and population. I got bored after about my 10th system. I tried using mods to spice things up (BigThings, LowFlight), but I got bored of those even quicker.  In short, this game is just an overhyped broken promise from Hello Games. If they ever improve the game to be more of what it was shown as, then I may repurchase it, but for now I'll go take my money and spend it on a game I'll actually enjoy.  P.S. If you want to play a game with much better orbital mechanics and exploration, Kerbal Space Program is 50% off this weekend.",

And for the first 4-5 hours, i loved it. I really did. But the more i played it the more i started to realise how terrible this game really is.  First off, the interface is god awful. Its laggy, its unintuitive, and its slow as heck. Recharge multitool i have to open inventory. Seems completly random which of the three tabs i get, then click my multitool tab, then click the miningbeam or grenade or bolt caster part. Press and Hold, then select the material to recharge with. Why can't i just click R to reload? and it will use whatever available element i carry to do it? Its just overcomplicating things.  And this brings me to the actual inventory. Why does items take up so much space? The shielding plates you can craft are 100% pointless. They charge less than 250 of an oxide (iron, zinc or titanium). And use the same inventory space, plus i can use the actual raw material for other things. Maybe if i could use one shielding plate multiple times to recharge my shields, but no one won't even fully charge me with some upgrades in place. Least let us stack these things, like gravitino balls, atlas stones etc. With the limitations that are, crafting that weapon upgrade which needs 10 balls is a pain in the tushie cause you need to free up space to carry them, then another space to actually make it.  And why does the upgrades need another space in the inventory? I kind of like that you can link them together for synergy effects. But this is not mentioned in the game at all, the only indications is my 'stat circles' go longer when i link upgrades then when i don't. I feel this could be done far better. Just let us click the shield/lifesupport etc and it brings up a mini inventory with x amount of slots we can put the upgrades in. Not taking up valuable space.   Then we come to exploration. Which starts out really fun. But once you're at the 50th planet you explore. They all kinda become the same. Same buildings, same resource nodes. Even the animal life starts looking similar after awhile. I wanted to see an ocean world so bad, when i finally found one. I was amazed flying over it, until i actually landed. Swimming is annoying as hell. Its slow, you can't swim at surface to regain oxygen, you actually have to jetpack out of the water to refill it, if you don't have the scubatank upgrade things.  Which brings me to the resource nodes. Why do they look identical on all planets? The iron ones and carbon have such a variety. But on all planets, Copper nodes will defy gravity and fly in the air. Heridium are black/blue pillars. And then we have the 'additional element' as i've come to call them, which is gold, aliminium, iridium, titanium, nickel, etc. Which only seem to have one type per planet. So if you get a planet with gold, might as well leave and go to next if you're looking for nickel.  There are buildings which have no entrace. I've ran into probably 10+ buildings. All of them with the 'rare schematic' when i did a space scan. Fly to them, land, often dive into a lake and swim for 5 minutes, then get to it, and there is no entrace to it. Impossible to get inside.  The galaxy map is also very terrible, theres no indicator of planets i've been to, i have to physically click on each planet to find out if you been there or not. Maybe i wanna go back to a planet where i found some rare resource on, like omegon. But once you've jumped once or twice, finding it again is next to impossible. And the waypoint system is terrible. Why can't i free roam with the waypoint lines still showing? And why does the waypoint line only go like 500 lightyears when i can jump 1500 lightyears.  Theres also only three races in the entire game. Vy'ken which seems to be fighters/warriors. Korvax which are robot scientists and Gek traders. Each with their own distinct looks, language and ships. Three just seems to little for this big galaxy. And theres no interaction between factions, except the odd 'send data the vy'ken planning to bomb the gek' bla bla bla. The promised faction system just isn't there.  And the promised big space battles. Sure i've had 50 fighters attack 3 freighters. But holy ♥♥♥♥. One stray shot hitting a freighter and everyone turns on you, and sentinels fly in to attack you as well. And theres no real reward for doing it, get some reputation with the faction, which i had maxed out after 10 solarsystems anyway. Not to mention how clunky the ship controls are.  And why can't i upgrade the launch system or the engines in my ship? so i can boost at faster speed, or take off more then 4 times on one charge of the launch system?  And the creepy alien goo in the abandoned facilities. Why aren't they a story in the game, like get some history behind them, and maybe even run into them later. But no, only sentinels are the enemy.   Game could be so good, but this was released way way way too soon, even with the delay this is so unfinished. And i havn't touched the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stability of the game. Experiment beta patch fixed a little, but i still crash at random. FPS drops mysteriously to 5-6 from 60+ after a few hours.   I really hope hello games will continue to improve this game, they have a lot of work ahead to make it fun, but there is so much potential, i hope they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up.",

I figured what I was hearing was good enough for me. Well it took over a dozen hours to realize that most of the promises made during development were not fulfilled. I won't list the reasons here because there are many discussions and threads including the mega-compilation of missing features that can be looked into. The game may be fun for some but truthfully once you've seen a handful of planets you have seen them all.  Obviously I do not have any inside information about the development of the game but I cannot understand how the end product is so vastly inferior to demos that were shown 2 or more years ago, unless those demonstrations were outright fake.  Since I am not able to receive a refund on this game because of my time played, my only hope is to let it sit in my library and wait for the developer to deliver what they promised at the price I already paid, however I don't see how that is possible short of a re-write of the much of the base functionality. It is my opinion the game was watered down to support the PS4 instead of realizing it's potential on the near-limitless PC platform.  Additionally, the game did not perform as well as I expected based on my system specs which far outpace the listed system requirements. It was very playable at first however with only minimal drops below 60 FPS, but it seems the more I played the worse the game performed, and this was across separate sessions of play. Also the performance seemed to get worse with each subsequent patch.  My recommendation is not to buy until a major update is made or a deep discount is available.",

A BRAND NEW GALAXY! so i can waste my time doing boring, repetitive actions all over again!   i didn't want to spoil the game for myself by looking up what happens when you reach the center, but if i had known what was in store for me i never would've wasted my money on this game. i tell you this, dear and highly improbable reader, because you may not yet know the pain of spending over 100 hours grinding and grinding to reach that impossibly far off goal, only to have it zoom out dramatically to the edge of the galaxy, effectively invalidating all of the repetitive, mind numbing effort you just put in. it hurts, and i dont want you to know this pain, whoever you are. it's too late for me, but maybe i can spare you and your wallet. heed my advice and do not buy this game, at least until they patch it. as it stands, it is definitely not worth $60.",

It feels like Hello Games really really wanted to make a purely exploration-focused 'Proteus-in-Space' — which would be fantastic and amazing, you can still salvage this, HG — but then at the last minute they felt compelled to shoehorn traditional gameplay elements in to legitimise what they were making. The (awful, unchallenging, tedious) survival mechanics only act as gates that keep the player away from the crunchy core of this game, which is the procedurally-generated galaxy.  The proc-gen is capable of delivering some lovely surprises, but feels artificially limited overall. I still find animals I've never seen before and I giggle out loud every time, but that sense of surprise and wonderment is limited in the fauna (there are only so many species on a planet, and they don't meaningfully interact with each other) and nearly absent from the flora and landscape. Planets have only one biome each. There's no such thing as a water table; caves in planets that don't have seas will never have water inside them. The strength of gravity is the same on a huge planet as it is on that planet's tiny moon. Barren planets are never barren. Every planet has a blue flower that gives you platinum, a gold flower that gives you zinc, and a solitary-growing vine that is the only plant species that attacks you.  I think that HG limited these elements to make the game easy to read for players: 'Oh I see a blue flower, I can get some platinum.' But those limitations cripple the game's own aspirations; if the point is to literally turn you into an explorer on the frontiers of a star system that no one has ever seen, and perhaps will never see again, then isn't that undermined by the fact that you can land on a planet's surface and immediately recognise certain plants as recurring resouce containers?  The reason I've been able to play this game as long as I have, the reason I didn't refund it nearly immediately, is because there's a decent-sized modding community springing up around this game, fixing or expanding on the game to bring it closer to what players wanted. It's no understatement to say that modding is literally saving this game right now. But every uncommented patch that HG releases makes the modding community shrink a little more, and without proper mod support, HG will just lose all the creative in the modding community and their game will just fade to black.",

With the finished product, it is just hard to imagine in which state the game was, when the hypetrain started at the E3. Until the end, features were advertised, but never made it into the game. This includes but is not limited to a missing multiplayer (even if there is only a slight chance for it), fraction wars that you could join and takes side in, dozens of building and ship presets, missing weather and atmosphere effects and wildlife behaviour/interaction can only be described as 'existing'. There are trillions of planets, that may be true, but every planet is already discovered by some life forms, because every few kilometers you can find an outpost (one and the same from the look of it). They are arrayed in a way too predictable pattern. They all look the same. Inside an alien that you can interact with - of course with repeating dialoges.   How to describe it a bit better? They have created an precedureal generated 'ocean'- true -, but is only a few centimeters deep. Therefore, it is pretty unsatisfying to find either a scrab/bug or an animal with some features of a wolf on every single planet. As a result, the game is highly repetitive and boring.  The game suffers from technical problems as well. It is slow, and not well optimized. You find tearing and stutters. The game freezes and hard locks. When the game is running you see textures streaming in. Objects apear in your sight in tiles or with some kind of static interference before they just pop up. Taking a look on game presentations, you never see a hint of these technical problems. Things don't just stream in. The flora and fauna are presented as rich, dense and big.  Communication after release were turned down to zero. No official statements to the problems with game so far.   I never felt as cheated before as feel with No Man's Sky. Sony and Hello games fueled the hypetrain intentionally, they lied and cheated in there presentations although they new in which state the game was. In the end, No Man's Sky just turned out as an boring repetitive Indie title with early access quality that has been blown up to an triple A title by marketing scamming techniques. Steam should not have any interest in supporting and seeing publisher and creators being successful with such games and this criminally minded strategy.   EDIT: I did not get my refund, which is unfortunate. 60 Euro for 7 hours of boring gameplay and 2 hours of fighting with bugs and idleing in menue. The money would have been better invested in some cocaine or a real sloppy bj, I fear. In the end, it teaches me again to avoid preorders in the future - and properly with that avoid Steam as well. In future, I will rely more on key sellers like 'GeeTwoEY' and other special offer sales. Let it kill the industies margin, I don't care. - But if (!) there will be a preorder game ever again in the future, I will damn ♥♥♥♥ing make sure to put a stop clock to my desk. I will refund the hell of any game whose developer is stupid enough to go the route of Watch Dogs, Arkham Knight or now No Man's Sky.",

I can spend hours wandering around planets and exploring caves and its really enjoyable.   Sadly that all changes when you get into your ship as the flight mechanics are dumbed down beyond words, its utterly impossible to crash your ship into the ground or a mountain, and see that really cool chasm ..oh you can't fly down it as the game won't allow you to fly low enough.  I would give the exploring part of the game 7/10 , however I'd give the flight part of the game 2/10  Sadly the most annoying thing to me is that my PS4 runs the game better than my PC does!  I am above the minimum specs (FX6300 cpu (3.6ghz, 6 cores), 16gb ram, GTX 770 2gb) and yet I'm getting constant fps drops to 13,16,21 fps. and the game is constantly stuttering and has micro-pauses.  I'm hoping the problems will be solved as the game is really fun but I cannot recommended it right now.  Edit:- Having tried countless methods of improving my fps (turning vsync off, putting fps cap to max, lowering all gfx settings, updating nvidia drivers, etc etc) I ran out of things to try, so applied for a refund. The refund was refused as i'd 'played' over 2hrs   Amusingly most of my 'play' time has been trying to fix the framerate and not just sitting and playing, heck, I've not even triggered any of the achievements.  I now hope hello games can patch it so my issues are fixed, otherwise its £40 utterly wasted. Like I said, I do like the game a lot and want to play it. if only the framerate would allow me to.  Update 17th Sept 16 - The game is a little more playable since the first couple of patches hit, however even though my framerate is 50-60fps, it is still stuttering and when the stutter happens the fps drops into single figures, which is really annoying and off putting. I hope future patches fix the stuttering but I've stopped playing the game now and we've not had a patch for like 3 weeks. (Thankfully I stumbled into Subnautica, which although is not a space game, it is a superb 'survival' game and at this current time, is far more fun than NMS is.)  Currently I am treating NMS like a lesson, it taught me never to believe a word of what devs/publishers say and to read reviews/watch streams before I buy any future games.  Perhaps in time NMS will be patched and get great new content that makes it a superb game, but I won't hold my breath. it seems Sean and Hello Games have gone into hibernation.  Update 29/9/16 - I tested it again yesterday after reading there was a new update, the game seemed to be worse to me so I uninstaled it and reinstalled it on my SSD and that made little to no difference. This new patch has made my 'stuttering' worse and the game is unplayable.  Right now I've simply uninstalled the game totally and that's me pretty much done with the game for the foreseeable future.  Edit:- I downloaded the game the other day to try out the 'foundation' update. Sadly its even worse for me, I was getting 7 to 11 fps on all LOW graphics settings. My GTX 770 might not be a top card but it is well above the min required. 7-11fps lol no.. game uninstalled until next patch",

Some planets and creatures are cool and if you enjoy exploring you will probably like it (check my NMS screenies), but the game play loop is extremely tedious and repetitive.  The worst part, though, is that  the game is missing a LOT of features that were promised by devs - some of them are still advertised in the videos shown at HG's site (2014 e3), and they AREN'T in the game:    - Lack of actually massive creatures like the brontosaurus and the sand worms (e3 2014 videos, vgx trailer)   - Lack of animal AI of any kind (seen during e3 2014 trailer, promised by devs countless times). You will see some bigger mobs attacking and killing little ones, but that's all.    - No different/gigantic buildings seen in the trailers - just the same couple of generic buildings on planets   - Every planet has literally thousands of buildings, every star system is littered with life, space stations and ships flying around. There isn't a real sense of discovery since everything you see is already populated.   - Lack of crashed freighters   - No desert (as 'sand-y desert) planets, although we've seen them in various trailers.    - The universe is not an actual universe, but a single, instanced bubble full of planets from where you can jump to another closed instance with a different set of planets; there aren't actual stars, because they're part of each system's skybox. It was promised by Murray that you could fly into a star or into dark space and that's not the case. This won't bother a lot of people, but for me is a massive immersion breaker.   - Different kinds of celestial bodies: ringed planets, rogue planets (they can't be in since there's no deep space in the game and each star system is an instance), etc   - Terrible asteroid pop-in. In the 2014 e3 trailer we saw asteroids really far away and that was really cool and immersive; now they spawn at like 50m from the ship. This points to a downgrade to allow the ps4 to run this game.   - Really low view distance and massive fog. It's basically the same as ps4. Terrible grass/flora generation distance, as opposed to what we've seen during live demos (6:05):          YouTube™ Video:  Sean Murray May Have Replaced Morgan Freeman As God&nbsp;",

Actually all but a couple of planets have had toxic atmospheres, which overall is just a pain in the ♥♥♥ for no gain. I finally found a planet with high sentinels and gravitino balls, which are a cash grab big time, but so what? I fight tons of sentinels for some balls, I manage to buy some better ships.

I really hope as someone who followed this game for years that maybe given a year this game would be worth revisiting and playing but it's time to face facts here, that's not going to happen.",

I is very repetative and in very short order, with the only real story driven aspects of the game fizzling out in the very beginning of your 'adventure.' After that it very quickly becomes tedious and boring.   I think most of us get enough mundane plotting about in our daily lives that we don't need more in the things we invest in for entertainment. Just a few  small  changes would have made a difference, making the game playable for a little longer. Even a simple increase survival risk, enough to actually make it difficult (at least in some areas), might have made a significant impact on player experience, and maybe keeping more player drawn into the challenge a while longer.   It just seems they got so caught up in their own hype around constantly expanding, dynamically generated universe, that they not only forgot 90% of the ingrediants that make up a good game, but they also forgot to put time into building in enough variables to make their endless universe something actually interesting and worth exploring. I kind of doubt that the  idea  they sold to us is possible in reality (at least with their resources and on the scale they were offering), but I fell for the hype because they were so excited about it I started to believe them too.  In real reality that we really live in, like for real... it's a lot like exploring a conveyor belt in a cracker box production line. Sorry, guys, but maybe next time try the under-sell/over-deliver method and lower your price a lot bit.",

It is unfortunate, but for me personally this game really fell flat. I still think it's quite an achievement, what Hello Games have managed to create. Especially given the size of their studio. But it wasn't quite good enough, which is a shame. I wanted to like this game.  When I think of the number of planets in this game (or try to.. it's a freaking big number), and yet there are elements to this game that seem so shallow. The variation of the planets is quite amazing but, the buildings, for one thing, get incredibly boring when you see the same designs on every planet. There are several designs of building and are always found in one of a handful of combinations. There are always the same things to interact with inside those buildings. Ship designs are sometimes quite cool but their function is always the same barring upgrades. Of course that's the whole point of upgrades but I was expecting actual classes of ships. I think that would have added much more depth.  I get that this is a survival and exploration game, so it is expected that you would have to repeat certain activities to ensure your survival. But I just wasn't expecting it to get boring so fast. This is just my view. I am happy that some people are enjoying it and I am sad that others (myself included) are not. I would rate the game 3/5 and sadly, I personally would not (currently) recommend this game.  Perhaps in time with updates, this game will improve. And I will gladly change my review if my opinion of the game changes. I will keep checking back to see what updates they have done and fingers crossed, things get better.",

I hoped for a new patch that would bring something new to the game or at least give me hope of something fun. Nope, just more of the same day after day after day.   And best of all, no refund since I played too long. So if you question whether you like the game after an hour you'd better get a refund.

Do yourself a favor and don't buy new releases through Steam unless you completely trust the developer.  TLDR; Sean Murray oversold this game. Do not buy it in its current state.

Since I like Space and Exploration Games a lot, I thought I would have fun with this. My hopes for this game were very low though but I expected this game to at least work.  And that's where the horrific story begins: It does not work at all on PC. After the first ten minutes, I knew this was a badly done console port and nothing more. Here is a list of bad things I expierenced:  -Textures and objects just being spawned in front of you out of nowhere -Very low level of detail overall. That contains textures and viewdistance -2D-ish Skyboxes for planets. Planets only begin 'materializing' once you come close to them -Not being able to steer your ship like a real plane or spaceship. It feels more like a scripted path where you can steer and shot a little. -Microstutters over and over and over and over again. -No proper Joytick or Mouse support. I could not rebind Melee to my thumbmousebutton for instance and my joystick could not even be used to fly the spaceship. -The entire UI control is obviously a direct console port and simple feels weird on PC. This contains having to hold your LMB to click on something. Every UI element is weirdly controlled over hotkeys or things to press for a while. This system just does not fit on a PC with Keyboard and Mouse controls. -Minearls repeat themselves even on diffrent planets. You will always find the same crystal-ish things that are Plutonium, Aluminium and so on. -At least bird creatures just spawn in out of nowhere, much like objects and textures.    Now some things that are actually great about this game, we have to stay fair, right?  -Planets truly look amazing and have some very awesome landscaping. -Animals, at least from what I have seen, look reasonable but still diverse. They are no aweful monsters but actually look like animals. -Ambient events such as space ships flying by are very well made and give the game a more lively feel. -The Upgrade System in the UI is very clever. Each part of your Suit, Multitool and Spaceship is easily distinguishable and it shows what parts you need to upgrade or rearm that certain thing. -Planets are humongous. -Very colorful artstyle.   Keep your fingers off this! I really hope Hello Games will refine this game A LOT so it becomes a good PC Game but at this moment it is just a giant piece of console port crap.",

The whole idea with the inventory and crafting is a mess, you have limited inventory and ship slots. If you craft an upgrade for your suit it takes a inventory slot, but you can get more suit inventory slots through drop pod (which look all the same again). The thing these is that they cost 10.000 Units more per upgrade, so you get your first new slot for free, the next for 10.000, then 20.000 and so on. The ship slots are even worse, you only get more slots through a new ship, since the upgrades you built for your ship are not movable you loose them when you buy or find a new one. Which leads me on to crafting, cause crafting is all about grinding. Everything you use needs ressources, so your exo-suit needs ressources and your mining laser and so on. So you land on a planet and head out to mine the ressources you need for your ship, suit and mining laser. If you want to upgrade something you have to grind even more, cause the high-level upgrades need a lot of ressources and most of them arent on your planet, so you fly arounf in the galaxy just to grind some more.

None of these elements were part of the game at launch and have still not been added since. I was hugely disapponted to find that, rather than the premium, ground-breaking title we were promised, No Man's Sky played like little more than an unfinished tech demo.  The ships in the game are functionally identical regardless of price or appearance. There are no improved flight dynamics or other advantages to upgrading your ship. The game doesn't even support a joystick which is ridiculous for any space simulation game in 2016. The in-game map is useless for navigation and does not allow you to return to planets you've been to before. Combat is extremely poor and repetitive.  As a fan of exploration games, and with '18 quintillion planets' to explore, I thought there would be plenty in No Man's Sky to keep me busy for a long time, but I found the procedural generation to produce very repetitive environments and such gameplay there is to quickly become tedious. I was already feeling bored after only two hours of play. Contrast this with other games in this genre such as Elite Dangerous, also a 'sandbox' game which I have played for over a thousand hours with no sign of losing interest.  I have only played No Man's Sky for seven hours, and have felt no desire to play at all since August. Content updates have not been provided and the developers have fallen slient. For a supposedly AAA title with a very high price tag of £39.99 I would expect to get hundreds if not thousands of hours of play from the game, not just a handful.  I would not recommend No Man's Sky to anyone interested in the space simulation genre. There is just not enough content there to maintain the interest of serious gamers.",

I was fortunate enough to get my refund in after 12 hours of game play (4 being fun, 8 being me hoping something new happened)  Also for those looking, the two trailers in the Steam preview are both from E3, beta footage.

The potential is there, the terrain generation can be breathtaking and the seamless flight from space to planets feels satisfying. It can even be quite a nice, chilled experience to have a wander around. But the depth just isn't there. Although i scoffed at minecraft comparisons prior to release, it is where my mind keeps returning to now - not because of the obvious mining resources comparison, but because of structure. Although games like minecraft are sandbox games, the crafting mechanic actually provides a satisfying structure of little rewards- as you gain new resources, you can craft better items, letting you reach better resources and construct betters items, and so on. Tasks that are laborious become easier as you build and craft. In No Man's Sky, blueprints for equipment are distrubuted at random, and finding rarer resources to construct some of the rarer blueprints is also random . As upgrading your ship, suit and multitool are the main rewards to chase (the journey to the centre is just that - about the journey, not the destination, and so effectively is just the same as if you wander randomly) this makes No Man's Sky feel unrewarding, and coupled with the first time you see an a.i. creature with a repeated asset or the twentieth time you see that alien plant that looks like an ice-cream wafer stuck in the ground, it all feels very empty. This game leaves me with new admiration for all the sandbox games that I thought I loved because they gave me freedom - I was actually responding to their cleverly designed systems that worked despite their sandbox nature.",

In its current state, which it has been in since its launch, the game will not provide you enough content to keep you entertained for more than a few hours. As soon as all of your gear has been upgraded, there will be nothing new for you to do, and I mean that. Even though the different planets and star system look different, they play out exactly the same - if you've seen one, you've seen them all. Interaction with the game world is also limited to either shooting rocks and other things with your laser or using a dumbed-down simple dialogue system to make the three superficially different alien races grunt in various ways. The game also applies a weird mixture of hand-holding and vagueness, with every resource in your vicinity marked on your 3D-HUD and simplistic combat with next to no challenge paired with a lack of clear direction and purpose. For some, this might be pleasing, but in a world as superficial and one-dimensional as this, it will lead to a lack of enjoyment fast.  On a technical level, it is poorly optimized and badly, especially considering what it is and how it looks. The original score is one of the few positive aspects of the game. For a long time, the game suffered from major pop-ins and ugly draw distance. Another huge issue is the lack of even the most basic communication with the development team. The day of the release marked a sudden blackout of the once active lead devs Twitter, with next to zero talk about the game post-launch. The combination of false promises and lack of open discourse is a cocktail of pure frustration.  Definitely not recommended unless you're looking for a game that allows you to explore mildly varied biomes without major limitations while you create your own motivation to keep going - or if HEAVILY discounted and bundled with a bumper sticker that reads 'I witnessed the biggest disappointment of 2016!'. You're better off playing Minecraft or Star Citizen.",

It is dull and repetative and the inventory system is just a complete abortion and probably one of the most annoying features of any game I have played.  Until this game gets a considerbale content update, vastly more things to do and a completely reworked interface and inventory system, I would pass on this game.  Oh and if any of the developers read these reviews then a word of advice. Staying silent amidst this overwhelming negatvity towards your game is the worst thing you can do. Show the community and customers who have bought your game that you take on board what is being said and have a plan in place to fix it.

Please note that my stats show over 40 hours of playtime but that is not accurate. My actual gameplay time is closer to 12 hours. 12 wasted hours of trying to find a reason to keep playing this 'game.'   I had hoped that I would love No Man's Sky but I barely like it.  No Man’s Sky feels more like a gorgeous looking Alpha release than a complete game.   The “game” consists of flying from planet to planet so you can look at different scenery, plants, and animals while mining different things you need to stay alive. The only quest, so to speak, is to get to the center of the galaxy.   PROS: Beautiful scenery with an insane number of planets to visit. Controls are nice and tight.  CONS: Here is a partial list of what I feel is lacking in No Man’s Sky:  1. Quests – there are no quests other than the core quest. 2. Crafting is ridiculously, laughably simplistic. 3. No benefit to changing spaceships except to increase cargo slots.  a. Note that there is no difference between the types of spaceships other than looks and cargo space.  b.There are no classes of spaceships. All of them handle the same while flying no matter how big or what they look like. 4. No easy way to find your way back to any solar system you visit. 5. Other than survival, there is no reason to mine minerals or trade with the alien races. 6. The price. I would feel like I overpaid for this if I had only paid $20 instead of the $60 that it cost me. 7. Yes, there are a couple of alien races you try to talk to but there is no real reason or payoff for going through the hassle of learinng their language.  I could go on but I won’t bother.  If you are the type of gamer who enjoys walking simulators that don’t really have a point because you feel that it is all about the journey and not the destination, then No Man’s Sky is your kind of game.   I cannot recommend No Man’s Sky in its current iteration. Maybe if they update it, a lot, but not now.  In my opinion, No Man’s Sky is a major disappointment. ",

Here is my refund request that I spent 3 hours on, submitted twice, and was declined both times due to the fact that I had more than 2 hours played.    I acknowledge the fact that I am over the 2 hour limit for most refunds. However my reasoning for this is that I was told by some of the community that the game would get better, more interesting, less grindy. So I kept playing, believing them. Sadly, the game did not meet my expectations. I do not feel that the 2-hour policy is fair in this situation due to the promised minimal amount of gameplay hours to reach the main objective (400 hours!) and the $60 pricetag.  My first reason for wanting to refund this game is that the gameplay footage that Hello Games - the indie devs of the game - released looks nothing like the actual game, and depicted some features that were not in the game. For example, in an interview with Game Informer, Sean Murray - the Managing Director at Hello Games - stated that other players would be able to see your character in the situation that you were both in the same place at the same time. This was proven wrong by two streamers on the first day of release, and the game is believed to lack any sort of visual netcode. These features that were promised are what originally drove me to become interested in No Man's Sky.  My second reason for wanting to refund No Man's Sky is because of it's low system requirements, and poor optimization. I have an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 4G Video Card and an Intel Core i5 4690k processor that clocks in at 3.5ghz, and I suffered from frame drops as low as 9 frames per second. Even some of my friends that were well over the system requirements listed on the Steam Store Page ran the game at a maximum of 25 frames per second.  My third and final reason for wanting to refund No Man's Sky is that Sean Murray recently went back on his statements that Hello Games would provide large amounts of content free of charge, rather than in paid DLC.  Due to the developer's inability to satisfy customers, and their removal of major selling points (that hooked said customers) in the final product, I would expect that a well respected establishment like Valve would offer a refund for people that were dissatisfied with a game that fails to meet the very simple criteria of a game being sold for a AAA price. Please keep in mind that I have only ever refunded one other game, and am a loyal customer with more than 45 paid games.  Thank you for your time and careful consideration of my request.",

Even in areas where you would expect to see life, like busy space stations, they are still lifeless and extremely dull. Multiplayer or not, at least add some more NPCs to places that are going to be busy like stations and outposts to show SOME life besides the one occassional alien who is also completely isolated at a trading post. There's really no excuse for 20 ships to enter a station with several ships also circling around it and the player doesn't see anyone ever come out of a ship or the ship even do anything upon landing. There are overall better games than No Man's Sky in the same genre with and without the sci-fi aspect. Subnautica, GRAV, The Long Dark, Starbound and Elite Dangerous to name a few and even Firewatch comes off as a more interesting walking simulator. Overhyped to ♥♥♥♥ with dull gameplay.

I thought it would be cool and chill exploration, even if a bit overpriced. Well, I got shafted for even thinking that. There's small things this game does that actually makes me think Hello Games had no QA team, and never consulted outside opinions on the game. This goes beyond the general lack of depth as pointed out by a lot of reviewers, although it does overlap. Here are things that stick out to me:  - Every planet seems to generate terrain on a sort of random sine wave kinda pattern with little variation. Land only flattens out a bit near some outposts. There's not even coding for specific biome presets or stuff to appear, like Minecraft did (which had procedural world generation too!). Its all just a sloppy, random mess. There needs to be some order but also actually cool and unique things to generate in order for me to feel like I'm exploring an interesting world.  - The textures are just bad in general and feel ripped straight from console, which is probably the case  - STOP GOING WIDESCREEN FOR EVERY MILESTONE AND EVERY NEW ALIEN MET. Is this intended to be good design?  - A lot of people have reported seeing similar animals with very little variation. I have heard from at least 10 people that they have seen the pineapple looking creature. Exploring seems to lose a sense of uniqueness when you figure this out.   - Give me an indication of where I'm actually going to land. I understand that coding flying close to the ground is tricky, but you can do it better Hello Games  - YOU CAN'T SET A WAYPOINT TO GO BACK TO YOUR PAST DISCOVERIES. WHHHYY. Remember:  This is a 60$ game   - Animals seems to have 3 behaviors only: run around and coo like idiots when they see you, attack you, or not care. This is all they do. Nothing else. No attempts to code ecosystems or more advanced behaviors.   - The sentinels being nearly everywhere on every planet is stupid. I hate fighting them because it lacks depth, and there is no real purpose given to them.  - Hazards like cold, hot, toxic, and radioactive all behave the exact same, just a different color and text. How long has this game been worked on?  My favorite thing about this game is the space flying, and approaching big planets at light speed, and then I feel a letdown realizing that there will probably be nothing memorable about the planet itself.   Hello Games, please, work on this game more. Make it worth our money. DO NOT PUT OUT PAID DLC UNTIL YOU MAKE THIS GAME WORTH IT. I understand a lot of problems can be pinned on Sony, but try to open your eyes to your criticism. We deserved much better from you.   1.1 UPDATE: Game definitely has more content, I will update this review after I play it more. Still not worth 60$ by any reasonable means as of yet.",

It's become a historic event as one of the largest bait and switches in the gaming community.   I think it's fair to say they never finished the game. Some things I found most disappointing: -All planets are very similar. (mostly just rocky, moon-like, repeating realms) -No multiplayer. -No story. (literally the story never finishes, it just takes you back to the beginning). -Ships are all the same aside from aesthetics.  -Predictable, formula based interactions with aliens. -Space battles are lacking. -And some many other small things.  In summary, this game is not complete. Its infamous in the fact that the creator has duked us all. There is no reason why anyone should purchase this unfinished product.  ",

In the 2ish hours that I have logged in this game, over an hour of it was spent trying to get it to actually work well on my PC, which is far better specced than the reccomended. In the other hour I actually played the game, I expereinced about everything that one could. I know this because after returning the game, I bought it again on my PS4 as a good friend of mine told me it performed well at least on the system. I enjoyed the game well enough in the hour that I had really played the game that I figured it was worth it. He was right, it performed much better, but after another hour of playing, I had accomplished pretty much the same amount that I had on my PC, and had nothing to do. I tried exploring new planets, but they were all pretty much the same, just with a different color scheme and most of them were already discovered. I tried making it a goal to learn a language, but it didn't help any as I never had issues trading with the other species in the game. I tried making a ton of money, which took me about 30 minutes to get to the point where I had enough money to buy the best ship I could find and still have enough money left over to buy 2 more. I tried hunting pirates, but because it only took me 30 minutes to get the best ship in the game, it was a breeze.   So to sum up. The absolute base idea of the game is brilliant and highly enjoyable. However, once you understand the base system, you are pretty much done with the game. If you get this game, you'll probably enjoy it for an hour, 2 at most, and that's because this isn't really a game.  It's a survival game that has no survival aspects.  It's a crafting game that allows you to do everything without ever crafting.  It's a shooting game that you don't ever have to shoot in.  It's an exploration game with nothing to explore.  It's an economy game with it's primary source of income as powerful as a cheat code.  It's an adventure game with no goal.  It's a game with no purpose.",

You can miss the planets you need the resources for, or hardly ever find them. The ships don't matter, it's the space they provide that does. And even then they are mostly ugly and all handle the same. I had high hopes, as we all do for games we want to succeed. But between the failed promises and the gameplay, this is a complete bust.

All Upgrades to weapons and ships are found in a matter of hours. The words you learn to communicate with aliens don't seem to matter since the game pretty much interprets their intentions for you. And even if you choose a wrong answer, the worst you can expect is the loss of a little health (which regenerates by itself).

Even if they work on it for two more years at the pace they were going I don't feel like this would stand up to the claims. On it's own merit, it's a fun short game that would be perfectly acceptable for a 10$ price tag but it's unreasonably overpriced. You can play for about 4 hours before you start getting disapointed, and drag it to 10 hours tops. There's just nothing to do at this point.

They made a ♥♥♥♥ing killing and got away with it. The gameplay is dull and extremely repetitive. The grinding becomes unbearable very quickly. The 'story' is awful. You have the normal ending (Getting to the center of the universe). What happens when you get there? Nothing. Not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. You see a bright light, and then you get teleported to a new universe to do the same. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Grind. Then, you have a second ending with the Atlas that's even worse, somehow. Oh god, the Atlas 'ending'. Ohhhh my god, this ♥♥♥♥ing ending.  The Atlas's ending allows you to make a new universe, but to do that, you have to have 10 'Atlas stones' that you'd collect along the way. That's not so bad on its own, right? Well sure, but if you sell them you can never get them back, they are near impossible to find and buy in the universe, and the worst part: You don't have any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clue until it's too late. That's right. You are given stones that sell for a high price and are not shown to have any use, and if you sell them, you cannot complete the Atlas ending. This game makes me angry. Angry I wasted my time in it. Angry at the lazy, slimy developers and their unapologetic lying to the public. Angry that I spent money on it in the first place. Just...angry.  Okay, so this review has been a rant so salty it could cause an overdose if read too quickly, but I feel like that's the right way to feel about this game.

Admittedly, Hello Games received much more hype than they'd wanted, but when you've land yourself in that situation, and you have Sony backing you, it should have been a good problem to have, but instead it became a missed opportunity.  The game by itself is okay, definitely for a niche market in it's current state, but even for what it is, it isn't worth $60.  Pros: - Experience of 'seamlessly' going between planets/systems is cool - Visuals are quite nice on certain planets - I experience fast load up times  - I had no issues running this game (only 1 crash so far), but I'm sure I'm a minority   Cons: - Game gets repetitive very fast - Combat system is very boring and even when upgrading your ship, you don't feel any stronger - Flight controls are clunky, and have an artifical barrier (can disable with mods) - No clear end game, just grinding to upgrade your ship and then to explore - Not enough variety within a planet, for the most part, you can go to a planet, fly around for 2 minutes, and then you'll know pretty much everything that planet has to offer - All space stations look the same in the inside - All building/bases you encounter (which will be many) on planets all follow the same 3 templates  - Interaction with NPCs are repetitive and superficial   The game was clearly marketed deceptively, only to realize there are alot of things missing that were explicitly stated would be in the game (eh hem...even a slgiht chance of multiplayer).  At time of writing, I have 24 hours of playtime, which is alot considering I don't like the game. I was waiting for this game since i heard of it, and was following its developement since announcement. This is not the game most people think it is. I noticed Sean trying so hard to manage expectations, always saying 'this game will be divisive' or 'this is what No Mans Sky is' and this is what 'No Mans Sky isn't', and it was disheartening to see why he was being such a Debbie downer about this game...and now I know why.  I tried to manage my expectations and tried to filter through all the hype, and at the end of the day I expected a game solely focused on exploration and discovery and some combat with the chance of meeting your friends. However, I also expected that there would be some variety and elements to keep me wanting to explore, but there is not.   If No Man's Sky becomes the game everyone wishes it to be through updates, then perhaps I'd buy it again, but for right now, it's simply not worth the $60 as it certainly feels like the scope of the game is unfinished.",

Good to know for the future not to give any game any chance of redeeming itself before hitting the refund button. It’s not like I even wanted the cash back – I wanted a Steam credit because I know exactly the game I would get instead – Elite Dangerous Horizons. I have played 200 hours of the original release of Elite Dangerous and loved that, even with its initial release quirks and restrictions because I knew exactly what I was buying.

            "review_text": "So, No Man's Sky. I have bought the game on the wave of hype it has received and has got to play for quite a bit in it. I did hear the first days the game was out that it was something great and fresh, though probably not as much as it has been advertised, but I did not seem to care. My biggest mistake was trying to care about the pre-order, and not actually waiting for a lot of reviews, as I did before with other games - I followed the hype build around the game.  But finally, I can tell I found out tons of issues with the game, and not in the usual meaning: it is actually mostly connected with the way the game has been advertised, with how it has been shown by Sean Murray and Hello Games at various cons.  The first part, important for me is actually the multiplayer - I do really enjoy the not-so-MMO multiplayer parts, like the system the Dark Souls series (including Demon Souls and Bloodborne) uses: you have got your own world, and you can get a bunch of visitors in it, without need or even ability to cross your way with 10+ players simultaneously, creating small, rather random lobbies for a short while. But obviously, as it was found out by some streamers, the final game seem to lack this ability, and I relate to two Twitch streamers, that has come to the same spot of the planet, and could not see each another.  Second part, is the actual 'uniqueness' of the universe. Better say, the quality of that uniqueness, since taking a closer look, you do realize that summing up all the planet terrains, flora and fauna you actually always visit different planet. The trouble is, that there is just a tiny little bit of differences between a 'hooved cat-like creature' on planet A and on a planet B, which is really sad. Besides, it is even worse that the fauna follows very simplistic rules of actions, not talking about what has been advertised: the game trailers, showing the small herbivorous creatures going to the river-side t oget water/whatever it might be on the alien planet.  Third important thing for me, were ships. I obviously did not expect the ability to build your own gear, as it is possible in games like Space Engineers, or Starmade, but at least some class diversity? Traders, warriors, explorers - any type of 'profession' a player would choose is not going to require a special ship to get acquired, they are all  the same .  Fourth part of the game I have been highly disappointed in, is the actual NPC part - it is done very lazily. Like, you have got tons of NPCs scattered all over the world (even, worlds), literally sitting in their tiny little corners of the galaxy and doing nothing. I am not talking about the fact that such placement of NPC characters makes it sound kind of silly, when you happen to be the actual 'first explorer' of the planet - these NPCs seem to have been here for a while, even making a sort of infrastructure on the planet, including trading posts and things. Heck, you can even find various monoliths to find out about the races' past, and even the actual ruins! On the planets, you have explored the first. It does sound quite... Stupid, at the very least.  Bugs, oh well. This is another part of the game, and I only can tell I have not encountered tons of them. And my solution was simple: I switched the game's language to English. The most of the drops of the game I had seemed to be connected with the localization, the game did look like it has failed to write out technology names in Russian, when I tried to get reward after talking with NPCs. And I can't tell this is a big deal for me, but still something... Sad.   This far, the game does not either cost it's money, or time to really bother playing it - just go watch trailers and enjoy them. Hello Games has made a different game, not something they have advertised. Though probably charging for it as for an AAA project, they might have enough means to fulfil their promises.",

The art style is certainly neat, and there is a certain satisfaction in the first few hours where you explore, collect and fix your ship and take off for the first time. The mini-game of finding new alien language words and deducing what the aliens you meet are saying is legitimately enjoyable from a puzzle point of view.  But the biggest problem is that very little of what we were promised was delivered. What we got was a sterille galaxy of planets with bioms that become quickly samey. What is the point of having zillions of worlds that really aren't that different? Even the planets shown in the promotional materials don't match what you see in the game.   What was the biggest problem was that the hype train got away from them, and rather than slowing it down and making expectations more realistic. It was treated as if was a AAA game from a major studio when it was pretty much an indie game. If there is one take away from NMS, its that to never trust another game from a new studio on a new property. I'd rather blind buy the next Call of Duty spit out by the EA sweatshops than anything resembling this.   The fact Steam won't give blanket refunds on the game is very dissapointing. Never before have so many people been taken in by slick marketing and a general desire to see a small studio pull off a great game in a sea of AAA titles that over promise and under deliver",

            "review_text": "No Man's Sky is a sci-fi space survival exploration crafting game. A very barebones, Early Access Alpha, tech demo version at that. In hindsight, for me the best part about it was anticipating the day it would come out rather than playing the game. Anyways for the actual review I'll try to be as unbiased and objective as I can. Skip to the last paragraph for my opinion on it.  You start off on a random planet very very far away from the center of the Euclid Galaxy. The object is to reach the center of said galaxy. You have an exosuit that will protect you from hazardous environments and allows you to carry materials that you'll need to sell for money or to craft upgrades or repair/fuel your starship. Now the starship, it's broken in the beginning. You'll need to use your handy multi-tool to mine materials needed to fix the ship. You can find the materials you need by scanning the local area. There can be some hostile creatures and these self-replicative machines called sentinels which may or may not attack you depending on the planet you are on. Another way to get money is to upload all the flora and fauna you've scanned. There are also journey milestones you can reach when specific feats are accomplished. There are also space stations and outposts &amp; shelters where you can interact with static NPCs. You can learn their language so you can better understand them and try to figure out the correct solution to their questions. And if you're succesful they'll reward you with crafting blueprints or materials. If you have millions of this game's currency you can also buy a ship from a docked NPC or if you're broke, you can hunt down a crashed ship to repair it and make it your own.  There's also a mysterious entity named Atlas you can follow if you need some direction. The Atlas path has objectives to complete and waypoints to go to. There are also some helpful NPCs named Nada and Polo inside of spacial anomales that will aid you in your journey. As for game progresson, You will need to mine (or trade for) materials to fix your ship and refuel it. Then you can start flying around your solar system and complete Atlas Objectives until you're able to fix your ship's hyperdrive. Then you'll need to craft Warp Cells to fuel your hyperdrive so you can explore other star systems and begin the long journey to the center. There are short cuts you can take however. Nada and Polo can show you where Black Holes are that will take you considerably closer to the center. Why Hello Games decided to call them Black Holes and not Worm Holes (which makes more sense) is baffling to me but I digress. So that's basically it. Fix ship, fuel hyperdrive, fly towards center making frequent stops to gather materials to craft more Warp Cells and upgrade your Ship, Exosuit and Multi-tool all while learning alien languages and uploading your discoveries.  And now for my thoughts on it. This is probably one of the worst games I could not stop playing. At 60 dollars I wanted to justify the amount of money I spent so I set a personal goal for myself. Get 100% achievements and complete all the journey milestones. And I did that...it took 86 hours. And I didn't even have to reach the center of the galaxy, in fact, I'm not even halfway there and I have no desire to reach it after looking it up on youtube and seeing how much of a slap-in-face dissapointment it is. There are some fundamental problems with this game such as there isn't much to do and you have to repeat the steps of progression ad nauseam. Which is fine for the first few hours and then you're like...'oh my god, this is going to be the whole game, isn't it?' Technically, the ship controls are very clunky, there's a lot of texture pop-in which totally breaks immersion as well some hitching (which seems to be a word I've never seen or used in this context until this game) and stuttering when textures are loading in. Though I assume if you have a solid state drive that wouldn't be as bad but I dunno. If I had to mention one thing I DID like about the game, the music is pretty awesome. Anyways, even with all the hours I put into it, at $60 I would not recommend this game. I'd say wait a year for Hello Games to add more content and get the game at a heavily discounted price.

Pre-ordered No Mans Sky based on developer craic as well as pre-release videos, etc, etc - realised that it would probably be more of a chilled experience but at least it would have variety and some cool stuff to do.  No. It really doesn't. I'm sure the performance problems I had are patched out by now but even so, this is less of a game and more of a tech-demo. The first 2 hours of the game are quite good, there's a sense of exploration and wonder and progress and all that good stuff. Then the rest of the game is basically the EXACT same as the first 2 hours, on a different nameless planet with the EXACT same looking faceless alien who says the EXACT same thing as the first alien you encountered only this time he's selling you a 16 slot multitool instead of a 12 slot one.  I'm being as honest as I can here guys, this game is severely boring. Once you've done the 'space to planet and back to space' a couple of times, you start to see how simple and unengaging the game actually is. Many people knocked Elite : Dangerous for being repetive, etc, but at least that game had dynamic combat and you could use a HOTAS stick, and controlling your ship was a challenge and you could use VoiceAttack to make it so your guns deployed when you said 'Weapons hot!' into your mic (just me then?).  In short, I wouldn't recommend this game as it lacks any engaging gameplay elements outside of the first 2 hours initial experience. My playtime is short because the game did not give me any incentive to continue.  3/10",

            "review_text": "*No Man's Sky - More like One Man's Lie*  Thing about NMS is that it is an amazing concept, but as said by a fellow reviewer here on Steam - A mile Wide, but an inch Deep.  I bought this game unknowingly that the boss of hello games, Sean Murray, had lied trough the whole waiting process from the start to its release. An example is how he lied about how you can meet other players and you will be able to see them and interact with them, but that the chances where miniscule that you would ever see them in such a wast space.   Guess what happened when two players who coincidentally ended up in the same universe. they got in contact through steam nicks and met up.  Nothing, not even a blocky 8 bit minecraft looking script :(  And this could be excusable if it was like when Sean commented on it:   ''Umm... Heh Umm dats weird, we didnt expect dat two players would meet up, hehh ummm dats weird, probably a script failure for that galaxy, umm dats why they couldnt commmunicate or see eachother, heh umm dats weird..'' &lt;- Him Probably watered his pants and thinking ''OH SHET WE GOT BUSTED''  Problem is that people have met more that once in game, not only on pc, but also ps4, everyone experiencing the same problem.  That leads to one conclusion, since the problem is cross devices, and and not just in one specific galaxy, the conclusion is: he is a liar, and that is what pisses me off, if it was just a script mistake i wouldnt care, but that little Tw*t Sean Murray is lying straight to our faces.  Also the Tw*t Sean first claimed that there will be no paid DLC, but hocus pocus abracadabra he damage controlled af and backtrack saying Qoute: ''That statement probably wasnt a good idea''  And as said the game is extremely shallow, and if you want to enjoy it like i did to an extent, you have to try really really hard to enjoy it.  And i dont even want to touch that piece of garbage ending (reaching the center) with a 300 foot pole  That leads me to my Pro/Cons  *Pros:* - Cool concept - Fun to explore different planets (the 5 first, after that its basically the same) - Really Cool environment, but as said it gets extremely repetivive  *Cons:* - They lied - Its basically the same shet planets after 5 of them - 60 Euro's Wtf - the shet ending, feels like you are one step from suicide (srsly i feel so bad for that pilot) - HE STRAIGHT UP LIED TO US - You have basically explored the whole game within the first 2 hours, after that its AAALL THE SAME - Mindlessly and boringly mining for resources is the most action you ever get in this game  Conclusion: This basically sums up The whole game, and if it was priced 10 Euros it would be a pretty good game from an indie developer, but for a triple A price tag this is just ridicilous. The bugs would have been understandable if the bugs where a mistake, but Sean tries to sneak his way out of every tough situation, lies all the time and does not seem to be interested in solving these bugs.   Definitively the best feature of this game is that the game is so bad that it has ruined Sean Murray's career as a game developer for the rest of his life.  60 Euro price tag rating - 1.5/10 5 to 10 Euro price tag rating - 6/10",

While it's not a horrible game (i have played far worse) it didn't appear to deliver many of the core features Hello Games promised. I understand our hype, as a community, set the game up for failure. That beaing said, I did enjoy the game at first, until i found it was the same thing over and over again. While it is satisfying to complete something you've been working towards, and there are some very interesting planets to be found, it becomes stale and tedious. Overall i think it all goes back to the overinflated expectations of both the fans and the game company. On top of all of that, it uses resources like crazy. I, by no means have the greatest computer, and it was fine. But every time i jumped to another system or got close to a new planet, the game seemed like it was having an epileptic episode. The music is great, the art style is nice, the idea is creative, the UI is clean. but those don't compensate for the negative traits. Unfortunately",

            "review_text": "So, long story short, I preordered when the false promises seemed real, and went over the two hour playtime line without being able to play. Longer story is that I preordered this game due to what it was promised to be. Shortly after I preordered, I learned that it wasn't what was promised, but still hoped it would be worthy of my money. The game released and I was still excited to play.  Upon starting up the game I was greeted by major graphical problems. And what I mean by that is nearly everything, except for smoke particles, and a few random bits and pieces, was invisible. I thought I needed to just adjust some settings, I spent nearly two hours doing that, and it didn't work. II decided since I was over the two hour refund time, I might as well continue to get this to work. stumbling through the invisible land, I hunted for materials to fix my ship. I eventually gathered them and promptly headed towards another planet hoping it would be fixed. It wasn't.  Afterwards I decided I'd try the age old tactic of deleting, and redownloading the game. That didin't work either. Eventually I found out my graphics card wasn't supported. Luckily, I was talking with my brother-in-law, and he knew I was still pumped for the game. Without my knowledge he sent a supported graphics card, and the game then worked. I kind of feel sorry for disliking this game so much because of that.  So, with the game now working, I promptly start my space adventure. And so I was promptly bored. After a handful of planets, I realised that each planet, each galaxy, was just going to be the same thing with minor changes. What these minor changes are, is things like, oh this planet has gold, this planet has iridium, these animals are just slightly different colored than the animals on a planet two galaxies away. I mean, even things like radiation, heat, and freezing, are all simply treated the same way, it just changes the planets color. In a universe of unimaginable number of planets, everything feels the same after maybe 3 planets.  And it is these reasons and a few more, that I would more then not recommend this game, but heavily wish I was able to get a refund. The only thing with that, is that I spent more than two hours on this game and so therefore I am banned from getting a refund, even though at least two of those are from trying to get it to be playable.",

I might not have had a problem with this had I not paid £39.99 for it but I did - more fool me. I think part of the problem is me though, I was so hyped about this game, I watched loads of press about it for the two years before it came out, perhaps I expected too much? Or perhaps promises were made that were not kept. Either way, do youself a favour and wait for it to be a fiver in a Steam sale and bear in mind it's a prototype indie game (but not a good one).

You literally travel to the same planets only with different colors. Hello Games said they had an algorithm for producing different planets that are all unique. Well I figured out that algorithm and it is very simple you can apply it to any game you already own. Ready? Just set your monitor’s RGB setting to a different color. That is really all there is to it. I have to hand it to Hello Games for using this method everyone can explore their planets in any game they already own.   Just yesterday I explored a planet called San Andreas with three different explorers. It was a big and populated planet with a major city to the south and an arid climate to the north. The sun was interesting to it produced a blue tint that made everything look colder than what it seemed. I got to drive different vehicles that the natives developed which consisted of cars, planes, boats, and motorcycles. It also seemed to be the easiest planet to meet friends for I had no problem meeting with friends and other explorers to tackle the various events that the locals prepared for us. It was a nice planet with a humanoid population and with a very determined police force if you got to out of hand.

At the very beginning I was very excited to finally play it and it was wonderful. Discovering stuff, naming it, seeing wrecked buildings with a weird goo all over, buying you first ship and multi-tool, going on the first warpdrive, all just awesome. The game presented very few of the things we were promised (just the basics), but I kept playing, expecting that calling in wingmen would come when I became friends with one of the factions (I had the *Close Relationship* status with the Vy'keen), but it never happened. I hoped that I could play it for hundreds of hours, but after one week I got bored. Then all of the performance issues came, as if it wasn't bad enough already. I play on a laptop, but I get to play games like War thunder and EA Battlefront with pretty good graphics and 60fps, so NMS, with it's comiclike graphics, should work just fine. It ended up running at 30fps at most and when they fixed it, Hello Games had already lost it. I mean, how did that get through testing?  UPDATE. I have looked through the patch notes of the game to look if some weeks of feedback from the community would get them to create new stuff for the game, but all they did was introduce fixes to the very basic mechanics and fixing bugs. This game has taken too much time to develop but HELLO GAMES clearly rushed it out as soon as possible. It's so easy to think that the testing was done by The CEO and other lead positions, who missed any and all errors. While busy worshipping their own creativity and innovation in the game industry, they made mistakes not even Super Mario Brothers made. Shame on you HELLO GAMES, go do a Joe Danger reboot.",

            "review_text": "Although the game had a promising start for me ultimately I am forced to admit it is disappointing. I regret paying full price and I have to recommend against most people paying full price. I'm a little torn on that, but that's where I sit today.  I really like to support independent studios and interesting, unusual projects- things that get out of the ruts that the AAA titles tend to fall into. No Man's Sky definitely did this, and it did it big with a completely unique premise and some genuinely impressive advancement of game technology.  It also gave me among the better first 10 or so hours of gameplay that I've experienced in any game, AAA or otherwise. Sure there were technical issues, but they didn't break the game for me personally and they've already largely been resolved- this is not Arkham Knight and the bugs are not the problem. Looking past those the promise is there and at first No Man's Sky feels like something really special. The world and creature generation are great, the tone of lonely exploration is spot-on, and the sound is simply amazing. In fact I would absolutely buy the sound engine of the game alone as a standalone infinite soundscape generator with adjustable parameters.  So... why do I regret the purchase?  There's really no away around this, but we got lied to about this game.  It's not that the game is truly awful. For something so ambitious it's really not that far off the mark, actually. But sadly it is filled with direct contradictions to how it was sold to us. And what's worse those direct contradictions sum up to a game that was sold to us as a robust product worth a standard $60 price tag that really didn't turn out to be one.  This is not just a matter of overzealous marketing, self-hype, or even the common sin of playing cinematics instead of gameplay at E3, either. This was the creator and lead developer of the game saying things that simply turned out to be untrue about major features in the game that don't exist. There are whole ways of playing he described in rather vivid detail that simply aren't in the game. Even worse we were shown what was claimed to be gameplay footage that looks very little like the game and contains tons of really cool things that simply aren't there.  I kept on playing for about 30 hours expecting to find some of them... And I didn't. Gradually I realized there just wasn't going to be much more to the game than those first 10 or so hours.  I know games change a lot between pre-alpha and release, and I'm fine with that, but that's not at all what this feels like. This feels like Sean Murray pitched a lot of ideas that sounded great and that maybe he genuinely believed they'd be able to implement... But that weren't actually in the game and that turned out, perhaps, to be impractical to implement after all. In other words it's more like a Kickstarter-funded project in Early Access on Steam than it is a release build of a full priced game.  We were told about and actually shown, in what was supposedly real play, sentinel walkers lying dormant and awakening as we approached, vast windswept deserts with smoothly rendering-in scenery as you approached from space, capital ship battles between factions that we could meaningfully join on one side or the other, a continuously operating economy, and unique ships that we could discover and name, an infinite world of ships just as it is an infinite world of everything else, with the perfect one for every playstyle out there somewhere. Literally none of these things are there, among many others. And that doesn't even touch on the epic disappointment of the game's conclusion compared to how the mystery of it was teased to us.  What we got that WASN'T promised however are a lot of questionable choices that all seem designed to slow gameplay down. Things like absurdly long button presses to perform actions, constant manual recharging of equipment, painfully limited inventory, and awkward equipment upgrades. The cynical part of me wonders if it's to keep you playing long enough to go past any reasonable return window.  Bearing all of that in mind if Sean Murray's interviews had really been a Kickstarter pitch and the game was currently in Early Access for, say, $30 or so, I'd be happy. $20 and I'd be absolutely delighted. Either one and I'd not only be glad to have bought it but I'd also recommend it to everyone as an incredibly promising project to support. I'd be looking forward to seeing it finished, actively involvd in the community, probably even writing mods and maybe even hoping they might integrate some of my own ideas in the game. I would being saying it would be worth $60 when finished.  So who knows? Maybe in a year, if they continue to work on it and deliver on all the promises they made, as if this were a weirdly executed kickstarter, I might change my mind. Those first 10 hours really do feel like they were going in the right direction and there are a lot of things to love about the game. I don't think they have any financial incentive to do actually do as much more development as is needed now though, but if I'm wrong and they do it as a matter of honor or commitment I'll gladly, eagerly, change this review.  But as of today, even with most of the technical issues fixed, there are simply far too many unfulfilled promises for me to recommend this game.",

To be fair, I often have trouble sleeping, so that's somewhat of an achievemnent I guess. But about 15 to 20 hours of my 'play' time for this game were spent asleep.   I was one of those who boarded the hype train early on. Unfortunately, the last stop that the hype train makes is often in dissapointment town; which is where I currently find myself.   The first few hours were truly a great experience. The next twenty, however, were tedious. After that I played for the sole purpose of getting to the center of the galaxy. I spent hours grinding warp cells to travel from star system to star system, excited at what I would find when I finally 'finished' the game.   Spoilers are incoming, but you're actually probably going to want to know this before you play. So what's at the center?         Nothing. The game shoots you to the edge of another galaxy, and you get to start the whole process over again. All that build up, all those hours, and the game laughs in your face. And it was this, for me, that really sealed this game's review. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game. In its current state, it truly feels unfinished.

            "review_text": "This game is a lie, a scam and total waste of your time. It was my first, only and last pre-order. I watched the promotional material on this game. I swallowed the lies of big boy Sean. I tried to gave this game a chance even after the shaky launch, the missing content,everything.    I will go on and tell you right now: This game is not worth buying. This is the new Aliens: Colonial Marines. The planets are, said lightly, stale, boring, repetitive. If you've visited about 10 planets, chances are you've already seen every posibility of planets. There is literally nothing else for you there. The animals are stupidly made most of the time and make absolute no sense compared to what was advertised.   I will go into every point of the matter at a time and tell you what is wrong with it and why, in my opinion, this game should be 20$ max. This 60$ purchase shouldn't include an extra ship for the pre-order. It should include 5 DLCs, activation of online player interactions, map packs and animal packs, enhanced space mechanics, a god damn ending, a purpose to play after learning the truth about both the center of the galaxy and the atlas path, and a hell of a lot more featured promised and promoted up until launch day by the devs and never put into the game.   Game mechanics    Simple at best. Combat si dumbed down to the level where you feel dumb yourself after you feel a tiny bit of satisfaction when you manage to kill something. Flying your ship around is not the most pleasant experience, especially with keyboard and mouse. Space combat, well, i frankly found it close to impossible with keyboard and mouse, the only thing that saved me from space encounters was the beam weapon that had autolock if you aimed aproximately around your target. On foot combat is not way better either.   'What do you do in this game?!' - cry. cry for your money and for your time, because after about 12 hours of playing the game i was done with the atlas path and i was disappointed. Right now I'm close to getting to the center of the galaxy but the urge to know what is there was too bad so I googled it an hour ago and what I found angered the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. I will not specifically say what it is, but trust me, if you're looking for closure after such a long journey, if you look for a reason to get there, you will not be pleased. I myself am infuriated actually.    Surviving is not surviving   It was my first survival game played that I spent more than 30 minutes in and I never, not even once felt in danger of not making it. I have played the game for 56.6 hours now, I have managed to raise a stupid amount of money ever since my starting planet, it being filled with sac venom, and get the best ship and full exosuit after hours of farming and I have died 2 times in this game. First was when i was farming, because i was spawned on a planet rich af, and second when i was first attacked in space when i didn't have the beam weapon and i realised that space battles are impossible with keyboard and mouse. And I wasn't attacked by 20+ ships as you'll encounter later in the game. I was attacked by exactly 3 ships. The only thing you have to survive is the urge to leave a planet where you've found a way to farm stupidly well, other than that, there is no immediate threat for you.     Fighting    I guess I covered a part of this one in the previous section. Pretty good variety of multi-tool mods for combat, but tbh I have used the basic one until very very late in the game and had no problem. Space was advertised to have big freigters and big space combats with more than 4 freigters attacked by lots of ships. The biggest amount of ships attacking as many as 4 freigters i saw were 21. Being a pirate is impossible. You need stuff only found on planets. I have visited so many stars until now being about 30k light years away from the center and I am yet to find Omegon on space stations or by destroying ships.    Trading   Give up the hopes for ever being a full trader. As it seems you have trade routes marked by lines when you're in space but they are useless. Farm highly expensive things on a planet where there is a lot of them and profit. That is trading. Other than that, complete lies sold to us by Sean and Hello Games.   Explore   10 planets for an hour each if they're all different then only visit them once you need supplies.   The atlas path   Giant disappointment. Only thing you get out of it sounds cool but it's practically useless to you and the other useful thing helps you get to the center which is another disappointment   The center of the galaxy   The giant disappointment of the atlas path multiplied by the number of light years you traveled to get here. Biggest let down i've ever felt in a video game after all that was advertised by Hello Games.   Mods   The only good thing about this game. Modders have made it possible to play the game on low end pcs, fly your ship under water and close to the planet surface, change the way space looks so it's more realistic, change the speed of both your character and your ship as you please, and even more to come once they can actually get complete access to mod everything they can in the game which i believe happened already a couple of days ago.   Multiplayer/Online   Non-existant/Irrelevant. There have been streamers trying, I was unfortunate enough to get my hopes shatered that it was just a launch issue a couple of days ago when i started playing and I actually found a star a player visited hours before me and we met up on the space station and didn't interact or see each other at all and met up on the closest planet and didn't find each other. Online component. The only online thing about it is that the things you rename/discover can be seen by others as discovered by you. Otherwise, non-existant as well.    Factions and AI   Factions were another big lie we swallowed whole. The 3 races evolve separately one from another and you can max out all 3 of them without conflict despite the fact that they are sworn enemies and some decisions imply harming another race. ( I had to chose wether i let a Vy'keen to build a bomb or not aka give him plutonium to build it or not and I could chose to let him do it knowing it would hurt a bunch of Gek without losing reputation with the Gek whom i have, at this point, directly harmed and gaining reputation with the Vy'keen ). The animal AI is simplistic. It attacks you or another animal or it roams around. Nothing else. Fauna doesn't influence the world around it whatsoever.   What about them beautiful rich fine a** looking planets from the promos?    Lies m8. People searched the game data packs and it's prebuild hand crafted stuff, not procedually generated like the bunch of misery we get to play on.    Worth your money?   Falls into the 'Hell(n)o Games' catergory. There are missing features. Repetitive dialogue, puzzles and interactions. Repetitive gameplay without any actual reward at the end. Nothing to justify the triple A price. In my honest opinion, the only fascinating and intriguing fact about the game is the technology behind it. That a game so gigantic is only 2.5GB in size and once you mod out some of the things in it you can run it on a low end pc without any issues. Another nice feature is the lack of loading screens in the game. This game is a tech demo. An over hyped, over priced tech demo, hyped with lies that fails to deliver more than half of what it promised and with any path you approach in this game ending in a giant disappointment. This game would've been better if it were made by EA Games even if they filled it with cash grabbing microtransactions and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs. The game launched weeks ago and I still get crashes in it after a couple of patches.",

However, it defied my expectations by being actually released and by (theoretically) fulfilling all its promised qualities. The PS4 release seemed to affirm all these qualities and really give the Steam lot a great deal of hope for the release.  What actually happened was quite an embarrasing chaos of galactic proportions of crashes, shocking FPS rates, as well as many other issues. My system far exceeds the minimum requirements and yet in virtually every location, the frame rate was abysmal. If the planet had any water/vegetation/abundant wildlife, it was unplayable (I am talking 10FPS). The promise of more `exotic' and lush planets closer to the centre of the galaxy is enough to keep me to the outer rim, thank you very much. The actual content of the game is arguably what I had expected and I do not fault the developers for it, but the presentation of the product is what makes me NOT recommend this at all. There is simply no point paying 39.99GBP or $60 on something which is not finished and has clearly been inadequately tested. If any of you have tried the current version of `Stranded Deep' or other such early releases, this is actually more skeletal than that (and those actually run well). The talk of paid DLC in the future at this stage is actually hilarious. In any case, after updating my drivers today, the game stopped loading altogether, so confirming the waste of money.   Theoretically, as entitled as the gamer community sees itself, this would be a great time to point out that developing a game is a very difficult task and as consumers we need to appreciate what we have. Developing a game featuring an entire (albeit procedurally generated) universe is insane. However, professionally developed software needs to be written efficiently and tested before release. The release of patches which have minimal effect on performance is amateur if anything. Perhaps they should have focussed on a simpler project which they could have actually done well.  tl;dr Awful performance, don't get in current state.",

(I watched a video because I couldn't torture myself and actually make it there using my own time) - The game is a GRIND after an hour or so - Repetitive - Once you start realizing the game sucks, your refund period expired 5 minutes prior.

There is so much here... Plants, rocks, creatures, damned sentry drones punishing you for stripping the planet's resources or destroying certain structures, and an interface that doesn't tell you much about itself so you've got plenty to keep your interest.  Day 2-4 Starting to get the hang of things and you're all over the place, looking for crashed ships to swap our your own with to get more coveted inventory slots on your ship. Oh, yeah, the ships...look at all the combinations of ships! You've found some items to help with that language barrier you have with the other 3 races, but you're still relying on the context of the gibberish to figure out what dialog you should pick.   Day 5-7 You start to notice that while the planets and systems are different, they're still the same. you're still seeing new ship hulls, but that matters less than the slot numbers, and where the holes are in the inventory slots...(no spoilers here, you'll figure it out).  Day 8+ You start understanding why the game's rating is where it's at, cause while you haven't and cannot visit all the planets in your lifetime, you no longer need to. The new has worn off and all that's left is to seek the center of the galaxy. Some still like the game, but for so many others, it's fallen flat. So, now comes the questions you should ask before you spend your money on this game..  1- Are you an optimist? Things could improve. Updates happen, content gets added..happens all the time. Not for No Man's Sky yet, unless you consider technical patches in that realm ( I don't..you forget to put a seat in my new car, you don't get to call it an update, you get to say 'sorry bout that, forgot to add the passenger seat.' and don't you dare brag about how you're fixing the issues, cause a finsished product is what we deserve, and what we paid for).  2- Explorer, or Hero.. If the latter, you'll do better to pass this one up, cause the pinnicle of combat is a sentinal capital ship that doesn't move, just sits there shooting you with half of it's guns while you flit around and destroy it's turrets. That is all. For you explorers, you'll last longer 'cause the next planet might have that life-altering gaming experience...or the next...   3- Want to potentially save the future of gaming? Then buy it play just long enough to discover that you agree with all the negative reviews, then immediately seek a refund because the game advertised above is not what you're getting (Please read refund policy first!). Features discussed in interviews or shown in screenshots or videos just aren't there. Maybe the pain of having to reverse charges or send refunds out to enough players will send the message to both Steam and the game development community at large that yes, they do have a responsibility to it's consumers to provide a product as advertised. I woudln't be surprised if they weren't sued for fraud. Even after the game was released, they never pulled the screenshots or videos depicting a different experience than you'll get in the game. Must have some epic lawyers somewhere...  So, to sum it up, if you're good with 60.00 for some entertainment that will most likely not keep your attention the way other games at this price range do, then by all means, hit the buy button. Otherwise, give it awhile... Maybe the people who's reputation will rest on this product will care about a future in this industry and fix it. Otherwise they'd do well to use the money they got (that isn't getting refunded), to legally change their names and have another go at it...",

I won't go over the usual stuff that the other reviews point out, but I will be pointing out one of the biggest flaws with the game that NOBODY seems to be talking about.   *Contains Spoiler*  So I decided to follow the Atlas path, which meant collecting the Atlas stones. Upon reaching the final Atlas Interface, I only had 9 Stones, because a sold some. I didn't know it at the time, but if you don't have 10, then you can't continue. I approached the interface, and tried to continue with 9, and it told me I couldn't. So, I went away, started grinding some units, bought an Atlas Stone from a trading terminal, and returned to the Atlas interface. However, I couldn't interact. Here's the main kick in the balls:  IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ATLAS STONES UPON INITIALLY REACHING THE LAST STEP, THEN YOUR GAME IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN. You can no longer continue with the story line, and you either have to give up and start again, or spend a few hours jumping through black holes. Essentially, if you don't have 10 Atlas Stones when you get to the interface, then there's not much point in playing. This realisation has made my attitude of 'I understand the hate, but it's still fun to play', to 'I understand the hate, and it's pretty much all legitimate hate'. I don't know whether I'll start again, or just add loads of funny mods.  Either way, until this game is on sale, don't waste your time with it.",

            "review_text": "'If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believe'  That's what pretty much described about this game for me. To be honest, I did have extra expectation from No Man's Sky. And why is that? Because the developer overhyped the game themselves. So many things were promised up to release date (even after delayed), yet they failed to deliver such promises.  Graphic: No problems with the graphic. It was good enough but the game definetely not optimize for PC. I can play the Witcher 3 at Ultra Spec with no problem, but I get a lot of FPS dropped in this game (even worse after update) and the transitory from outer space to the planet surface not as smooth as shown in the trailer. So dissappointed.   Music: Also no issues for me. I didn't expected much from the music as this is the kind of game that music didn't matter to me. I actually like the Zen feeling I get from the music.  Gameplay: This is where the game failed to deliver it promises...hard. So many elements in the game felt short coming, felt incomplete. It is boring and repetative. It doesn't feel rewarding at all. Gun feel weak. Flying the airship feel empty. Finding ruin or bases becoming routine...and chore. And seriously, what gave them ideas to put tech upgrade and elements you are collecting in the same slot.  Atmosphere: Up and down...mostly down. Once a while, you will came across meaningfull planet with well design atmosphere. Most of the time, it is just a barren, lifeless planet. Which I don't mind if they are well design. This it problems with computer generated environment in the game. After two and three planet, I have noted the oddness and the out of place the way the planet designed; the flora and fauna scattered on the planet. Other words...bleak and boring. The WOW factor disappearing pretty fast after a few hours. Couple with boring gameplay, it become rather drag to play after awhile.  Summary: I haven't finish the game of course, but I already lost my enthusiasm to play the game. I did pop the game once in awhile between my others game, but after the update, the game lagging and FPS dropped so much, I probably going to stop playing this for now...maybe until something good happend to it.

Taking Sean at his literal word, this game contains only a fraction of the features that were promised. Any feature that made the game compelling and that did make it into the game has turned into an exercise in providing an extremely basic implementation and relying on the player's imagination more so than an implementation of the actual feature.  As a developer, I can assure you, no customer in their right mind would pay full price for a product that was less than fully featured. So, why should we? Unfortunately it's too late for me to save my money. But if I can save you yours, that makes this review worth it. In its current state, I would wait until this game drops to half price or lower. I still have my hope that Hello Games will release free DLC that will bring this game up to what was promised. Until then, this game becomes just another dissappointment in 2016.",

As long as your can make them    Cons    It is fun for a while but then it gets boring   You will never meet another player   The game was advertised as multiplayer but Steam now list it as single player only   Don't worry about competing to upload your discovery before anyone else. No one will ever discover what you have found and you will never see a discovery someone else has made   There is only so much exploring you can take before you end up being bored with no focus or goal   Becomes very repetitive and a grind   Too expensive to buy considering the lack of content   You find way too many duplicate blueprints   After you have scanned a planet full of creatures it is not fun anymore   Scanning plants and rocks gets boring very fast and has little point   The game could have benefited from a much larger number of achievements, something to keep you going   Don't even bother thinking you could become a trader    Conclusion  I really really wanted this game to succeed but it just isn't good enough at the moment. I recommend waiting until the price drops and they have added a LOT more content to it before you buy it.

It's frustrating me up to the point where it's actually making me write my first ever review because of it. I'll keep it brief.  I loved how the game started, big world to explore, have to fix your ship, the suspense of what was to come was amazing.  Then it happened. I escaped my first world and then the more i play it, the more i realize how there's only four unique types of buildings, how scrubbery A on planet 1 looks identical to scrubbery B on planet 2 but with a diffirent name, and how 50 planets further everything still looks the same. Sometimes there's a diffirent shade of grass (purple, yellow, red, green) and sometimes there are a little more rocks than the planet you visited before. The variables are incredibly limited in my perspective. And perhaps more anoyingly to me, weapons. You have a mining laser and you have a rapid fire gun. There's no variation, the mods dont seem to do anything meaningful and there's only sentinels to use it on who's rules i cannot grasp. I am not allowed to defend myself or mine a rock, but a giant gold ore deposit inches away from one is somehow perfectly fine?  I was expecting a lot from this game. Too much? Well, maybe they hyped it to be more than it actually was, and i kinda was expecting that to be the case. Yet from all the things i've seen and heard up to the eventual release, we barely have a handful of the things they said would be in it.   Does it look pretty? Yes Is it big? Yes Will you ever get to see everything there is to see? Very unlikely There's even some humor in it here and there and obscure references. It's not a bad game.  But it also brings a lack of variation in quests (it's always the same things), buildings (once you've played for more than 30 minutes, you've seen them all), creatures (very limited amount of parts they consist of), landscapes (there's random generation, but it's all roughly the same), weapons (there's two, and you can do everything with your mining laser).  I liked every other game in this genre, but this just feels so incomplete, rushed, almost Beta like... I cant believe i paid €59,99 for this...  ",

That there has been a lot cut from the E3 version of the game, so the game available on Steam right now is very shallow. This is true. This issue is actually extremely complicated and while I'd love to discuss it, here is not the proper place.  Though I should explain the shallowness more, because that is relevant to the review. The game itself isn't shallow, but certain parts of it are. NPCs, the copy-pasted architecture and machines, the pointless grind of progression, mini cutscenes that eat your time away, etc., are all repetitive. And what you think isn't repetitive after an hour, will be after 20 hours.  Some parts of the game have not become repetitive to me, though. The world generation has very obvious patterns due to how procedural generation works, but each planet has its own unique feel, and once in a while you'll find a planet you feel you could stay on forever. This part of the game is very unique and relaxing, and I can't wait to see how procedural generation evolves over time.  Overall, I would say not to buy this game. Not because I hate Sean Murray or Hello Games, not because I feel robbed of my money, nothing like that. But  this game is not worth $60 at this point in time.  This game feels like Early Access, but lacking the flood of patches and updates and dev support that Early Access titles so often have.  The quote at this timestamp  is very true to my opinion of this game.    TL;DR   If you are considering buying this game, and you are reading the reviews to help you decide, I highly recommend watching the video I linked above for the first 25 minutes or so. It might be more insightful than a lot of the reviews on Steam for this game.",

            "review_text": "As someone that waited years for this game and bought into the hype, I'm sorry to say that this game is an extreme disappointment. We were promised this beautiful universe where anything was possible and what we got was just... so far from that.   The biggest hyped thing about this game was the fact that everything is procedurally generated: the ships, planets, lifeforms, plants, moons, space stations, etc. You have literally 18 quintillion worlds to explore. That's exciting, right? Wrong.  Once you set out into the stars and land on more and more planets, you start to see the beautiful picture that was painted quickly fall apart. This isn't a game about exploration, it's micromanagement simulator at every possible level. At seemingly every turn there is an alarm going off telling you that whatever charge has been depleted. This means you have to roam around planets mining resources to charge up various pieces of gear at a near constant level. That's a major part of the game play: staring at inventory screens charging up various pieces of gear. Oh, and your extremely limited inventory space will make this even that much more maddening.   The fact that there are so many worlds to explore has to be this game's saving grace, right? Wrong again. After you land on a dozen or so worlds, you start to realize they are all pretty much exactly the same. Sure, the plants and animals vary slightly, but overall it's the same. This is especially true for any structures on the planets, which are actually part of the very little actual gameplay content in this game. All the structures follow the exact same layout. They all feature items in basically the exact same places. The aliens you sometimes encounter in these structures give you the same boring choices over and over again. The aliens themselves can't even be bothered with this game since almost all of them are too busy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing on Reddit in their iPads. Really. Almost every alien is just starring into a tablet computing device they are holding. That's all they do. They don't walk around, they don't interact with the environment, they never even leave the chair they are sitting on.   Speaking of aliens, we encounter these same species on seemingly every planet but there is only ever one of them at each structure on the planet. Where is the rest of these people? Where do they live? Where are their ships? Why don't we see any of that? Why aren't some of these planets covered by massive cities? Nah, we just get more rocks, deformed wild life and repetitive landscapes. Hell, even the space stations you dock in are completely devoid of activity minus the same procedurally generated ships landing and taking off for no reason. You never see any aliens get out of their ships to sell goods, nothing. And for crying out loud, why is every space station laid out exactly the same? It just doesn't make any sense at all.   If you've seen the E3 gameplay, pre-release trailers, etc. just stop for a moment and forget you saw any of that. In the game files, you'll find special assets specifically created for the E3 demo. Everything we saw there was not procedurally generated, it was carefully curated and scripted to give the illusion that what was happening was going to be the status quo for the worlds in this game. It is not.   This game is not even remotely what we were shown in those videos. This game may someday be that game we were promised, but it is not that game today. I really wanted to love this game and it's such a tragedy that it turned out this way. What makes it worse is that Hello Games is probably the worst company I've ever seen when it comes to handling public relations. Hell, EA did a better job at handling the SimCity launch uproar, and everyone hates EA. Hello Games has been completely silent since the games release, not addressing the outcry of fans that are deeply disappointed or explaining why they straight up lied about what this game was. At the very least they should come out and say that there is a roadmap to add features to the game... SOMETHING.   Anyway, as somone that really really wanted to love this game, I just can't. There are so many terrible design decisions and gameplay mechanics that I'd rather just do a crossword puzzle-- cause at least that has a satisfying ending. Yeah, even the ending in No Man's Sky is like a slap in the face. Do yourself a favor, do not buy this game. At least not in it's current form. Maybe in a year with some updates it'll be playable, but something tells me that won't be the case.",

Weeeeelllllllllll....Elite is still a far supierior game, WITH Multiplayer and players affect how the direction of the game pans and and in a way the story plot. The price tage of Elite and all its expansions, if your wait for the initial price to drop can all be obtained for under $30 each, is still cheaper than No Man's.  Pros: Great graphics, amazing visuals and colors, nice crafting system. Gek perfumed farts.  Cons: Crappy flight controlls on planet surface, resource collection quickly becomes a grindfest, almost all animals are hideous Spoor abominations, lack of enemy diversity becomes apparent, space combat blows, next to no game plot,   Naming things becomes meaningless as no other player will ever see your planet named LSD; where acid rains constantly, Acidillos roam the land while Rave Worms travel in packs making thier mating calls and Magic Mushrooms grow in abundance. For the same reason Tony G's Traders will never be recognized as a galatic spanning franchise in-game (I renamed every trading postin honor of Tony G).   Maby the single player nature of the game is due to the fact that Hello games copped out on buying servers and to save face said there was still a chance (although infintismal) of meeting another player in-game.  For $60 AUS you could get a lot of things that leave a longer lasting, and more positive memory, than this game has laft; A night out with your friends, taking your parents out to dinner, a 1 foot joint to celebrate 420 Day, a new set of tyers for your bicycle, a 50gram pouch of tobacco, 10-20 humble bundles of games, or a birthday present for your girlfriend/boyfriend.

I was bored after about 10 hours of gameplay (not straight), I played maybe 3 hours a day before getting overwhelmed or bored. I was mining, for what seemed endless, and most of it went towards repairs of my ship or suit or multitool on my first planet. As soon as I realized I could leave, I left to explore, and landing on each planet was cool and exciting for the first maybe 5 planets/stations, then I started to see that there was nothing really exciting going on. Mine, fight off some nosy sentinels, maybe get attacked by a small creature, mine again, enjoy your surroundings for all of 10-15mins before deciding you were bored and hoping your next planet held something different. But, it was pretty much the same anywhere I went, no matter how many times I've warped.  BASICALLY, THIS GAME GETS BORING PRETTY ♥♥♥♥ING QUICKLY.

Currently Im playing it as a trader where I just travel from Space Station to Space Station in order to buy and sell goods. Allthough I have to be careful not to destroy a space station in the proces! ;) I have a ship that is very much suited for being a trader, I used to have one that was more scientific so I had to trade that in. (That one was more suited for landing on asteroids and investigating them)  Even though I can use my warp drive to jump to different systems, I prefer to fly the old fashioned way. Just aim for a star in the night sky and fly towards it. Sure it takes longer but its really what makes this game unique... that you can actually do that. Allthough I have found that I run the risk of spending too much time on the edge of two warring factions... It does get dangerous out there. Luckily me being a trader changes the attitude of NPC's towards me.  I was sort of able to adjust even my appearance towards being a trading character, with a little help from a friend who uploaded some screenshots of me. He has popped into my game occasionally to aid my quest to the center of the galaxy. But he's kind of a griefer aswell so I tend to avoid him. Luckily the size of this game is so large that running into him is a very small chance.  My quest to the center of the galaxy is taking a LONG time... I find myself spending too much time on a planet because there is so much to do and discover that is unique. I ended up chasing a Giant Worm on a Sand planet once for so long even that the day had turned to night. And then I got lost when I did eventually go up into space! haha Cuz all the planets were in different positions. Silly me, I opened a ticket with HelloGames thinking it was a bug... They were very helpful and responsive in their reply!  In general my advice is use the map to keep track of the stars you have visited. Allways scan for other players. And fly low to the ground preferably with your wingmen. If you want to stay alive. Because its a Alien-creature-eats-other-alien-creature world out there! I mean that level of interaction is wild! I find the mining a bit tedious so I just skip that part and buy everything, and then just form new materials by letting the atoms come together!  Running at 60FPS on my Corei3 with a R7-250x @ 1080p happily! Hope to bump into you guys on one of the 18 Quintillion planets if you decide to buy the game!",

Then the disappointment set in. This is it? Yes, that really is it. This is an indie game, and it should have an indie price. I'm thinking half-off normal. But it does not. The traditional full pricetag for a big studio AAA video game is way too high for No Man's Sky.  The game has a lot of small inventory management, which quickly becomes frustrating and annoying. After a few hours of playing when you figure out what's what, you realize there really just isn't any depth here. Sure, you can explore a procedural universe, and that really is a groundbreaking, awesome feature. But that's all this game is. There's nothing else to it.

In my experience, i spawned in on an arctic planet where my environmental shields dropped so fast that even when melee jet boosting i still could not get any of the rescources for my ship other than plutonium which spawned in a tiny cave next to my ship. Later when i somehow got my ship up and running i travelled to a gek system where the rewards for buying and reselling certain items were bountiful. i took that money and bought a new ship with 20 slots instead of 16. then i decided i should move to a new system where i would come to find a beutiful planet with a ship that had 24 slots and a 12 slot multi tool. Things were looking up then a small fleet of pirates ambushed me just ouside of a space station and destroyed my hyper drive. then i tried to run to a nearby planet instead of fighting where i was killed by hostile (elite) sentinels on that desolate black rock. So i fled the planet only to be pursued by sentinal ships and shot down miles away from a planet or a space station. That broke my shields and i was respawned on the station. i had no money left from buying that ship that was now in ruins and i could not get past that pirate blockade no matter how many times i tried without any shields. SO my playthrough involved me getting repeatedly f**ked by a dozen or so space pirates early on in the game, later to be f**ked by sentinels trying to get repairs ultimately never leaving that system nevr beating the game. I would not recommend this game to people as only a few people will pay 60 dollars and actually get a spawn near a good planet/ system.",

Just no fun, boredom simulator, and any novelty wears off within the first few hours.

Do not waste your money on this thing until it actually runs.  Update 8/23/2016- Killing and restarting Steam got it to work, but this is unacceptable. I have now also played the game long enough to experience almost PowerPoint levels of framerate. Some worlds drop to 8FPS. I am not running this game on a low-end PC, either. I can suffer the occasional dip into the high 20's, but dropping to single digits is not something I can overlook.  Based on the trailers and other marketing, this game is only 10% finished and looks a lot like a technology demo with no real game behind it. I still do not recommend this game, since there's no game here.",

I know one of my friends suggested it would be fixed if you could host a private server. My thoughts were along the lines of being able to teleport to a friends location somehow.  Now I haven't been following Hello Games social media but as far as patches and reviews go, they haven't taken a step to improve their game. They kinda just left it and pat themselves on the back saying 'good job we're finally done'  So with that being said if you like drifting around looking at rocks and selling/buying things then try this game (although you would REALLY have to like that to spend $60 on it). Or maybe you like the goal of seeing what's at the centre of the Galaxy. Either way research before you buy.  Also, WHY GOD WHY do I have to be attacked when I'm just freaking mining. I hate that I'll be having a peaceful and fun time and THEN BE ATTACKED. Makes the game not challenging, but really damn tedious to play.",

I wanted to like this game, I really did, but the missing features, combined with the total lack of performance, really killed it for me.  First the performance:  My PC: Intel 4770K 2x 980TI SLI 16GB RAM  When the game first launched, I had to throttle my settings and limit the game to 60 FPS to prevent tons of hitching. When new drivers and a new patch were released, performance was worse. To this day there is tons o f texture pop-in and it is someone nausea inducing and infuriating.  Next the missing features: Do not watch the videos associated with the game. They are out of date and irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, NMS is a game where you go to a planet, farm some stuff, go to another planet, farm some stuff, etc. The 'discoveries' you make and 'upload' might get wiped and not reflected in the game. There is no multiplayer (it is not an MMO obviously), but it advertised you might run into other players, but... There are articles out there about how two players found the same planet, but were invisible to each other, environment conditions did not sync, etc.  All in all a huge let down, especially for $60.",
