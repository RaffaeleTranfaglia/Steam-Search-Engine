            "review_text": "RAGE is a great game at first. Everything feels unique . The graphics are incredible and the atmosphere stunning. The weapons feel satisfying and the enemy AI responsive. The enemies are not too tough , but not too easy either. The story seems interesting in the beginning too. The driving can be fun and there are options to modify your weapons and vehicles. The world seems big enough for you to explore , which is also pretty nice. The crafting system is simple and useful. Additionally , the mechanics in total feel useful .There are also plenty of mini-games you can play in order to earn some extra cash which are pretty fun. The combat system is similar to most of the shooters today, nothing special , but was made better and more engaging by specific mechanics , like the wingsticks . Overall, the first few hours spent in the game were enjoyable and the game just felt great.   After the first few hours of gameplay,however, the game starts going downhill. The weapons stop feeling that great and the game starts to repeat itself just to make you feel that it's longer. The missions feel incredibly repetitive and I just felt that the only thing I was doing was to drive from point A to point B and then kill endless waves of enemies. I also started getting really mad about my character , since I never got to even hear his voice. Even the driving started becoming extremely boring and the challenge had all been lost , since I was never pressed for ammo. There were infinite supplies of everything : grenades , bandages , ammo. The enemies stopped being interesting and handling them was just too easy. I didn't even get to finish the game , since the atmosphere and gameplay became so repetitive that drove me mad! It felt like an endless motive.. Last but not least ,the lack of cutscenes took away the immersion for me as well. It felt like the game lacked something basic , apart from the other. As a conclusion , every aspect of the game was simply ruined by the unneccesary extreme length of the storyline , which caused repetitiveness.  To sum up , RAGE is a fun shooter at first , but as you get used to the mechanics and the gameplay , as well as the story and the mission patterns , it stops being immersive and throws away the potential.  Thanks for reading and I hope that this review has been helpful!",

            "review_text": "I wish Steam had a 'Meh' rating, because that's how I felt about Rage. Not a solid 'No' but definitely not a 'Yes.'   RAGE is, let's be clear, an old-school shooter. In spite of slightly open visuals, most of your FPS action occurs in the same general tunnels and limited pathways that Id Software has been doing since Wolfenstein 3D. Oh, and there's a driving/racing component which is decidedly 'meh.'   The IdTech 5 engine is visually reasonably pretty, but the game is, I gather, pretty poorly optimized to take full advantage of the highest resolution textures. But to be honest, I don't find the graphics all that amazing, and graphics alone don't sway me without otherwise solid gameplay.  The story itself is pretty humdrum stuff, and ends rather abruptly. I gather we won't be seeing a sequel, at least not any time soon, since Id is busy with Doom 4. Honestly, it's nothing special. Post-apocalyptic wasteland controlled by authoritarian regime (very cleverly known as 'The Authority.' Yeah.). Plucky rebel faction fights against them and sees you as their possible savior because...aw hell, I forget why. But whatever. You're the chosen one.  You fight alone through Id corridors using mostly typical weapons (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc.). There's some variation there, but it's all the usual suspects. The gunplay itself is kind of meh, really. I found the sound design for the weapons to generally be kind of underwhelming. They seem to 'clatter' rather than 'boom,' if that makes sense. The wingstick is kinda neat, but limited in ammo.  The minigames are generally pretty forgettable. Gambling stuff, racing, and rhythm games, really. Nothing special.  Honestly, the game plays like an 'also ran' to Borderlands, but it takes itself much more seriously and lacks any co-op component. I'd say it's worth not more than $5. At that rate, it's decently fun to run around and shoot stuff. But it's a fairly disposable game and even at a $5 price tag, you won't be missing much if you skip it.",

            "review_text": "Pay no mind to the bethesda badge on the box, this is actually an id software game (and it IS in face developed by them). So straight out the door you should immediately remove fallout from your mind, and while you're at it borderlands (although the world is similar). Look at the games id made: Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake are the ones that come to most minds and should be a great example of what kind of game this is No, there is no real RPG element to this game. No there is no crazy loot system. No it is not a huge open world (although it is probably the most open world-ish of any id game). No it is not a multithreaded complex story. But then again, did any of id's games have any of that? So please stop thinking it's a bethesda game before you buy it, you'll thank me.  So what IS this game then? It's an id game. For its time it had amazing ground breaking graphics (and still looks great to this day). It has very tight and crisp combat with very well done controls, perfect level design, and amazing ai. And when I say amazing ai i mean I put it in my list of games with best ai. It's not mind blowing because of it's complexity and intuition, but because of the variety and character it gives all the enemies.  So what's the downside? This game is one of those games where a developer obviously is trying something new to the point where you feel it isn't in their typical style. As a result a lot of the 'fluff' content and features feel not only mediocre, but also unnecessary. Also because this game does not focus primarily on level design it's not something I see myself going back and playing again and again like I would with the old doom and quake titles.  In short I do consider this a great game, but certainly not id's best form. The combat and level design are really at the quality only id was capable of (I say was because id is no longer id), and the new tech that Carmake put in this is pretty awesome. It's a blast and, while short lived overall, it is well worth every penny of the $10 price. It might even make you feel hopeful about the game industry again, you jaded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Addition to the review: I notice that a lot of people are saying my review isn't helpful, I am not saying this isn't a good game, in fact I quite enjoyed it when I played it on my 8800GTX, but the game has serious technical issues that hinder many people from playing the game and I have not found a fix that works. I can recommend the game itself because it is a lot of fun, just not on PC due to myself and everyone I know having SERIOUS issues with the game.  RAGE... while it is a well done game, it is hindered by game breaking technical issues that they have not fixed and the game came out quite some time ago. If you read through the forums, you will find that a big problem with the game is the way that it caches textures with higher end graphics cards. This causes extreme pop ins for textures that really ruins how good this game looks and destroys your frame rate. This only seems to be an issue with higher end graphics cards. I have experienced this issue on the following cards: Nvidia 280GTX (and two of these in SLI), Nvidia 560 GTX, Nvidia 560 Ti, and the Nvidia 660 Ti. Normally I wouldn't bash on a game for an issue like this but for it to be such a massive and common issue really ruins this game and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone with a higher end rig because of this. Now if you have a lower end rig (ran this without any issues on a Nvidia 8800 GTX), you may be able to run this game without any problems but unfortunately there are no guarantees. I cannot recommend anyone buy this unless they are willing to roll the dice with this broken game. I really hope id Software can step it up after losing John Carmack and fix this engine. Go play it on consoles if you are dying to play it, you can probably get the Anarchy Edition at your local Walmart or EB Games for $20 or less on PS3 or 360.",

            "review_text": "Rage has some interesting parts, but the package as a whole is a mess. The color of the world is dreary but every NPC you meet is somewhat cheery and treats you like their best friend. While I love racing games and did not expect realistic vehicle behavior, Rage's MarioCart-like take is off the wall arcade. The power ups add more chaos to the racing that's already silly in comparison to the shooting. Even the shooting isn't all that good. The AI is interesting in that it seems to react to the situation, yet it's still dumb and easy to defeat. Bad missions, bad driving, and a setting that isn't coherent and reminds me that there are other similar games with much better story and tone.    There's probably a lot of games that have been and may be $5 on sale that I would take over Rage.   The Rocket Rally races are just random nonsense where there's no consequence for dying and bares no relation to the rest of the game.   I either end up playing whack-a-mole as enemies pop out from cover or just walk up to them with a shotgun when they are crouched. Mutants you just wait for them to run straight at you.",

Post apocalyptic shooting with vehicles and open world elements from the people that made Quake, sounds fantastic right? That's until you actually start playing. You're dropping into the world with the barest amount of exposition and rescued by John Goodman who within five minutes of meeting you, gives you a gun and asks you to wipe out a gang. Vehicles don't exist beyond mini-games and the odd moments where you need to traverse relatively short distances to mission 'dungeons.'   You ultimately join the rag tag group known as 'The Resistance' who fights against the tyrannical 'Authority' (honestly guys, hire a writer and come up with better names) in the most cliched manner possible. The game does have it's standouts. The gunplay feels good, the animation is excellent and blowing up other cars is enjoyable. The characters are very well constructed and they make you want to just sit and talk with them but instead are used as one-shot interactions. John Goodman's character disappears after the first hour of the game.   The game was unfortunately not everything I wanted it to be but it was still an enjoyable experience. Get it for $5 if you have a rainy weekend.",

Rage is a very great breath of fresh air for FPS games, It blends in nice open levels inside the overall world design of the game. You can have up to 4 weapons equipped at times, and they all feel powerful and immensely satisfying, They have complex recoil movements and different weapons are used for different situation. It's FPS aspect is fun, frantic, and intense, though you will be finding yourself covering behind objects a bit too frequently.  The Graphics are very well done, the objects and everything looks good in the game, but you may need some help from mods to get rid of the texture rippling.  The story is the weakest point of this game, as you play the game, it is backed up by either way too generic characters, or promising ones that you barely get any dialogue from. Even though the world is somewhat decent in size and filled with crowds. It felt rushed and unfinished, and put together at the last second.  But, the game is good overall, i never usually put scores on games, but since this review is a bit crazy, i would give it a 7.75/10",

            "review_text": "Despite the hugely anti-climatic ending that WILL leave you disappointed, Rage is a very under appreciated game, that got a lot of hate due to its crappy PC port on release. Most of the problems it had were fixed, but it still feels like a console game. And playing on PC, that is unacceptable.  If you're able to get past the graphical issues, Rage is a very well made game. Think of Borderlands but without the RPG stuff: that is Rage. At first it may seem like an average game, but as you play it you'll discover that it's a lot of fun and it has a strange charm that will hook you up before you know it. I can't tell where that charm comes from, because thinking back, it's not better than similar games like the mentioned Borderlands, but it's still fun, which is what matters when playing a game.  Sure, it's rough around the edges, not for perfectionists, but if you play a game to enjoy it, trust me, you will like this game. Also, if you have the chance, get the Scorchers DLC, it makes the game better and adds content to the endgame, which the original was missing.",

            "review_text": " Solid FPS with some nice Open-world and RPG elements.   Don't expect too much from the story. Even though the whole post-apocalyptic universe this game is set in seems very authentic and well done, there could've been done so much more in order to make the story more compelling. There are a great amount of interesting characters, both enemies and allies, which add to the atmosphere.  The gunplay overall is not on the level of Killing Floor 2 for example but above average nontheless. The guns handle well, the sounds are realistic and shooting feels satisfying. Different types of ammunition help spice things up especially later on in the game.  Throughout the game, RAGE wants you to believe it's an open world shooter. Between quests, it does a relatively good job at it. During missions, however, there are a LOT of invisible walls which can get annoying at times. Most missions consist of going into a cave/dungeon/city/building and pick something up/deliver something etc. and then go back to the quest giver. The levels are generally linear but well designed. You don't have to run back the way you came which prevents the player from losing attention quickly. There are not a lot of areas that I felt like I want to get out of immediately.  If you're planning on playing RAGE on hard difficulty, I wouldn't bother. All they did was turn the enemies into bullet sponges. It doesn't necessarily make the game harder, but you just end up wasting a lot more ammo and it just doesn't feel right to see a bandit without any heavy armor take a couple dozen bullets before eventually dying.   Overall, I didn't feel like quitting the game at any point, the game kept me interested enough to play it for about 13 hours. If you're into games like Fallout or the Metro series this might just be something you should consider picking up.",

Either way, the formula is still 'Go here, kill things.' So if you want to chill out, not stress your brain cells, and shoot things, this is for you like it was for me recently.  There are some interesting aspects of the game other than the core formula. That would be racing which is effectively kart-racing at the end of the day. I recommend plugging in a gamepad for these to maintain your sanity. It's not bad with the exception of the Rocket Rally, which is a poorly designed game mode as it is based too much on RNG and not enough on skill.  The high point for me in this game is the nailgun added by the Scorchers DLC. The rebar firing mode is too fun. Takes a while to reload each shot, but it one-shots all the the stronger enemies.

            "review_text": "Thanks to Steam's free-to-play weekend I gave RAGE a jam, what first drew me to download and play it was Snoop Dogg, RAGE is Snoops favourite game. I was a little reluctant at first because as a gamer I can become easily addicted to chasing achievements and didn’t want to delve into yet another post apocalyptic FPS, but RAGE is seeming more like a diamond in the rough.  RAGE is a FPS developed by id Software. It uses the company's OpenGL-based id Tech 5 game engine and was released in October 2011. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic near future, following the impact of the asteroid 99942 Apophis on Earth. The game has been described as similar to the movie Mad Max 2 and to video games such as Borderlands. The mixture of FPS shoot and loot based missions and demolition derby type racing is just enough to be entertaining, if you get board of the same go to point [A] and kill random bandits to recover some junk missions you can enter a race, zoom round a circuit and bash and crash your way across the finish line to earn more upgrades.  In RAGE's story, the asteroid 99942 Apophis impacts the Earth on August 23, 2029, leaving few survivors. Human survivors have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including race tracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own.  RAGE has two multiplayer modes: 'Road Rage' and 'Wasteland Legends'. In Road Rage, up to four players compete in a free-for-all match that takes place in an arena designed to make use of the vehicles. The objective is to collect rally points that appear around the arena while killing your opponents and stealing their points. Legends of the Wasteland is a series of two-player co-op missions based on stories that are heard throughout the single-player campaign.  So aside from the basic gameplay and plot overview my personal opinion on rage is to give it a go, even just a few casual missions and there are fun or get right into the game and get all those delicious achievements. If you find yourself really getting into the RAGE universe, Bethesda and Dark Horse Comics announced a three-issue comic book series based on RAGE, also there is an entire novel based on RAGE game.  Enjoy killing bandits and making the roads a safer place, but watch out for Mutant's... ",

The first person combat sections are usually set in corridored levels full of enemies to mow down, making it a blend of Borderlands 2 (the driving, setting and open world) and Quake 4 (the frantic action set in the fairly common linear area).

            "review_text": "I remember hearing and waiting for this game back in '08. I actually remember them announcing that Rage would be coming out sometime in April, 2009. Yeah, that's how long I've been waiting for this game. Long and behold, it's finally here.  For those who didn't know, this game occupies 3 DVDs. That's right, the game weights 21 GB. Well, at least Sony's Blu-Ray format doesn't have that problem. I am also extremely glad that the developers didn't trim down the game so it could fit on one DVD (you know, if it can fit on one DVD for the Xbox, then it can fit anywhere, kind of like what happened with the trimming down of the GTA 4 world map because of the DVD format.)  Anyways, the new engine is astounding. The textures are amazing, especially the faraway ones. I get a stable 60 FPS with my Fermi, 8 GB Ram and 2.93 icore. It is very nice to see a new engine and not some re-used or re-updated albeit old inherently engine like Unreal 3.0.  However, do not expect this game to be open-worlded in the same sense that Fallout 3 and New Vegas are. The world seems large but you are only confined to small and medium sized areas. As you play, more of these areas become available and you can go back if you want to, but this game is mostly linear when it comes to navigating the world itself.  There is not enough exploration to go around but I absolutely love the environments - none of the environments repeat. I love the abandoned buildings, hotels, sewers, back alleys and such. It is something that I always wanted to experience in the last two Fallout games but couldn't because of the lack of the said environments, because of the recycled areas with the same textures and objects and because of the outdated engine. This time however I can't stop taking snapshots via Fraps and Steam.  There are several types of enemies. Some of the punks however speak with a British accent and have British flag tattoos, but most of them look the same (a homage to Mad Max and Doomsday (2008) perhaps?). There are some other medium and large-sized mutants.  I like the fact that there are several vehicles and that you can customize them. There are also several ammo types for each weapon, however all I really ask for is for head shot to equal instant death, which is not the case in this game unless you use a shotgun up close.  You can also create some new items that will help you advance in the game as well as access some closed off areas so do not hurry to sell every junk you find because you might need it.  As far as the weapons are concerned, well I'd say that most of them get readily available within the first few quests, so you do not really have to work hard to get them. Plus the ammo is not that scarce for some reason, so do not expect any Metro 2033-kind lack of ammo. Also, half of the weapons look like they were taken from Crysis. I would also expect some weapons to be home-made.  There' s no way to skip the occasional cut scenes or hurry up the monologue, BUT if you take a few steps away from the person giving you the quest, then the quest becomes readily available without you having to hear the whole story.  The enemy AI is good. They dodge bullets, take cover, retreat, advance and throw grenades - everything that you really need. It is also satisfying to blast some of the melee-wielding enemies. They don't always rush at you either, they actually try to surround you.  This brings me to another point. The gameplay itself is what truly shines in this game. The fire fights and the shooting just do not get old. It is extremely satisfying to fight the hordes of mutants. You can craft sentry turrets and sentry bots(like in Doom 3) to help you out. You can also craft various types of special ammo, and since there's no weight limit, there's little reason to sell junk that can be used to construct the dozen or so different things.  When you die, the nanomachines that were implanted in you moments before the asteroid collision and the subsequent hypersleep serve as a defibrillator. Meaning if you die, you can revive yourself once or twice before the defibrillator recharges. There's a tiny minigame involved that determined how much health you get once you are revived. And by health I mean how red your screen is before it turns normal since the game has regenerative health.  The characters you encounter are all unique. They all have different clothes, voices and personalities. Some give you new quests, some just do small chit-chat. The secondary characters even have names.  There are some easter eggs scattered around including a few that pay respect to Fallout, like the bobble head and the water purifier chip.  The minuses:  Let's get this out of the way: You can't see your legs and you cast no shadow.  Oh, and you are also mute. All you can do is listen.  I like the fact that you do not have any maps or minimaps when you enter new unknown areas ( I don't like excessive HUD), but friendly towns could use some indicators because it causes some confusion when you enter a new friendly place and are trying to navigate between the newly introduced characters and quests.  When you drive a vehicle you get a third person view, however you cannot look around or behind you which really constricts your view.  The sky looks amazing although it is static. It's like a giant wall paper.  The dead bodies disappear quickly, but at least they won't do so unless you loot them. So if you want to increase realism, do not loot the bodies.  I don't think I've encountered a single checkpoint or an auto-save. That's right, your entire progress depends on your manual F5 saves, what's more is that every time you save, it takes 4 seconds for the screen to unfreeze. Annoying but necessary. So if you forget to save and die, you will have to repeat your last progress from your last save.  The game is also extremely easy. I'm playing on the hardest (Nightmare) mode and I steam roll over everyone and everything. The quick regenerating health is part of the issue.  The most important thing is the lack of a good and consistent story. This game nailed almost everything but the main story. You wake up from cryosleep and you get thrown into the semi-open world of fetch quests. For some reason people around you assume that you are a killing machine who is able to take out hordes of enemies and fetch supplies. No one ever explains why you should be doing the things you are doing. One might think that there is no need for one coherent story in the huge 21 GB single player post-apocalyptic world but I beg to differ since this is not an open-world game. You cannot bypass quests and go wherever you want, there ARE constrictions.  Overall, the game feels like playing a Mad Max movie with the elements of Borderlands, Fallout, and Some Metro 2033 elements. But that is not to say that any ideas were stolen or re-used for this game. Rage is its own kind of animal, it is unique and it's got plenty of peculiar style. The world is believable and immersive. And the game itself gets better and better as you play it.  Highly recommended. ",

            "review_text": "A fun and intense first person shooter set in the future of wasteland earth. So, it’s a little bit like Mad Max then? Well, it’s about 99% Mad Max-like. I mean you’re going to see insane weaponry, vehicular combat and bandit gangs, so it’s safe to say that this is a Mad Max themed shooter, but definitely not a movie clone.    Graphics: 10/10  For a game that is nearly 5 years old, it still impresses me on how good it looks. It’s not “perfect” by any means, but its good enough that you will think that this game is newer than it looks. Not to mention that you don’t need an overly powerful graphics card to run it; a GeForce 9800 GTX or an AMD equivalent is just enough to get playable framerates. This also goes for both the CPU and RAM. No need for a fancy £1000 rig to enjoy this game.    Storyline: 7/10  You are emerged into a wasteland earth full of bandits, gangs and mutants. You are seen as the ‘hero’ of the game and you learn more about the places and the people the more you play further into the story. It’s the generic story where you defeat all the mutants and gangs, whilst doing unrelated side-quests along the way and eventually “save” the world. It’s nothing new to the table in terms of storytelling and I wouldn’t personally call this one “story heavy”, the game is an experience and is for experience, not to be fully immersed in it. It certainly delivers that experience in a decent sense.    Sound: 10/10  The sounds of gunfire, the roaring engines and the clarity of the voice acting is at its best. Every bit of soundtrack has been fined tuned to sound how they were supposed to be heard. I am proud of what id Software did here. What an impressive achievement.    Gameplay: 9/10  It delivers very smooth and very polished gameplay that many is sure to enjoy for hours. The controls are responsive and the game difficulty is well balanced. The only downside is that you have to keep checking if you have enough ammo for a weapon as ammo in this game is very scarce, especially at the start of the game.    Price: 10/10  For the price of £12.99 and an additional £3.49 for a DLC, it is reasonably well priced and is definitely worth buying. Although, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale to get it.  ",

Its unfortunate however that the game had SO much more potential and I WISH they included more and perhaps even a more open world as I loved the story and path of the protagonist (even though the protagonist himself lacked importance - perhaps because he had no voice) and simply would have given this a 10/10 if there were more towns/interesting places to visit.

The character devleopment and interaction fall more along the lines of fallout, so you do get the best of both worlds. While maybe not as good as it's solo counterparts, this game is a nice break from the time one needs to put in when playing an open world video game, sometimes you want the post apocalyptic feel but able to play it at a quicker pace. Weapon selection is alright, and nothing is more fun that shooting rebar out of your nail gun at a enemy. Customization and crafting (for once) Is a pretty big must in this game as money is avaiable but tends to run out quickly since good ammunition is in short supply and must often be bought or crafted.   Overall I would rate this a solid 8/10. Good atmosphere, character interaction, and fast paced sense of accomplishment make this game a +. The negatives are the low ammount of character customization, combat interaction could be improved, and storyline worked on. Overall this game gets a solid 80%",

            "review_text": "Gaphical Fidelity: ID outdid themselved with the visuals of this game. The texture qualities themselves may not be astounding. But the vastness of the world and details of each individual component make it quite a breath-taking sight. For me, it is still one of the most visually appealing games i've played. The artstyle is damn impressive.  Performance: As much as i'd like to say all good things about this game. The texture popping is something that was an issue on release, and still has not been properly patched till this day. It's not a major issue, and not too noticeable on my computer rig, but it doesn't exactly make ID look like they put a lot of time into fixing the game.  Design: I love the character and map design. Each enemy type has so many different variations, it doesn't feel too repetetive when fighting them. Plus the characters you talk to are each unique and memorable in their own way, wether it be serious and rought around the edges, or kind of goofy.  RPG Aspects: This is something that kind of looks like it was shoved in last second. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it feels unfinished. You don't have any stats you can mess around with for your character. The clothing you wear is picked out of 3 different variations near the beginning of the game, meaning not a lot of variety. There are basic upgrades for armour, and for your individual weapons, but they are very basic. The coolest part would probably be the item crafting. Even though it is quite simple. It makes you go looking for the unique parts required to make certain items, such as the explosive RC cars, lock drills, bandages, etc.  Story: Honestly, story could have been better. It sets the tone quite early on and I quite liked how it began, but without spoiling anything, the ending was a bummer and quite of left you hanging. Plus, you can't continue playing after the campaign to explore which I thought was silly. The ending really allowed for it...  Voice Acting: Voice acting was fantastic, I don't have any issues with it. Frankly they had me at John Goodman.  AI: The enemies AI was frankly one of the best parts of the game. They aren't your typical baddies that just stand there or rush directly at you. They were far cleverer than I expected. I found that enemies with melee weapons would duck and weave to avoid your shots, plus jumping, rolling and climbing to make them quite adept at reaching you without being hit. Any with ranged weapons wouldn't just stand there, but use cover wisely. Retreat if you were bearing down hard on them, advance if they found they had an advantage. Not just that, sometimes they would work together; for instance, the Authority had units that defended with a energy shield, and other units would hide behind him for protection.  Weapons: The weapon design was quite good, but what made the guns so much fun to use, is their sounds, kickback, and also the phsyics implemented when an enemy was downed. If you shot an enemy in the head, their helmet would fall off, shoot them in the leg, they'll limp or topple over. Hit them with a shotgun, they'd go barreling through the air. As a FPS, I absolutely approve, and found the shooting aspect solid.  ____________________ Presentation: 7 (Clearly high production, but story was weak and not all the characters were that memorable) Graphics: 7.5 (I would of given this a higher rating if the texture popping issue was fixed) Sound: 8.5 (Sound was overall impressive, especially on the weapons. Plus voice acting was above par most of the time) Gameplay: 8 (Excellent shooting sequences, but I did find the car comabt kind of tedious) Overall: 8 (A large amount of content for Single player, but only about 7-8 hours for the campaign. Does include co-op missions and a car combat competetive mode which is nice)",

            "review_text": "RAGE is one of the greatest flops that I have seen in video games, but it is still blows my mind every time I play it. RAGE is a first person shooter! A lot of people don’t seem to understand that, but it has been pretty clear from the start. This is NOT another Fallout or Borderlands! I don’t understand where everybody keeps getting this from. RAGE differs from Doom 3 in the fact that there are “safe” areas and the main world map has opened up a little bit giving you freedom and a break from shooting stuff with your shotgun, but at the heart of things it is still a FPS.  Pros:  Rage was created by id software meaning that the shooting is superb. Every weapon just feels good and sounds like it should.  Wingsticks: The wingstick is the best weapon in the game. It is essentially an offhand quick use weapon that is a sharp boomerang of decapitations.  Mega Textures: Id Tech 5 uses mega textures which make the game look gorgeous (when you are far away). Driving around in your armed buggy outside in the wasteland looks amazing and has a great feel to it. Water: The water in RAGE looks really good. There is not a whole lot of it and there is no swimming, but it does look good.  Memorable Characters: The townsfolk that you run into are often a bit goofy like they stared at the sun too long, but they stick in your head.  Enemy Mobility: The enemies in RAGE are very agile (especially the mutants) and often climb on the walls or ceiling or are jumping over a rail or down a floor.   Other “Weapons”: There is more to RAGE than the shotgun (though the shotgun is always a good bet) there are items that you can “build” such as the sentry turret or bot and use them to help you out on your journey.  DLC: If you are liking RAGE get the DLC and play it after you finish the game, since it gives a better ending.   Cons: Mega Textures: The down side of mega textures is when you are close up. If you go up to a soup can on the self it is all but a blur. There are some resources that can help to make this problem better, but it can only get so good due to the lack of higher quality texture file released by id.  Texture Popping: Basically you have a higher texture quality popping into place when you turn around in the game. This is a fairly common issue among lower end computers, and can be a primary reason to not play this game. There are some fixes for this but generally if you have a higher computer it won’t be an issue. Note: AMD cards have been known to have performance issues, but I haven’t experienced this.   Saves: The auto save feature in RAGE is all but broke. Don’t rely on it. Save your game whenever you want manually… Simple as that.  Story/Game World: The story of the game started out pretty good, but went downhill quite quickly. I felt like you are the only person in the game world that can do anything, and things like money are only there for you to use. The world is fairly static and default jump height doesn’t allow you to jump up on boxes or crates.  Ending: RAGE is essentially the first part in a two part story/game and the ending shows it. The ending makes since, but ultimately it is a letdown.   At the end of the day I really like RAGE and think that it is a great game, though it has been overlooked because of these issues. Hopefully id can fix this stuff and produce an amazing Doom 4, but we will have to wait and see. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that likes FPS games and to pick it up with the DLC when it is on sale.    ",

But the world is only open to about ten minutes of exploration. Then you'll find out it's only a handful of canyons connected together and most of the locations are locked and accessible only during certain quests. Everything else you see in the distance is just a picture on the wall. But your movement is limited even when on foot. Most of the obstacles in your path (like railings, chairs, tables, crates and such) are surrounded by an invisible barrier that allows you to shoot through, but doesn't allow you to jump over these obstacles. Which becomes even more annoying when you see your enemies parkour-vaulting over them, popping behind them, or shooting blindly from cover - all the things you can watch but cannot do.",

A majority of the game is spent building your reputation. Your only act of significance occurs in the final moments of the game. Unfortunately, even the endgame isn't rewarding.  Playing on the second most difficult setting, I died only twice. Rage is ridiculously easy. The AI is predictable and lacks intelligence. The guns are imbalanced.

However, refining the bare minimum won't get you very far. Nothing about Rage makes it stand out. Yes, it is fun. But no, it isn't memorable.  Grade: B-",

Sure the shooting is there and what shooting there is is incredibly well done with locational damage and some decent weapons. As well as some amazing enemy animations as well as AI that is impressive in it's ability to take cover. Rage offers more than this though with it's light RPG elements such as crafting and 'quests' and the buggy driving mechanics which will come in to play while travelling to your quest locations. Here Id's abilty shines with car combat that wouldn't be out of place in a dedicated arcade racer. What really impresses though are the NPC animations, such as the blind Dr with the shoulder robot or the Mayor of Wellsprings who all show movie quality animations and facial tech. Just be wary if you're an ATI owner as there are some driver issues related to this game. 8/10.",

First of all I have to say I was really excited about this game when it was announced and after watching early build footage and trailers. I pictured Fallout with vehicles. I immediatly pre-ordered the game and waited for release day.  My first attempt at playing Rage was marred by graphical annoyances as turning in the game would cause me to see textures low rez for a second before the high rez textures would load. This was immensly annoying as the game didn't even look that great to begin with. After pouring through forums and tech support there didn't seem to be a fix that would cure this bug so I continued playing until I got my first vehicle. This is when I stopped playing. The vehicles have very limited physics and the landscape are very limited in scale that there didn't seem to be any fun to be had at driving. I stopped playing shortly after that and considered this game a loss. Fast forward years later and I decided to play it again, knowing what I did about the games limitations and hoping the texture bug would atleast be fixed. Now that is when the fun began. The vehicle part of the game is more like Borderlands than some surreal open world driving simulator that I had hoped. Vehicles have very limited physics and the areas you drive through are just large hallways that you go through to get from point A to point B with a few enemies thrown inbetween. But what makes Rage shine is the combat. Its what ID software does best, the feel and sound of the weapons and the enemies reaction to getting shot. After getting over my initial expectations I was able to enjoy the game for what it is, A really fun shooter. If your looking that and nothing more you will be pleased.",

The graphics are amazing and the game is open-world... if you consider a two-square mile canion with uninteractive gorgeous scenarious where you CAN´T GO open-world.  You race in normal races and stupid ones where the objective moves constantly - so even if you tuned up your car you end up losing because you have no idea where to go - and battle with them, either against easy enemies or an horde of final ones, inside and outside the lanes.  This was supposed to be a post-apocaliptic race battler with RPG elements. What´s the problem with it? ID´s software dumb touch is the problem. Closing the player in a dead end with either a wave of enemies or big bosses, dumbly blocking strategical positions and exits with impassible little fences, like DOOM does. limiting ammo and grinding, removing maps from interiors so you get lost after you finish the level (the old 'where the ♥♥♥♥ next?!?'), and the most imcompetent corpse-looting in the history of games (not like STALKER where you can loot weapons, or Elders Scrolls where you can even loot armor: this ♥♥♥♥ get 5 Bucks per corpse and a little random ammo).

After about a hour of playing i had to take a break because i felt nauseous and my eye's felt dry. It's the same strain level as Jazz Jackrabbit... The controls are a bit dodgy, the feeling of a bad PC port is big in this game. By tapping the strafe button you take a big step to the side instead of a normal step in all of the other FPS's so the controls can be called quite bulky, invisible walls are used almost as much as in the old-school Medal of honor titles which means that you will encounter allot of these, and the inventory system is just bad, you can clearly see that it was designed for a controller. The texture loads a bit slow, so be prepared for allot of texture loads while you play.  Overall the weapons and character models look nice, the intro sucked me right into the game and atmosphere but as soon as the game really began it lost all of its charm. It's worth the 5 euro's i spend on it but if it is above this price i would spend the money on a game like Fallout 3 since this is a better alternative.  After playing for 90 minutes i rate it a 6,5/10, mainly due to the dodgy controls and eye straining style. This also gets my 'Bad port' stamp of disapproval.",

The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently. NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times. The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least. While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted. The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types.   The game could have been better, defiantly, the story could have been a bit better and my god the texture pop in is the worst I have ever seen in my life, however it may not have entirely been iD’s fault based on what I’ve read. Even on current gen systems you will at times get odd FPS loss and major screen tearing and if you have an ATI card you might want to look else where because I have read that people are STILL having trouble running this game.   If you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better. It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3, it is very much in between, far better gun play then FO3 for sure however.",

Let's start of with what I dislike.  Negative: *You do not have an in-game town/world map, kind of sucks cause I'm one of those guys who likes to explore everything and check off certain areas as 'done' with memorizing the areas through world map. On the other hand the game seem to be so linear that you don't need one.  *The jump seems worthless, there are obstacles in the game that's not even up to your knees that you can't jump across, which makes me think 'why did they even give you the option to use jump at all?'. You can't even climb over desks, or big windows with stuff in it, you have to get a lock grinder or whatever it's called to blow up the door. That's so poor.  *A headshot with the crappy pistol doesn't kill the enemy, not even 1 feet away. A bullet through the skull on a human being should kill him. (And no, I do not mean the guys with helmets)  *The co-op was a bit dissapointing and really short, I was expecting being able to play full campaign with my brother and not some short missions. Maybe I did my research badly before purchasing the game.  *Using bandages or creating them seem to be quite useless. I mean you do regenerate full health by just not getting shot anwyay and if you badly need a bandage you're probably screwed over anyway cause you need to swap to the bandages from whatever you're currently using, like HE grenades or whatever. A heal button is missed in those scenarios, like pressing 'H' on your keyboard.  *The mouse feels bad when you're in the menu, checking inventory, quests and things like that. Feels like it's lagging.  *In combat you can't lean!! I hate that you can't lean and take cover, best you can do is to crouch behind a desk or things a like and just stand up to shoot and then sit again. I think it's rreally poor that you can't lean when your opponents can do all kind of stuff, lean, jump over desks, climb though windows, take their arm up with gun only shooting at you while taking cover.  Postive: *The vehicles looks good and are fun to drive.  *The FPS is overall nice, except you can't lean!  *The enviroments and graphics are okay for being a couple of years old game, don't see why people complain over it really.  *The enemies move good and make up for the lack of leaning.  *Quests are OK.  Overall, there is more negative things to say about the game then positive. I would recommend this game at a low price on sale, but no chance of getting it at it's full price, there for I do NOT recommend buying this game. It kills some time sure, but if you're out after a good fps game, spend your money on something else.   ",

You can visit a total of 5 or so dungeons and then do them again in sidequests. You'll probably forget them anyway. One dungeon is special though as you can revisit it backwards. That one you will remember for life!  In the free cities you can join offroad races in different modes, most of them spiced by miniguns and rockets. Races earn you points you can spend on vehicle upgrades like thicker armour and wheel spikes.  I don't think multiplayer (racing only) was ever alive in this game on PC and I only tried co-op back at release and it was too laggy.  Pros: I really enjoyed shooting.

            "review_text": "In my opinion, Rage isn't so bad, for the price at least ($4.99 Discount) ($9.99 Original price). The game suffers greatly from pop-ins, boring story, and stiff gameplay. For some reason lowering the graphic settings seems to help simmer down the pop in issues for me. The FPS combat aspect is fun but still lacking. The enemies' movements are pretty cool, but you as the player, your movements are very poor in comparison.  If the player had the abilities to evade and maneuver more like or similar to the enemies it would be a great asset to the gameplay. I haven't gotten far into the story, but I can tell you now it isn't something great. While the beginning shows something unique it quickly starts to fall bland and boneless. So far it has been missions such as:  'Go to this person and get something. 'OH, that person's something has been stolen.  'Go to a Raider's camp and retrieve it.'  There is no actual Open world, everything is oddly convenient. Also, you can't pick up enemy weapons and gear. The game is very, very, basic. Which is unfortunate, it had potential. Rage has a Mad Max feel to it, you can race with your buggy and combat enemies with mounted weapons, but sadly the world just isn't open enough to justify it.    This game is simply nothing exciting, but truth is I'm enjoying the game for what it costs. I would say give the game a try if it's on discount. I wouldn't recommend paying $10 as for this game honestly doesn't feel like a $10 game.   Final Rating: 6/10 Could've been much better.",

Even my potato (GT635M) could handle the game at most graphical options high without dropping bellow 35-40FPS.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, fresh, FPS experience. It's sad that the game was plagued by numerous technical issues upon launch and most people just gave up on it. Just don't go in expecting a more actiony version of Fallout, instead appreciate the effort put into all the different little details and you're gonna have a good time.

            "review_text": "It seems that success was never in Rage's destiny. id Software (known for their genre-defining shooters, Wolfenstein 3D and Doom) released their 2011 open-world shooter in a post-Fallout 3 gaming landscape, choosing to leave their world fairly empty and uneventful aside from car combat encounters. It's testament to id Software's brilliance at making a polished combat system that the many flaws Rage has don't massively detract from the fun you'll have playing through it.   It's glaringly apparent throughout Rage that much work has gone into the combat. Guns feel great to fire, with multiple modes of fire and different kinds of ammo to suit the varied situations and enemies you'll be encountering. There's a decent selection of them too, with the Combat Shotgun being a particular favourite, as you blast shells into mutants and bandits alike. There's also an Engineering (aka crafting) element, where you combine components to build certain tools. It's quite fun to build Sentry Turrets and deploy them, as well as RC Car Bombs that you can drive into a group of enemies and detonate. You'll quickly find yourself creating bandages to heal up more quickly, and making a ton of Pop Rockets for your shotgun for that extra explosive bang. Simply put, id knows how to do guns and do them right.  As mentioned before, there's a fair bit of car combat in the game. We've since had games like Mad Max that do this quite a bit better, but here it's not too bad. You get a selection of cars throughout the game, and you can arm those with machine guns and rockets. Most of your encounters will be as you drive from one objective to another, and you can earn money from destroying bandit vehicles and returning to Wellspring or Subway Town for rewards. There's a decent amount of things to do in the game, with races and mini-games, plus the two main towns with their Job Boards that offer side quests.   The biggest issues with Rage all concern its story and quests. You're mostly looking at a run of fetch quests throughout the game, and everything feels a bit samey. There's a general feeling of 'meh' throughout the experience, as you venture into locations (sometimes more than once if you have to go back for a side quest) and dispatch of enemies, then either pick something up to bring back to town or plant something there. This is mostly a game that concerns itself with the fun feeling of shooting things, so in that respect it succeeds, but you'll not be playing this for any interesting or in-depth questlines. It's all going to wash over you, as the story limps to its conclusion. It's clear a sequel was planned, given the rushed, open-ended final cutscene.  Overall, I do recommend Rage. I enjoyed my time with it, because the things that id gets right are the things that tend to matter in their games. You're getting a polished combat system, with plenty of nice guns and tons of enemies to shoot them at. You're even getting a small open-world to enjoy, even though there's not all that much to do in it aside from drive around, shoot other cars and occasionally pop in for a quick match of Bash TV. There's a bit more to do in the towns and those are the activities that will take up much of your time. The quests are the major flaw here, being generally uninteresting and uninspired. Rage is still id's most underrated game, and while its flaws will be apparent to you as you play through it, there's some good, solid stuff here that makes for an enjoyable experience.   ",

            "review_text": "Another game I bought on release, stopped playing then picked it up later to finish. Where to begin?  - Release for this game had a BUNCH of problems. Most notable was the Megatexture system they tried. While they fixed most of it. Some of the problems still linger, such as texture pop in, blurry and mushed textures. Like any other games associated with Bethesda. The game looks great indoors and at close ranges, looking into the distance is nothing but blobs and blotches.  - The Gunplay is alright. There is some downs, some ups. But most of all, it stays average throughout the entire game. There is a good assortment of weapons and equipment you can use. But you'll just find yourself sticking to the same few weapons throughout the game, as using anything else is rather pointless.  Lets start off with the Wingsticks. Holy ♥♥♥♥ these things are OP. There is no reason to use any other sort of equipment besides these. HE Grenades take to detonate, and won't always kill everyone. Turrets take forever to kill someone and can be destroyed with a few shots. Wingsticks however, once thrown will fly towards the enemy and one shot them, occasionally they'll fly back or you can pull them out of their skull. Which makes it easy to keep a surplus of them, later on in the game you can upgrade them so they'll fly around walls or cover, kill multiple people and then come back. You could compete the game no problem only using wingsticks.  Some of the equipment is useless, or very situational. You do a quest in the first zone to get some RC car bombs. During this quest, you can use them to great affect and to complete objectives. They have small tunnels where you can drive these RC bombs through, kill people in cover and all sorts of stuff. However, no where else in the game features these tunnels and all the NPC enemies will focus fire these car bombs down. So there is no reason to use them again.  Same thing can be said with all the ammo and weapon types in the game. Once you get a certain type, there is no reason to using anything else. Most of the pistol ammo is useless once you get Fatboys/FatMammas. The Crossbow is completely useless, as there is no stealth in the game so the Sniper Rifle works better for long ranged, all of the bolts are situational and much like the RC cars, useless outside of missions. Including the Mind Control bolts, which are supposed to be a 'superweapon', but its just quicker and easier to dispatch people with another gun.  The Weapon Upgrades, Inventory, Crafting system and everything else feel forgotten about. There is little reason to craft anything, the inventory has no limits. The weapon upgrades can be checked, but they're so few and used for four weapons. In the all, they all feel useless and you'll likely very rarely use any of them.  - Racing and driving is seriously the best feature of this game. It handles better than anything else and feels great.   - The Story is a mixed bag, I really enjoy the first area to the game. Its much bigger and most of the content takes place here. The theme is nice, people trying to make it by. Bandit and mutant troubles all over the place with people occasionally mentioning 'The Authority' like they're some big bad. However, as soon as the resistance comes into play, everything else is practically forgotten about and you're thrust in with them with little explanation.   By the time you're done listening to people mentioning that they're TOTALLY NOT IN THE RESISTACNE. You go do a quest in the Dead City. Which has a lot of hype built up around it, but in the end, it has little to do with the game. (Not to mention, it has a great atmosphere). You go in there, fight an extremely busy boss and then you're back out again. Then you're thrust into the resistance with no real reason to join them, other than 'The Authority is bad mmkay.'   You finally get to run into the Authority and they seem to be a real threat compared to bandits and mutants you've been fighting. But midway through the mission they become a trival experience, as you get everything you need to fight them. Including pulse shots that oneshot them. EMP Grenades, which disable armor and shields, and armor piercing rounds. Which leave little reason to use anything else when fighting them. Besides Wingsticks. After doing all this, you have to do a few more missions, the town you're in starts becoming occupied by Authority. Which provides a good feel and some seriousness to the story. Then you're offered to head to the second area with the Resistance to help take the fight to the Authority and help end them for once and for all.    The second area is completely devoid of any good feelings, atmosphere, etc. Its gray and bland. The most interesting thing in the entire area is a broken apart cargo ship. Which is only there for some neat factor. The rest of the story is suddenly thrust into your face and you're dropped in the middle of it. Then its promptly pushed to the side and you need to go do some errands for the towns Mob Boss Mayor and reputation so people don't rat you out to the Authority. However, the latter doesn't really affect anything. If you talk anyone in the town, they'll tell you that they already know who you are and that they're counting on you.   You run around, do about 2-3 errands for the Mob Boss so you can get his approval to work out of his city. Which once again, doesn't make any sense due to the entire having been there for ages, and him being anti-authority. (Not to mention, everyone says you need to do this before you can do any sidequest/shopping. But as soon as you talk to him you can do it all anyways without completing any of his quest). So you do them, and then suddenly it doesn't matter anyways, because the Mob Boss was taken away by the Authority. Which gives a feeling of 'Why did I even bother?' Then you need to go back down and talk to the resistance to carry on.  You also have the option to do a few side quest, there is about 1-2 given by NPCs, and a few on the job board you can find. But is insanely lacking compared to the first zone. The second task given to you by the resistance, is to finally take the fight to the authority. You need to go disable some shields on the bridge and finally get to encounter some new Authority units, like their vehicles. However, you can one shot any of the authority vehicles with the pulse cannon on your own. So its another moot point.  Once you're at the bridge, you take the lift up kill a few guys (literally about 6-10 guys). Disable the shields and head back to talk to the resistance again. Which then they inform you that you're now at the end of the game and this is the final mission and you're gonna take down the authority. You get in your vehicle, head across the bridge and find a conveniently place side entrance. The final mission is a cake walk, they give you a OP gatling gun so you can blow apart what few enemies you come across. You go through a few hallways, take a elevator ride up. You're now at your objective.  It gets even worse, the final 'fight' of the game is nothing more than a wave attack of about 6 fodder infantry, on three waves. So yeah, a total of 18 weak units. There is no boss fight with the General Cross, who everyone mentions throughout the game. You quickly dispatch these last few units, hit the console. Boom, game done. Cutscenes, credits. Overall, it feels like they ran out of production time. The second zone/part of the story is about 1/4th the content of the first area. The story is hamfisted and shoved in your face, which overall leaves a unsatisfying taste in your mouth. Which is a shame.  I could describe a lot of other things, but I'm hitting the character limit. Overall, the game is mediocre and is only worth to buy when on sale for cheap. Its something good to waste a few hours on. But the racing and driving is great. I'd recommend buying it for a few dollars just for that.",

You have atleast some open world, which you will only see from your vehicle, because everything else is absolutely nonsense (You'll probably die, atleast in Ultra Nightmare, but i can't tell about the other difficulties). Once you accept a quest (you have to in order progress in the campaign) your destination is set and you move yourself in front of a dungeon-like entrance (no, seriously there is an entrance for every quest). Later in the game some scripted events in certain places will delay your arrival at your destination, if you are not cautious From that point on even Call of Duty is more open world than this game (also applies to each single level). The game also tells you to play a level again, in reverse. That happened to me once or twice i don't really remember, nevertheless it is definately too often in my opinion. To be honest, the animations are really good. Although they repeat themselves (no-few variety) as you can imagine. The graphics load themselves as you move on, none of them are preloaded so prepare yourself to see some washy/blurry textures if you really want to buy it.

It's like a more serious version of Borderlands, with an expanded vehicle/race system and some more 'realistic' weapon options. And you are ON EARTH after a meteor wiped out civilization, instead of on an alien world.  This game is fun, if you can get it for cheap. It involves a lot of running around a post-apocalyptic world and killing some mutant bandits with a fairly wide variety of weapons. You also get to drive around in three different vehicles, which you can upgrade using points you earn through racing events. It also has an invention/engineering system where you use blueprints and components to build special bullets, health boosters, and sentry turrets. Your character was in suspended animation before the meteor hit, as the government's attempt to reboot society in case everyone else died. So you're a man from the past, trying to fit in in a future where society has totally collapsed and the face of the planet has changed.  The weapons are set, you don't find flaming shotguns or acid SMG's dropped by enemies or hidden in chests. You can build special bulltes for certain guns though, which mostly either increase damage or scramble enemy shields &amp; robotics. But the gameplay and plot feel a lot like Borderlands... but with less humor. It's like a more serious version of Borderlands. You run (or drive) around the desert wasteland, doing a few 'fetch quests' for the locals. Then you have to fight the local army that calls themselves 'the Authority' to prevent them from doing any more experiments to make mutant weapons with which to oppress the people and rule what's left of the human race. Oh, and you have a special suit with nanobots that can revive you when you die. But it has to recharge between uses.  If you get the DLC mission pack, you also have access to a fun series of missions to take down another bunch of bandits, you get a girlfriend, and you get a new weapon that can fire nails or convert into a magnetic railgun that shoots through walls. When you get the DLC, play those missions as you find them. I mean, you can wait until you get a little further into the game, if you feel like you need to find some new ammo or something, but really they are designed to be played as you go. Don't wait until after you beat the main game or you miss out on the real usefulness of the nail/rail-gun and having your girl show up in your trophy room. The DLC missions really fit right in with the main game timeline and plot. The first one is a cavern located behind Dan Hagar's garage. The rest should be easy to find.",

The bad things about the game is that, the enemies are the same. You have the ones that run at you, you have the annoying ones that hide behind anything. Finally, the boss, the every little that there are, they suck, a few bullets and grenades, then there done. The quest are the same, go do this, return to the person, and repeat.

Pros: - Beautiful graphics despite the laggy textures. - Wingsticks - Guns were reasonably fun to use - Secret areas that payed homage to older Id Software games were fun to go through, even if they were short-lived  Cons: - EVERYTHING ELSE  For a company that practically started the business of FPS gaming, this is a ♥♥♥♥ poor showing from them. The story was basically non-existent. The driving parts of the game were only there to kill time before you found the next tunnel or sewer to walk through, and were pretty much only necessary because someone in the development stage couldn't decide whether the game should be open-world or straight FPS. So they decided to mix and match, and came up with snake eyes.   I have said it before: 'If a game has brilliant graphics and a bad story, the game will be terrible.' RAGE is one of those games. I had the same sort of problems with Fable 3 and its terrible story. But I would sooner play that than this.  Bottom line, RAGE is hands down, the worst game I have ever played, and now it is forever going to stare at me from my Steam library because I was stupid enough to waste good money on it.  If you want a good post-apocalyptic game, try the Borderlands franchise. Those games actually have full campaign co-op, a decent story, interesting characters, and the vehicles actually serve a purpose.

            "review_text": "RAGE was a title that id Software fans were pretty well hyped for, hoping it would prove an evolutionary engine leaps beyond what we got with Quake 3 and Doom 3. Keep in mind it had been 7 years since id had brought forth a title from their own studio (Quake 4 was done by Raven Software in the interim, with id as the publisher). There was a lot of excitement.  Ultimately, RAGE is a heartbreaking experiment in a new engine. I can't recommend the title because, compared to other FPS shooters of the era, it's simply boring. The mechanics are sound but lackluster; the sound design is borderline awful (noticable cuts between track loops - very unfortunate); the skyboxes, while pretty, feature clouds that don't move (making it look like the picture map that it is, rather than an extension of the world). Invisible walls abound. Driving is not fulfilling as the vehicles handle rather poorly compared to other titles. SHOOTING isn't fulfilling - headshots tend to not insta-kill targets unless higher-end weapons are used - and honestly, if the shooting in an FPS doesn't make you go 'mmm', you probably aren't looking forward to a great time.  Character designs are decent, but there isn't any way to advance dialogue - you either have to listen to it or walk away from someone to get the game's quests to pop. Which brings me to the quest engine - it's a fairly rudimentary setup designed to give you objectives to keep you moving through the world in a more or less linear fashion. The game isn't on rails in absolute terms, though it might as well be (it might arguably have benefitted from some chaptering as a way to improve the pacing, a la the original Dead Space, perhaps).  If you're looking for a solid open world style shooter, my recommendation is to get deep into the Borderlands franchise. If you want something grittier, there are a ton of options out there where the shooting is a joy, the sounds are good, and the graphics are either on par or better than what's presented here.  As much as I love id's prior work, I can't recommend RAGE. I'm a fan of all sorts of games, but this one just put me to sleep. Didn't engage with it, couldn't love it, and I vote this one as skippable.    For: people collecting all the id titles to satisfy a fetishistic urge Not for: people who like first-person shooters",

I have heard differing oppinion about the later part of the story and the end of the game. I feel the end was a bit weak but it did not affect my oppinion of the game that much (might be that i did not have that high expectations of the ending).  Rage is not a hard game if you are used to shooters (FPS). I played it on normal and on the hardest dificulty and even if it was harder it was not to dificult.  I recomend the game. It is fun and a good shooter with a strong story (exept maby the end).  It is also good if you want a post appcalyptic setting without the zombies that are flooding the games these days.   /K4tch",

Rage is a very unique first person shooter set in the post apocalyptic Earth, after a massive asteroid has hit the planet. Due to the toxicity released upon impact, some humans have turned into 'mutants' where as the remaining lot has hidden underground or in some sort of shelter. With time, cities have been build from scrap left around where as most of old buildings were abandoned. You emerge into this vast wasteland to discover humanity working to rebuild itself against such forces as bandit gangs, mutants, and the Authority – an oppressive government regime that has a special interest in your character in particular.   This game can be compared to the Metro series, although having played both, i must say the combat in Rage is a lot more satisfying. The abbility to craft, sell and buy items is really cool. Just like in Metro, you have to buy your own ammunition which adds realism. You can customise weapons, improving accuracy, damage etc. You get to participate in car races, upgrade your car, add weapons to it, carry out quests like in a standard rpg. The world is not huge, but large enough, missions are difficult and very interesting. There is also a lot of gore.....u can actually blow other peoples heads with a sniper rifle :D Overall I highly recommend this game to any fps fan who also is in to the post apocalyptic atmosphere, likes to explore, gather resources and enjoys a bit of melee/gun combat brutality. It really needs more positive reviews, because it deserves it 100%. I r8 8/8 xD",

The gameplay isn't anytihng really new, with the standard fps weapon selection and enemy types. However, good enemy AI combined with their unique tendency to bob and weave and climb around levels, combined with very solid game mechanics, keeps things fun enough. Vehicular combat is also enjoyable; rally racing itself seems like it could be a fun PVP standalone, and I'd love to have a local multiplayer version.   Now for the bad: Nothing in Rage feels like it matters. While the world and the characters in it look and sound great, none of them do anything or have any particular characteristics to make you care about them one way or the other. They are merely window dressing. The storyline itself is a bare bones mash up of Half Life 2 and Fallout, with bland generic factions like the Resistance and the Authority. There is no main antagonist. Missions are repetitive, with side quests basically just sending you back to zones you've already cleared in story missions. It's also far too easy to actually be engaging, and you'll never really experience any of the tension that the games great looking enemies could have inspired. Also, the game was also clearly designed and optimized for console, and some of the UI elements are just awful on PC (for example, only being able to assign 4 useable items to quickslot keys, rather than just allowing the player to assign them to whatever keys they like). The game doesn't intelligently determine when you're using a keyboard/mouse or a controller, so controller propmts will stay on the screen even when using a keyboard until you disable the controller in settings (something I don't like doing, because generally I use a controller for the driving portions of the game, and a keyboard/mouse for shooting). There are also notiiceable performance issues, with framerates occasionaly plummetting for no good reason, and textures bouncing back and forth between high and low quality versions (this is on a gtx 960, which should be more than adequate to run this game at full settings).   I'm kind of on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not; really I'd give it about a 60-70 at most, and there are certainly better games out there to play. Since Steams system requires giving it either a yay or nay, I'll recommend it with a couple of strong caveats: If you're looking for an engaging story, avoid it. If you want a game that's perfectly optimized for PC, avoid it. If you are strictly looking for a pretty looking, decent FPS, by all means give it a shot.",

The mechanics are fair, the enemies are pretty interesting, and the textures are nice, along with the weapons in my opinion. However, the weapons are more typical of the more common first person shooter. Having devastating ammo types was a good move, but I believe that the weapons in general should be lootable from various enemies. The other issue is that this is a pretty bad port for a beloved studio such as ID. All in all, it's worth the current price, but don't expect to much out of this game.   I have noticed that people have bashed this game for ripping off borderlands. That is actually false, as this game was in development before borderlands, even if it came out last. You can thank 2k for their brilliant rip-off known as borderlands. This game does borrow a lot from fallout, which is only excusable if you count the fact that both this game and fallout 3 through 4 were made by Bethesda.",

I heard a lot about the quality animations of the game before it was released, and it does animate nicely. It ends up not mattering in the slightest because enemies either run directly at you or hide behind cover, slowly peeking out. They do not seem to work together at all, and the most impressive thing the AI does is retreat further back to different cover.  It feels like there is mouse smoothing, steering is annoyingly controlled via keyboard instead of mouse, when shot your view becomes 'doubled' which looks kind of neat but is complete crap for controlling and aiming.  If you took Borderlands, removed the cartoon outlines on everything, removed the randomly generated weapons, removed talent trees, removed the humor, limited the fps to 60 and forced mouse smoothing... then the result would still be a game that is far better than Rage in every regard.  There is not really any upside to playing this game. Only purchase this if you really love ID games, you have completed all other FPS titles in your library, and the game is under 5 dollars.",

I'm not normally a fan of multiple types of gameplay in one game (ie; racing in an FPS), but in this game it works. The races serve not only to let you get better vehicles and weapons, but you're getting more practice driving -- and when you're out in the wastelands being attacked by other vehicles, this training comes in handy.   The graphics are incredible, the scenes, the town layouts, the building design, the layout of the wastelands, are all frikkin awesome.

In other words, this is a solid FPS.  But here's my problem, it's so very predictable and I found the story so completely unengaging that I ended up asking myself why I was playing this. The bad guys run at you typically the same way and if you are smart enough to hold back and entice them, you'll never die and can very often clear a room from a distance. On the other hand, go in guns blazing and you're meat pretty fast.  So basically I just got bored, which is unfortunate since there is so much that is right with this game. It is hard to describe what is missing, but it is this feeling that no matter the quest, you're still doing the same thing and after a while it just gets old. especially when there are so many new games out there to be played...

The rest of the game is a first person shooter with a nice 90s-style like...dozen weapons or so, as I recall, at least with the DLC...which I would recommend getting a few hours into the game if you find yourself enjoying it so far.  There's some crafting, a few little minor upgrades (increasing max health and weapon parts), and NPCs to get a small number of quests/missions from. The story is alright, though not very engrossing. The setting and gameplay are the big draws here. I will say now that the ending sucks. It's boring and weak. That is all.

There were clearly some good ideas in there, and it might have been a good game, but so much of it is muddled and confused.   I find the gunplay, which some praise, to be cheap. Enemies are simply bullet sponges but conversely you're never really in danger. You have all these cool ammo types, but then switching ammo is slow and incredibly cumbersome, so you feel you are being punished for something that's clearly supposed to be a fun mechanic. All the battles are very samey because every area you're on rails and the enemy just pops out of rediculous spawn points. Half way through the game instead of being able to kill everything one shot with a sniper rifle, you have to shoot their helmet off and then shoot them again. It's dull, it's repetitive, that gives you an idea of their idea of 'progression'. I finally snapped when bare chested hatchet guys were running at me and taking half a clip of the assault rifle to die. The world is so incosistent. One gun is wildly overpowered than the rest, the pop rockets, so you find yourself using the same gun over and over, and occasionally trying others for some sort of variety, anything different.  As for the RPG element, everything's incredibly linear again, but they almost present it as if you can go where you want, but there aren't any maps. Yes no maps, so even if you wanted to go where you wanted, you'd get lost in the incredibly samey and dull canyons. Progression and inventory is pathetic and a pointless waste of time. Certain things cost rediculous amounts of money just to be a money sink.   There is so much wrong with it, so many poor design choices, that you should spend your time elsewhere.

It promises a lot more than it delivers as far the 'open-world' aspect goes, there's quite a large area of environment that shows off the the Mega Texture technology, but really the outside is pretty empty. Once you get past that however there is a very solid game here.  Artistic direction is imaginative and special, characters have actual character, gunplay is classic solid idsoftware stock, combat as a whole being very satisfying. The Wastland Legends co-op is particularly good and can also be played single player for a real challenge. The vehicles and racing is servicable but doesn't particularly shine.   Overall RAGE is recommended but don't expect Borderlands or Fallout, otherwise you're likely going to be disappointed. However getting past what RAGE is not and you find yourself a very well crafted game, it does what it does do well and it retains the core of what an FPS should feel like, stripping away the contemporary fluff and just delivering good 'ole fashioned ballistic mayhem.",

The developers were flamed on all forums for developing the game with gaming consoles in mind. And I have to admit that the game could have (and should have) looked alot better.  So once the technical issues are resoved, I would still recommend this game as a 1st person shooter. The enemies are really fun and the guns are pretty cool too. And in spite of some horrible textures, the areas you visit are extremely well designed.  The negative: Some people experience technical difficulties and graphical glitches.

Now, before I get into the gist of it all I would warn everyone from RAGING from throwing your keyboard + mouse or gamepad across the screen into the monitor.   A unique taste of an fps genre, it's 60 fps environment that Cormack claims within the game definetly sets the atnmosphere and mood of the game. Many times you will wander through the desert by foot, or by vehicle or tread through unspoken territory and be in awe at the sheer dense rock (believe or not) or the textures itself.   Graphiclly speaking, Cormack boasts his 60 fps with top-notch quality indeed. That coincides with the ambience of the soundtrack! Many times you will go through areas or fights where the tempo of music fits well with the theme of it all. A sense of dread, a sense of fore-boding, or the occasional sense of being scared.  Game-play wise, it's an fps so expect a large variety of weapons to use, much like the DOOM days, where you can carry a minigun, shotgun, pistol, etc. and more all within the space of a keyboard!  RAGE is built for the PC, with more options available in the graphics options such as SMART, yes it also has gamepad support specifically the xbox 360. Nevertheless RAGE at it's core is hard-core pc and not a console port, just makes SURE you have a above-average rig in order to play this game properly!  Overall, I didn't RAGE through this game, (Hard to believe to be quite honest. yet for any Gamers out there looking for a Doom or Wolfenstein, or just bloody hate the world, I want an apocalypse man! kind of fellow, I'd suggest giving RAGE a go!

Although everyone hates Bethesda and although all of you hate them, All of you still own one or more of their published games and probably have played them all more than once.   To me the graphics were dead on, and the game mechanics were what they needed to be. Most of all I just plainly had fun with the game.   The cons to it though are that they put this game out as a filler between projects that were supposed to be bigger and better things ( ie. ESO, and Dishonored). The story behind this game was spectacular considering that it was left exremely short at the end. I was also severely disappointed in the fact that this was NOT an open world to explore RPG type of game. If it would have been I would have probably had an extreme heart attack. Also the Game Editor that they released in hopes that this game would possibly revive itself ( with the likes of the G.E.C.K. and the Creation Kit) was (OMFG!) almost impossible to use and understand unless you were an advanced modder, so that completely left that out for everyone because most of all the advanced modders I know of were building massive mods for other games like Fallout 3, and Skyrim.

            "review_text": "Overall: 6/10 (TLDR version) RAGE is overall rather boring for being advertised as a FPS. Long 'wait' times between points of action, result in the overall suggish feel of the game. Small 'open' world makes traveling between locations a chore. Plot is almost non-existant and missions are pointless and unchallenging.   Initial Expectations: I bought RAGE expecting a mix of Fallout and Borderlands. However this game doesn't really live up to either of those expectations. The beginning feels almost identical to Fallout - world ends, everyone jumps in these vaults --ahem 'arks' and a lot of them don't work properly. You wake up the only one of your ark to survive.   Character Development - or lack thereof: That's about as much character development you'll get. You don't get to customize your character at all. No picking sex, no custom looks. Aside from getting to pick your 'armor' later on in the game play, looks seem to be completely pointless (you'll rarely see your armor anyway).   Gameplay - Overall: Gameplay feels very minigame-ish. Due to the overall small map size, you're contastly being loaded into arenas to complete the various quests and races throughout the game. Each race is held within a arena, but it is not a custom area. Instead it is a restricted copy of the overall map, with areas 'outside' the race being blocked off by barriers. Another arena gameplay minigame is waved base: basically survive X number of waves in order to win. While the waves do slightly increase in difficulty, I had no issue beating in on the play through. Other little minigames exist to like some card games, and betting some boring virtual fighting game.  Gameplay - Interactions with NPCs: As you wander about completing rather vague go-here-murder-this and go-here-to-meet-so&amp;so, the plot thus far has been rather dull. Your character does not talk, thus prohibiting character development there as well. And constantly having to click 'E' to continue boring conversation (with no option to skip) has left me browsing the internets while I wait for the monotone voice actor to finish their speech. Even shopping is annoy as you walk up to the shop character, press E and they tell you *EVERYTIME* that they are a shop keeper and sell goods, after you wait for them to finish you must then press E again to even enter the shop. This pointless interaction adds to the overall waste of time and slows down the overall gameplay.  Gameplay - Where is the FPS: RAGE feels more like a racing game then it does a FPS. The little FPS you actually do feels very sluggish. Headshots != insta-kills, in fact you can shoot a bandit at point blank range with a large number of weapons and they'll just recoil. Recoil is actual the worst part of RAGE combat thus far, after you successfully hit an enemy, they'll recoil from the shot, during these few seconds of recoil they are for all intents and purposes immune to any further damage. Sure you can continue to unload ammo into them, but no damage is actually being calculated. This amounts to very sporadic fighting, Shot-wait-shot-wait-shot = dead, resulting in very unexciting combat. Another thing about the combat is it feels the AI cheats. If you are moving in anything but a couch, the enemy doesn't even have to visually see you, you just have to be close enough - and then they charge you.   Gameplay - Racing: Racing and driving is a HUGE part of RAGE. There is no fast travel to any location (not that the map is big enough for that), but instead you must drive EVERYWHERE. While not a huge issue, bandits respawn through the area and slow progress when driving between areas. To get a better car and equip it with weapons you must compete in races. Any car upgrades must be done using credits only available from this race (and thru killing bandit cars later on in the game). Races amount to three types: timed-solo, regular race (with 4 cars) and a weapons race (also with 4 cars). Racing is not difficult and can easily be accomplish with successful bashing of the 'boost' key. There are no penalties for losing or blowing up, thus no cost associated with racing. Basically it's a try-try-try-try again situation until you win enough credits to upgrade your car.",

I got it on sale for $5, and have a 16-hour playthough under my belt and looking forward to another on a harder difficulty.   Likes: ~ Easy to pick up and play. I find some RPG games require me to have significant 'ramp up' time before I'm able to play my best. Plenty of game mechanics to keep things interesting, but not enough to make them obtuse to utalize. ~ Atmosphere: very well done. And the scenery is quite impressive. ~ Enemy ragdolls: Or shall I say lack of them. Dead enemies are quite convincing, many times continuing to stumple forward despite their doomed state. It may seems like something small, but it adds quite a bit IMO.  ~ Game/mission length. Nothing too long and ardarous. Quests can be done quickly, and are all quite fun. The game took me 16 hours to finish on hard difficulty, with lots of side-questing in there. It's a short game, but I do not feel like anything was padded out at all.   Dislikes: ~ The very beginning. Opening cinematic, you take control of your character... and then you are immediately thrown into things. The beginning of the game is a bit jarring, and doesn't really give you the chance to immerse yourself in from the start. Then again, considering the plot, maybe that's intentional... ~ The very end. Game does not allow you to return to the open world and putz around. Either have backup saves or do every side-quest you want to do ASAP.  ~Hard isn't hard: If you're decent at these sorts of games, 'hard' isn't very difficult. For the first hour or 2 of play it is, but once you have decent weapons, you're tough to take down.   Overall, lovely game, definately worth the price. Think of it as an action game with some well-done RPG elements and nice visuals. Good for a couple weekends of fun or more.",
