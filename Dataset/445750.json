    "description": "Made in Construct2, Settled is a story driven game with hints of exploration. As you progress, subtle changes appear. Memories and nightmares act as new areas, although still remaining in the confines of the house. When you reach the end, the conclusion may not be what you expected.",

Messed up little horror game for a fair price with a well told messed up story. Reminds me of 'Home', but a little different, and without branching endings. Takes about 30 minutes to beat. Did I mention it's f***ed up? Because it is. Happy Leap Day!",

It's sick, disturbing and creates a palpable sense of unease.  It relies on some standard horror cliches, but its unexpected, harrowing ending made my skin crawl.   Misleading title, did not feel settled. ",

            "review_text": "Not really sure what to rate this game considering the price point. On one hand, I don't really feel like I gained anything, the story didnt't really engage me, on the other hand it was pretty creepy at some points. The issue being that at what shoud've been the creepiest point, the final cutscene. I didn't feel overly creeped out or surprised, as I had figured out the twist already. Just kind of... dirty I guess? Two dollars would probly be better spent on like, a soda or something.",

            "review_text": "How high is your tolerance for slow-paced weirdness? 'cause that's gonna determine how much you'll enjoy this game. If it's high, you'll enjoy this little story. If it's low, give it a pass.  The gameplay in this game is just a process of moving from one checkpoint that moves the story along to another. There's enough minor things changing along the way that looking at objects multiple times is worthwhile, though if you're only interested in getting through the story you'll find that searching for whatever object gets you back to the story is annoying. Fortunately, there isn't a large swath of objects to interact with so searching is decently short. It's a plus that the gameplay caters to both the person who will click on every interactable object just to see what's there and the person who just wants to get through the game, but the latter type of player will find the gameplay unpleasant.  It's clear that Settled is more focused on its story and setting, because both are quite well-done (if a bit thin at times). There are a few semi-traditional jumpscares, but they don't come out of nowhere - they're built up to using the environments you go through and the sounds you'll hear. Things moving out of the corner of your eye, minor graphical changes in an object you think you've seen over and over - it's the little touches that really give the game an eerie atmosphere. It's good, but nothing in this game is going to seem revolutionary. Without spoiling, blood and guts get thrown around pretty liberally but I sometimes wondered why it was even needed. This is where your tolerance of weirdness is really going to come in handy. The designer clearly has a good understanding of how to build atmosphere and move a story along in a way that feels genuinely strange and uncanny. The somewhat gratuitous blood doesn't always seem in line with that. People with a high tolerance for weird will probably enjoy the story and be able to forgive some of the weaker points in the narrative. You just want some well-made weirdness? You'll get a decent dose of it from this game.  Personally, I had a great time with the game. I like a good short experience and I always enjoy seeing a game with a good horror foundation. If that's what you want, give it a try.",

            "review_text": "Little 30-40 minute game; it is almost linear so we could describe it as a short movie. Pixel graphics, really really good sound and artwork, subliminal stuff here and there... the whole deal for an unsettling and twisted 'experience'.  It reminds me of the good old dark horror games from the 90s.  There are a lot of titles on steam that try to creep you out, but fall short, or end up being plainly boring. Not to mention when they rely on jumpscares. It is a good feat to get you hooked for 30 minutes, and maintaining the pace to creep you out while moving forward. As another reviewer pointed out, you feel being observed during the whole gameplay.  Really interesting if you get it for cheap. Hope the author embarks into a full blown horror title, because the horror part in this game is really well fleshed out. Pun intended here.  edit: the game does not shutdown properly, so it stays running forever if you don't kill the process manually.",
