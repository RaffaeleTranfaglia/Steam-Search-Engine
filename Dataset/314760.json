    "description": "Direct Hit: Missile War offers a deep strategic experience to those weary of the never ending stream of Command and Conquer clones that dominate the real-time strategy market. Direct Hit brings many fresh ideas to the table, in particular: separate player maps, and the replacement of classic RTS units by customizable missiles.",

            "review_text": "Has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get over that, Direct Hit is a fun and complex game. You build your base, mine, develop weapons, and your opponent does the same on their separate map. There's an impressive tech tree and designing different types of missiles, and seeing the result of firing them is fun. Recommended.",
