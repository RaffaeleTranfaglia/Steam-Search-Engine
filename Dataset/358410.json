It's over the top and innovative for its time. There are 2 ways to get this on steam. The other being the Apogee Throwback Pack which also includes Blake Stone",

            "review_text": "Having grown up playing Apogee games, I found this game to be a blast to the past!  Seeing that it was only 7 dollars I had to buy it. Mainly buying it for nostalgia and for the dog mode.  I have to say, playing the game as an invincible dog is surprisingly addicting! It's great fun running around biting your enemies to death and howling in victory.   Dog mode can be entered in cheat mode by typing 'dipstick' and 'woof' while playing the game, but also, bones will appear that will also activate it. The game doesn't spoil you, either, the mode eventually wears off and you can either look for another bone or type 'woof' again.  All in all, I would recommend buying this if you enjoy trips to the old days of gaming, even though this is a revised version of the original ROTT, it still has that old timey feel to it!",
