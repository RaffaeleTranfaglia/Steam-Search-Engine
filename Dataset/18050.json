            "review_text": "I was happy to hear more DeathSpank would be coming. Thongs Of Virtue is basically more of the same, which is great. The new content includes new weapons (assault rifles, bazookas, etc.), enemies and of course many environments to explore, but the formula stays the same. It also has a great deal of fetch quests and grinding, which can be kind of tedious if you play longer sessions, but all things considered, Thongs Of Virtue is on par with its predecessor!  Personal playtime total: 20 hours",

The game embodies a variety of classic RPG elements, tons of loot, quests and the same humorous touch we got used to in the first episode. If you liked the first DeathSpank, you'll also enjoy this one.    +  Funny storyline   +  Funny take on protagonist   +  Classic RPG elements  +  Tons of loot, quests, and a multitude of equipment combos/sets  +  Easy Achievements  +  Local Co-op  -  No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)     Personal Ranking:   8/10 ",

Also, you get to navigate a pirate ship! Too bad it's given to you at the end of the game. :'( Lastly, this game is a tad bit longer that the original so that was cool. All that's left is The Bacoing...",
