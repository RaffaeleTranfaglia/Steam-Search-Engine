            "review_text": "I have played 12 hours of this RESCUE 2 game that i got on release date.   GOOD THINGS: Amazing graphics and lighting Realistic equipment and vehicles Realistic incidents Water levels Several stations Organising vehicles  BAD THINGS: Incidents are repetitivly staged and repeats, which leaves the player bored after an hour of gameplay Fire spread is way too intense, nowhere near a realistic level. The only vehicles that can contain firefighters are engines. Firefighters cannot be customized, in regards to uniform, helmets, colors, tags. Firefighters literally cannot put out fires without constant player supervision. The ai will almost every time stand inside the fire, having given up on attempting to put it out. Foam does not stay onto objects to isolate them from fire or oxidation. why even use it? Oxygen levels. Wow. This is just bad. first of all, NO firefighters use oxygen inside the SCBA. Using Oxygen for breathing creates an enormous fire and explosion hazard if pressurized oxygen were to burst near a fire.  Now for the actual gameplay mechanics of oxygen: Your firefighters oxygen level drains as he is nearby smoke or fire.  if you stand near a fire in the game you have 15 seconds of oxygen. WAT. Diffrent kinds of fires.  Not worth 24,99 hueroes",

Although there still are some bugs to fix, some graphic issues and missions repeating themselves, I find it to be very enjoyable. I do however reconmend adding another fire station, more fire apparatus, an explanation into Class A B and C fires, more missions to randomized from the bag and having any amount of units to respond to a call right away. This game exceeded my expectations and deserves high credit. A+ 4/5 stars and a reconmendation.",

            "review_text": "As a Firefighter I try all of the emergency type games. This one is on par with most and I would give it a 3.5 out 5. My only really dislike of the game is the repeating of the same random missions over and over. The devolopers should have a random scenario generator to make each incident unique. I recommend this game mainly for the fire fighters out there that will get a couple hours of enjoyment out of it. To the average gamer this might not be your cup of tea.",

Very few bugs/glitches were stumbled across while I played this game. Is it better than the last one? No. I only say this because there is not a great variety of fire engines unlike Rescue 1. However, this sequel does not dissapoint, unlike some other sequels. This is a great game for boosting tactical strategy skills. The only negative part of this game is the lack of missions. The amount of story missions (main missions) are too small. If you are reading this while deciding whether to get this game or not, there is only one thing I can say: BUY IT.",

            "review_text": "I've played now 7h, finished the campaign and saw every single mission at least 10 times. Not only the scenarios are repetitive, e.g. a burning hot dog stand, it's every single time the same kind of fire, the same number of casualties and even the places of the bodies in the map are identical. In the end I've finished nearly every missions in about 30 sec by just sending the foam vehicle. The mission costs are identical for every vehicle so there was not even a penalty in doing so. he paramedic mechanics are broken completely, I never needed to use the defibrillator or even the first aid kit. I had buggy pathfinding, glitches, at one point I had to restart, because I weren't able to send the paramedics to hospital.  I'm very disappointed of this game and no, it's not getting better after the first hours!! Absolutely not recommended!",

I enjoyed Rescue 1 and All of the Emergency series from the start, yes pathfinding is dumb in all of those games (and in this one) but one can live with it.  In this game tho, The 'story' ends after (for me) 5h of gameplay, and missions just repeats ... Buy a truck foam sprayer and most of the missions will be completed within 5 seconds of it starting. Where is the joy? the fight? the pressure ... there is none!  One mission - Fire inside a warehouse is prolly the most challanging ... but after you finished it 3 times - what is the point?",
