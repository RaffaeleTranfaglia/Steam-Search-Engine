            "review_text": "Bloody Good Time is what I consider one of my (albeit many) guilty pleasures. Do I recommend it? Well... sort of.  First and foremost, what all potential buyers need to realize is the game never really finished development, may as well be considered 'dead' in terms of the online play (though there are a few groups that do planned game nights), and is far from perfect.  That said, it can be a very enjoyable game to mess around with now and then, as it does have bots for singleplayer experiences. Is it the ultimate in difficult or varied gameplay? Absolutely not. Is it stunningly beautiful with some kind of mind blowing story? Hardly (though I'm quite partial to the graphical style). But CAN YOU HAVE FUN IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE? YES.  I think most folks that bought BGT initially were expecting a much more expanded experience from the developer's previous game: The Ship. However, the development was prematurely ended. They had *no chance* to make this a game that would meet expectations, so complaints about that should be summarily tossed out in my opinion.  What the game DID end up providing was a framework that is fun to play, unique to experience, and a base of inspiration for future developers.  So here's the low-down:  Graphics Pretty good (I'm a huge fan of the style, personally, but I'm kind of weird :P). Nicely stylized and well-themed. Not AAA standard, but who cares about that nonsense.  Sound Another 'pretty good'. Not a lot to say here, as it's a pretty straight forward game that doesn't have a whole lot of chances to show its chops.  Gameplay I REALLY like the gameplay, and while it could have definitely been expanded upon, the version available isn't all that shabby. There is a good amount of weapon variety, map layouts, environmental traps, game modes, etc. Certainly not infinite potential, but a fair amount (depending on price). The bots aren't exactly the smartest AI in the world, but if you intentionally prevent yourself from exploiting their shortcomings they can be quite fun.  Difficulty This is kind of a toss-up. It really depends on how you play and how much you exploit mechanics that will *never* be fixed. Basically: you can have as much fun as you allow yourself to have... if you get greedy and elitist, you'll find that fun-factor and difficulty plummeting quite quickly.  Multiplayer Again, the game is 'dead'.... but if you have friends at a LAN party or whatever, this can be an absolute blast to play. Just don't expect to find any random pick-up games outside of dedicated Steam Groups that hold organized game nights.   Overall I'd say the game is fairly good if you're looking for something new and interesting to mess around with now and then. If you have friends that you can play with, the game can be freakin fantastic.. but bot play will work in the short term (though will definitely get tiring after awhile). But hey, depending on the price it may be worth it for something you can install and play a few hours every now and then (like I do).  Is 'The Ship' better? Yeah, most likely... but BGT is quite a bit different in theme and style, so it's hard to compare. If you want the ultimate in 'murder party' experiences, go with The Ship... if you want a more deathmatch-y, ridiculous setup go with BGT (or just go with both and have all your desires satisfied).  This review makes me wish Steam had a 'sort of' recommendation option, because it really is kind of a 50/50 chance that you'll enjoy it.",

Then again, I'd be the first to admit that I'm ♥♥♥♥ at these deathmatch games, so maybe it was just me. Frustrating, confusing, and not exactly a game which lives up to its name...but at least they didn't just stick a bunch of space marines or soldiers in a war-torn battleground and tell you to plant some flags.

Even if this game was a free-be, don't bother. This game should be downloaded as a top ten game example of how not to make a game.

I feel that Bloody Good Time is a great game and even better than The Ship ,if only there where more maps. Its a shame that theres not alot of players playing the game. So ill only recomend this game if you have friends to play with or if you dont mind playing with bots. Even though theres lack of players there's groups who have events to play this game and theres players on the weekends.If its on sale,I say BUY this game! Overall ill give this game a 8/10.",

            "review_text": "What the game looks like:   Mysterious Director X is collecting fresh faced talent to star in his new movie. He is notorious for going overboard to get the results he wants. You plus 7 other hopeful actors are in the running to get the role of a life-time, if you have what it takes to take on/out the competition. This is the abridged version of what is written on the store page for the game.  One of the game's listed key features is , 'Be a deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Flush your enemies in the toilet, crash their heads on their plates when they eat, do whatever it takes to maim and kill other competitors in nasty and unexpected ways! '  After reading all of this plus watching the trailer, I'm stoked. I assume I'm going to be getting a game that's somewhere between The Haunting: Starring Polterguy and Tecmo's Deception. The player must decide the most inventive, zany, creative ways to kill off the competition. You're given the option to use environmental executitions OR just go at them with whatever weapon you find lying around.  What the game actually is:  The humor and story of the trailer is no where to be found in the beginning 'cut-scene' as you are treated to a 30 second text and still-image intro. No dialouge yet. It tells a vague story of a director who made movies so graphic that they HAD to be real. Do you want to be a star? This is where I started to get concerned.  I'm taken to the main menu, trying to figure out my options as an annoying as F**K voice over spouts taglines on repeat. Think Spider-Man based on the 2000 film 'Did I hurt your tusky wusky', except more frequently. After messing around with the various game modes in Arcade mode I realize that the game is nothing more than a 'theme shooter'. There is no story mode, no plot or linear gameplay. It's either join a fps server or play fps with bots. The entire 'plot' is just to flavor the character choices, weapons and stages. It's completely superficial.  The 'deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' feature you might be wondering about refers to different traps that populate the level. You literally camp by a button, wait for someone to walk over the 'white X' on the floor and then activate the trap. That's it. The graphics have a nice style to them and the levels are well designed. However, the music is annoying, the sound effects are obnoxious and every once in a while the 'director' shouts a stupid catch phrase.  I'm sad I'm out $3.24 but I'm thankful I didn't spend any more than that on this empty shell of a game.",
