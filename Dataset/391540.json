Other than that I thought nothing else of this game. Infact I thought this game was lame in all honesty. So, one day I decided to purchase the game. I thought it was going to be a waste of money. Little did I know this game was going to be the most heart wrenching, intense, emotional game I will ever play in my life. The characters in this game are memberable and relatable. Theres always excitment everywhere you turn. I've been so attached to the characters in this game. When they gave me the option to kill I could never bring myself to it. Even after beating this game I can't bring myself to hurting the characters. WHICH IS SO STRANGE BECAUSE THEY ARE VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS. This just goes to show that this game will make you attach yourself to the characters you interact with. And the underlying theme of this game is incredibly strong. I don't want to reveal it in this review you're just going to have to beat the game and find out for yourself. This game is incredibly powerful and it's totally worth the price. You will be entertained for hours and your heart will be torn into bits and pieces (trust me, my heart was crying so much) If you are still reading this I thank you for your time. Toby Fox and his team did an amazing job on this video game. I've never been happier with a game such as this one. Lastly, Don't judge a book by its cover, as cliche as this sounds, thats what I did and I could've missed out on a great game. That is all I have to say. Have an amazing day:)",

            "review_text": "Well. This game honestly took me by surprise.  When I first saw this game, I didn't really think much of it, just another generic 8-bit RPG filled with memes, so I didn't really ever consider playing it. Then, a friend of mine gifted me it, and I didn't want to be rude and put it off, so I thought 'hey why not give it a shot?'  And so I did. Frankly I was surprised at the bullethell aspect of dodging enemy attacks in an RPG game, and I don't really mind bullet hell so I welcomed it. Boss battles are also quite unique as well. They each have their own gimmick that you have to do, IF you want to befriend them. (tip: if you want to, there is always a way to spare absolutely every enemy you encounter in the game, no matter what. You sort of have to do that on your first playthrough if you want to see the True Ending). In terms of attacks, they each put in their own unique twists in an attempt to hinder you. Frankly I really liked how all the bosses mixed it up in terms of attacks and gimmicks. Enemies are pretty interesting too  In terms of story, how should I put this? It takes a while to find its own voice, and the story seemed generic with a mild humourous twist at first. But then I got to the final few parts of the game, and the story REALLY picked up from there. VERY rarely have I ever played a game where I managed to legit feel something for the story and it's characters, and Undertale's finale did exactly just that.  NPC's are also pretty unique. A lot of them I found pretty funny, although some of the attempted humour may not appeal to some people, as they may think it tried too hard. Nevertheless, almost all the NPCs are likeable and have clear distinct personalities.  The soundtrack. The soundtrack is, quite frankly, one of the best aspects of this game. I have not found one track in here that I dislike. Just about every single one I've heard, I've loved. The best ones are the boss themes, a lot of them are a mix between retro and modern. Toby pulled off this combination in an absolutely excellent way, putting this game's soundtrack in my list of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in any videogame  Overall, would I reccomend it? It depends. If you don't mind bullet hell and retro style graphics, then this is definitely the game for you. If you don't like either as much, then I'm not sure if you will enjoy this game, but I still advise to try it out for the story/characters. This is definitely one of the better games I played this year, and I can't wait to see what'll happen if I do different things during different runs.  10/10",

            "review_text": "Undertale is an RPG game that takes many cliché elements in RPG games and creates it into this new type of game in which, just as the description mentions, you do not have to harm a single soul.   PROS: + Unique type of gameplay + Battles are unlike anything seen before + Surprising elements (planned crashes, (non-harmful) game file issues, etc.) + Many different characteristic entities, all with a very unique behavior + Intriguing artwork + Multiple 'routes' and endings + Great amount of soundtracks + Trading cards with valuable crafting rewards  CONS: - It's not really clear in some battles what you're supposed to do - The protagonist character is rather bland and randomly constructed. It doesn't feel satisfying to be the 'normal guy' in what is best described as a world filled with a colorful mismash of vivid characters - A lot of the game and its areas and transitions make little to no sense - Not exactly story-driven, despite the title being UnderTALE. Rather a loose collection of character dialogues, jokes and interactions that eventually bring you to the end - The further you come in the game, the more it devolves into endless dialogues that really make you want to skip them (for example: the part where Alphys just keeps texting you over and over annoyed me greatly) - You don't do much else than walking around, interacting with characters and having battles  Undertale is a pretty pioneering game when it comes to what we have seen in RPG games already. However, it's not exactly a game for everyone. If the humor didn't catch you, like it didn't with me, chances are you didn't enjoy the game altogether. Despite my generous rating for this game, because I feel that this game is certainly different than your average RPG, I did not enjoy this game a lot because the charm of it simply failed to capture me. Obviously it did click with other people. Even then, I still fail to understand how this game was dominating the gaming market for several months, and seemingly still raging on as I edit this review I typed months ago when the game's afterglow should've ended already.  My rating: 8/10 (read on for more information about this rating. Any more comments about this will get removed)  Edit: I usually don't break character in my reviews, but I want to share a bit of the bad experiences I had with both the game  and  the mentality of the fanbase.  I copied and pasted my review back after a mass fanboy downvoting parade flew over it. It's not really fair to sketch my review off as 'not helpful,' because I give both pros and cons and explain why I don't recommend it. I'm not saying the game is bad or shouldn't be played, but it's not my cup of tea either. I could also just write an awful joke or reference from the game here, like a lot of people do because the crowd deems it 'hilarious,' but that isn't helping anyone, but instead deprives people from helpful reviews that  do  help them getting an insight of what the game is like.  This game enforces some kind of idea that if you don't like the game, you will be found and treated like a heretic and your choice on videogames is suddenly bad. I mean look at the helpful/not helpful ratio of the negative reviews, while most 'singular-line reviews' in the positive section have a 90+ percentage of being 'helpful' (read: completely useless).  I've seen some well-constructed 'not recommended' reviews way better than mine being downvoted beyond belief. This kind of inability to witness people disliking something you love arose in some of my (former) friends and makes me feel like this game is mainly played by teenagers or people who find the hype of randomness and memes hilarious and can't at all take any negativity over it.  Seriously, I have been told these exact words by someone I used to refer to as friend: 'I know what's good for you better than you know yourself.'  Of course, if you don't see yourself in this, you shouldn't feel guilty. I'm not implying that you shouldn't downvote reviews that aren't going further than a few sentences, nor that you shouldn't voice your opinion over it, but instead encourage you to rate and argumentate fairly and considerate. Feel free to downvote mine too if it didn't give you insight or a different perspective. This is all besides the point of this review, but I'd like to have this addressed nevertheless. This seems to play a role in many reviews ever since Steam was invented, and it's a shame.",

Then I stared even longer. The dog fell asleep. I managed to keep up my staring for a decent ten minutes after that but nothing else happened. I begrudgingly closed the window. I never played a videogame before that reminded me of how it's better to love and forgive than it is to hate and murder. That's the stuff they teach you kindergarten, but mostly because they don't want all of you arguing over the only box of crayons or the last gummy bear in the jar. This game means so much more. I'm an adult now and I've been struggling with a lot of the themes presented within this work. It was so relevant and so beautifully articulated, I didn't have the heart to do what many of peers are pushing me to do: a Genocide Run. I guess I'm not the hard-hearted person I once thought. I can't even bring myself to kill fictional characters (although I did accidentally kill Toriel on my first try and ended up resetting right away. I felt horrible!), much less hate them. I look at my current life now. There's only one person I truly despise, but this game has shifted my perspective. The anger has turned to pity. This game is the best therapy I've ever had (not that I've been to actual therapy). It's true when they say love when you can.

Making the Pie Shell  You will need:  1 1/3 cup flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 cup butter (cups of butter, not buttercups) 1 egg yolk 1 tablespoon water 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions:  Combine flour, salt, and sugar. Cut in butter, and mix until the consistency is like coarse sand. Mix in egg yolk. Add water and vanilla, and mix until the dough comes together. Form into a thick, flat cylinder. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate (about 30 minutes). Butter a pie tin, and roll out dough to fit in the pan. Crimp edges and prick the bottom all around with a fork. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Gently tuck parchment paper or aluminum foil on top of the dough, and pour about a cup of dried beans or pie weights on top. Bake until golden brown (about 20 minutes). Remove pie weights and let cool, then brush the bottom with milk. Completing the Butterscotch Cinnamon Pie  You will need:  1/4 cup butter 2 cups whole milk 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 + 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons water 9 egg yolks 3 tablespoons corn starch 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1 baked pie shell Whip cream Instructions:  Brown the butter in a small sauce pan (heat until bubbles stop and there is a nutty aroma). Heat milk and heavy cream on medium until the edges form bubbles. Heat 1/2 cup brown sugar with water on medium until the bubbles become slow and big. Reduce heat to low. Slowly whisk in brown butter, and then the milk/cream mixture. If there are any caramel lumps, raise heat until they are dissolved. In a bowl, combine remaining brown sugar with yolks, corn starch, and cinnamon. While whisking, stir in half the stove mixture into the bowl (this will prevent the corn starch from lumping). Pour everything back into the pot and raise heat to medium, stirring constantly so the eggs do not scramble. Stir until mixture considerably thickens, and adheres well on the back of your spoon. Whisk to ensure homogeneity, then pour into pie shell. (You may have a little extra left over.) Bake until mixture has set (about 25 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave inside for 20 minutes more). Let cool in the refrigerater (about 1 hour). Serve with whip cream (and enjoy the feeling of your HP being fully restored!).",

(as stated before, it can be dimished by the investment in the story, but beating them the first time is a grindfest of trial and error) -/+ The unique fight system ( attack or pacify) is flawed, as it can make you waste time doing an action for no results , spending long periods in unnessesary long encounters.  -The fanbase. No, seriously. Avoid Tumblr like the plauge. It can deeply harm your vision of the game . ♥♥♥♥ing hell, avoid TUMBLR because its Damn Tumblr!  9 outta 10.

I ended up getting this game in November (around Thanksgiving) of last year, and ever since I've still enjoyed it to this day. Undertale is a game that revolves around a 'choice' system, and the choices you make end up varying the game's ending. As you might have heard, there's 3 main endings - a neutral run, a pacifist run and a genocide run. It follows a sort of puzzle RPG styles while also having a bullet hell style mechanic for combat, which I ended up enjoying. Figuring out how to spare certain characters was a good part of the game for me, and it was pretty interesting. Of course, the plot is incredibly well-written. At the surface, it isn't anything too special, but going deep into it (especially when you do the Pacifist/Genocide runs), there's a lot of twists and turns throughout the game that I won't spoil to keep it's integrity. With the different runs and endings of the game combined with the fun puzzle RPG/bullet hell gameplay, I was able to go back to this game plenty of times since getting it, and to be quite frank I don't regret it. While there are games I still enjoy going back to and playing, this is probably the first that's ever had a real impact on me and given me something to follow.  Sure, the fanbase can be pretty trashy and the game's pretty much everywhere at this point, but if you don't let that spoil the experience for you, then I can easily recommend picking this one up. It's an easy 10/10 from me, with the only real complaint I have being the visuals.  P.S. Alphys is love, Alphys is life.",

In general, this game is damn well amazing and an emotional rollercoaster. Undertale is full of characters you grow to love and keep near and dear to your heart. The people you meet all have a factor to keep the game (or characters) intruiging. The game definitely has replay value, along with full over overwhelming challenges.

            "review_text": "*edit in December 2015* I originally reviewed this game in September, when it had freshly launched and I had just played it. It was a quick, silly, premature review, but it got the point across well enough, so I'm keeping it there; but I wanted to update this a bit to more fully reflect what this game means to me.  This is not just your average flash-in-the-pan popular-for-a-month 'quirky indie game', like some people seem to be assuming. This is not a game that just affected everyone for a moment but will be forgotten tomorrow. Two and a half months later and it's still just as profoundly stuck with everyone I know who's played it, in most cases even moreso than before, as things have settled and we've really had time to think about the game and what makes it so great.  Undertale quite simply has more heart put into it than any game I can think of. Every inch of the game is saturated with so many secrets, easter eggs, wonderful little touches, and signs of the love and care put into the whole package. Every single character, especially the major ones, are so well-designed... the dialogue is so on-point at all times, with immeasurable mountains of optional dialogue you'd have to play through the game dozens of times to see all of... the graphics a simple but charming, and the music is unforgettable. Most of all, though, the game makes you feel emotions. Strongly. I mean running the whole gamut of them, too, even if you just go down one story route. Everything is just so well-done, and even moreso in retrospect after you play the game, look back weeks or months later and realize just how phenomenal it all really was.  Toby is modest to a fault about all this, and some fans are indeed perhaps a bit  overly  enthusiastic -- but there is a reason this game has gotten as much attention as it has. There is a reason it's become so beloved.  Succinctly put, it's my favorite game of all time now. I say this in confidence after months of letting everything sink in; it has officially dethroned Chrono Trigger, after 20 years, as my very favorite video game. So... yeah.  (original review below this line) ----  I wanted to wait until I finished it to review this game, but I honestly can't.  No, really. I rarely feel like playing any game for more than a couple hours at a time anymore; I always have things on my mind, other things I think of that I should or could be doing -- even the absolute best games, even ones I consider favorites, can't keep me hooked and unwilling to move from my seat like this one already has, from the very beginning. Every single save point I thought, 'Maybe I'll take a break now... nahh, just a bit more....' and was glad I stayed. It starts out strange but intriguing, and just gets better and better and better. I don't even care if the rest of the game ended up being trash, I'd still recommend it as the first few hours are absolutely more than worth the miniscule asking price.   It's unlike anything else. It's just too good. Buy it.  *edit after finishing it, via the true good ending* BUY IT.  BUY IT. AND A COPY FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW. ",

            "review_text": "GREAT game, beetween this game and LISA you can see how great an indie game can be if people put effort and heart into it, also the fanbase is huge and incredible, now, lets talk about the game a bit... the story... IS AWESOME, that being said, you can accidentaly play a playthrough were the plot wont be that good (the 'bad' ending) in wich there is not that much story and what is there is mostly for people that are replaying the game, so be sure to play the game several times i am currently during my 5th playthrough and i plan on playing again after i finish it, the gameplay, at a first glance it might look like your typical earthbound like rpg and it kind of is... but with some twist, the battles are done by timing your attack, the best you time is the more damage you do... now the enemy attacs are really interesting, they present itself like it would be on a shoot' em up or a bullet hell kind of game (like touhou games) and it is quite unique and quite challenging some times, thats not all of it there are some enemies that will change this patern again and again during the development of the game, so you wont get bored of it... but there is also another twist on the gameplay you dont need to fight, as the game proudly tells you on the store, you dont have to destroy anyone and i mean ANYONE it doesnt matter how much it looks like you have there is allways a peacfull way out and there is where most of the charm of the games shine, i will expand more on this later, now the music and sound design it is also great you every song is carefully crafted and it fits perectly to whats happening on the game, the sound effects are also good and quite charming (the sound of despair coming out from a broken bike is an example). Now graphics... having in mind that this is a game with 8 bits-like graphics i can say that there are also great, each sprite is well designed and have ton of details, and if not, the minimlistic style fits perfectly what is hapening, now one of the best things if not the best about this game are the characters, every single one is awesome, and loveable and unique and i mean everyone even the most unrelevant characters are charming... you have to make sure to check them and to talk to them and to do everything you can, i cant pick a favorite character i just cant, i love every single one of them. and also i said that the game shines when you choose the peacefull way out and this is because of the characters, when you forgive every single one you are basically making them realice what they are doing or you help them know themselves better, and you are rewarded with really interesting dialogues.   Toby Fox, thanks, i love you and i love undertale  i hardly can say anything bad about the game to be honest... it has a GREAT sense of humor, the story is great, it has a HUGE replayabilty, the characters are lovable, the gameplay is great, the graphics and the sound/music is great too, i have to think hardly about something bad about the game but if i have to say one 'bad' thing about the game is that you can not erase what you do most of the times what i mean by that is that if you kill someone and then repent and load a previous save or restart the game, the game remembers, no matter if you didnt save the game (almost) allways remember, the only thing you can do to really restart the game is by erasing the steam folders that have the data of the game.  i also want to highlight that the game is FULL of secrets, some of wich i am sure are still to be uncover but rest asure the greatly active fanbase will found them all someday i am sure ;)   my score i think is an obvious 10/10 (during my first playthrough i said my score was 9-9.7 but after playing it again i have to give it a perfect score kudos toby fox and thanks for so much)",

As far as the gameplay goes, Undertale is a retro style, Earthbound-ish RPG with some bullet-hell thrown in. It's pretty delicious. But where the game really goes BEAST MODE, is in it's dialogue, humor, Characters, and story.  This all gets even JUICIER when they throw in some cause-and-effect decision making into the mix. Depending on the choices you make throughout the game, even small ones like choosing to either kill a random monster or spare its life, will affect the game in some way. This leads to bunch of different endings and changes to the story that you can witness, and it also leads to a ton of replayability.   Sounds pretty sick, huh? Well, you're dang right.  The soundtrack, especially the boss themes, is comparable to a 5 star steak sauce marinade, which is to say, it is quite good. Speaking of boss fights, Undertale has some of the SICKEST ones i've seen in some time. Many of them put unique twists on the combat style and they are DANG GOOD.  When all is said and done, this game reminds me a lot of that Horse Egg Casserole I ate last week: It looks a little weird at first, but once you get a taste, it gives you a warm satisfying joy in your belly that sticks around for days to come. This is surely a slam dunk worth experiencing.  If Undertale was an earthquake, it would have a magnitude rating in the 7.1-7.9 range, 'Major earthquake. Serious damage.'

            "review_text": "Don't let the graphical style fool you, this game was a labor of love.  Things react to your actual actions as a player, not just dialogue prompts... the NPCs will react in different ways based on seemingly minor things you may or may not have done. There's alternate dialogue everywhere, multiple endings, so many things to find... there's little secrets and hints, and it takes at least two playthroughs to put the important bits together. Little hints and facts you may have picked up from just reading a bookshelf can come back and hit you hard when you learn more about what's going on, for example.  The battles are really interesting as well. There's generally multiple ways to end a conflict, and the dodging mechanics when you're being attacked vary a lot throughout the game and major fights tend to introduce new twists. The fights have a lot of work put into them, much more so than I imagined from seeing the simple Dragon Quest-style view. Everything from the enemy reactions to the sprite changes and animations must have taken a lot of time for each monster, much more work than you usually see anymore.  The game's not very long, you can 'beat it' once in a day if you push... but I think it's well worth getting 'cause there's so much in it to explore when you replay it (to try to avoid spoilers).

            "review_text": "Undertale - The friendly RPG where nobody has to die I never heard of this game before until it release on Steam around September 2015 and it seemed to be very popular for some reason. I thought what's the big deal about this game? It look just like an RPG game like EarthBound or Mother 3. So I went to the  Undertale website  [undertale.com]  and try demo. The first minute on demo was really impressive and after I finished the demo I went back to Steam and buy full game and soundtrack bundle instantly, I didn't buy games on steam for full price for long time but I really want to support the developer.  The very first game that make me feel bad for trying to kill monsters Undertale is a truly one of the most heartwarming and very charming story-driven games that I've ever played so far. I was playing normally by killing everything I encounter because that is just how an RPG games played right? but until I fought the first boss    Yes, it's Toriel everyone's beloved goat mom    and suddenly I just realized that I don't want to kill her but I accidentally kill her while trying to lower her hp but she will die if you attack when her hp is less than 1/4 of her full hp and that was the first emotional train that hit me straight into my face when I hear her last word. Well I have not feel so strong of an emotion toward game since the ending of Okami    Amaterasu and Issun farewell scene    anyway I reset that playthrough and start my new playthrough again and surprisingly, some of the characters know I regret my decision and decide to start new playthrough that mean every decisions you made in this game will be save in somewhere in game files and will affect the game unless you wipe your data on your computer.   The gameplay First, it might look like normal RPG game but when you play you will find some humor of this game like you cannot actually sell your items to shopkeepers like in RPG because they don't want to spent money for items that they're never use but there still only one shop that still want to buy your items because they want them and they have a very deep history   'hOI! welcom to da TEM SHOP'   or YES! You can literally date a skeleton! And maybe some events you may think the game crash but actually the game close itself to make it look like game crash. but the most outstandingly design gameplay that very unique is a battle system it still be turn base battle but instead of you and your enemies switch turn attacking each other the game will refer you as a heart that can move around and you control it to dodge enemies attack like a bullet hell game for avoid getting hit and when your turn to act you can choose to attack and kill them or chose 'not' to attack instead if you feel bad for hurting them. This game have main 3 playthroughs, so as I mentioned earlier you can finish the game by killing everything or only kill someone who annoying you or even kill no one at all these playthrough you choose will lead you to different endings.   Story This is the selling point of the Undertale and the reason that I buy this game I really love Undertale's story such an amazing story that filled with good humor, morality and emotional feeling. Sometime they have some silly thing to laugh about or sometime will be moment that my eye cover in tears from very emotional story that make me try not to miss any content in Undertale not just dialogue but everything I suggest when you playing you should inspect everything in the game even it were pile of garbage maybe you might found   an astronaut food  . It really fun to discover secrets in Undertale. As I said some characters know about SAVE system that mean they will know what happened in last playthrough so dialogue will change when you talk to them that make Undertale different form other RPG in Skyrim you can save and killing people just for fun then load save again like nothing happen but in Undertale if you did that some characters will still remember so be caution if you playing on no killing playthrough.   Conclusion If you are not into story rich game don't play it, if you are concern about 'bullet hell dodging thing' because you are not good at it but still want to play the game for story then go and get the game it is not that hard and they have some armor   Temy Armor   to help you progress the game. This game is true morality story you will get what you really deserve at the ending of your playthrough that you choose. The soundtracks are very good too, they really affect the game so for the best experience you should not mute the game I have some moment that shed a few tears from my eye because soundtrack is so good and it fits very well with current story. 10/10 one of best games of all time for me.",

The story is superb and the characters are captivating.  There are few games that can mess with your emotions like this one. It's full of memorable moments. Not killing the enemies is much more fun than I thought it could be.  The only bad thing I can say about this game is the fandom (or, to be fair, just a part of it). Sometimes there will be something super clever and unusual that will blow the mind of a lot of people, and some of them can't handle it. It's the kind of the problem that 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic', a girls cartoon whose creators decided to put real content instead of the usual bimbo drivel, has. The fans mean well, but if some of them bothers you, just ignore and take the game for what it is.  It's not an expensive game and despite only having up to 30 hours content it's worth the price. And even though the soundtrack is the same price of the game, it might be worth it too.",

Rest assured, they're all here, but there is much more below the surface.  What truly set Undertale apart for me was the overwhelming amount of love and care poured into it. Don't let the graphic style fool you; this game more than makes up for it with its memorable and relatable characters, incredibly catchy soundtrack, consistently unique battles, and an attention to detail that would make any fan of the Mother series proud.  On top of all this, the most engaging aspect of Undertale is the fact that there are always multiple solutions to any problem or opponent you face. The decision is yours to make as a player, and you only have yourself to praise/blame for the results of your actions. This game's unique take on the traditional/expected RPG was wonderfully refreshing.  My only piece of advice if you are considering this game for purchase is to avoid spoilers at all costs. Undertale is a game that is best experienced for yourself!",

            "review_text": "Undertale is magnificent gift, it is hands down my favorite game of 2015 and Honestly probably my favorite of all time, this is one of the greatest experiences I've had in a very long time. Toby put a lot of love and care into this game and it really shows, I have never been so invested in a story and it's characters in my entire life. Undertale is definitely a game I'm going to continue coming back to every now and then just to revisit all the characters and places I love.  Narratively this game is a paragon of interactive story telling. Every choice you make weighs on your conscious because every connection you make with the characters feels organic. Every character and their dialogue are all so charming it's hard to dislike any of them, even the background and non story important folk have a lot of character to them, the art style while simple is appealing and fit the world nicely. Don't get me started on the sick jams the music is perfectly composed, every part of the soundtrack fits the moment flawlessly really helping bring out the emotion in the scene. I could listen to the OST all day and have and continue to listen to this magnificent soundtrack for years to come.  An RPG where playstyle actually changes the way the story shapes up, depending on whether you go down a pacifist, nuetral or genocidal path, characters, dialogue and places change A LOT, allowing for several playthroughs if so desired. Befriend even your enemies by choosing to just show a little mercy or murder everything if you so desire these options take you on completely different stories. Toby thought of every contingency when it comes to decision making, almost everything has some sort of different dialogue depending on what you do, or don't do.  I wanted to add on some things since I didn't talk about game mechanics: •One warning I would give is that this is NOT a traditional RPG, that term is kind of just sprinkled ontop of the game, the defensive combat mechanic during the entire game is an AVOIDANCE / BULLET HELL type of mechanic and is always in use, so if you're not fond of that type of gameplay or just not very good at it you're better off watching a playthrough. •Linear, if you have a problem with games being linear than yeah that's a thing I guess? I don't count linear as a negative if it's done right. •Some jokes/gags do run on a bit, some characters can be a bit two dimensional with their personality (on a surface level, there's more to them if you play down certain paths), I felt it was written well and honestly I liked them through out the entire game. •Playing the game completely blind is honestly the best way to play the game, not knowing the characters and locations makes everything so much better. •This game isn't for emotionally detached edgelords either, it's a touchy feelsy type of story.    TL;DR: I legitimately have nothing negative to say about Undertale, I have never been so enchanted and enamored by ANYTHING in a very long time. I think about this game every single day, I listen to the music every day, I've lost sleep over how much I love this game and I want to cry. 11/10 Would true reset my mind to experience it all again.  Gonna go lay down while I continue to experience an existential crisis.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2016 notes  After playing this game a year later, on the anniversary of its release date, I can honestly say I still feel the same way about it. It's still a really, really good game with fun characters and dialogue, amazing music and a nice story with interesting game mechanics. It's a shame this game gets such a bad reputation because of a lot of rabid fans and its popularity on the internet. Allowing otheres to ruin something beautiful for you is a real shame.   I feel bad for those that didn't get to experience pure, unspoiled, completely blind not knowing any of the characters or music. That experience was so amazing, seeing and learning everything the first time without prior knowledge was well... Magical. Going in knowing nothing was honestly life changing for me, never being able to experience that again is heart wrenching, I truly wish I could.  Even now the game still brings out beautiful emotions other games and media fail to bring out and just makes me really think and want to be a better person. Thank you for everything Toby Fox, you've really inspired me to be more DETERMINED, I can't wait to see what you do next friend!",

Pretty insignificant change, but this game deserves it. If you'd like to view my old review, I'll be keeping the old one available for your reading pleasure.  Original review published Jan 23 2016:  Undertale is a fantastic, thought provoking, hilarious, depressing, and overall insanely enjoyable game. The music is outstanding (but people need to chill with the whole 'undertale has the best music of all time' thing, it doesn't). It's something you will invest your emotions into, and it knows that. This game will break you. It certainly broke me, I almost felt what humans call 'feelings.' Weird, right? I played this game like a traditional RPG and 2 hours later I felt like a giant piece of ♥♥♥♥. Choices matter. A lot. Everything you do has an impact on the final outcome of the game, and it makes it all the more worth it.   I'm going to give this game the highest rating out of any game I'd played that came out in 2015. I'd almost give this game the highest rating that I've ever given a game. It's fantastic enough to earn a 10/10, but I'm giving it a 9/10. Now that's not bad at all. I've only given one game a 10/10 rating EVER. 9/10 is ♥♥♥♥ing generous coming from someone like me who hates video games. It's my second favorite game to have come out in 2015, ironically sitting behind Killing Floor 2.   So why did I give it a 9/10 I don't hear you ask? Well, the internet has ♥♥♥♥ing RUINED this game. On the game front it has very few, if any flaws AT ALL. It's damned near perfect, However the fanbase and what the internet has made it out to be is just too ♥♥♥♥ing awful to ignore. The Undertale fanbase is so ♥♥♥♥ing awful, that I'd say it's significantly worse than FNAF and Minecraft. The best way I could describe the fanbase is Five Night's at Freddy's fanbase, only 1 year older, and much less mature. It makes sense, trust me. The fans are rabid as ♥♥♥♥, and it turned me off of the game almost entirely. I made a negative comment on an Undertale video that had nothing to do with the game, but a song in the game, and I got a DEATH THREAT because of it. (I'm not kidding,  gyazo.com/feb1e8214b52b33115fa5a271eb41df7  &lt;- screenshot). Memes aren't funny, especially stupid ♥♥♥♥ing video game memes. Also, something being random doesn't make it funny. It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid when people say the humor is good for being 'random.' And when the internet finally realizes that, the fanbase will be slightly less cancerous than Furious Pete's crotch.   That's really all I can say about the game without spoiling it. And believe me, you don't want this game spoiled for you. I'm glad I bought and played through it before having the game spoiled for me, because this was a truly fantastic experience filled with lovable characters, an outstanding story, a great soundtrack, and one of best senses of humor in a game EVER. Undertale is absolutely 100% worth the money, and I'd recommend it not only to people who like RPG/Bullethell games, but to anybody who likes video games. This is by far one of the best (if not the best) indie games ever made, and it currently sits pretty comfortably at the 12th slot on my personal favorite videogames list.  My name is Storm, and you've just had the pleasure of reading this review.",

The 'combat' system never gets boring, though if you suck at dodging bullets (like me), it can get a bit tiresome when confronting bosses. The graphic style is pretty cute, what with animated little sprites and what not. The soundtrack is simply DIVINE. Dialogue is funny and quirky, just like the characters you'll run into on your journey.  Its, and I don't say this lightly, probably the best game you'll see in a while.

            "review_text": "Honestly, after beating the game for 7 hours to have the 'happy ending', I cried 3 times because the story is just amazing. It is stunning and incredible. I've never expected to end this way. It started off with some stupid and dumb puzzles. But after that, it drove the player deeper and deeper as the story takes its place and time and affected the players an unprecedented way. That is the factor that makes Undertale a masterpiece. I played a lot of RPGs and this one really makes me turn around and give me an unique story with beautiful gameplay.   *THE SYSTEM OF UNDERTALE Now, when I first saw Flowey ( dat son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ ) almost killed me, all I think is that this game is stupid because all I have to do is move my heart ( i mean my soul ) around like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. However, after sinking my teeth into the game, I realized it's a lot more and its brilliance lies on its simplicity. Undertale expected me to have played RPGs before and played with those conventions in unexpected ways and that clever manipulation of gameplay mechanics adds weight to a story that couldn’t have been told in any other way or medium. That's what I need from RPG games. Make something new! At first, I thought I got that dodging combat mechanics, but after a while, the gameplay started pushing me and players to a limit with these storytelling from characters to characters as the story builds up. Every monsters in the game has its own unique way to deal with, you can fight them or spare them if you want the true pacifist ending, of course. For me, I wanted the true pacifist ending so therefore, I have to flirt, hug, and pet in order not to kill them so that I can spare them. That's it a cool idea. Not only that, the way that I interact with them feels like we were treating each other from I to I. There are tons of jokes relating to anime and even snail jokes that really know how to set up a crowd. Undertale really knows how to predict the players and that's it a factor that I like about Undertale.  * THE WAY MONSTERS WORK The way Undertale builds up the story is hilarious and touching. A lot of hidden messages are putted through out the game. Each of them knows how tell a story about humanity and morality. For example, when I was listening to echo flowers in a hallway that recorded a conversation between two people, I was impressed by it. It was about a monster whose greatest wish was to escape this underground lair to see the view, don't want to share it because she(he) afraid that her( his ) friend might laugh at her ( him ). However, after telling the truth, the friend laughed anyway and it was funny until it said: ' Sorry, it’s just funny… That’s my wish too. '. And from that I was silenced for how honestly these characters were written. Witnessing the depth of monsters's dreams about freedom really a strength of Undertale. Giving the players the exploration of humanity and morality. Talking to them and discovering about them is amazing. I was amazed for how well-developed these characters were written. It just makes me cry because I have to fight them which I don't.   *THE MOST AND OBVIOUS REASON WHY UNDERTALE IS A MASTERPIECE: DETERMINATIONNNNNNNNNNNNNN Of course, games like super meat boy, hotlline miami, dark souls really make us have to say ' wtf ???' and rage quit. Not only that, but they also do something that makes you angrier is showing a text that say ' YOU DIED' which is pretty annoying, right ??? Now, as for Undertale, 'Stay determined' will be the phrase that I will remember for the rest of my life. In Undertale, there are lots of times that I keep dying over and over. Not only that, you can't sell things ( maybe that is the first time we seen in RPG gam, right??? Or maybe dark souls, perhaps ???? ) to the merchants. However, after putting up with it, I have experieced a meaningful story, so many things that I want to explore in Undertale and I don't want to give up. WHY?? DETERMINATION !! I was really entranced by the way characters worked. Some people said this game looks like sh*t. For me, even though the art not that impressive, it is still an amazing game.  * VERDICT I really don't know how to describe this game. I really am. But I can only call it by one word only ' MASTERPIECE '. It really has its own dynamic way to tell a story with great comprehension about RPG players's mindset. I gotta admit that this game will be the game that I will never forget. And because of this game, I AM NOW FILLED WITH DETERMINATION !! 10/10 Would recommend anyone buying it. It's a masterpiece",

            "review_text": "First of all, I am not a fan of RPGs myself but I do have my own exceptions. Undertale just entered in this list in the past night, as I am writting this review.  In this game, you play in the skin of a human girl that has fell into the depths of a mountain, where there is a world with monsters sealed away from the surface for many years due to a war where humans ended victorious. In order to the monsters be able to return back to the surface, they need a last human soul out of 7... and that's you. What are you going to do? Will you fight back and destroy them?... Or will you spare them with hopes they won't harm you and understand that humans aren't necessairly murderers? Well, you will be pleased to know that you can actually decide which destiny you want in this game: you can optate to kill every monster you find, you can kill ones and give mercy to others and you can give mercy to everyone. And every little action you do in the game has got consequences in the story. This is the only RPG I know where you can win without killing opponents and that was one of the main reasons I got interested in trying out this game. I went for a Pacifist Route as I really did not want to finish the life of the creatures and let survivors thinking that every human is equal and I can guarantee that your actions are rewarded in surprising ways! You also end up getting attached to the most important characters of the game as each has got a different personality and are really memorable!  Now, I will talk about the game by parts and tell what I think about each:  Story - The essence of Undertale's story is simple as I explained above but it is impressive the level of depth it has got as I can really tell that these indie developers have put a lot of thought in it not just by having experienced the game but also by informing myself on the internet about the other kind of consequences it can bring depending of other types of actions you do. There are really many different versions of the story. There's drama but there is also a lot of humour, dark humour and references to japanese culture and I promise that this game will steal you smiles and laughters!  Graphics - Other thing that pleases me in Undertale is the retro aesthetic it has got but this is just a matter of personal taste. They are pleasant and detailed. It interestingly changes to a more minimalist graphism once you enter in a battle. There's a detail that I won't develop a lot as it involves spoilers but there is a point where I really believe you will feel disturbed by the type of visual a certain monster adquires for being distinctively 'out of place'.  Gameplay - In third person it works like a normal RPG: you wander around to explore the environments and you interact with characters to obtain informations. Ocasionally, you will be dragged to battle with a random monster. Fortunately, the encounters are not annoying as they do not appear a lot of times. In battle, you have four options: to fight (a graph appears and a vertical bar passes through it. The more centered the bar is by the moment you press your key, more damage you inflict), to act (this functionality is really interesting as the secondary options that appear really depend of the monster you find, and even in here the creators used a lot of humour!), to use items (like in normal RPGs, items can be used to heal HP or to increase stats) and to give mercy (monsters will be spared from harm but it won't work unless you performed necessary actions in the Act command although this rule only applies to the majority of the monsters). The way battles work has got an original mechanism as I never saw something similar before: your soul is represented with a red heart and inside a limited area you can move it to dodge yourself from enemy attacks that vary a lot. There are occasions where you have your soul limited to specific movements too or that you are exposed to special enemy attacks that force you to either freeze yourself or to move yourself to ensure you don't get harmed. You really need to have dexterity in your fingers as some enemies attacks (especially bosses) can be really difficult to dodge. A note I would like to make is that in case you want to spare every monster, is the fact that every monster you find has got a different way to be 'defeated' and they are not only creative but will also surprise you and make you laugh a lot!  Controls - I don't have got a single complaint in these: they are simple and very sharp. If you are enoughly familiar with playing with a keyboard you won't have any issues.  Sound and music - Just like the graphics, these are retro-like. The sounds are varied and simple. While there is not a lot of different musical tracks in the game I found them pleasant.  Difficulty level - The level of difficulty is progressive and is challenging but not to the point of frustration.  Longevity and replay value - I finished the game in approximately 10 hours but the time of conclusion might vary depending of the player skills and the destiny you choose. It is relatively short, but the fact that your actions change the whole story course gives you extra reasons to consider returning to the game and play it again.   I am really happy that a game like this appeared in an industry overflooded with games with the same selling formulas and same conception formulas. It brought a completely new way to play an RPG and hooks you to the end. I do think the industry needs more games like this as with the technology evolution many game makers seem to forget what's most important in the conception of a videogame: its essence, its soul.   Undertale is a hidden indie gem that deserves recognization. I really can't find any complaint for it as I never found any annoyances in it nor even glitches. And this game can be yours for only 9,99€, a real bargain. Please buy it, it is worth every cent. And spread the word: Determination.",

Anyway, Undertale is a very unique game that pulls off uniqueness in a way that isn't just simply overloading the game with non sensical ideas like many indie games that have the same aspiration. It deconstructs RPG formula, &amp; video game formulas in general, while providing a core gameplay component of a hybrid turn based rpg where you try to dodge enemy attacks in a way similar to top down shooters. The game has you questioning video game morality, one way in which by 'humanising' the monsters, &amp; also presenting plenty of humourous writing &amp; a bizarre, humourous world. Undertale also notably has one of the best soundtracks in gaming.  Undertale is not without its flaws though. Obviously, I like the game, love it in fact, but boy is it flawed. The first huge flaw i'll mention in Undertale is the way the game progressed, which is pretty bad thanks to the mix of uber linearity &amp; monopacing. There are many linear JRPG games but Undertale sadly felt linear to the point of being on rails too much of the time. Things to discover off the story path that have gameplay value can be counted with one hand &amp; bits of text &amp; such with no value can be counted with 2. Undertale also felt like it was going 60bpm throughout, imagine a car on cruise control. Only towards the end &amp; in a few boss fights does this rule change. Consequentially you never get to get acquainted with any particular area &amp; immersing yourself in the events taking place in them, the people, etc..., something that all of the greatest RPG games had.  The other major flaw is the structural use &amp; also gross overuse of misdirection humour that the game is practically built upon. It looses it's effect quite quickly due to this, &amp; can be related to the monopacing. Misdirection jokes eventually become things that are tied to the game formula that you would come to expect at regular intervals.  Undertale is far from perfect, &amp; judged purely through an objective lens &amp; quantifiable measurements, it would only be decent at best, but Undertale is an art piece that manages to challenge the foundations of game design. The overall plot is very clever even though the actual script is not the best, the game does some of the best 4th wall related stuff I've seen at the end, &amp; of course, boasts an amazing soundtrack. Not unlike Postal 2, Undertale is important to gaming as an artistic medium despite not being the best it can be as a game, &amp; through a subjective lens, my thoughts on the game would be a solid 8/10. One of the best in 2015 (if not the best).  I focused this review on bad things because a lot of the good is too hard to put into words or impossible to say without spoiling the experience, but I highly recommend giving Undertale a shot.",

But now I can't go back to it anymore because I believed I fell out of love with this whole genre. The turn based systems bored me to tears, the real time systems became mindless killing just so I could progress the story without having to be stuck on a boss because I didn't grind enough to a certain level. And though I would never admit it out loud there was a part of me that would always questioned my actions in said video game. Subconsciously I could feel myself having this conversation with myself.  'Why are we killing this random solider?'  To which I would reply 'Because they are in my way. ' 'We don't have to kill them.' 'Oh yes we do.' 'Why?' 'Because I won't get any exp and then I'll die to a boss and I won't be able to progress in the game.' -hits the runaway command- 'See why can't you do that more often?' 'I only did that because they were stronger than me and would kill me in one hit! -sigh- Time to go grind...'  When I play an RPG I want to play it for the story. I want to roll around in the lore, really get a good feel for the time, place, and setting in which the game takes place. Some games do this some better than others but for the most part I start to lose intrest the moment the game slaps me with a 'You must be this high a level in order to progress' Now the game won't actually say that but it will be hinted at the moment you come to a boss and die over and over again. I thought I was done with RPGs for good.  THIS THIS GAME CAME ALONG AND TURNED MY WORLD UPSIDE-DOWN  Or rather turned what I thought of a RPG could be upside down...what a pleasant surprise. 'The rpg where nobody has to die, eh?' I thought. I was a bit skeptical and didn't jump into the game right away. Until a Let's player I watch frequently decided to give it a go. I watch the first part of the game, which I heard was basically the tutorial section and was hooked.   HOW DID THE DANG TUTORIAL SECTION MAKE ME CRY?!   It was the tutorial section for Pete's sake the part of just about any RPG that you just want to skip over to get to the good part but that was the trick of this particular game. I CAN'T FIND A BAD PART. There was no time when I just wanted to skip, no part where I was bored. I had to get this game myself and I have no regrets.    Ten minutes into the game I was already invested and the more I played the deeper I feel in love with this game. Every monster is memorable, every character is unique and loveable. I never got board with battles since most of the time I was trying to figure out their problems while dodging their different attack patterns. And even if you chose to attack its never the: push-a-button-and-wait method that I was used to from most RPGs.   Now its really tough to talk about this game without spoiling something so I'll do my best. The multiple endings and hidden secrets add enough to the re-playability but this meta game play feature it also has makes the game makes you wonder just how deep does this rabbit hole go...and the only way to find out is to play it yourself! You will not regret it no matter what your play style is.",

I promise, you will not be disappointed with your purchase.  Also, this game easily features my favorite OST of all time. Toby Fox put the icing on the cake with his fantastic music.

The story will probably leave you in (deep) thought for a week or two after. You might even realise a thing or two about real life afterwards (i have heard about people who did). I have to admit that the story even made me tear up... no game has ever done that before!  The characters have great personalities. They feel like real people/friends.   What you do with this amazing story and these great characters is up to you. You can choose to kill them all, or go out of your way to not hurt them. But your choices matter in this game, and you cant change them. Starting a new game won't change it. You will have to play all the way through with your choices. I did not want to hurt anyone, but i accidentally did anyway. I felt horrible and the game did not want me to forget what i did. You can do the genocide route, the pacifist route or both, but i have not and will never take the genocide route.   The soundtrack will not disappoint. It is so good that i bought it the day after i finished the game.   There is much more to say about this game, but this review would just turn long and boring if i continued.

            "review_text": "One of the most important morality narratives in games since Bioshock or Spec Ops: The Line, Undertale is the rare breed of game that makes you question why you kill in videogames. It's also charming and fundamentally optimistic, challenging you to be a good person and empathize with your enemy.   The combat system is a frantic, ever-mutating bullet hell that's constantly redefining it's own rules and flipping the script to keep you guessing how to play it. Every enemy is a puzzle to figure out how to make friends and 'win'. You'll cheer up ghosts that fight you with their tears, and sinister turnips that want you to eat your veggies. It's weird, disarming, and puts a smile on the face of a cynic and softens a hardened heart.  Adding to the feelings-fest is an expansive soundtrack that keeps you tapping your foot or wiping tears from your eyes at many of the games critical moments. Honestly, the soundtrack is an achievement in itself. It's filled with distinctive leitmotifs that are tied to characters and themes, with familiar motifs weaving in and out at just the right time. It's beautifully rendered, and part of the reason I bought the game at full price (which I never do).  All in all, if you want to meet some fun characters who you'll slowly grow to love, and reconsider violence in videogames, Undertale is a must-buy.  Cons: the walk speed is very slow, some of the jokes can be grating, and the enviroment art is basic and/or ugly.",

            "review_text": "  It took me far too long to finally play this game. I just saw so much hype it was bit too much for me. However, I was still interested, and still wanted to play it. A kind soul gave it to me as a gift, and so I decided to finally play it.  It all seemd rather childish at first, a childrens story... but i was hooked even before he title shoed up. in part because of a choice I made, and i felt the game pretty much said 'welp. this is your life now!'  Lets go over a few points.  1.) Graphics If you want the latest and greatest graphics, then this simply isn't your kind of game. With the exception of a few key points in the game, this is largely a pixel-game. Pixel graphics galore. Something I love, bcause games like this usually focus on character development. This game did nt disapoint in that respect.  2.) Characters Every character, including the random-encounter enemies, seems to have a story behind them. Sure, some are silly, others are more serious, but they are all made with care, by someone that loves his craft. The main characters are particularly interesting. All of them seem well-rounded in their own ways. I believe they all try to get you to learn to love them too. In my opinion, they succeed in this front.  3.) Story Its pretty hard to explain what's so amazing about this game's story without spoilers, so instead, I'll justouch on what drew me in:  One of my most favorite genres in the world is comedy. This game is comedy gold. Puns, groaner jokes, and a few characters themselves just the most hillarious ever, i almost never stopped laughing. There were times where the comedy was kind of over-the top, and sometimes bland, but it always fit with the characters and story. The comedy itself is why I so highly reccomend it.  It's more than simply comical, however. you'll laugh, youll feel fear, you'll feel bewildered, you'll think everything is messing up... but stay determined, dont give up, and you will perservere. Never before had I played a game that questions what undertale questions. I can see in it elements from how Homestuck works, and it truely works here.  4.) Sounds Although I can't say the sounds are unique, I can say the way sounds are used in this game is very well put together. Characters all have their own voice, and they are different enough that you can tell who is speaking solely through the sound that comes on for every character in the text. Sound is used very well throughout the entire game.  5.) Music For being a pixel game, the music is very well thought out, and very well put in. Especially in one part with a certain ghost. It may not be as iconic as pokemon, or as famous as okami, but I feel thats a part of how its used in the game. In various places, there is a  lack  of music, all to invoke a sense of ambience. There was never a time I felt the music was out of place.  6.) Puzzles None of the puzzles were extremely difficult, and the easiest ones are actually solved for you. A few of them  seem  to be really really hard, but if you stay determined, you'll be fine. I can't say too much here without spoiling, but I can say there is usually more than one way to solve every puzzle. That fact, plus how they are solved, is another reason I adore this game.  7.) Overall As a whole, Undertale has proven to be one of the best games in its genre of pixel games. This is doubly true if you liked games such as Earthbound, and Cave Story, though neither of those games captures the essence of why Undertale is so good. If you can look past the fact its a pixel-game, and just start listening to the story, then I'm ertain you will enjoy it just as much as I do. Its a very well-made game, that knows when to take itself seriously, and when not to. All annoyances in the game seem to be put there on purpose, and all the easy portions were, too.  Undertale is not impossibly hard (though parts will seem such), and not terribly easy (though, again, parts will seem such). With technically three main endings, there is replaybility, which gets even better with the fact even though you start over...   the characters remember you, vaugely (and sometimes 100%), from your previous runthrough  . Just remember to stay determined, and nothing will be able to stop you :)  Full disclosure: I recieved this product as a gift from a friend. I'm so glad they gave it to me, and I'm so glad I decided to play it. Its an amazing game that I will likely buy for someone else, just so I can support the delveloper. &lt;3",

At first, I was skeptical. 'This game? There's no way this could be GotY material.' I was wrong. I was so wrong. I have never been more wrong in my entire life. This game is just amazing. If I had to pick a game to be described as perfect it would be this one.  The art style might be a bit quirky but it's a good quirky and I wouldn't change it for the world. The music is sublime and I'm listening to it as I type this up because I can't get enough of it. However I think the games real forte lies in its gameplay and its story. Gameplay-wise, the pacifistic rpg battle system is damn near the most refreshing twist I've seen in a videogame of late. You can play it straight and slaughter everything but you can, and probably should, win by not fighting. The humor in this game is incredible as well. There's a joke to be found around every corner. But don't think this game is all fun and laughs. The humor juxtaposes a dark and sophisticated story. within minutes of starting this game you'll find yourself staring hard choices in the eye. Undertale's use of characterization is some of the best I've ever seen. Everything practically drips with character, from plot important npcs down to the very enemies you fight.  If I had to make a complaint... If you tied me down and put a gun to my head and said I had to find something bad to say about Undertale I'd say that it's too short. But it isn't. When I finally beat it I didn't want more because I was unsatisfied, rather I wanted more because it was such a good experience. This game is going to be one of those games that I'll never forget. I'll remember it from start to finish because every moment was enjoyable. Every second was well spent.  So do I recommend this game? Yes. I recommend Undertale. I recommend it wholeheartedly.",

I've lost thousands upon thousands of hours of my life to these games.  This game beats them all, without contest or equal. As blasphemous as it may sound, Earthbound was literally NEVER this good. This is perfection.  Other games rely too heavily on quirky contemporary humor, or weird (read:poorly localized) senses of taste, making it nearly impossible to enjoy them to their fullest. I don't know if it was just my lucky day to perfectly resonate with an indie game, or if this really is the most moving game of all time.  I could talk about how immersive and beautiful the game's world is, how every situation (even the noclip!) has secrets and dialogue options. Nothing is left unfinished or unaccounted for. I could go on about how every single NPC is awarded multiple new lines of dialogue for every major story development, and how every enemy encounter is also an NPC, and you can talk to all of them! I could tell you how you will come to love every single one of the quirky, cuddly, sometimes mystifying main characters with all your heart, despite only spending a few minutes with each. I could also tell you how this game is a complete deconstruction of all RPGs, ringing with a novel and weighty sentiment of player choice being the deciding factor of roleplay in a single-player RPG. I could tell you how the entire story shapes around your actions!  But, I think that discussion should be saved for the annals of eternity, where it belongs.  Now, I've played Mother 3. My tear ducts are well oiled. This is definitely the game for you if you enjoyed or are a fan of the Mother series. I think you'll love this game even if you aren't. It's just that good.  In one final note, I also used to swear on the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games from the mid-oughts. Anyone remember those? They each made me cry with their lovable characters, simple pixel-art expressions, great music, and situations of outright despair. I loved those games.   After having played through Undertale all the way to the True Pacifist Ending, I can safely say. Undertale beats those games with a rubber hose!  10/10. Would become the freaking monster butterscotch Pope again.  Butterscotch Pope would be a really good name for a rock band.",

The amount of fourth wall breaking and the tone of the game can do anything from making you happy, sad, and even making you feel like a horrible person. The game will remember everything and anything. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. There is almost no question about whether or not you will enjoy this game. Do you like RPGs? Do you like laughing? Do you like unique characters? Do you like intruiging stories that draw you in? Do you like dogs? If you said yes to one of those, you'll like this game. If you said no to all of them, you'll probably still enjoy it. This is in fact my new all time favorite game. You want to play it blind, trust me.

Just the first 10 minutes totally and hopelessly sold me to the game.  Let me reiterate, the gameplay is unique, but it's also familiar RPG old-school style. If you pay attention to the story, and you should, you'll reap rewards in game but also in life. It breaks so many conventions that RPGs have a death grip on that I'm not sure if I should be so surprised at it becoming a cult-hit.  Back to the unique gameplay: You can kill the enemies, or you can try to get them to give up. If a monster is obsessed with washing, ask it to wash you. Then you can just show mercy and you 'win' the fight. The story is extensive and I've missed a lot despite looking for as much as I could manage I can take other paths to learn more. Thankfully after the end you can still wander around and for reasons I won't spoil.. there are so many choices.. and each are tracked. The game might even remember despite starting a new game.  Don't assume anything. Take it at face value. Pay attention. This game has managed a perfect balance of horror-scary and comedy, and whatever mixture in between. The intro to the game, pay attention, and you'll have a good time.  Don't pay attention?  YOU'LL HAVE A BAD TIME... [in game joke but helpful to remember if you ever read it in game.]  I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say this is the best RPG I've ever played. If not within this style of jRPG/Early cRPGs. Definitely Top 5 RPGs of all kinds on my list.  Finally, no spoiling here, but this game will MIND♥♥♥♥ YOU at least somepoint.  Don't assume anything!!!! This game is really unique.. the most unique in any game, combined with a story and complex characters that react to your actions... Just the first 10 minutes totally and hopelessly sold me to the game.  Back to the unique gameplay: You can kill the enemies, or you can try to get them to give up. If a monster is obsessed with flexing, flex too and have a flexing contest ; ) . Then you can you 'win' the fight without killing.

Thankfully after the end you can still wander around and for reasons I won't spoil.. there are so many choices.. and each are tracked.

Not in spite of the fact that you know the story, but BECAUSE you know the story! It's like a book. The more you re-read, the more you understand, the more secrets you unlock, the more you enjoy it and feel for the characters.  And that's what you do in this game- you feel for the characters. They're not static like in most other RPGs you find- Somehow, they seem more relatable, more alive, more -human- than most humans in other games. Where most games, you have one well-developed character, in this game, you have.... Well, I'm not going to spoil it.   I would go on and on and on, and I easily could... But I will have MERCY and SPARE you the massive review. Suffice it to say this:  While most game dev -teams- struggle to make a compelling game, somehow Tobyfox managed to make a game that eclipses all of them, practically by himself. So put that in your spaghetti. If you need some salt for it, just lean over the plate. The tears this game's storyline will give you will be salt enough.   Ten out of Ten stars.

I recommend purchasing this game and adding it to your charade of games. Here's why  The Characters: 9/10  Undertale has AMAZING characters. Whether if they're a short skeleton who likes puns or a talking flower who wants your soul, Toby never messed it up! This is because Toby probably has previous programming experience such as creating the Earthbound Halloween Hack which features Megalovania, a song that has been the most notorious in the soundtrack. Technically these characters are some you will never forget whether it's someone great and bumbling like Papyrus or someone mysterious and unsettling like Gaster. You will never forget them! Only one problem, SOME can be forgotten. These are mainly the BG characters so It doesn't affect the rating that much.  The Story: 9/10  Okay. This game got much more creative with the RPG element besides just earning experience, gaining inventory and journeying. This game decides to undertake in going a different route besides just travelling all the way just to stop some baddie and then celebrate about it. Many games like the Paper Mario franchise and the Final Fantasty franchise are responsible for this gaming sin. Instead of doing that you're a child stranded in a vast, immense cavern and must reach the end and leave. But there is a final boss, It even recycles the plot from Super Paper Mario where you defeat the main villain but one of the side villains kill the main one and turn into a monstrosity, Oops, spoilers.  The level design: 10/10  Toby's time working on this game was well worth it! All of them are beautiful in their own way and kept my eyes fixated on my screen. None of these were terrible in any way. The one that was most beautiful were the Ruins. The most nostalgic stage of the entire 6 hour playthrough of fun you'll have.  BONUS: About the developer himself His name is Toby Fox. His experience with other things and the music he's worked on led his success to Undertale, he's made multiple references to webcomics like Homestuck and Cucumber Quest in this game and even one of the soundtracks is inspired by both of them. This is the factor to Toby's success and why Undertale was such a big hit.  Conclusion: 10/10  Okay. Toby your work is absolutely outstanding. I love your game development skills and how hilarious you made all the characters seem, especially Papyrus, he made me chuckle everytime he was on the screen. From the ruins all the way to the end this game was the paramount reason I started RPG development.  Welp tl;dr here.   Ten out of Ten!

Though it may seem simple at first, the combat quickly ramps up in difficulty to allow you to test your skills. And finally, the story behind this game is very well thought out and every choice you make has an outcome somewhere down the line. Good or bad, you'll be reminded of the choices you've made and forcing you to think before doing.   This is a very well-made game and it'd be a crime not to play it.",

Some people may write this game off because of the graphics and its rather lackluster first glance appeal, but that would be a dire mistake. This game truely sets itself apart from other games by having unique entities, like the bullet hell system in combat and the fact that every single encounter, battle, etc counts. Every battle has a meaning, an affect on the game world. The game dramatically changes according to whether you go on an outright slaughter, attempt to save everyone or even something inbetween. This is one of the few games where your choices matter 100% and dramatically affect the outcome of the game and your progress along the way. In addition to the stellar gameplay, the soundtrack is masterfully crafted and adds a lot of deph and emotion to the already deep story rich gameplay. I could probably sit here and go on on about how amazing this game is, so I'll simply say that you will not regret buying this game. Priced at $10 its a steal compared to the pricing of so many other games. I guarantee that this will be one of the games that you have no problem playing again and again to see the different endings. This game truely delivers beyond its scope and has very strong emotional development.",

I thought the game was extremely boring, repetitive and I hated all the characters.   Then my friend forced my to play through to the end of the game and I recieved the Neutral ending, I thought it was very cool, but the one fight wasn't worth my time. I still disliked the game and I continued along with my life thinking it was overhyped to the extreme, but the game refused (heh) and one night my friend and I were in a Skype call and he forced me to play through the game again. This time on Pacifist. OH. MY. GOD. I loved it. Not killing the characters made me love them, the dates, the hangouts, the spagetti, I finally loved the game. I nearly cried during the ending and now everytime I hear the song played during the end (Hopes and Dreams, or His Theme) I tear up a little.  The game is nothing to write home about if you don't go through Pacifist or Genocide, mainly the first one. The game isn't one that you enjoy from start to finish, it's one that you push through at first and gradually love, and that battle makes the ending a thousand times more rewarding than if it was just given to you about characters you all love.  My thoughts before Pacifist - 6/10 MY thoughts after Pacifist - 9.9/10 (I had a bad time at one of the endings)  If you gave up before finishing, do yourself a favor and push through it to get the endings, because it's so worth it.",

Gosh the true pacifist ending is really touching. It has surely made thousands of people cry(I'm not one of them lol. I wouldn't tell you that I cried for at least 10 times even if I did).  The only part that is not good enough to me is the FREAKING Sans fight. You will get to the Sans fight if you play a genocide run. IT LITERALLY TOOK ME A MONTH TO BEAT HIM. SANS IS TOO FREAKING STRONG. On a second thought, maybe the producer of the game attempted to make the player feel the weakest in the genocide route. Sans was made to be a god intentionally.  And I have to brag about it: HELL YEAH I BEAT SANS! HELL YEAH.  In comparison with Life is Strange, I'd say this game is much better. No offense to those Life is Strange fans, cuz I'm one of them too. However, choices don't matter in Life is Strange as much as they do in Undertale.  (Life is Strange Spoilers warning) For those who've beaten Life is Strange, you must all know that no matter what choices you made in the previous episodes, there would only be two endings for you to choose. And they are both bad endings. Undertale, on the other hand, has multiple endings depending on the choices you've made. AND THERE IS A REALLY HAPPY ENDING.  Plus, if Chara is a girl, can I be her boyfriend? (Just a tip: DON'T PLAY THE GENOCIDE ROUTE IF YOU'RE NEW TO THIS GAME. YOU WILL REGRET IT.)  Updates: I just got my fifth ending which is the soulless pacifist ending. That jumpscare was epic. Again, Reminder: Don't play the genocide run at first. It messes up everything",

Probably in my top 5 favorite games because of just how brilliant the game is. It reminds me of the amazing old games I'd play, such as Chrono Trigger, Metroid Fusion, Final Fantasy, and all those amazing games.  Undertale is an amazing game that EVERYONE should play. Its worth far above its $10 price tag. Its worth WAY more than many huge production games that I've played.  The story is so personal and brilliant, and you really feel like you are the character that you are playing as. Toby did a perfect job of that.  Now let me go cry in a corner.  ________________________________________________________________  Review after pacifist ending:  This game has transcended the fourth wall and space and time and feels and my mind more than any other game has that I have ever played or any movie that I have ever watched (Yes, even Bioshock Infinite, Madoka Magica, and Inception). It has the most mind blowing ending of any game that I have ever played ever. It brings you into a new level of contemplation of life and video games and stories in general that I have never reached before.  And my gosh that OST. My GOSH that OST.     I'm just not sure if I even have the guts to do a genocide run now ;--;     ________________________________________________________________  Review after genocide ending:     Just kill me now   ",

It's characters and writing are so good it pulls you in the little world within minutes and each time you play the game it feels like you are coming home to a bunch of friends to catch up. I can't stress enough how.. welcomed? This game makes you feel. A lot of it personally for me probably stems from the fact that the protagonist is refered to as 'they' by everybody and that you can hang out and make friends with all the silly monsters no matter what the differences. This game has a sort of unique sense of humor interwoven thru all it does and while it gives off a strong JRPG + Earthbound vibe it's?? Also a dating simulator? Hugging and dog petting game? Bullet hell? Snail racer? It has it all. The music's an incredible treat too! Undertale has been the most refreshing thing I've played this year and I just want to share this joy with as many people as possible. It's understandable that it might not be for everybody because some people are put off by 4th wall breaking and a lot of meta jokes (Which this game does a lot, like woah. Oh, and puns.

            "review_text": "After finishing Undertale completely I knew I had to write a review about it. I have never written a review (with effort) before but I’m going to try to describe the game for you as objectively as possible. There will be some subjective parts but it should be obvious when I talk about my personal opinion.    What is Undertale?   Undertale is an indie RPG made by toby fox and released on 15 September 2015. It started its life as a kickstarter project on 13 June 2013. Toby fox asked for only 5000$ to make the project reality yet he received 10 times that amount. The main mechanic of this RPG is that you don’t have to kill anyone, but you can if you wish.   Community   I want to start off with the community because it seems that this is the main reason why people are discouraged from this game. Lots of people call the Undertale fandom toxic and although it’s not the best community I’ve ever seen it’s by no means as bad as people say it is. Yes, there are a lot of memes and ♥♥♥♥-posts and sometimes Undertale is being mentioned for no reason but there are also some amazing people who try to expand the story after the game ends or create amazing fan art. What I think the main reason is that the Undertale community is treated as toxic is because most people don’t realise that if someone didn’t play the game yet that they won’t understand the jokes that are being told. I can clearly see why this would be annoying but saying the community is toxic because they make references to certain moments in the game that you just don’t know about (yet) is idiotic.  At the end of the day though you shouldn’t even consider the community as a reason for not liking / not playing the game. Especially considering this is a single player game, you won’t have any interaction with the community within the game itself.   Story   This is the main selling point for Undertale. It’s story. Here is a brief part of it to get you started: ‘Long ago, two races ruled over Earth: humans and monsters. One day, war broke out between the two races. After a long battle, the humans were victorious. They sealed the monsters underground, under Mt. Ebott, with a magic spell. After many years legends say that those who climb the mountain never return. You, the player, climb the mountain and you fall in a pit where you end up in “The underground” the place where the monsters were sealed away. Your objective? To find a way back to the surface.’  The story is perfectly designed to make any interaction the player may take feel important. Even when in battle it always feels like you are progressing the story instead of you just getting interrupted to fight someone. The characters have their own personalities and this even includes some of the random NPC’s and normal enemies. All of the characters are really likable, even if you may find some annoying at first. Some of the characters their backstories are really deep and some characters don’t even show any of their backstory making them very mysterious.  Throughout your adventure you will be faced with certain choices, the biggest and most obvious one being that you can either kill or spare your enemies. This is a very important aspect of this game. When you kill someone they are actually dead. You may have certain species of monsters that keep on reappearing but the monster that you previously killed isn’t coming back.  Almost all of the decisions you can possibly make will change the story. There are three major endings to this game: Neutral, Pacifist and Genocide. All of these endings will explain different parts of the story.   When you try to immerse yourself into the story you will be blown away by it, multiple times. I have cried when playing this game and there is no shame to it. The story is just that good. I would love to tell you at which points this happens but obvious spoiler warning. You will just have to trust me on this one.    Gameplay   When it comes to gameplay you have two major situations. In-battle and out-battle.  Out-battle you will run around trying to solve various puzzles to progress, interact with characters to further the story, try to find new items and better equipment. Pretty standard RPG stuff. The puzzles are fun. Although they’re neither easy nor difficult they are still interesting to do.  In-battle you have two ways of defeating your enemies, by killing them or by sparing them. When it comes to sparing the enemies, fights will become puzzles themselves. You will have to perform different kind of acts in order to make the enemy not wanting to fight you any longer. You will have to understand what every enemy expects out of you in order to make them merciful. Don’t worry you don’t have to search up what kind of hidden numbers of characteristics each enemy has. It all becomes obvious during the fighting itself.  If you wish to slaughter your enemies then you can do that however admittedly this is a pretty weak part of this game. Unlike other RPG where you have many different attacks and spells all with their unique stats and effects. In Undertale, you only have one way of inflicting damage. The amount of damage that you deal is based on your timing in pressing a button but other than that, actually hurting the enemy doesn’t really change that much. (You do get different timing patterns with different weapons but overall it will be very similar)  There is something really interesting though about this game and I wish that a lot more RPG’s would use a mechanic like this. In a traditional RPG, when it is your enemies turn you simply have to take the damage and hope it doesn’t kill you. In Undertale, if an enemy attacks you, you will have to dodge the attacks yourself in order to survive. You will be a small heart that you can move around to avoid the projectiles that the enemy shoots at you. It’s basically a bullet-hell. The game will start off easy on you but the dodging can become really difficult later on in the game. The great part about this is that you can improve your own skills when fighting the enemy instead of mindless grinding to boost your characters stats.    Music   If you don’t like chiptune then you probably won’t like the songs ON THEIR OWN. You see we are talking about a game with a retro style so the chiptune fits in. However more importantly is that the songs always seem to match the situations in the game perfectly. Yea I know that that is what video game music has to do but I have never seen so perfectly done as in Undertale. When it comes to the soundtrack that you can buy separately I’ll admit that it is a bit overprized.   Summary    Undertale has become my favourite single player game of all time and for good reasons. The fighting elements are interesting and skillful and the story will make you curious and wanting to get more. The game is also decently large with an average of 21 hours of gameplay to beat all three major endings. With it only costing 10 euros I don’t see a reason not to buy it. Even now that it's has become a year old it's still a great story to be part off. If you still aren’t sure about purchasing this game then you can still try out the demo. You can download the demo on the  official Undertale website  [undertale.com] .   Recommendations for playing   The best way to play this game is to be as blind as possible. The story is the most important aspect of this game and even in the early beginnings the game will start to give you important story elements. Also actually try to immerse yourself into the game. The character you are controlling shouldn’t be played like you would with, let’s say, Mario. In Mario games you pretend to be Mario and save the princess but in Undertale you are playing as yourself. The game heavily depends on your own decisions.",

Side characters and plot-important NPCs alike have life and charm unlike any other, and the dialogue should at least be able to coax a smile out of even those who are jaded when it comes to net-era-savvy humor.  As if that wasn't enough, the music is excellent and complements the gameplay and cutscenes perfectly. The gameplay varies it up quite a lot once you leave the first area, so 'navigate menus and dodge the monochrome bullets' is not the most you can expect out of this game. Not by far.  If you're concerned that this game is trying to shove a message down your throat, make you feel bad for daring to kill an enemy in a video game, it's not. NPCs will tell you where you can shove various things and you'll have a bad time, but the game never tells you you should feel ashamed of yourself.

Here's a review to try and get you to buy this.  It's really quite difficult to summarize this game into a couple of points. From the comedy, to the story-driven characters, to the game-changing choices you can make, to the FANTASTIC music, it all meshes together to create one of the most fun, intense and emotional RPGs ever. The hype can seem discouraging, but I was not hyped about this game until after I played it. I know it's a gamble when somebody tells you to go into a game and pay money all whilst knowing absolutely nothing about the game in question, but take that chance with Undertale. If you just invest a bit of time into it, you will almost certainly be very satsified.  Well, I suppose you should know just one thing before going in: killing is entirely optional. This is a very integral part of the game, so keep it in mind.  This game will take you all the way from tears to blind rage and back again. This game isn't worth its asking price. I would pay twice, or even three times as much for this game. This is  not  a game to pass up, just because it seems overhyped or the visuals seem terrible. I myself watched a video of this game beforehand and thought it was boring. Boy, was I wrong.  So do yourself a favour and pick up this game because you will almost certainly love it, even if you dislike RPGs or turn-based strategy games. If nothing else convinces you, this game can practically run on a toaster, making it the perfect game for a long road trip, or if you're looking for fun on a budget.",

All the characters in Undertale are filled with personality and I find many games out there fails to capture this one aspect of character building.

Another great thing about this game is that every single step counts. Absolutely every single one. Even those small random fights you encounter throughout the game.

Every single thing you do not only in your current run but in your previous run WILL come back to haunt you. Every decision you make. Every piece of dialogue you read. It will all build up and you will truly be judged as a human being.  I'm the type of player that really enjoys getting to the cream of the crop.

But with time the game started to grow on me, I got emotionally invested in the characters and started liking them (and paying for their college education) and after finishing the game I was greatly upset at the ending I got and was determined to get the best possible ending.  So I sat down and played through the entire game again in a single 7 hour sitting, doing every single side quest and character story I could find. I finished that 2 days ago and I'm still processsing it; the story is increadible and well written, the endings are (unlike a lot of story games) satisfying, the characters are, somehow, the most real I've ever seen and I (who normaly is stone cold in games) got extremely attached to a lot of them (I will never accidentaly kill you again, I swear ;~;) The graphics aren't anything special but they still manage to create the characters in a way I didn't think 8/16/whatever bit could accomplish (I normally despise retro stuff) and the game's combat mechanic is unique and fun (except for that one boss, ♥♥♥♥ that one boss) and doesn't get old for a long time.

A nice friend told me to play this game because it's really good. How or why is it good? She didn't say. Just told me to play the game blindly, so I did.   Undertale is a bullet hell type RPG, wich is pretty fun and unique. The gist of this game is that you can complete the game without harming a single 'enemy'. Emphasis on enemy. EVERYTHING you encounter in the game during a FIGHT you can befriend in a spcific way while dodging their attacks. So in a sophisticated, philosophical, complex, [big word], way you can be passive.  But I'm used to my RPGs having violence, loot, gold, and EXP, some of you might think. Yea you can still kill LV up and get gold like any RPG. But if you're not a sociopath who can't feel guilt and enjoy harming others, you're going to have a bad time. This game can get you emotionally and you might even feel bad by wacking a frog with a stick. I mean c'mon why would you do that? The frog doesn't know any better, give it a break, or flirt with it even.  You can be violent or get through the game without harming a soul. Wich ever path you choose will change the story. Speaking about story changing, certain characters in the game will rememeber your actions like in those Telltale pointy clicky games. Some characters even go as far as to break the fourth wall. Even when you revert back from a SAVE, they might remember something you did.  But yea, the games pretty good. Spent 10 hours or so on [one?] run to get the true ending. A dollar worth an hour for a total of 10 hours of gameplay (or more). Undertale is really a game you want to experience rather than watch some Youtuber play it for you.   Judgement Pros: -Amazing music -Nice interactive gameplay (rather than taking turns slapping each other) -Unique world full of adventure -Can flirt with goat mom -Being friendly can win you the game -Snail racing -Be on television -Save the world -Make a snowman very happy  Cons: -Heavy feels -Can't actually hook up with cool skeleton -Feels are too strong -Brace for crying -Evil flowers   I give this game a rating of:  Asriel did nothing wrong/10",

            "review_text": "It's highly unlikely that anyone's going to find this review buried beneath the thousands of other reviews, but I feel like I'm personally obliged to leave a review for this game. It's left a... considerable impact on me.   This is mostly a response to the negative reviews of this game, as I struggle to understand how people could dislike the game.   Undertale does indeed have some flaws. It's designed for a very specific demographic, and many have complained that the fandom is absolutely abysmal. And... that's kind of true, but it's true of any popular game. This game does indeed pander towards the 'Tumblr' demographic, and, well, I'm in that demographic, so maybe I have a biased opinion. I feel as though the community is a contributing factor that leads to this game's dislike by those that have never played it: because people constantly pester those who have not played it to play it, and fail to understand how someone could not like it, and I somewhat fall into this category. It's annoying when people constantly pester other people to do things, and I know I've probably ruined the experience of the game to a few people just by my massive obsession, and feel that I really need to apologize for it. I feel like this fandom will give the game a horrible reputation, and violate Toby's wishes of this game's discussion never becoming a 'garbage cesspool.' But still, however the fandom may ruin the public perception of the game, the game itself is still good. I got the game before it blew up, I just saw it on steam, and bought it without really knowing what it was, and I adored it.   Some people complain about the graphics, something that has never mattered to me. I appreciate the minimalism. And I don't think I'm really driven by nostalgia, per say. I didn't play Earthbound until two years ago, and I thought it was alright. For me, Undertale was much better, much better than probably any other game I'd ever played, although it's really hard to compare Undertale to other games, because it's so unique. The story... didn't really make me that emotional. It's not like I cried, or anything. But I still believe that it was expertly crafted, and that the game was put together with so much care, and wit, a kind that you could never really find in any other game.  I laughed constantly throughout this game. This game had my kind of humor, and I guess some people have different senses of humor, so maybe it won't appeal to them. But it was perfect for me, and there was not a single character I disliked, at all. It was the perfect mix of humor and plot. The pacing kind of felt a bit iffy the first time I played through the game, though, so there's a slight criticism. But still, playing it a second time, and seeing all the slight foreshadowing, and how everything tied together, I guess I changed my mind. I loved the plot, and I loved the humor. It's a bit confusing at points, but it can come together. I do think part of the true final boss was a bit corny and generic, and I was slightly disappointed by it, but that doesn't really matter.   This game kept throwing all sorts of unexpected things at me, and I loved every second of playing it. I never lost interest, I was constantly engaged. I'm the sort of person that plays video games mostly for the stories. My favorite part of any RPG is talking to NPCs. Dialogue is the primary focus of this game. It's understandable why I liked it. This game wasn't necessarily difficult, though some of the boss fights were a bit challenging, but that isn't the point. The gameplay isn't the focus of the game - it's merely using the medium of gameplay to tell a story, and it does it quite well. It uses game mechanics as metaphor, and I thought it accomplished this excellently.  I found the beginning of the game to be the least engaging part, and while I still absolutely adored it in every way, and thought it was perfect, it wasn't the best the game has to offer. So, I guess some people who only played the game for around an hour didn't really experience what made me love this game.   I've played the game around 4 times. I'm obsessed. I originally wrote this review, and then planned to stop thinking about it, but boy, was I wrong. I've watched 4 of my friends play this entire game, all the way through. I run the wiki for this game. It occupies my thoughts, honestly, 20% of the time. I can't stop thinking about it. I kind of wish it was longer, but I couldn't see any way to extend it. The game is already so interconnected, that I really don't want it to ever be patched, (except for bug fixes), and I never want to see a sequel or anything. Because this game is perfection, and I doubt any other game could really replicate the quality of this game.   For me, it was the perfect game. For most people that buy it, it'll be a pretty good game. For a few, it might be a waste of money. The only scenario where I would recommend not buying the game is if you are really, really bad at bullhell, in which case I'd just recommend watching a Let's Play of the game instead. Although, I really do believe that this game is an experience that you can enjoy to the fullest extent if you play it yourself.   If you've somehow traversed all of these reviews, and are actually reading all this, just buy the gosh darn game already. It's clear that you're interested. Give it a shot. You'll probably love it.",

In this game, players are able to 'personalize' who their character becomes. Players can choose how violent they act to how much they explore the land.   Undertale is very similar to the Nintendo 64 game, Paper Mario. They are both played the same way- turn-based fights and a branching story line, however Undertale outranks all other games of this type.

I can't even put into words just why Undertale is so great, but the fact that this game is compelling me to try and do so anyway should speak for itself.  I felt a lot of things playing Undertale: curiosity, shock, joy, fear, anger, sorrow, disbelief, regret. But most of all, I felt  Determination . And I'm not just being cheesy, I'm not just playing off of the importance of 'determination' in the storyline. I really, truly, felt determined to play, to win, and in many cases, to go back and right the mistakes I had made before.  The game, the story, is incredibly compelling.

The Soundtracks is out of this world, i was blown away by it, catchy when needed (mettaton and spider dancer) and haunting when exploring some secret areas related to a specific ending.  I honestly couldn't find a flaw in the soundtrack.  The boss battles are fun, a bit hard for some but that can be explained by how inexperienced i am in such games.

            "review_text": "It took me a while to play this game, over a year after it came out. For the longest time, I had to hear about it among my friends or see jokes and references about it throughout the internet. Constantly, I hear how good it is, but at the same time because of how popular it got, the fandom has gotten a lot of hate. Because of how much people like this game, some people are turned away from it before giving it a chance, or simply because it was hyped up too much for them to find satisfaction.  The concept is fresh, allowing you to choose between fighting monsters and growing stronger or trying to please them and spare them from a fight, which in return doesn't make you any stronger. You must do something different for each creature to earn its trust and avoid a fight. The creatures themselves are fun to see and can be pretty creative. Some are pretty basic but others have humorous designs or personalities, like a small volcano creature that attacks stronger when you encourage it because it thinks it's helping. When you are sparing an enemy, you usually have to pick between a few different options to act on. While it's interesting learning each creature and what you need to do to earn its trust, it's never really challenging and doesn't really make you think outside the box much. Most of the time you'll either be doing a trial and error of the different actions or just stalling until a fight ends. If you choose to ignore the pacifist option and simply attack the enemies, it's a pretty basic time-based system requiring less thought than the alternative.  The game has different routes based on how you go about the spare or kill option. There are three main routes, the pacifist route, in which you kill no one at all and befriend all of the key characters, the genocide route, where you kill EVERY enemy and fightable character, and the neutral route, which is pretty much everything in-between and also mandatory to complete first for story purposes. There's a lack of variety between the routes and the philosophy is pretty black and white, either being kind to everyone or going on a murderous rampage. If you try to mix it up and kill one or two creatures on a regular run or spare a few on a genocide run it just results in the basic neutral ending. It would be interesting if there was more variety based on who you choose to kill and who you don't, like affecting the story or who you fight next or maybe grant you access to exclusive items or places, but all it does is intervene in the objective of either sparing or killing everything and give you some different dialouge at the end. However because it is a unique concept I don't blame Toby Fox for not adding too much depth and complexity into it and focusing more on the story and the idea of an RPG where no one has to die. It's the first of its kind so there's room for a lot more implementation of the concept.  The routes themselves don't change that much. the neutral and pacifist routes are pretty identical up until the end besides some minor dialogue changes. The genocide route is pretty much designed to not be fun, as you skip a lot of story bits and kill the main cast. The main attraction of the genocide route is the fights, which are the most challenging of the game. The fights are enjoyable and beating them is satisfactory, but there are very few actual bosses in the genocide route, which takes away the main entertainment one would look forward to. But hey, it was intended not to be fun, so it works I guess.  The combat in general is really fun. It's pretty much a bullet hell where you avoid the attacks from the enemy before you make your move. While typical enemies aren't all that special, I had a lot of fun with the boss battles. The boss battles like to change up the mechanics and have a unique twist to make the fight more engaging and entertaining. Though they aren't that difficult and just require learning their attacks to avoid them successfully. The music is also great. There's not just one or two great tracks, pretty much all of the bosses have amazing themes and they suit the battles well and add to the atmosphere.  The game looks okay. I'm not really a fan of Frisk's design but it's alright. I like the designs of the main cast, all of which are memorable characters, as you may guess by how popular they've become over the internet. The locations are kinda dull, probably the weakest part of the game. There isn't much to explore and the puzzles never require much effort.   The humor and characters are pretty divisive among the people I've met. I liked it, I thought the characters were fun and I thought the game was pretty funny. I can understand why one wouldn't but I thought it was enjoyable and never felt too overbearing. It really depends on if it's your cup of tea or not. I think a lot of the hate for the humor comes from the fandom, who make a small gag from the game into a huge meme you see over and over again. The whole bad puns doggo anime stuff I kept hearing about weren't as obnoxious as I thought they would be and were pretty small parts of the overall humor you find in the game.  As for the story itself, it was really good. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was very entertaining and the whole climax was great. You can probably guess what the main message at the end of the game is going to be, but that didn't make it any less enjoyable for me. The theme is kinda obvious but the execution is very well done and the whole presentation is great. It's something you have to experience for yourself and it ties the game together very nicely, so I wouldn't just watch a video of the end or something, because you should be engaged throughout the game in order to fully enjoy it. It's also interesting learning about the lore of certain characters and how it develops across the different routes. Even though the ending of the genocide route was creepypasta fuel I thought it fit in nicely and the mood was genuine.  I usually don't mind fandoms because I think every franchise has its fair share of obnoxious fans but it got to a point with this game where it hindered my experience. I know it's easy to get swept up in the hype of a game but they ruined a lot of things. There were several moments in the game that were supposed to be big surprises and cool twists that were just outright spoiled for me. Mainly it was the final bosses, who were still fun to fight, but it took away a lot of impact already knowing they were coming. One major spoiler is simply the existence of a character which is ruined just by people having profile pictures of them. And it's not like I was looking at gameplay videos or looking up information of the game, all of these things were ruined for me just by virtue of being in groups with people who played the game. Just hearing about the game so much revealed a lot of key moments from the game that I wish I could have experienced blind. I guess it's my fault for not playing a game immediately when it comes out.  Overall, I thought the game was really good. It wasn't perfect, and the popularity was definitely overblown, but I thought it was a very enjoyable experience. The game isn't for everyone, and I can see why some people wouldn't like it. It has flaws like any other game, but I think the pros outweigh the cons. It has a nice cast of memorable characters with an intriguing concept, great music, and a lovable feel. I know the fandom can be annoying, but I encourage you to give it a chance and go into it with an open mind. It was an enjoyable experience that I'll play again for sure. Just don't expect this game to be the greatest thing ever, but also don't try to force yourself to hate it because everyone else loves it. Sure there are a lot of things that could have been better, but it's a fun experience nonetheless.",

I'm not sure I'm done with it just yet seeing as there's apparently more to the story in other paths, but I have reached an ending I'm truly satisfied with.  It was well worth pushing through that one section to see everything unfold, and right now I've been starting at THE END for the whole time I've been writing this, mostly because the music is so good, but also to see if anything happened.

Yes, this game is up there with these two, and in fact, this game got a 97 on metacrtic, HIGHER then Half-Life 2, Higher then Fallout 4, Higher then phantom pain. Why?  This game brings something to the videogame industry that I don't see much of anymore.   1. This game brings memorable characters.  2. Brings back the classic feel of the SNES RPG's, alot like Earthbound and the mother games.  3. Humor. And alot of it.  And last but not least, something that telltale tells their customers they put in their games but does this barely, which undertale does impressivley and better.  4. Choices that impact the story and flow of the game.   17. Spagethii  This game honnestly makes the player feel great. It makes the player feel they matter.

Undertale has all you could ask for in a game. An amazing story, clean humour, adventure, a unique combat system, a nice soundtrack. The list just keeps on going! Undertale allows you to carve your own path in the story, either be passive to everyone you meet, or brutally beat them to a bloody pulp (I think you know which one I chose). Anyway, there are several endings to the game that you can get (One being absurdly weird and disturbing) that all depend on your actions throughout the game. And the combat system? Man, do I love the combat system! Its a unique twist of the pokemon combat system, but instead of just being attacked back and losing damage instantaneously, its actually almost like a minigame everytime your enemies (or friends) fight back, making it so that you can actually not get injured or get injured less by pure skill. It truly does give the game a twist when fighting enemies. Overall, this game is a prime example of a beautiful game sent from the heavens above. Sure I may only have 6 hours in the game as of writing this review, but trust me, I will be playing this game again just to see what the other endings have to offer! What are you waiting for?

First of all, this game overstepped all of my expectations in just the very begining, this game is one of a kind, filled with awesome things that a lot of games nowadays forget to do or they just dont care about it anymore.  The story is the strongest part of this game and it is really well written and exectued, is a rollercoaster full of emotions, from the start to the conclusion the choices you do are going to be affected in the story, if you want to just play it without caring anything but kill people you are missing the whole point of the game, the little details this game has are unbelievable good, the cast of characters are funny, good and memorabe, the fights with bosses are great and the way they interact with is very unique. You can be a saint with everybody and get an ending, or be the devil formed in a little kid with a stripped shirt and kill everything that moves and get that good ol' EXP quicker.  The soundtrack is INSANELY good, it's the second strongest part of the game, it carries the game the same way the story does, it fits perfectly with the 8-bit style, the soundtrack is so good that even after you close the game you will still hear it in your head that you will probably go to youtube and listen it for hours while thinking how good the songs are.  I think in the future it will be one of those games for referece that will be remembered as one of the bests.  Long story short, go buy this game, you willl not regret it, it's one of the best 8 bucks (10$ without discount) that i've ever spent in steam.  Buy this game or die, or rather, play it then die.   My final rate is 89 billions/10, thanks for reading.",

Entertaining sense of the creator's humour will accompany you through your journey as you meet various likable characters on your way back home, both enemies and (hopefully) friends. The game's preferred way of battling aggressors is trying to find a peaceful resolution which will convince the monster to stop fighting and the available options are unique per all monster types. For example, if you fight a sexy looking monster who can't stop admiring itself in the mirror, perhaps it'd like to hear about its nice hair? If you're not interested in becoming friends with anyone, you're also more than free to kill them, though that might have its consequences. Undertale features few endings based on the player's actions through the game and all of that is sweetened by the game's catchy soundtrack.

            "review_text": " Undertale presents itself as traditional a 2-D RPG as it can get with turn based combat mechanics, a host variety of environments to explore and interact with, and an elaborate if not abstract cast of characters. The world in itself is actually beneath the world above because you're not just anywhere, you're many ways down under where many monsters will greet you.  However, at the surface, Undertale is a deceptive title with many elements that can be both endearing and perhaps even thought provoking. If your heart can survive the journey, you will further come to appreciate the quirks and good times that are buried in the game.  Combat mechanics often involve a bullet hell variety timing and precision with that very element being upped and turned on it's head just when you think you've learned to master it. The same can be said for the main cast of characters who can prove just as unpredictable and in an odd sense, human at their best comical standards and at worst dramatic moments.  The main element that shines in Undertale is the pacing and flowing of the story, and it's not just patience that players are rewarded for but their ability to not be violent. For those who have played it, they understand this. Combat can be achieved without combat at all and while arguably a bit more tedious, the results are as entertaining as they are heart warming. Undertale at it's peak will lavish players with genuine moments many developers and various teams strive to produce but all too often fail to achieve. On the same hand it will relentlessly punish players for cruelty and violence. A mirroring affect that not only denies the ultimate conclusion, but also does not relinquish after the game's credits have rolled.  Undertale proves in an age of more accessible and easily digestible plots coupled with bite sized gameplay, that with the right words and clever enough world, a game can hold onto you even more once it's concluded. If there is any one game on your list of ' I have too many -insert game service- games that I haven't played already so I won't buy this! ' this one should certainly not be on it. ",

So I feel a huge need to recommend it to others.  To put it simply, Undertale is a game about a human that falls into an underground world of monsters. The game is made by Toby Fox, who you may know as a popular composer, notable for working on Homestuck, with pixel art by Temmie Chang. The battle system is unique in that NO ONE HAS TO DIE; every battle gives you the option of FIGHTng the traditional way, or ACTing; non-violently negotiating with the enemy to convince them not to fight anymore. The way you choose to address battles with this system has a permanent effect on the rest of the game. The other unique aspect of the battle system is the bullet hell style system to avoid damage, which is truly unique for an RPG. You can make friends, enemies, and many other things along the way. And, well, that's really all I can say about the story without spoiling too much. Oh, also it takes inspiration from another great game; earthbound. But at the same time manages to be its own thing. The humor, music, writing, and presentation are all top notch, and by the end you'll care so much about everyone in the game, and will possibly change the way you think about the world within a game forever.  In short, please pick up Undertale. It's so amazing, Toby Fox deserves money and, well, frankly, it's only 10 bucks. What have you got to lose?  * Reading this review... It fills you with determination.",

It's only $9.99 on the Steam Store but offers one of the best story-driven games i've played in 2015. You see, it's not an ordinary game... everything you do MATTERS in this game. I dare say, it rivals choice making games like Mass Effect, Telltale Games, and so on.  Characters are incredibly likable, the puzzles are interesting without being cringe worthy to solve, enemies and bosses don't have to be slain (in fact, you can totally spare everyone and try obtaining the True Pacifist Ending like I did). The lore is really something you don't want to skip, the plot twists are pretty wicked, the boss fights are awesome, and nothing rubbed me off the wrong way.  If you're engaged, you'll most likely get emotional. There's bits in the game that don't make sense at first until you've completed it or done certain 'requirements' to find out the truth. God I love this game. It's extremely rare to get such a golden example when it's only $9.99 when i've played games that failed miserably while being sold for $59.99 ... yea. Greatest aspect is the fact your choices matter. Hey you want to reload and change something? Oh the game won't forget what you did during your previous save. Even if you quit and try making up, the game isn't going to forget. Think carefully about everything you do, for even the most useless / simple item could be significant later on. Everything matters, and I love how the game doesn't disappoint in reminding me of that.  Also the first game that asked of me to NOT restart (aka going into NG+) because story reasons. Yeah that took me by surprise but I loved it. In fact, I loved every moment I spent playing this game. It's funny, addicting to play through even if you die a few times ... you'll grow attached to the characters (especially Toriel) along with being sucker punched. It has dark themes, don't take this lightly as some happy-go-lucky game because it's not. But who's to say it has to remain dark? You choose however you want to handle the adventure, as a pacifist or murderer.   10 / 10 game, is now on my top ten favorite games OF ALL TIME. Please, support the game and buy it. I promise you, it's worth every cent when playing this well crafted game that I won't be forgetting anytime soon, or ever really.",

            "review_text": "Woah! :O  I've never had ANYTHING touch my feelings in such a deep way before as Undertale! It's crazy! And even half a week after finishing it I just can't think of anything else. My productivity went down, yet I feel like it was totally worth it. A huge inspiration! And those jokes are hilarious! xD  The world is very well written. Everything works together well, and even very early things have some meaning late in the game. Everything has a meaning! Even if they seem to be some flavour dialogue.    Though, personally, I'm not much a fan of the bullet hell fighting. But of course, the game needed some more gameplay elements, and this was the best way to add something while making it varied and unique for every monster. It never really got frustrating though!   One thing I'm even less a fan about is the whole meta stuff. About saving, loading, and resets being actual game components and seen by some characters. Especially in the endboss fights where   your file gets 'erased' and brought back.   It feels like it makes the actual story, about the war, the barrier, and you trying to just get home, feel so small and insignificant, as you're fighting for   reality itself, and not just to free the monsters, or just to get back home.     Especially odd as even after you fight the endboss, the barrier breaks, and everything is as if the entire timeline never was in danger.   I would really prefer if it was just its own little contained world, with a legend, and a hero.  But yeah, I imagine, since the game is largely about defying common tropes, the meta things were planned even before you came up with the story  Even thought it's a large part of my review, it did not make the game worse for me. It's more of a personal preference. Undertale still is my absolute favourite top game!    The writing reminded me a little to Psychnonauts, as many scenes are done in a humorous cartoon like fashion.  Many things that most game developers largely ignore have been added in. Many small things that work wonders together, giving the game a much more lively feel. Like the different facial expressions of the characters. And the 'cutscenes' like when   you were dating with Papyrus or cooking with Undyne,   or even when toriel angrily stared at that Froggit attacking you xD It seems to be so much additional work, but it made the whole game so much more fun and emotional! And the fight with Toriel, how she tried to stay determined, and slowly lost her steam, and eventually stopped attacking completely :C  I wish you could stay a little longer with her in the ruins in the beginning. To get a bit more familiar with her,...  ...and to make leaving her even worse D:   The music is perfect and conveys the feelings very well! The writing is perfect and conveys the feelings very well aswell! And the character sprites and animations are perfect and convey the feelings very well aswell aswell! :P  The tiles of the game map seem a little simple though. But I guess it's more of a style than just simple art. As things like the shop windows, or the core are in marvellous pixel art!   One of the many best things about the game is the ending. I only played one run in pacifist, but it was amazing!   I'm really really really really glad that the ending truly is happy. No sudden 'artsy' bittersweet ending, or a complete open ending. It really is a full, satisfying ending. You can see how the characters are doing afterwards, and even how you finally get to stay with Toriel x3    I really hope there will be a sequel or something similar set in this universe, even if it's not in the same genre as this game. But the worldbuilding and writing is just so grand. It could even be smallish slice of life things. Doesn't need any big adventures!   ]: )",

The characters, the world, the events that took place; these will not.

This is what happens when Earthbound/Mother 3 has a kid with the RPG Maker adventure RPG, Yume Nikki-- and I feel that after experiencing the game, it truly is my most apt comparison.  For a bit of backround, I tend to be very bad about completing games that I have, especially on PC. But Undertale is a game that kept my interest, and while it took me multiple play sessions to get through even one of the routes (Pacifist, I cannot handle Genocide yet), it was a well-worth experience that I wish I could experience again with a mind clear of expectations.  The writing is great, being consistently not only humorous, but also emotional. Toby Fox shines well with his music, and some of the tracks, especially during the end points of the game, need to be heard at least once-- preferrably while you're playing the game yourself. The characters of Undertale are all varied and endearing; even the store keepers are great to talk to. And some points are even kinda scary, but it's a good level of it that helps keep your attention.  The gameplay is absolutely unique, taking cues from bullet curtain games (Touhou) for the main point of your defenses. Attacking in itself is very unique as well, giving you a bar in which you need to press your execute button to hit the middle, or close to the middle, repeatedly. But there's the added twist that you can, definitely, get through the game without killing any monsters-- and in fact, it's vital for your run to do so, depending on what you're aiming for. To avoid killing, you can do Shin Megami Tensei-style options of trying to appeal to the monster to get them to stand down, at which then you can give them mercy and spare them. You can even choose to attack, but then not actually attack, which counts as a move in itself, which can help your way towards sparing. You won't gain EXP through this-- and the game 's Pacifist route is built in such a way that it's much more skill based due to the unique way of defending, so you won't need to level up-- but you will gain Gold in which you can buy healing items and armor with.  You come to care about the characters in the game. You become invested in seeing things through to the end. You truly want to see things reach a happy conclusion. Through a unique usage of automatic saves that happen in the backround, your actions will change your experiences-- and these are experiences that will stay consistent, even if you reload without saving. I don't think I'll ever see a game again that uses such a mechanic to this extent, and it is excellent as a story-building tool.  Really, I can't recommend this game enough. You might mess up at first. You might miss things you should do, at first. But experiencing this game is highly worth it, especially for the $10 entry price (though I wouldn't be against recommending buying the bundle with the OST for $8 more.)",

Traditionally, the term brick referred to unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.  Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called 'lightweight blocks') are made from expanded clay aggregate.  Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 5000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as mudbricks, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.  Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds, collectively known as brickwork, and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.",

            "review_text": "As an avid old school RPG fan from the 90s, I picked up Undertale based on the hype alone. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was hoping for a pleasant surprise.   Well, I was surprised all right. Let's start with you actually DO in this game, since nobody that reviews this seems to actually tell you anything about the gameplay.  This is at its core a very bare bones RPG. There are no skill trees, no special attacks, and no other stats other than attack, health, and defense. You have only person in your party - yourself - and you fight random monsters like any classic RPG. You have only 2 choices when you have a random encounter: Fight, or persuade. Fight is exactly that, direct damage against the monster's HP. The persuade option, or 'Act' let's you pick a dialogue option to talk the monster down. Pick the right one (or enough right ones in succession) and the monster stands down and you spare its life.  Combat is incredibly superficial. Worse, you will NEVER gain levels if you choose to spare all the monsters you face. Your only progression will be gaining new equipment, of which there is only 2 slots, and they are just stat upgrades generally.  Outside of combat is an extremely linear RPG experience. You go from environment to environment, encountering NPCs, small shops, and learn a bit about the lore behind the world. There's little exploration to do and little reward for doing it outside of the many jokes you might discover. There are a few puzzles, but most of them are incredibly simple and more designed to poke fun at puzzles found in most other classic RPGs.   There are some gimmicks the game utilizes. Each time a monster attacks you, instead of dealing simple damage, it opens a small bullet-hell mini game: Dodge all the projectiles and you take no damage from the monster. This is truly the only challenging part of the game. It tests your 1942 skills more than your RPG talents.There's also some very clever manipulation of your Save File that works really well when it's actually exploited, which is too rare. While the game has multiple endings it certainly doesn't warrant multiple play throughs.  Obviously the heaps of praise this game gets can't be justified on its game play. So does the overall presentation thrust it into greatness? Not really. Almost everything you encounter in this game is a joke or a long running gag - all monsters, their attacks, most NPC dialogue, and most search queries in the environment. Few of these elicit more than a chuckle, despite the constant absurdist quality of it all. The graphics are certainly not pretty as you'll note from the screen shots. Battles are almost complete black and white.  The game has almost no options. You can go fullscreen or what looks like 640x420. You can set some controller buttons. And that's it. There are no sound options so get ready to reach for that volume knob when you boot this sucker up.   It does have one thing going for - awesome 8-bit music. There are some seriously memorable tracks here (my shortlist of favorites: Metal Crusher, Song That Might Play When You Fight Sans, Dummy, Spider Dance, Megalovania, Bonetrousle). And there are a couple moments of sheer brilliance. The game is at its best when it plays off of RPG tropes and breaks the 4th wall. But there's not enough to justify how long it'll take you to get to those moments. I can't recommend it as a whole package.",

If you couldn't tell by now, the story was my favorite part about this game- not to say that I don't love everything else about it. The pixelized art is beautiful, the game mechanics are fun (not to mention an incredibly unique mix of touhou shooter and rpg battle that I'd love to see in more games in the future), your choices COMPLETELY matter (no, not just for endings- the entire game changes based on how violent you are), and while the music is subtle most of the time, when a boss battle or an emotional scene happens it makes things intense very quickly! If there were any complaints, it would be that the puzzles are very easy- but personally I liked that because then I could get to the story and character bits faster! *-*  This game is easily worth $10, and if you want to support it further the soundtrack isn't expensive! Personally I find it to be worth way more than $10, and I hope this game reaches consoles and handhelds in the next year.   ***** Possible Spoiler*****   If you want the best ending, never stop being a pacificist and be friends with every monster you can!

However, I have to admit, never once have I ever felt that these characters have felt more like a genuine family member to me then any of the characters here in Undertale. Rather it's Toriel as my mother, or Asriel as my little brother, Sans as my cool uncle, or Papyrus as my UNcool uncle who's so uncool that he's actually super cool. I love these characters, I want them to succeed, I don't just feel bad for them, or sympathize with them, I feel happy when they are happy as well, and when they are sad, so am I. This became most apparent when I had fought Asriel at the end of the True Pasficet ending, as I SAVED him, and as began to scream and cry, begging for me to stop and let him win, I started to cry with him. After the fight, and it asked me if would forgive him, or not I did so without second thought. Then when the game asked me to comfort him, again I lost it, I wept several manly tears (okay maybe not very manly). Never before have I felt so attached to any characters in any work of fiction. I have never felt that I could relate, so closely then I have with this game.

I've had the various endings, characters and most events spoiled for me forwards, backwards, and sideways; and I'm not even halfway through my first playthrough yet (it's pacifism, don't worry). Even with that being said, I'm still going to finish the game, because  I love Undertale so damn much .  Given that you play the game as the pacifist, Undertale provides an absolutely fantastic experience choc-full of memorable characters who will undoubtedly drive you into maximum overfeels. I guarantee you at least one event that'll make you laugh..and cry. The latter has many more than the former. Every time you run into an encounter, random or otherwise, the game turns into a mix of an RPG &amp; bullet hell that is always refreshing.   Be warned that malicious actions have consequences; the game WILL remember if you kill somebody, even if it's an insignificant minor enemy, and will bar you from the true ending. Should you be really curious to see what happens if you kill things, watch Youtube videos on it.  I recommend this game to anyone who liked the Mother (Earthbound) series. Undertale is actually quite inspired by it, IIRC. It's hands down one of the best games I've played this year. Hell, it's my favorite game of the year. No, wait, not even that--it's my most favorite game  ever .  11/10, would play through again. And again. And  again .",

Lessons are learnt, hours are spent looking up fanart, theories, experiences from other players - anything to keep the journey alive.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt that no game has made me connect with its characters on as strong a level as Undertale did, and they lack three dimensions and voice-acted speech.

But here I go.  Undertale at first glance might look like a simple looking JRPG, with some new twists added to the typical JRPG formula. You can either kill or spare your enemies, and who and how much you kill affects the outcome of the game. Instead of directly receiving attacks from enemies that lower your HP, defending works as some sort of mini bullet hell, and each boss adds its own little twists into it. It is rather fun, although the random encounters don't offer too much by themselves. Gameplay wise, it is fun and enjoyable, and can provide a great challenge if you so desire.  But really, it is a whole lot more than that. Undertale reminds us of how powerful storytelling can be in a videogame, in a way only videogames are able to achieve and no other medium can ever dream of. It is truly a great experience, and a real ♥♥♥♥ing ride all the way through. Gameplay and Story tie together very damn well, and your actions for once, have real importance.  And did I mention the soundtrack? Holy damn, it's ♥♥♥♥ing god tier and one of my favorite soundtracks ever. Really great stuff.  So my verdict? Go buy it now. Seriously. It's a really fantastic game.

            "review_text": "Undertale.... a game that i had never given much credit. When i first looked at it; the graphics seemed bad, monsters seemed stupid, and the story didnt seem appealing. But i started seeing people talk more and more about this game... i had to give it a try, and to my surpise was one of the best games i've played in a long time. That said the worst thing about Undertale is its hard to decribe because your experience is different depending on how you play...    I have completed the Neutral and True pacifist routes so my experience/ review may be different then someone who:   *played the Genocide route  *Only played Neutral route  *Did not play through the entire game (Which is kind of a given)  -----  Undertale is a game where your choices matter.... that said there is really only 2 major choices that really effect the game. Kill all the monsters or don't. There is a 3rd ending but it requires you to complete the 'Neutral route' first. Anyway, even though the choice seems small it changes the way certain characters act, which ones you meet, which ones you wont, and how future run thoughs are played.   Neutral:   For me i found this route like every other rpg out there. Bond with certain characters, boss battles, dying to monsters a lot, and exploring a world of the creaters imagination. But the game has many things that set it apart from other rpgs. The jokes are perfect, interesting ways to fight creatures, amazing character development, and sometimes 'pee your pants creepy' moments. This route (when you dont kill any of the main characters or any monsters at all) really makes you fall in love with the friends you make on your journey. The ending to this route is creepy and funny all at the same time and makes you want to replay the game to get another ending and actually beat the game (this routes ending makes you feel that there is stuff undone).  True Pacifist:   The ending to any RPG that makes you get close to your friends within the game. Though it still stands apart from other rpgs with its humor, story, and surpising experiences. When beaten the game will make you feel as if you cant reset it thanks to a character asking you not to 'reset the time line' and make you feel as if you are playing god.   Genocide:   The route you take if you kill every monster. Although i haven't played this route for myself i have seen/watched/ and talked about this route with others. This route makes this friendly RPG turn into a horror game all of its own. The main characters that were your friends in the other two routes become your enemies and the way they talk and act are different. Sometimes when you check places red text will apear telling/ asking strange things like 'where are the knives' or 'its me, (fallen human's name)'. Though this route is much different and some what terrifying the mystery and strory development are great.   ----  Undertale is a beautiful, beautiful game and i suggest this game to anyone willing to sit down and play it. It really surpised me and i can say personally that its an experience worth while... the best way to describe it is to say...its a friendly rpg where NOBODY has to DIE....",

On more than one occasion I found myself thinking that the author has really thought of everything for this game.  This game is a puzzle RPG.  Puzzles abound on the overworld. Combats can be resolved in more than one way. Creativity, clever solutions, or 'thinking outside the box' are all generally rewarded. Enemy attacks are predictable and reasonably avoided. That said, this is, at least mechanically, an easy game. If you expect your technical skills to be challenged, you will be disappointed, except perhaps for a few boss fights. Equipment and items are available should you find yourself struggling, or could instead be forgone altogether to increase the difficulty.  This is an emotional game.  As an RPG, reading (and understanding) the on-screen text is important. If you find yourself often skipping through text in games, or have difficulty immersing yourself in a game, you will be disappointed in this game. If instead, you find yourself often wondering how other characters might react to a given plot event, you'll often be pleasantly rewarded. Difficult choices are available to you throughout the game and are reasonably presented. Conversely, the game's humor keeps the energy high at all the right times.   If you buy this game, expect to put 10-15 hours into a single playthrough, depending on your skill level and reading speed. It is well worth the $10 this game cost at the time of review. ",

If you don't know, in Undertale you have the option to not kill anyone at all but you are always given the choice to do so and that makes you wonder 'What would happen if I kill this person right now?' and if you did, it would change how the story plays out, but not the story itself.

And the end of the pacifist run is probably one of the happiest and most awesome endings ever, it was so good that it brought me to tears, and I've never once in my life cried to a video game, or really any kind of fiction other than some black and white movie I seen as a kid.

I personally enjoyed the Pacifist route the best, doing what is needed to start and maintain the Genocide route is heart-breaking to do as all the characters are very lovable and the consequences for your actions make the player feel bad for choosing Genocide. So overall the game is very well made for just been made by mainly one person and the storyline it great and the characters are very well designed.  -SPOLERS-  I have to say my favourite part of the game was in the Pacifist route meeting Papyrus and going through his puzzles, his reaction to seeing you for the first time is funny and seeing him trying so hard to capture you is moving to watch as he really wants to become a part of the royal guard.   My favourite character has to be Sans, he is very amusing when he makes puns and is overall a lovable character. He is also very mysterious because he appears to ‘teleport’ places, for example when you head towards the mysterious door Sans seems to teleport after he goes out of the view of the screen and when Sans walks away and appears in the completely opposite place to where he was originally heading.   Overall I would recommend this game because of its detailed and deep story line, lovable and interesting characters and good soundtrack that just about always fits with the events and locations.",

I never knew of the past Kickstarter campaign it came from, and upon the release, I had no initial draw toward the bits and pieces I had seen of it.  That is, until a friend of mine gifted this bundle of entertainment to me.   Though I immediately saw the draws between this and the Mother Franchise, I couldn't help but love it. Music, Character Development, Story, and hell, even the unique encounter system was humorous the whole way through.  Though it probably sounds like ignorant gushing over a game, this was legitimately one of the most surprisingly touching games I've seen over the past year, and I'm sure glad to see many more open to this quirky style. :D  Since its indie fame has jumped forth (leaping, more like it), my only hope is that unlike other quickly hyped indie games that are released nowadays (looking at you, FNAF) that the community around it, doesn't over-saturate what makes this game unique to anyone that has given it a quick look.  Don't spoil this game for yourself, it would really be a waste.   For all of you reading that are waiting for Mother 4, this will not be a disappointment. :)",

            "review_text": "I went into this game not quite sure I was getting to, but I ended up getting a lot out of it.  It's a unique game where it actually feels like it does what it claims to do: that your choices actually determines how the game plays out—characters will act differently whether you're being a friendly pacifist, or a kill 'em all murderer. The world can feel alive, or it can feel like you're the only person alive.  While the combat may not be everyone's up of tea, I enjoyed it greatly. Figuring out how the normal monsters ticked were easy enough after awhile, but it's the bosses where the mixed combat of puzzle and bullet hell shooter really shine. Each of the bosses has a unique take on it, and it was an element I enjoyed greatly.  The biggest strength though, is its writing and its characters. The characters are well-designed and well-written—sticking with you long after you finish the game. You'll start to care for them over the course of the game if you choose to befriend them, and they just might shatter your heart should you decide kill them instead. But even then, some of them show the strength of their character in the face of adversity—either by still believing in you and giving you the benefit of the doubt, or by giving it their all to keep the rest of the world safe.  And on the story, the game does a fantastic job of balance with its thematic elements. On the surface, it seems like a very simple, lighthearted game with its many jokes and snappy writing. But its lightheartedness only serves to really drive home the darker elements hidden beneath the surface. It's a game that'll make you laugh, make you cry, make you scared, and make you smile all at once.  The other strength is its soundtrack. It is absolutely worth the bundle, but even if you don't get when you buy the game, it's worth the $10. Many of the game's battle themes are extremely catchy and pleasant to listen to, but even some of the overworld themes will find a way to get stuck in your head.  I will say that for those that get major anxiety from unsettling/creepy imagery, then it might be a little difficult for you to get into it. Near the end of the game if you go the   neutral   route, then it can get extremely rough for about thirty minutes or so with the final boss. Just throwing that up there as a warning.  One last note, you real need to get the true end of the game. It'll take more than one playthrough to do it, but I promise you the payoff is worthwhile.",

The story is absolutely amazing, this is one of the most captivating and beautiful stories to come out of the games i've played. The gameplay is really interesting as it (without spoiling anything) allows you to become one with the character, and makes every encounter different. The mechanics, now this might not make a lot of sence if you haven't completed the game already, but the game actually keeps track of your deaths and choices throughout the game, which at the end comes to a conclusion based on a lot of different variables. This makes it so that you can actually have three different playthroughs and get to different endings because of your choices. The ending is awesome, the gameplay is ridiculous and it changes very fast from making you laugh to making you cry.

Go in it blind. its much more enjoyable to experience it cluelessly for yourself. honestly if i could go back in time i wouldn't even watch the trailer.  the fights are touhou-style; meaning crazy shiz is flung at you and you're expected to dodge it using your keyboard (its a controller friendly game but personally I find the keyboard more comfortable) and if you don't dodge your heart will suffer. even if you suck at touhou-style games (like i do) don't let that stop you from journeying through this brilliantly put together game. (Toby fox i salute you).  Also if the 8-bit-ness isn't your thing, thats not a valid excuse dont let tht stop you either its woooorrrthh it.  the one and only flaw for this game is the fact that it has only one save slot. theres a very good reason that theres only one and you only need one for yourself but i can't make my friends play it on a different slot like i usually do. other than that. it's worth whatever you paid and i wish everyone with a sense of humour would play it.",

Fallout 4 be damned, once I fired this up I couldn't stop till I was done.  What I liked about it (aside from the obvious heaps of creativity lovingly dumped all over every aspect of the game) was the way it turned the whole RPG system on it's head with the ACT system and then how it had a consistent story with foreshadowing, hints, and teasers that tied everything in. It also addresses the player being able to Save and reload saves by working this into the game in a fascinating, and at one point terrifying, way.  I'd recommend this game to everyone. It is a must play and should be Game of the Year for 2015.",

            "review_text": "By this time, you have probably heard something about Undertale, due to the massive hype train about it. Whether it is showing up in image macros, youtube videos, or various in-jokes, it is clearly a massive internet sensation. I will do my best to try to cut through the hype and get to the core of the matter.  Undertale is an RPG based on games from the 16-bit era (SNES/Genesis) with elements of bullet dodging games. The mechanics are fairly straightforward - walk around and interact with characters, occasionally getting into turn-based combat. The combat interface features option for attacking the monsters, which uses a timing minigame, running, and using items. The innovation comes in the ability to perform a variety of actions toward monsters. Choosing certain actions will convince the monster that you are friendly, and can end an encounter without you or the monster dieing. This awards you with gold, but does not award XP. When it is the monster's turn, there is a brief dodging minigame. This gets tougher as the game progresses, but the game is not a bullet hell. I've been okay even on my low LV run, despite being pretty bad at bullet dodging.  The graphics of Undertale are mostly 16-bit sprites, and pretty well done. The game looks well put together, but don't 3D graphics or photo realistic designs.   The musical score for this game is one of the best I have heard in an indie game. It's a nice blend of 16-bit retro tunes and a wide variety of musical styles ranging from symphonic to jazz to rock to polka. Sound effects are otherwise fairly basic. Each character has a particular sound effect for their voice, making it possible to recognize them, but there is almost no voice work in the game.  Undertale's hype is built almost entirely on its story. It has a large number of ending variations. Every boss you kill or spare changes the outcome of the game. It is indeed possible to live up to the game's tagline of being the RPG where no one has to die, and that is a very satisfying if challenging outcome. You can also kill every single monster in the game, which is challenging for its own reasons. The game has a message to it, but it is not preachy or really self-righteous about it. The game just treats monsters in random encounters like characters as opposed to being just a source of XP. It also takes into account game mechanics in the story - saving and loading is something that happens in the world of the game.  Characters in Undertale are highly memorable. Toriel and Flowey (both of who show up in the first few moments of the game and are on the cover art) are both very interesting characters with a solid amount of backstory available to explore. Writing is clear and easy to read, and the game's humor is pretty impressive. I have written this with the intent of not spoiling the game, and it is best experienced unspoiled. (I read spoilers beforehand and wish I hadn't)  If this sounds at all interesting to you, I recommend buying Undertale. It is well worth $10 US, the soundtrack is great, and when it is on sale it's a steal.",

Still more will find that not much in the game speaks to them, and many will even seek to silence the fanatics and tarnish the games reputation wherever they can. For a moment however, let's forget about the polarising fanbase, all the hype, all the arguments.  I won't tell you that Undertale will be the best game you've ever played. I won't tell you that Undertale will change your life. I wont' tell you that you will hate Undertale. I won't tell you that Undertale is overrated. I won't tell you how you have to feel about Undertale. In fact,  I won't even tell you that you HAVE to play Undertale.  Instead I'll tell you what Undertale means to me.  To me, Undertale is a fantastic and unique gaming experiance. It is a lesson for me about simple game design and story telling. I love the music and the characters and their stories tug at my heart strings. It's a trip down memory lane and brimming with personal nostalgia thats very close to my heart. The story and gameplay seem unique and new for me, somthing farmiliar and yet different. The battles annoyed me a little after a while and some monsters seemed to easy for me. The boss battles on the other hand excited me and I was always salivating for the next one. I adore pixle art but the graphics were too simpllistic for me. They did however manage to grow on me over time. The story brought me to tears on more than one occasion. In the end I was filled full to the brim with determination and felt a real connection with the game and it's characters, one I have not felt for quite a long time.  I loved Undertale.  I will tell you, if you think the trailer or demo look interesting, that you SHOULD play Undertale. Then once you've made up your mind, good or bad, you can come back and tell everyone what Undertale means to you.",

The game's 'mercy' mechanic is neat but doesn't really change that the gameplay is still very simple.  The only place where this game really shines is in the writing. The characters are charming and witty and the story has all kinds of twists and turns. It may remind you of your favorite cartoons from when you were a kid. If there is a reason to buy Undertale, it is the writing. Everything else in the game is just a vessel for conveying the story, and it shows.  ",

They're goofy and not really written in a 'epic novel' way, but they are very easy to like. + Gameplay is simple to grasp but can be difficult when it needs to be. Some fights will give you some minor trouble in the 'clean' run, whereas the 'genocide' run is notoriously more difficult. It's very reminiscient of games like Earthbound (which is where some inspiration is drawn from, so good for that). + Story is very intriguing and sad, and offers a lot of alternate endings depending on your choices (the absolute good ending, the neutral endings (loads of these), and the genocide endings). All have different meanings to take away from the game. + Addicting soundtrack. + Memes.  Cons: - Despite the good value for the price, it is short. I would have gladly paid 50$ for 5x the amount of things to explore if the experience was just like that. Granted, there are multiple endings to explore and replaying the game changes things around!  - While the ending felt very resolved and I loved it, I wish there was more to do with a certain character we encounter at the end. I also wish there was more interaction with many of the main characters. - Hard mode needs to be fully done! With maybe more story to be had if you redo the pacifist run in hard mode.  Overall:  Great value for the price, and a game that deserves the hype it gets (at least, on tumblr). I'd recommend it for anyone craving a well-crafted, thoughtful, classicaI gaming experience. I also really hope the creator does more with the universe, and tries for bigger projects. I'd love to pay for more.",

You can spair enenmies, fight and kill everyone in site, or pick and choose. You learn about numerous characters, and no enemie and character doesnt have a intersting personality, or trait. The graphics and colors are very appeling, and it reminds me of C64, or NES type graphics.  I dont recomend to watch lets plays of this game, or go online and look at a guide (unless needed). Experience and explore this game by yourself, or ask freinds like i did. (thanks guys :3).  And finally, the music. OH THE MUSIC. This game has some of the best music in ANY game ive evr seen. All the tunes are catchy as cr@p, and they all sound really good, if you dont play them to death. I highly recomend to get the sound track (or the game soundtrack bundle, if u dont have it already) . If i wasnt so broke, i would get it XD.   i hope this review helped you. Check out this game, or my profile -Nicolas :3   ",

            "review_text": "If you want to know what I like about this game, read basically any other positive review, because they're all correct. Undertale is a very good game. Contender for game of the year, strong contender for indie game of the year. However, just like everything else in the world, it isn't flawless. These problems are all pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, but they should nevertheless be mentioned for the sake of completeness. Like I said, if you want to read what's good about it, there are literally thousands of other positive reviews you can read that'll mirror my views. I'm going to focus on the problems. (No spoilers)     High difficulty spikes for some boss battles.  Some fights are drastically more difficult than the preceeding area, to an often jarring degree. Make no mistake - even though it may not look like it, the game actually provides gameplay challenges. If you want to recommend Undertale to someone who doesn't usually play video games, keep this in mind.     Unpolished from a technical standpoint.  You can't enter the option's menu after loading your save - which you wouldn't want to do anyway, because there's literally nothing aside from 'Joystick Config'. Volume options, keyboard controls and resolution options are nowhere to be found. When playing in fullscreen (toggled by F4), there's some sort of invisible diagonal line that offsets the screen by about one pixel - it's not noticeable unless you sit close to your monitor, but it's there. Furthermore, the game crashes when you try to quit from fullscreen. Obviously it doesn't matter if you wanted to close the program anyway, but it's still mildly annoying. Finally, it runs at 30 FPS, which is honestly works perfectly fine, but the bullet hell sections would still benefit from a higher framerate.     Technically, there is player choice, but most people will have a nearly identical first playthrough anyway.  This is my most abstract criticism, because not only is it necessarily a bad thing, it's not even the game's fault. Let's face it, why  wouldn't  you do a pacifist playthrough your first time around? Undertale advertises its ability to negotiate yourself out of combat as a unique feature - and it is... which is why almost everyone's first playthrough is going to look almost the same. When given a choice between 'do what you do in every other video game ever' and 'do something new', it's not really much of a choice. If being merciful was a more common feature in games, you'd have more people doing a 50/50 playthrough or 'kill everyone' playthrough. But as it stands, since the words 'Killing is unnecessary' are the game's main selling point, it's clear that the vast majority of people will want to take that as far as possible.     EDIT: I don't like something about one of the endings,  I'm not going to go into details in order to avoid spoilers, I just wanted to point out that there is something I see as a blemish in the narrative. Most people don't seem to share my opinion though, so whatever.   If for some reason you think I hate the game, let me quote myself. ' Contender for game of the year, strong contender for indie game of the year. ' I'm just pointing out these flaws, because I haven't really seen anyone else do it. If you want to know why it's a good game, read literally any other review, or - better yet - play the game for yourself. The less you know going in, the better.",

The storyline, if you ask me and plenty of other people, is well done. The characters are very memorable, have some interesting and  (At least somewhat)  unique personalities. Undertale was the first time in, well, ever that I found myself delighted when I saw Papyrus and Comic Sans in use. It was interesting to see how simple text, with barely any voices at all, can convey so much emotion. There were times that the game had me laughing quite a bit. And admitingly, on the other hand, Undertale was the first time that a videogame had me close to tears with emotion; but to be honest, I don't think that's a bad thing – it just shows how powerful of a game it can be.  The soundtrack worked perfectly with the game, as well. Helped to make the game much better, in my opinion. It's understandable if pixel art isn't your thing, but Undertale seems to pull it off well. It really does feel like some honest effort was put into making it look great.  Throughout playing the game, I have been desperately searching for flaws that the game may have. The puzzels are a bit of a challenge on the first try, but not too hard. They'll have you confused for maybe a minute, but they're by all means do-able. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is debatable. There's also the community. It shines in some spots, but in others, it's ... questionable. Personally though, I don't tend to keep a community in mind for rating a game; most of the time, how the community/fandom acts is not the direct result of creator intervention.  Games like Undertale are hard to come by.  REALLY  hard. It's rare that you find games such as this that shine, stand out from the rest, and are nearly perfect. The only flaws I find in Undertale are ones that, if you ask me, have little to no effect in the end.  Undertale is a full on 10/10. It's only like, ten bucks man. You're only doing yourself a favor by buying it.",

[Characters] Characters are easy to understand and can fit into basic descriptions Frisk - The deaf kid who is always nice Chara - The girl who never blinks and has a bloody knife Toriel - The old woman who always is nice to children Flowey - Similar to Chara but does blink and has no knife I think you get it. [Story] Very simple Once upon a time,two races lived over the earth Wazowskies(Monsters) and Doras (Humans) Then there was a war and this guy used a spell and was like YOU SHALL NOT PASSSSSSSS Monsters want revenge against humans blah blah blah [Overall Gameplay] With four buttons FIGHT ACT ITEM MERCY it is similar to most RPG games but instead is more of FIGHT SPECIAL ITEM FLEE,making Undertale's system a bit different. Most people know that ACTING leads to MERCY. Now UNDERTALE is one of the few RPG games where you don't have to kill. Other RPG games that don't involve killing are 1. From Gamejolt and only involve exploring 2. Some idiot's work into trying to be better than this game. Or 3. Simply unexplainable. [Conclusion] Most people like this game but I understand some people may not like it for certain reasons and I accept that. I am not one of those petty morons that hate on people that hate this game. I actually hate people who hate people that hate this game (Bububleh that's alot of hate and people) since they are 1. Children under the age of 13 2. A mega-fan of Undertale or 3. Once again,Simply unexplainable. Another note,the fandom's horrible section of yucky R34 (Although like 5% is okay with me) which would require more bleach than the amount of fluid the Pacific Ocean can hold to clean all of that stuff up. In the end,Undertlae is just another form of FNAF,which also has decent characters,story and gameplay along with the fandom section of yucky R34 (Which 5% is also okay with me) but the creator became a money ♥♥♥♥♥ and made 4 sequels the last one killing the game's populartiy.

Yet throughout all of the games I played on all of those platforms, none of them I repeat NONE OF THEM! Have ever been as close as Undertale. This game is more than just a work of art. It's the masterpiece that has and always survives the test of time. The primitive pixel graphics seems to add to the charm the game possesses. Undertale is the Mona Lisa of the entire Steam Library. It has memorable characters, a deep storyline and an amazing soundtrack. This is a work of art unlike any other. I HIGHLY recommend Undertale to everyone on Steam.",

            "review_text": "I'll separate this by categories, Gameplay, Graphics, Story, Music. and Final Thoughts Gameplay - 8   It's good and its solid. Nothing super crazy. The gameplay does not make you want to come back to it more so than the story and adventure you go through. Although still a unique well thought of mechanic and it was executed nicely.  Graphics - 8  I feel this is the highest I can rate it since it is very old school looking and not the most impressive for old school looking games but the art direction is superb despite the old look. It looks more so 8 bit than 16 bit and even over that looks more like an old DOS-pc game over a console game. I can't just give a 9-10 here but the more you play it you realize just how creative they were. A nice thing they do is make it gradually more pretty as you play through it. It starts off very bleak and slowly becomes more pretty as it plays out. They use design to amplify the mood of story brilliantly.  Story - 9.5-10 This game is very surprising here. What starts very simple gradually like the graphics reveals it capable of more and more. You begin to think they can only tell the story in one direction and feels like its very simple and linear. Then it throw some REALLY crazy ♥♥♥♥ to throw you off. There is shockers, there is twists, and there is moments I really gasped like watching GOT. Also worth mentioning is the humor of this game. It's absolutely hilarious. One of the funniest games I ever played. But over its humor is it's emotion you really care for these characters in the end and most of them are very love-able. And the gameplay ties into the story perfectly. How you play the game is the message of the game.    This story IS TOP NOTCH.    Music - 10  I am so capable of writing a thousand page essay here so I'll keep this short. The sound track is up there with the works of Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda. I know that's a bold claim but that is how well this music is sticking in my head. I can only compare it to the work of these guys because they are the only ones I think that it would be fair to compare Toby Fox with and that is 'The Best'.   Except neither of them wrote the game as well.  Overall thoughts  Game of the Year doesn't do this title justice. Because games I love this much haven't come out in close to 20 years now.    I know many people think that child hood impressions of games are grossly exaggerated and never on the level they are said to be because the age the material was absorbed. Even I thought maybe I was guilty of this.  Only until you play something that feels just as good. Playing Undertale proved to me that this is not the case. All the bits of wonder I received playing games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, in my younger years came alive in me while playing Undertale. That sense of childhood wonder was burning bright as ever. It proved to me that a game can STILL be as amazing as those titles if done correctly and because of that I'm filled with new optimism for gaming in the future.  Toby Fox's Determination has filled me with Inspiration.",

The characters are very easy to get attached to (I really reccomend doing the true pacifist run first for the best experience) The boss fights can be challenging (especially in genocide) but GOSH DARN is it so rewarding to mercy them..... or to brutally murder them. The scenery really does make it up for the graphics, and the sprites look well made!  Over all, I think Toby Fox spent his $50,000 well into this amazing game!

The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict is about Nicholas Benedict who is an orphan with narcolepsy going to a new orphanage and trying to find a hidden treasure that he finds out about early in the book. Nicholas is not able to look for the treasure in the morning so he finds a way to get out of his room at night, which is locked at night because he has horrible nightmares and would scare the other children, by getting a wax mold of a skeleton key that the orphanage operator has. Nicholas also meets a friend whose name is John. Nicholas loves to read and while he is reading a book about astronomy, he comes across a note that says “Consult the Butler” and the book that was next to the book he was reading was written by Brian T. Butler, and inside the book are receipts to very expensive telescopes, which Nicholas thinks is the treasure. Nicholas is also very smart and realizes that the telescopes must have been placed in an observatory, and he sneaks outside during one of the nights and finds an overgrown pathway that he follows up a hill to the observatory. Nicholas goes inside to find the treasure but when he checks inside the observatory there’s a spot for a massive telescope but the telescope had been removed by someone. After Nicholas leaves the Observatory and is going to go back to the orphanage disappointed, he sees another overgrown pathway that after following it leads to a farm. Nicholas leaves and the next day he gets his friend John to sneak out and they go to the observatory together after Nicholas shows John the hidden passage, and they follow it to the farm. Once they get there they see a girl sitting on the edge of the cliff. Nicholas and John panic and try to get the girls attention, but she can’t hear them. After a while she realizes that she is being watched and turns around and looks frightened, and almost backs off of the cliff, Nicholas and John leave so that the girl is frightened and accidently falls off the cliff. The next day John and Nicholas go back to the observatory and think where the treasure would be in the observatory when Nicholas here’s someone in the forest coming to the observatory (which they started calling the Giant’s Head). At first Nicholas thinks it Mr. Collum, the orphanage director, but when they look to the door they see that it is the girl who was sitting on the cliff. Nicholas and John scream, and Nicholas faints. The next day the girl comes to the observatory and Nicholas starts talking to her in sign language. John asks how Nicholas knew how she was deaf and Nicholas explains how he realized that it took her a while to realize people were behind her when she was on the cliff, and when she scared them in the Giant’s Head and she didn’t flinch when they screamed. Nicholas and John talk to the girl all night and she explains that her name is Violet and that lives on the farm next to the cliff. A few days later- WAIT THIS IS UNDERTALE!!!

When I dove into this game, it was extremely unique and stupid. But it is type of stupid that makes you smile from ear to ear and think to yourself 'What the ♥♥♥♥ am I playing??' and it so very unique from other RPGs I've both seen and played. The soundtrack is memorable (personal favorite is Sans' Theme when you first run into him), the characters are well developed and their sprites are very well designed as well. The Bosses you face can be tough if you are not good at these times of games (I know I am not) but they are beatable after you know their patterns of attack. In my opinion, my favorite boss to hate would be, without a single doubt: Flowey. He is such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you want to kick his ♥♥♥. And you can kick his ♥♥♥, but doing so is easier said then done.

Pros: -epic music -great characterization -choices do matter (if that's your kind of thing) -ability to choose the option to not kill everything in sight -retro graphics style with bullet hell mechanics -spaghetti  Cons: -you will develop feelings for pixels -the humor isn't necessarily for everyone -you don't have to kill everything in sight -the fight system takes a little while to get used to -you might have a bad time  overall, 10/10 would cry again.",

This probably shouldn't come as a surprise though since it takes much of it's gameplay influence from the Bullet Hell genre. You could say this game has popularized the genre since Bullet Hell I consider to be a pretty niche genre.  The highlight of the game for me was the Mettaton segment, I found that entire area very fun.  This game offers a fun unique story, great gameplay, and the fact that it is replayable is an understatement.   I was impressed with how well your actions take real effective concequences in this game, something done so well I think Bethesda should really be envious.   When I first started this game, I was frustrated by how the game encouraged the pacifist approach, feeling that it was the game that would not let me play it. But as I got further into the game, I realized that the real heart of the gameplay is the passive approach. Figuring out characters holds a lot more depth than just mindlessly attacking them, and that's the beauty of this game! It truly is.   Unfortunately, I feel this game lacks in proper level design. Your sent on a linear quest through a shallow (but beautiful) world experiencing jokes disguised as puzzles. One of this game's biggest flaws is how it sometimes tries too hard to be funny that it kind of dominates the experience overall.  Either way, this was a great experience and I'm glad to have beaten this. One of these days I'm certain to try the other two routes this game offers if anything just to experience the extra bosses and content.  This game deserves a sequel, but I'd say it would probably be difficult to make story wise. But who knows what the creator might come up with. He's certainly very creative.",

After not having internet for a week I decided to go back to Undertale because I was bored. This was the best decision I've made this summer. Undertale is one of my new favourite games because of it's humour, art style, and storyline.    If you're the kind of guy (or girl) who likes dumb AND witty humour everything in this game will make you smile. There are jokes where it flat out tells you what's funny and then there are jokes that you have to really look closely at to understand. There are even jokes stretched out across different story branches but I won't spoil them for you!   The art style is kind of hard to pin point exactly, some scenes remind me of an old DOS game but others are just plain SNES or NES style pixel art. It's a really pleasing game to look at. From the detailed battle sprites to the scenery and landscapes nothing goes un-noticed, for the exception of small items in the world like in the Junkyard. Never the less it's all well done, big or small.    Next up I'm going to talk about the storylines, there are 3 main plot lines in Undertale. The most popular being the Pacifist Route in which you spare every creature you encounter, I did this route first and you should too as it really ties together the story in a feel good way. Next is the Genocide Route where you do the exact opposite of the Pacifist Route, KILL EVERYTHING. When I say everything I mean EVERYTHING, every single damn monster you encounter? Kill it. This route isn't for the faint of heart and if you've grown attached to the characters in the story, well then prepare your ♥♥♥♥ for a bumpy un-lubed anal ♥♥♥♥ of emotions and feelings. Also the Genocide Route has the hardest boss fights ever so ♥♥♥♥ that. Last but not least is the Neutral Route. In this route you can really do whatever you want, there aren't a lot of rules. Want to kill a particular character you don't like? Go ahead, you're not evil but you aren't great either. Mercy and Fight can be used equally in this route and will give you an appropriate ending depending on who you have killed/spared and who you haven't. For any new players the Neutral Ending will be the first ending you get in Undertale on your first playthrough no matter what, doesn't matter if you kill everything or spare everything you're going to get a neutral ending.    Obviously the story is the biggest part to this game as evident by my significantly larger paragraph than the others I wrote. But that's just because there's more to talk about and more to describe in that catagory. This game is really well done and is obvious why it gained such a cult following so fast.   (TL;DR The art is good. The humour is good. The story is good. Go play it. Also it has a good soundtrack. Again go play it.)",

And the dev even made sure that if you're stuck on some boss fight or another that you don't have to sit through the same dialogue for each character. It'll just jump you right back into it.  -The ability to play through the game completely passively is a nice addition to an RPG, and allowed for great new ways to deal with encounters and bosses.  -The soundtrack seems to be perfectly attuned to each little instance you're in, helping the encounters and situations be all the more memorable and engaging.   I could continue listing the things I personally loved about this game, but the short of it is; it's worth the price.

This soundtrack is very well done and notoriously catchy at times - I'm very partial to 'Mad Dummy'.  As for the game itself, as others have mentioned, if you haven't played this game and know little to nothing about it, just pick it up and play it. Reading walkthroughs or reviews will very likely ruin a good portion of the story for you and that would be a waste. Most of the characters are at the very least unique or funny and at most relatable or sympathetic, and the story paces itself well - you get pieces of the story through character interaction.  The game is an RPG/dungeon crawler with slight puzzle elements, and the interesting bit is that you do not have to kill anyone, but you can if you want; it's your choice. Gameplay is similar to olderThere is a slight learning curve to gameplay, but almost anyone can pick it up and understand what needs to be done. It is fairly linear, but I believe this was intentionally done as to keep the overall story unknown until the climax.  The art style is reminiscent of older RPGs utilizing sprite art and basic color pallette and really pulls at the nostalgia strings. It also lends to the humor and drama of the characters and story without overwhelming you with stylistic tropes.  Overall, I loved this game, and the soundtrack is a great addition to those that enjoy chiptunes/8-bit style music.",

My first introduction was via my friend who happened to be stuck on the final boss in a non-pacifist run, and had me and two other friends try to beat it for her. Suffice it to say, I saw hell and was unsure if I wanted to visit everything that came before. I'm incredibly glad I did. As you play, the backstory is slowly fleshed out, and you meet many....interesting characters along the way to say the least. Each has their own personality and redeeming qualities when you get to know them. Even in a world where everyone wants you dead, you can still make friends apparently. You also have the choice to go the opposite route, and cut a bloody path through the underground if you so wish. How you play is entirely up to you, but remember that even the smallest action can have echoes later on. From a technical stand point, the game is what it appears on the surface for the most part: an 8bit adventure with chiptune music. There's a distinct lack of glitches that is a breath of fresh air with the state of many games at launch these days. There are some various interesting choices in the technical realm used later on if your run is more neutral to genocidal. It had me somewhat confused at first, but it definitely made the experience with that final boss something to remember. No spoilers, but yes, it is supposed to do that, and you are supposed to reload it at times. It's not your computer. Overall, I really enjoyed my first run through of this game and look forward to a few more playthroughs in the future. Undertale is a charming 8bit adventure with a wonderful soundtrack that you will have stuck in your head long after you close the game. I highly recommend it to anyone who may be on the fence about it or anyone who wants a different sort of diversion in their gaming experience. Also, you can date a skeleton, and I did it because I could. I have no other explanation for doing that.",

I felt my progression with every enemy I spared. A sense of accomplishment trailed me while playing this game. The gameplay was excellent, in addition to the story, characters, setting, lore, humor, and the SOUNDTRACK. When playing, you really feel the determination mentioned with each save point. But as fun as this game is, it does delve into a rather horrific storyline. I wouldn't recommened it for the meek. I'm about to face the final boss, who I've seen online, and I think that's where it starts dissolving from clever humor into disturbing horror. The game also has some parts where the fourth wall is broken; not as a joke, but as the in-game characters questioning their exsistence and remembering past save files even if you hit reset.

The writing is funny - genuinely funny, the humor got me from beginning to end - and heartwarming and heartwrenching in equal measure at points. You WILL develop a fondness for every character, even ones you wouldn't expect to ever care about. You may think you have the nature of the story all figured out only to be thrown for loop after loop on this emotional rollercoaster, yet the reveals never feel manipulative or ham-fisted. I definitely cried some real tears on a few occasions. Just, a good and pure-hearted game.  The gameplay is extremely creative rewarding, and challenging without being outright impossible, even to someone with little to no experience with shmups, and the minor puzzle aspect to figuring out how to SPARE enemies was definitely something I enjoyed. And finally, the game looks and sounds incredible. While this game has multiple endings and several ways to play, for a great deal of replayability, here's a statement that'll only make sense to people who've beat the game; I'm satisfied to have beaten this game once, and never fire it up again. It was a wonderful experience and they've earned keeping their happy ending.",

Most battles can be fought using the 'Act' command while others take some thinking about how to approach it based on checking out the opponent and reading the clues in between turns.  Check it out.

That, already, should give you a good idea of my thoughts on this game. Undertale is simply an absolutely fantastic game that I feel should be in every gamer's library.  Yes, it's on the short side, but that's honestly a good thing with this game. There are so many secrets to look for between the 3 routes (Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide [also known as a No Mercy run]), some of which are exclusive to certain routes, that it would be annoying if the game was too much longer than it already is. Seriously, it's honestly one of my favorite parts of this game, some of these secrets are just astounding.  Perhaps my favorite thing about this game is not the charming characters, the humorous dialogue, the memorable boss battles, the amazing soundtrack, no... It's probably how the game makes you feel bad about killing monsters. Remaining as spoiler free as I can, when monsters get low on health, they lose the will to battle you, and they'll hope that you'll give them mercy. After all, they don't wanna die. Heck, if you keep killing them, the encounter rate will actually go down, to symbolize their fear of you.  Killing bosses (and certain, non boss enemies) has a more noticeable effect on things, since they'll no longer be in the game. You won't be able to participate in certain side quests, you'll miss out on humorous dialogue, and, worse of all, you'll be locked out of the Pacifist ending.  BUT, having said all of that, doing a Genocide run of Undertale is honestly something that I recommend everyone do. It'll break your heart, killing all of your friends, and you'll most certainly have a bad time, but it's also absolutely astounding what changes when you do a Genocide run, and will give you a whole other level of appreciation for this game.  But even if you don't do a Genocide run, just the Pacifist and Neutral routes already do such a great job at providing an amazing gaming experience that just those two routes alone are definitely worth $10. As I said, they provide an absolutely amazing experience that everyone should most definitely take part in. Screenshots don't do this game justice, you have to play it before passing judgment.",

Do you already have the game? Buy it for a friend! Share the love!  Though, try to stay away from the super obnoxious fans when you play the game - their love can get a bit messy and interfere with your enjoyment.  My only complaints: - the random encounters could stand to have more variety - after you've fought an enemy say about three times, there's really nothing different. Then again, running away is pretty easy too. - There are odd 'lulls' in activity and greatness in this game. But when it picks up again, it usually makes up for the lull. These mostly occur in the middle of the game.  Who this is not for: If you play games just to seek a challenge or competition and really don't care much for story or immersive experiences, this game may not live up to the hype.",

So a couple weeks ago I went over to a friends house and he was playing a 8-bit stylish game that looked like ♥♥♥♥, He told me that it was called 'Undertale' and I was like 'well ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie games amirite' but no... I was very wrong. I did some research that literally said stop researching and play it for yourself. I bought the game and booted it up it took a while on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop but once I saw the screen I was like 'dafaq.. no full screen?' (f4 to fullscreen btw) Now this game is very nostalgic and will take you back to Earthbound and Persona as they feel alike but Undertale is such a unique and refining experience to be had... and it's all in the comfort of your own home. I have literally speed ran this game twice in 8 hours and I can't say I found many secrets but jesus... some of these nods to other series had my cracking up and some had me crying. I was very satisfied with my experience no matter how long it was and I will keep replaying it until I find every secret and every ending... This game is a personal experience and every person will experience it a different way and this is why I beg you to give this game a try, You will not be disappointed  EDIT: I have now went down all paths and my opinion on this game stands, the tiniest details will change depending what you do, so make sure you check every nook and crany",

Also within this run, you'll find that the fun aspects of the game are mostly gone and the difficulty spikes greatly between two bosses. Despite this though, I suggest after completing your pacifist run that you play or watch someone do this run.  General: This game isn't as godly as some fans will say, but more or less of a 'polished gem'. I myself feel that this game is a close masterpiece that should be cherished in the gaming industry, but not to the point that some fans make. This game masterfully creates it's tone, and provides very satisfying content for the $10 it costs. The audience that will enjoy this game will not be the general one, but if you have a piqued interest in the game, try out the demo and if you need a further look JUST watch the beginning of Snowdin. This will give you a good enough analysis if you'll like the game or not, and if you are still interested STOP WATCHING and play it quickly.  My Rating: 9/10 (Masterful, but with some present flaws) Realistic Rating: 8.25/10 (Great, but with quite a few noticeable flaws present in parts of the game)",

After buying it for my friend since they wanted it, they shared their library with me so I could try it out. My mind about the game has change a little bit. The visuals still look weird, poorly done and a little out of place. The music however is the best part of this game. That would make sense since the developer makes music and is known for that.  The story can be cliché and can try too hard at some points, but the multiple endings and clever design of the many paths you can take can make up for it. Little details and dialogue change depending on your previous playthrough. It's a nice touch and that would have taken a long time to code. The game can force you to like it's characters for their constant humor and annoyance. It works on alot of people, but I mostly just skipped alot of the dialogue because I wanted to just move on.  The gameplay isn't unique within itself, but it has never been done in an RPG before. People compare it to 'Gunhell' and it's fun to try and dodge the projectiles to avoid taking damage. The heart you control can also change colour which changes the whole mechanic which is a good thing.  The concept of 'not killing enemies' isn't entirely new. (Earthbound had your enemies turn to normal, become tame etc. You never killed anyone.) But what hasn't been done was that this was one of the main factors of the game.  This game can appeal to alot of people with it's story and simple easy-to-learn gameplay, but it just didn't do it for me. Mostly because of the art and story. It was a fun and short experience and people say it has good replayability but I don't think I'll play it again.  Overall, play it if you wish.  7/10",

This game had so much buzz online that I was immediately resistant to trying it, out of a weird defiance, so when I did start playing this game, it was with preconceived expectations that I wouldn't like it and that it would not live up to the hype.  I was wrong.  This game slowly and completely immersed me in its little world. The music is simple yet brilliant. The characters are vividly imagined and their dialouge is cleverly written.  You aren't told too many rules explicitly, you learn how to play as you go along. When you equip different weapons, for example, you don't realize how to fight with them until you get into your next encounter. I found this interesting and engaging, and for that reason, it made me want to try out a variety of weapons rather than sticking with the first thing I equipped.   As for the story itself - you make many choices as you go along, and they do impact how the plot develops. You feel the consequences of some choices you make, and you sometimes feel like you are the villain in the game after all. The monsters become more human by the minute, and you feel like your 'human' character is not much different from them.  I will not lie, I felt increasing regret for killing a specific character in a boss fight. As I kept playing and learned that there are various ways to lead encounters so that you can Spare monsters (and as such, don't have to kill them), I ended up resetting the game so I could start all over again and spare that character.   Normally, video games have bosses that you are supposed to defeat and they are set up so that they are clearly a villain and obstacle that you, as the hero, need to get rid of. In this game, the 'boss fights' are monsters just doing their jobs, leading their lives, and often times have nobler motivations than you as the main character.   This leads to surprising levels of introspection and thoughtfulness, and at least for me, formed a desire to replay the game from the start to try to do things differently a second time around.",

Nope, the gameplay is fantastic with the fight scenes either being heart wrenching or very funny and some of the later boss battles… especially sans they are so hard, but they don’t make rage quit at all, it was still fun even when hitting triple digits of death, it’s a game where it doesn’t have stupidly hard difficulty (like I wanna be the guy) but it’s not too easy either! The game does hold your hand (literally toriel does) at the start but that’s just the tutoriel after that it really doesn’t, it’s a game where if you die it is your fault, it doesn’t lag, it’s not randomized, it is all your fault, you did it wrong but it’s still fun even if you die thousands of times, and the music! The music is also amazing, the person who composed the music knows what he is doing, it’s not just a generic dull boring music it’s an exciting, fun, nice music and it is just really the great! The only cons are that the puzzles aren’t the best; they are a bit generic, but still… kind of fun, so in conclusion undertale is a fantastic game with fantastic humour great characters , an amazing story with amazing music but mediocre puzzles 9.9/10",

Luckily, I got to play it having only a few minor elements spoiled. A fresh run for all intents and purposes, which is the most recommended way to go in to it. After playing it myself, I also give that advice.   Many reviewers have differing opinions of what constitutes spoilers, so even spoiler free reviews may ruin small bits of the game. Tread carefully when reading other people's opinions on the game. I'll do my best not to include anything specific here.  On to the game:   Undertale is a 8 to 9 hour 8-bit story-driven rpg where your decisions in the story affect how the entire game plays out. Each decision you make changes how the other characters respond to your presence. This mechanic makes combat more meaningful in a genre where most fights are treated only as a means to grow stronger.   |-The Battle System-|   The battle system in Undertale is most similar to the Earthbound series. All the fighting takes place in turn-based combat from the perspective of the player character.  There are two twists to the formula.  1.) Enemy attacks are a form of top-down arcade shooter. Your ability to survive depends on how well you can dodge their unique patterns.  2.) Arguably the most important aspect of the game: You can attempt to spare every enemy you encounter.  Killing the monsters is usually quicker and easier than sparing them. On top of that, sparing monsters does not award the player with experience. With this in mind, the player needs to decide whether or not it is worth the trouble to leave each hostile enemy they meet alive.   |-The Story-|   The biggest reason most people try Undertale. Someone recommends the game and, more than likely, it is the first thing they'll talk about when trying to convince you.  Bottom line?  It's good. Not great, but good. It has a couple interesting twists here and there, but for the most part it follows a predictable path. Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but don't go in expecting a new classic of storytelling. If I get specific on the why it'll tread into spoiler territory, so let's move on to what I believe is the strongest part of the game.   |-The Characters-|   Undertale has a boatload of funny and endearing characters. Even the random battle enemies have unique personalities and interactions. Outside of the various areas you visit, they help to fill in the world and make it believable. In many rpgs random npcs mostly just have throwaway lines that don't have any impact on you at all. In Undertale they almost always have another joke to tell, or something that adds a little more to the overall story. It's definitely something I wish more games would do.  That's without starting on the main cast. In order to avoid spoilers I will say that for as much care and effort that went into the random npcs, much more was put into the named characters you encounter. Every one feels like they are necessary to the story, and none of them feel like they were tacked on just for the sake of it. Some of their interactions, on the other hand...   |-The Writing-|   For the most part, Undertale is well written. I wouldn't say it's a pinnacle of writing, but it does its job. It is servicable throughout, and there are only one or two times where it takes you out of the experience. Usually, this happens when the game is attempting to convey sadness, desperation, or sentimentality. It goes from heartfelt to hokey real quick. Some of those moments are well done, however.  The jokes are Undertale's strength. There are so many so frequently that I wonder if they started out with the idea that they were going to make a game with a ton of puns and awkward humor, and then try to fill in a story around the jokes. Most are well done but, as to be expected with so many attempts, some fall flat.   |-The Music-|   The music is great. If the characters are the strongest part of the game, the music is a close second. Like the characters, each piece of music makes each different area, situation, and boss fight feel all the more unique. From the monsters to the places they accompany. The retro-style of the music goes hand-in-hand with the visual style to create a cohesive world.   |-Overall-|   I played Undertale having only heard that it was good, and I tried it with relatively neutral expectations. In the time since, I have seen many people laud it as the game of the year (or all time, even). With that in mind, is Undertale as good as many people claim it to be?  In my opinion: No.  Undertale is good. It is worth playing. It is of a quality I wish every indie game would be. But it's not perfect, and its flaws were apparent to me as I played through it.  For many people, Undertale is the first game that they've played of this quality. The first game that gave them meaningful impact for the decisions they made. For them, it is the game of the year, maybe even the best game they've ever come across. It is none of these things for me, but that is not something I can hold against them.  All in all, Undertale is a game I am glad I played, regardless of its shortcomings.   8/10",

Here are my experiences ok?  GOOD NEUTRAL I was going to mke true pacifist but i didnt know how to date alphys so i got this ending oh and remember omega flowey? well... HES NOT HARD IF YOU 'REMAIN CALM AND STAY DETERMINED' that's exactly how i beated him.  PACIFIST Alright my favorite ending so far this one after looking how to date alphys up i did al the dates and yes ASRIEL DREUMRR come on ha he is kinda hard but i managed to win and i saw how he breaks the barrier (You need 7 human souls to destroy it so asriel uses 6 no he actually uses 7 'cause all the monsters together make a human soul explaining all)i was so happy that i didnt want to restart my time after flowey told me dont do it, oh and asriel just scared me i thought he was going to make me fight him again but it was just the special THANKS you toby for not making me fight him so this is it for this run.  NEUTRAL i haven't done neutral yet   Good neutral Omega flowey... again??? im bored  No mercy i only killed what came from me anything mettaton ex to everyone that attacked me  but i generally didnt seek out monsters... i was sad to see muffets/undyne/papyrus/asgore deaths they were horrible but thats what i get for being a disobedient child right?  GENOCIDE haven't commit genocide yet(maybe soon enough i dont know if you reply genocide then ill do it (only until sans no true genocide pls no true genocide i dont want a true genocide but an almost full one is fine).  False genocide:the only choice if i ever do a genocide.  So in a few words This is such an awesome experience 10/10 no joking",

On the positive side, I personally found the gameplay interesting, and the overall presentation a delight to experience. If anyone is on the fence about getting this game, I will say this. There is a demo of the game that can be downloaded on its website. What the demo does is showcase the opening moments of the game. If you feel that after the demo the game is lacking, all I will say is the the game gradually evolves as it goes on. However the basis of the game can be found in the demo. I was personally hooked by the demo, and found the rest of the game to exceed my expectations. Though, that is the key word with this game, expectations. What I would recommend is to play the game with no expectations at all, and if you're on the fence on spending your precious ten dollars on this game, then play the demo to make sure it's for you.

The storyline is complicated and confusing at the same time, but only in the best ways. It leaves the rest up to the player, and you get so attached to each and every character you encounter. I honestly didn't think it would be that great, but I can safely say that I have a new favorite game.",

            "review_text": "[SUPER SUBJECTIVE, PERSONAL REVIEW ALERT] I know people are looking for objective reasons to why games are good or not, and i couldn't fulfill that need, thus, this banner.  It's really hard to find the right words to describe this game. A big part of why this is my favorite game now, is personal. I always liked retro games, partly because i didn't have a choice. I didn't and don't have the best pc available... Far from it in fact, most of my computers couldn't even run the newest games on the lowest settings. But besides personal biases, this game is masterfully crafted, and the attention to detail is truly astonishing. The story is a great meta-commentary on RPGs and gaming in general, messing with the players head in a number of ways. But it doesn't devolve into a joke and memfest of 4th wall breaking, the game has it's humor, wich i again found really good, and laughed my ♥♥♥ off multiple times, but it got a broad range of emotions out of me, from tear-shattering laughter, to the edge of crying. It builds a cast ofreally strong and interesting, diverse characters, who you (or at least i) couldn't help, but get closely attached. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack... I listen to it on a daily baisis for almost 2 weeks now. You may have noticed, that i haven't touched on the story. That's because (as many have stated before me) saying even a word about the story. would spoil part of the experience, you have to experience it yourself. I don't know how did i avoid being spoiled, or even hearing about the game for months after release, but even if you are spoiled, it's worth it for the ride. This review turned out much more personal, than i originally wanted it to be, but i couldn't stop myself, this game touched me like no game has ever have. After each playtrough i looked at a completely different perspective at the characters, and the world. There are no more words for my amazement for Toby Fox's masterpiece, just these words: Please, do yourself a favor, and play this game.",

            "review_text": "I have a lot of mixed emotions about a story like Undertale.  I feel that it is in for the best interest of everyone to read this to play the game to know what I mean when I say it recaptures a kind of magic that can only be felt very scarcely. For some people, like myself, it's that haunting, beautiful wonder of gravity in a game where you decide the world and its' fate through patient battles of decision.  I have played a lot of JRPGs and western games and everything under the sun and I will admit something to you dear reader, this game did for me what Earthbound didn't. That must seem so strange, but we must come to understand something you and I; Earthbound and Undertale are not the same game.  They are similar. They are beautiful and they carry a small piece of history with them. Undertale will carry history, I think as the second coming of what we can hope for in games. With more and more titles like Earthbound &amp; LISA starting to pop up, it feels like a great digital thaw might be cracking where we can see the gooey heart in a world of generic brown landscapes, open sand boxes that go nowhere, characters that you could or couldn't really care about &amp; mindlessly doing something for as little as an ever-increasing Score. I like this feeling. I like the sincerity of it.  But I warn you of this, reader, DO not do it. And I'm sure you know what I'm talking about if you've played the game but if you don't? Do not go the other way. You will be warned, you will be bothered and maybe you'll care. Maybe you'll care. But the reality is, is that Undertale, is a world unto itself much like all other stories. I can't stop you, the only person that can Stop You, is Yourself. A part of me wants to explain how much I wish for you to understand the... Innocence of a world like this. But if you chose not, you'll come to, not necessarily a mind blowing revelation, but one of some profound impact.   You'll definitely be in for a less than pleasurable experience. Some might call it a bad time, I call it an option for development.  I played the game to the fullest capacity and went straight pacifist, I'm not a monster in the land of Monsters. But maybe you are, maybe you desire the taste for blood in the water like an 8 bit shark, in an ever-shrinking pool of soft-hearted chum. In which case, by all means. Enjoy. But remember, the leftovers are far less than satisfying.  With all that out of the way, let's talk about the game itself then.  Music? Music is great for the kind of game it is. It's upbeat, powerful and I remember humming Undyne's theme the most to myself. I haven't doen that since Digimon World on the Playstation 1. The music is really good and it feels authentic to both the atmosphere and story. Including the Tem Village.  10/10, no faults to be found.  The Story? The Story is You, are a child who has fallen into the depths of an ancient mountain said to house the monsters that once lost the war a great long time ago. You are now exploring their world, a visitor unrecognized by many because the monsters have all mostly forgotten what humans actually look like. I will not spoil anything for you under any circumstance, but I'd advise Caution in everything you do. Also, peace is, with 100% certainty, a valid choice.  8/10, I'd like to have seen just a bit more of the human world and what it was like but we'll get to see more in the future, hopefully.  Gameplay? The Gameplay in Undertale is that you are presented with a semi-linear JRPG style navigation with a menu that allows you to FIGHT, ACT, use an ITEM and to have MERCY for your foes or yourself. Using a proper combination of items given a certain number of fights, you can actually make boss fights much easier. You can choose to fight and fight and fight your way through, seeking to return to the warmth of the surface, or you can try and talk to anyone willing to do so. And those that aren't as willing to do so. 10/10, can't find any faults in it. Does the job adequately.  Pro Tip: You can't sell anything until you get to Tem Village, and certain items cannot be bought or found again. Be smart.  Characters? Ah, what would a story be without its cast and let me assure you that while the Monsters found in Undertale are seemingly simple, they do in fact have things they care about. You don't need to remember every bit of dialogue for the characters to have impact, but you will understand that feeling of being a friendly stranger in a strange land. It really isn't any stranger from my world or yours, so just act like Yourself.   Length? The game can be beaten I believe at just about 4 hours, maybe less considering I've seen someone run and win in under 2 hours (but not watched the video). I gave it the fullest look through and even on occasion just turn it on for ambient noise. But make sure that if you run a Pacifist run to go Back to the Flowers at the start, and to reload a save after talking Sans in that one room, towards the end. He'll do something, if you did it right.  Length? 9/10, I'd like to have seen more honestly. I would like for there to have been more and seen more but that's more my expectations than Toby or anyone else's.   Replayability? Yes. There are a number of endings and some interesting things happen if you decide you can't handle the cold. It explores choices well and honestly, I'd give this game to my kid for a lesson on things like morality.   Price? Ten dollars is a good price for a gem you can pick off the shelf and say 'wow it left an impact'.   Overall Opinion? On a scoring grade I'm giving it a Perfect 10. Really. I have minor nitpicks with it, but the reality is, those are my feelings for more. To see more, to feel more of this world. It's beautiful and charming and really I wouldn't change it for anything in the world unless it was for the better. There are mysteries hidden within and questions unanswered and I won't spoil those for you to discover. If you want more information, you can find it yourself. But if you really want to dig into a comfy, classical RPG with solid fun at the core, you can bet I'd recommend Undertale to people of all ages.  Nyeh heh heh.",

The characters are well-written and convincing, and are overall very fun to interact with as each shows a different face to any given situation (PRO TIP: Call Papyrus in every possible room).  And the decision-making is excellent, too. It's well-crafted decision making that subtly lies within the process of gameplay. Instead of presenting you with '[CHOICE]', it lets you decide what to do almost fluidly, sublty affecting the outcome until you can reach a polar opposite ending.

The combat isn't that hard - If you're used to Bullet Hell games like; 'The Tohou Project' the combat isn't very difficult. Maps are plain - The maps are cliche like snow levels or fire levels and the maps don't have anything that seperates them from other indie rpgs. 8-bit desgin - I understand with GameMaker Studio you can only make bit games but it couldn't of been 16-bit instead?  The postives of the game (Short ver.): The combat is original - No not killing enemys is nothing new (Look at Shin Megami Tensei) but the Bullet Hell mixed with turnbased combat is great! It's not even stuck to bullet hell for example the fight with Muffet or Papyrus. The music - Toby Fox's work on the webcomic 'Homestuck' was amazing and now an game OST? Yes please! Characters - I liked all the main characters but their personallities weren't that amazing, but they were all very likable. Story - SPOILER FREE: The twist with one of the characters you meet at the begining turned the game around for me which almost never happens with me, I even got pretty emotional with the pacifict ending. Dialouge - The jokes are mostly funny and the characters feel unakwared and very natural. Moral System - I don't hate this games moral system. Thats a Achivement. Mutiple endings - You get exactly what you deserve even after the Genocide ending you're punished when you reset the game.   Worst of all of the game: The fanbase  I'm not the greatest reviewer but this is definetly worth the £7 or $10. -- Cemlar",

The battle system is kinda weird for an RPG, turning into a bullet hell game, and it may remind you of Touhou. It's unique because there actually are consequences for killing mons without thinking anything of it, and the game remembers that you did that in a previous run. If you're starting a genocide run (or if you kill any of the bosses on the neutral route), it will make you feel like a horrible person. You'd be surprised how a game manages to make you feel bad for killing something you know is just pixels. The soundtrack is awesome enough to justify being a paid item on Steam and supporting the creator. My favorites are The Core, Death by Glamour, Another Medium, Megalovania, and Asgore. Spear of Justice is an honorable mention. Start to finish, it feels kinda short, especially if you do 2 or more playthroughs in a short span of time, which I would not recommend.",

At first glance this game might not seem that interesting, but you would probably be wrong.  Everything is just so well done in this, the characters are memorable in their own way. Even the random encounters will stay in your mind after playing this!  Fighting is basically turn-based combat, but each turn you have a minigame kind of thing where you'll have to dodge/repel your opponent's attacks. Combat system is a bit hard to explain, but it's really something unique.  Soundtrack in this game is one of the best one I've heard. The music varies from time to time, whether it's something happy while having a friendly conversation with someone or a menacing one when you are having an intense boss battle, it's awesome either way.  Also there is one thing that makes this game stand out of the others in my opinion, that being that you don't have to kill a single enemy in this game    or you can kill everyone   .  Undertale has been far more entertaining than most AAA titles for me. I'll hope that you will try this game out!",

It takes influence from the cult-classic game, Earthbound, which means it has a lot of humour to offer and many dark themes to find. The action-timings for when you're attacking changes depending on what weapon you have equipped, so the game is not feel as repitetive as most RPGs are. The soundtrack is amazing and fits the mood to the area and/or events that are happening while you progress through the game.  From what I've seen from other reviews, Undertale is not the first of it's kind nor is it the best example of it's kind. But I, as a new player through this kind of game, have been blown away and look forward to the universe of games that Undertale's formula has followed. If you have been overhyped for this game, it will most likely let you down. I entered with the right amount of hype and have thoroughly enjoyed what the game has offered me.",

Hilarious: This is probably the best game I've encountered in a long time. 3. Once you stop, you cannot quit: I had said to myself that I would finish a game I was playing before I had started. I decided to just start the game, see the initial story, but then I found myself getting deeper into it. 4. The story is simple: The story isn't very complex. *Spoilers from the beginning of the game* You are a human who falls into a monster world and you are trying to escape */end spoilers* 5. Gameplay is amazing and entertaining: In this game, you don't have to kill anything. That's right. The big monster in the corner, you can sing to and make them sing along. The boss? Oh, yeah, you can make him your friend. Everything in this game is so dynamic, you can choose whether you will fight a monster or not 6. The music: The music is really great! Very good soundtrack!  Cons 1. The story is short compared to other RPGs: Don't expect a full scale story such as Fire Emblem or Tales of blah. The game is short, but makes up for it in replayability. There are multiple endings, multiple things you can do in the game, etc.  That's all the cons I can think of.   So, I would give this a good 9/10, just because I wish the story was longer.

            "review_text": "[No Spoiler Review] On the surface, it's an RPG game with puzzle elements with a pixel art style going on. But in reality, this game hits home the moment you boot up the game. It will stay that way even to the end.  If you're inspired with games where you can carve your own path and grew up with games like Mother, this is more than enough to jump into the game and enjoy it. This is one of those games where it is designed well by narrative and player interpretation. Depending on the choices you make, as a matter of fact. It can make some parts easier, and later parts harder. Vice versa.  The atmosphere and the characters in it despite the direction they took with the pixel style are all rememberable. Just about every NPC in that game will have something to say, and it does change over time. So the exploration and curiosity is always beaming at every corner. This game's quirky, will go to great lengths to make all kinds of jokes. Both literal and sometimes clever, pun-ny ones at that.  The sound track? Now that really hits home as it takes inspiration from Mother/Earthbound, and takes notes from various SNES sound tracks and making it catchy enough to hum to a few battle tunes. Pretty addicting right there.  Now, for an RPG game, I know some of you want those hours you want to sink into. But this game does not care about a long, mediocre experience. With around 12~ hours or so of the time that I spent with, that entire time was spent with quality. No filler. No additives. No preservatives.   This will be one of those games you really want to go in blind. Don't look anything up. Play the way you want and see where the game will take you. You may be surprised and end up coming back for more.",

This game can be played in three main ways: Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide. During Pacifist you spare everything. In my opinion this is where the game excels in story. In this way you get to hear tons of backstory about characters. Next is neutral, in this way you kill some characters and spare others. This is the part of the game where the story is getting a little bit weird in the sense of the story starts getting messed up. Then there is genocide. This is by far the hardest way to play the game in terms of the sotryline is just plain creepy, as an example the music is deeper and slowed down in most zones of the game. Also the gameplay is extremely frusrating because this mode has the hardest bosses in the game. A unique part of this game though is that even when you restart the game or uninstall and reinstall the game, all characters will remember your previous runs of the game. The soundtrack is probably one of the best there is out of every game i have ever heard.  I say this game + the soundtrack is worth $60 even though it is only roughly $20. You will get so much enjoyment out of this game and i give this game a 9.5/10.  If you like rpg games with an amazing yet messed up story line, this game is definetely for you.",

You don't even need to think that hard about what the game is trying to tell you, because it's very up front about it. But if you take the time to think, and look into details a little more, there's a lot more very moving stuff to be found.  And I don't just mean in the game itself. This is a game that breaks down everything you know about video games, and it's already one of the best ever just because of that.  This is probably the best game to have been released in 2015, no contest.  The only game that could possibly ever match this one for its artistry is Dark Souls. Needless to say, this does not have the Dark Souls learning curve, so if you're trying to buy something moving and a Souls game is too hard for you, grab this.

Story gets fascinating after you beat it once, then twice, then finally 3 times; and each time the game changes dramatically and you\\'ll have new fights and unexpected encounters.  Disliked: OK two gripes. (1) The first and second playthroughs are a bit too easy. (2) On the final playthrough it takes waaaaaaay too long for monsters to show up.

            "review_text": "Perhaps one of the most well written games I've ever played, coupled with very solid gameplay mechanics, choices that matter a whole lot, lots of secrets and humour. And dogs.  There isn't really anything this game doesn't hit head on. It might seem like a simple RPG at first, with an interesting mechanic for actual battles, but it gets so complex with every enemy having unique and interesting attacks, and bosses having mechanics that change how you have to play the battles out for even more fun battles. And then the whole concept of sparing functions like a puzzle on its own - figuring out what each action does and how you'll get the monster to stop fighting. Sometimes you have to resort to options you wouldn't think would be necessary, but you don't have to kill a single monster in the game.  The writing is impeccable. It's full of ridiculous, silly humour that doesn't work through references, pop culture (for most part) or easy jokes (...also for most part), and is still hilarous and fun. Then we get into the serious stuff. It's pretty much how Earthbound and the MOTHER games run it: lots of really silly jokes that make the game seem lighthearted and not too serious, but then throws a bunch of heavy, serious and well connected plot at you to make you cry your ♥♥♥ off. And it also works in Undertale. The true ending torn me to pieces, happy yet sad pieces.  The characters are perhaps one of the best things about the writing. They're all so full of life and personality, and you get to see many of them evolve quite a lot, not to say find out more and more about them as you go on. Most of it is completely optional, if you don't care about them too much. But I can certainly say I've never loved a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skeleton named after a font, nor a fish with a temper, so much before.  The artstyle is very solid. Simplistic, but cute and can still be somewhat disturbing... and very creepy... at times. There wasn't a single character/monster design that I didn't like, and the best part was the freedom they took with the whole idea of 'monster' - Literally anything can be a monster. Some of the stuff you see is plain ridiculous, yet lovely anyway. It's the weirdest thing to say that you can date a skeleton, pretend to be a gelatin, pet buff dogs, have a flexing contest against a horse and fight a very terrifying... flower... all in one game.  And then the music. Just, just buy it. It's ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. All of it. I stopped so many times in certain areas and battles just to enjoy the music for a little longer, something most games don't really get me to do. Even as much as I absolutely adored the game, I don't even know what was more worth it - the experience of everything this game is or the music alone. They were both as powerful and amazing as one another.  All in all? Not just a RPG game. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience of laughter, joy, challenge and bittersweet tears. One of the best games I've played in my life, perhaps the most memorable one. It's a game I would recommend to absolutely everyone, not just RPG lovers, not just bullet hell lovers, not just good story lovers. This is the kind of game that anyone would be able to enjoy immensely and finish it with a sad smile on their faces, wanting more. I already know that's how I will be, even though I have plenty more to do here.",

However, Undertale has... fallen from grace a little bit, to say the least. This is just my opinion, but I believe that the fanbase overhyped the game to the point of ruining it, very similar to the of Five Nights At Freddy's (which I never really liked in the first place to be honest). Don't get me wrong, this game has a very high replayability factor, its interesting bullet-hell combat system was fresh, and the story and character development, including the inclusion of LGBT characters in the form of Undyne and Alphys, were more than selling points for me, but the severe overhyping of the game kinda ruined the experience. Also the ridiculous amount of porn that exists if you look up Undertale on google. Overall, I give this game 10/10, but just know that this masterpiece is a shadow of its former self because of the extremism of the fans.",

It...it may sound strange to some but when I played Undertale, it was like I was able to make my own decisions and I finally had friends that loved and cared about me. All the choices I made in my first playthrough were pacifist and...and it felt like someone out there was truly proud of me. It's really silly, I know, but as I was leading closer and closer to the end and hearing how proud my new monster buddies were of me, I just broke down. I forgot it was a game in those few hours. I forgot it was fiction as I was captivated by this beautiful story and amazing music. When I got my neutral ending, and Sans told me to take care of myself, because someone really cares about me, it was in that moment, where I was finally proud of myself for not killing myself. Again it's probably very juvinile but the feeling of having someone genuinly proud of you(no matter if they were fictional or not) when you're at your lowest, dragging yourself around just to make it through the day, well it means a lot to me.  This game actually made me feel something, which is very rare in a video game for me. I mean, yeah, I've done other rpgs but never have I felt this strongly about a game before.

I'm not going to go into specifics about how the game looks, plays, and things of that caliber; alternatively, I'd like to take a moment to talk about something that many people seem to have a difficult time understanding: Happiness.  This is a concept that's easily comprehended by even the children in their youngest years of living, but later into things I've noticed that its true nature starts to get hazy. People start to question the very validity of the happiness that kids experience, and perhaps it is true that what some kids have isn't particularly real happiness, but if Undertale, Spirited Away, stories from across human history and even more than that has taught me, it's that children may understand happiness better than any of us. The young are filled with a desire to live and see what everything has to offer... an affirmative determination to learn more, laugh more, live more, and even love more. Maybe it is innocence that's the deciding factor, and maybe we do leave that behind at a certain age, but love, happiness, and peace ARE stronger than just simple innocence. In my eighteen years of living, I've yet to gain any EXP or LOVE (which only people who've played to the near end of the game will get), but I've never had any real reason to even try to. And as much as I wish I could say we were all playing the same game... the truth is we aren't; we play by the same set of rules to be certain, but some variables change them and us in the process. Some individuals lose the path to happiness. They do things that in their minds they see as logical decisions.   Killing people, killing ANYONE, including yourself, is never a logical answer, nor even a right answer; please take that to heart.  If you can't find your happiness... talk to someone. Talk to anyone willing to listen. I guarantee there's someone out there who will listen. It's all so intensely daunting... but one thing I can tell you is all of this... all of this is a project. It's a continued piece of effort that we throw ourselves into daily or bi-daily. It's incredibly difficult to find happiness in a short amount of time; it's so difficult it can't be measured by clear way of passing; however, it isn't impossible.  To find it though, you just have to keep going.  I can't tell anything about this game that you can't already see from the trailer, the internet, or everything that's already been said about it, but I can say this: If you'd like a pleasant experience, one that may teach you a thing or two about the inherent nature of happiness and love, than I'd say that you should try it out. You might very well enjoy it.  Have faith in others.  Have confidence in yourself.  Stay determined.  ~Anti",

            "review_text": "Here are some sentences that I can use to describe Undertale as a game.  -It has a vivid, inspiring, and emotional story, set in an expansive and elaborate world with a deep and dark past.  So much thought was put into this game and the lore is as mysterious and intricate as, say, the FNAF series.  -It contains a wholesome and diverse cast of characters that are lovable down to even the most minor of 'monsters'.  All of the characters have complex and amusing relationships, and even regular enemies and npc's are engaging.  -It utilises excellent pacing of comedy, heartbreak, triumph, discovery, etc. to always keep the player freshly invested.  There are plently of surprises around each corner that take the player by surprise in a literal sense and emotionally.  -It must have what I view as the best (retro) soundtrack of any media I've ever heard personally.  There is no need tab out or be bored. After beating the game, I've listened to the soundtrack many times just to jam.  -The gameplay is surprisingly fun, challenging, and entertaining, with a very fair and responsive difficulty curve.  One could describe it as something like a bullet hell game with puzzles and utter nonsense (amazing story) on the side.  It can be enjoyed heavily on a basic level of comedy and gameplay, and it has a high level of replayability.  -This game shatters all expectations and cannot be confined to any genre.  All that I can say is that it is its own very unique experience, with a feel and style akin to something like Earthbound.  -Undertale has forever changed the way that I look at video games and the way I look at life.  The story is presented in such a way that it leaves a lasting impact on you, especially since it is greatly influenced by the player.  -This all being said, a player will have to play through the game for a bit before they become comfortable enough for the game to start throwing curveballs at them; until then, it will appear like a 'standard rpg,' but be patient. Give it a chance, and you will throoughly enjoy your time spent in the underground. I HIGHLY recommend this to any person with any inkling of an interest to try out this new weird indie title. You can go far with this game; it will be the best $10 you ever spent. :)",

The score is amazing and really sets the atmosphere when playing the game. Other than that, Undertale has been a fantastic game to play. It’s a delightful little game, well programmed, beautiful musical score, unforgettable characters, and quite inspiring in my opinion. Although it's a quick one, you’ll have a great time.",

For those who get enamored by this game, it will make you laugh, cry, get mad, and all other torrents of emotions. It will break you. It is very meta too, which honestly surprises me the amount of content an depth a game like this has. For those who love gaming an RPG's this is a game that is worth trying at least once. I feel like you will fall for nearly all the characters, and genuinely do not want to harm them or kill them, as is one of the themes of this game. The story and characters and humor this game has is so unique, as well as the designs of monsters, that it amazes me one person made this game. I tip my hat to Toby Fox in that regard for this game which is more like an experience, and I don't say that lightly. If this game is not for you, then I totally understand and respect that as well. Even little things like the fact that you can't sell stuff to most shopkeepers in this game or the importance of items amazes me in this game, details like that, let alone all the 4th wall stuff. It never gets tedious or grindy and the bullet hell part of the game feels genuinely fun as well as the whole sparing an acting concept. There is just so much to this it blows the mind. I'm glad I decided to play this and would probably do it again, and would recommend it to anyone even slightly intrigued and interested by it, I'm sure you'd find something you'd like, as cute and charming as this game is.

This game made me a plate of sphagetti.  I highly recommend that you take the tagline 'A game where nobody has to die' seriously. There is only a single person in the entire game you even need to hit FIGHT for, and that's only because it's the only button you can even hit at the time. You will not regret it.  The story in this game is brilliant, and introduces a whole host of characters whom I cannot forget even if I tried, and despite my every attempt, I now find myself comparing every other game against. The music is a even mix between several genres, and flows and fits perfectly, and is worth every extra cent. The graphics are retro, but don't think that they're subpar in any way, and in fact I think any higher resolution would make the game lose its impact in a later section.  I have tried and tried to find a flaw in this game, if only for the sake of making it less perfect when I compare my future games to it. I have failed to find anything wrong except that Hard mode is not completed yet, and one aspect of the ending left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth days later when I thought about it. (Though it's fitting, all things considered about the character it happened to.)  I could say 10/10, but that would only cheapen my rating. This game is perfect in every way, and it will leave part of your soul permanantly affected, and you may never see the rest of the world the same way again.

            "review_text": "*My review of Undertale , a great game with Earthbound-y roots*  Some light #spoilers  (you've been warned).  No plot details though.  Sooooo, I guess I did a successful run of Undertale.   tl;dr It was pretty good!   It was very cute, and endearing. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's an instant classic. It borrows heavily... ahem.... was inspired very much by... Well, let's just say it straight up pulled multiple things from Earthbound. Considering it's roots and who made it, that aspect is very much intentional. So, I can see why people who are absolutely bonkers about it might be affected by the redirected nostalgia of EB/Mother.  That isn't to say this is a bad or poorly made game. The graphical appearance belies a very well-crafted, intricate, attention to detail story with characters you actually care about (or eventually grow to care about). And your decisions actually matter to a granular degree! which is not often seen in those AAA higher budget 'choose your own adventure' type games. I'm very, very impressed with the amount of effort the writers went into crafting a story that actually encourages you to talk to everyone and not have it get boring. There were several jokes and one-liners... and well, things that happen that genuinely elicited a real response (for me, it was mostly smiling and laughter). And for the most part, what is said is contextual and reflective of other things mentioned in the story. It's the subtle callbacks. They're not overbearing, and it's really quite clever when you're paying attention.  The music was also surprisingly great. I guess the guy who programmed the game is a musician by education/trade? It had me humming along. The guy uses the same 3-4 leitmotifs I noticed throughout the game, but his effective use of several different genres and understanding of different styles of music really show that he gets music, and gets how to make it thematically relevant. The throwbacks, graphical references and directly ripped SOUNDFOUNTS from other video games were a nice and appreciated touch. Slight spoilers, but we have homages to several game franchises including (but not limited to) Earthbound (duh), Final Fantasy, and even Dynamite Headdy.  There were plenty of opportunities to subvert your expectations as well. I think it's nice and not frustrating when done well, and he did it well. I will say, I just about fell asleep in the first 45 minutes or so of the game, but once I got past the 'tutorials,' I found the game much more engrossing. The battle system is a great thing. Subverts your typical understanding of video games in the same vein and genre, while introducing a whole lot of custom 'scenarios' based on who and what you're fighting. I won't spoil anything major, but basically (apart from random battles from time to time), there are no two encounters that are the same.  The game is rather meticulously scripted. I won't say it feels linear, but it pretty much is. What matters here is more the choices you make. That's where majority of the 'exploration' comes from. Otherwise, the narrative is very much set in stone, like a well worn novel. The game does play with the concept of reality, time travel, and outside dimensions a bit, but the game will basically take a scripted path from start to finish. And that's okay! Because the attention spent to the details is second to none. I honestly think the narrow scope of the narrative serves to encourage multiple playthroughs, and doesn't waste the players time. There are lots of little secrets you can find and experience if you go a little out of your way to find them. That's part of what makes the game so engrossing. I go here, search that, what will I find? What goofy thing is there next to discover? The linearity of the narrative makes finding these kinds of things a little easier and thus you enjoy them more. So, in addition to being a good story, it's just a very well made, and well-paced game.   If I had to nitpick about anything, it'd just be that the art style/design in some of the characters is inconsistent. It comes across as a mish-mash sometimes. Some characters are well designed, but some look like they were scribbled onto a piece of paper with a ballpoint pen. Maybe chalk it up to a smaller budget, or a small team of people with different art styles, but I did notice it. It didn't really affect my ability to appreciate the game at all though. It's just something to note.  That said, character face sprites while talking were very expressive. One could tell a bunch of effort was put it into designing and key-framing them. It's probably important to have expressive and emotive faces next to the text bubbles because you spend half your time in the game reading dialogue. As a result the character sprites themselves don't nearly get the same amount of animation love... but to be frank, you hardly notice it because you're too busy laughing at a bad pun or enjoying an intense battle.  I did two endings (out of a possible three from what I understand?). I will be planning to do the third later tonight maybe.   There is nuance even in the endings however, and I'm sure if you cared you could look up a flowchart or something on the internet... I'm guessing honestly... but I think Undertale has garnered enough of a following at this point that it's probably out there on the net.  I think the game deserves the praise it's getting, especially considering the team it came from, but I can't say it's the best game in this vein that I've ever played. That honor goes to Mother 3.  9/10 go and play it.",

I'm gonna warn you, it is impossible to get the pacifist route the first go, since the game is created that way, but when you do get the good ending, have a box of tissues with you. I cried. A LOT. I'm replaying it to see any of the little things I could have missed throughout the game, and overall this was a very well made game. The music is beautiful, comforting, fun, exciting, and some of the music just gives you feels depending on whats happening in the game at that moment. The characters are extremely loveable, and its almost as if they are real. Some of the characters you can talk to over and over, and they always come up with something new or funny to talk about. Also, some of these characters are extremely relateable in many ways~ It makes it much more interesting and exciting to play through and in a way makes you more attactched to these characters. I don't have the heart to do the genocide route. Not after having built relationships with these characters. This game really plays with your emotions, but in a more positive way. Honestly this is one of my favorite games, and I will always remember this game. If you are hesitating on getting this game because it has become so 'Mainstream', I suggest you get it. It is popular for a reason. Don't try and be the hipster outcast just because this is a game everyone likes. If most people like it, its usually for a good reason! I admit I was hesitating about getting it for that reason, but having played it, I realized that a lot of times, if something has gained a lot of fame, its usually because it earned it. This is one of those games that honestly earned all the popularity that it is getting. I hope more games like this will start coming out. This is one of those games where you know the creator put a lot of heart and thought into it, and I am very thankful for that~ So many wonderful aspects to this game, there is something for everyone in Undertale. :)  Happy gaming~",

It also demands you have a sense of humor similar to Toby Fox, the game's developer. If your sense of humor isn't completely goofy and nerdy, you might think the game is far too silly. And if you're looking for a challenge, you're looking in the wrong place.  All of that being said, I found Undertale to be one of the most hilarious, well-written games I've ever played. It's not the prettiest thing to look at, and could surely use a visual upgrade, but the music is fantastic, the battle system is far deeper than it seems at first glance (most of the boss fights are pretty great), and few games will ever warm your heart like Undertale will. Undertale is not for everyone, and the fanbase would do well to remember this. However, I can say with certainty that Undertale is for me.",

I watch the trailer and its concept of combat made me want to play this game. Now, like a SOB I am, I pirated the game first (Yeah, go ♥♥♥♥ myself, I know.) But after beating the game I was so shocked that I decided to actually buy the game. The game is so powerful that it LITERALLY leaves a scar in a place of your heart. It is a masterpiece. I would recommend this to be a GOTY2015. The Story is Amazing and has a huge amount of content depending of which path you choose. Characters are filled with personality and you will fall in love with them. Battle system is quite an unique mix and it will bring you fun and frustration if you mess up. Every Enemy is Unique in its way. Bosses are really fun and challenging as well. Be warned tho, if you do beat the game on the Pacifist way, it will require 100 times the DETERMINATION to actually reset the game 100% and explore the other endings. I simply cannot explore the other endings due to the personality of the characters. I did the True Reset when I bought the game and I still did the Pacifist ending. This game will make you cry. Will make you laugh. Will make you Insane. Will make you think about it for weeks and even might get you sucked into the fandom of this game. In my honest opinion, games like these, where when you finish it and make you going to miss how it feels playing it for the first time. Thinking about how you could've done this thing in another way, or simply having to write a review of it, are considered masterpieces in my book. Toby Fox's KickStarter game was extremely successful and I was glad that the UNDERTALE team finished this product. Extremely well done to the team. I read that they might have comics of this series as it was listed in the goals of the KickStarter. I am quite excited for it and hope it becomes a reality. I simply need more UNDERTALE.(Maybe even a sequel...? But I honestly don't know how team's going to pull it off.) The fact that this is an Indie game, and has made so many people think and reflect about themselves, is quite incredible. Witnessing the influence of games like these feels me with DETERMINATION.  10/10 GOTY2015 Would make others play. ",

This is a child's game.' So... Suddenly for no apparent reason I decide to buy the game and give it a shot. After one hour playing, I was already convinced: This IS one of the best games of 2015. And I'm amazed by this fact, so many called 'triple a games' fail to be as fun as Undertale is. So far, there has been a very few amount of games that managed to keep me interested in playing it, this is one of those games.  In basic details, Undertale is a JRPG styled game where the objective is not to kill anything, try to solve all of your problems in diplomatic (sometimes not so diplomatic) ways. But of course, if you just want to say 'screw everything' and start killing everything that's in your way, you can do it, but mind the interesting consequences by the near-end of the game that are going to make you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's filled with awesome and lovable characters, lots of puns and stupid but very funny enemies (such as a block of ice with a cool hat).  Undertale is very well designed, it's an emotional game, it's not epic and great, it's simple and fascinating. The creator did a really really great job with this. I understand why there's a good amount of people complaining, it sure does not have a very good visual, even for an parody 8-bit game, but if you ever feel like trying something fresh, interesting and really entertaining, give Undertale a try.",

            "review_text": "Wow, what a fantastic game.   The writing is absolutely fantastic, with interesting characters abound (My favorite is by far Papyrus).The battle mechanics are interesting enough to not get boring because of how each enemy is like a puzzle in and of itself, keeping you on your toes when multiple enemies ambush you and you are forced to think about the best way to dispatch them. The music is also excellent, in and out of fights.  The kill/spare mechanic is amazing with the way it affects the story (which is awesome). The story itself is engaging and kept me interested throughout the entire thing, even when late-game bosses were giving me major headaches. The game is tough enough to be satisfying, but not too overbearing.  In my playthrough, I tried to spare as many as I could, and my mistakes had pretty dire consequences. It was really interesting (and usually pretty emotional) when you see the consequences of your actions.  And holy toledo, let me just say, the ending to this game was like nothing I've really played before, maybe ONE single exception which I won't name as it would spoil what makes it... insane. Really creative stuff here.   Negatives: There's a boss and setting that gets recycled a few times in samey areas that, while not detrimental story-wise, was just a little bit stale by the end of it, at least until the final fight with said boss. Also the lack of initial explanation of the attacking/fighting mechanic (which I used rarely in my playthrough) made it a bit disorienting when I used it the first few fights. Also a personal irk, the graphic style is very charming, but I personally think the game could have benefited from full hand-drawn 2d art to flesh out the world. Sometimes it was hard to recognize what they were trying to depict in their small pixel count, but honestly, the style still works very well with the game.  Also, the lack of an options menu with volume control is a little annoying... the sound is very loud compared to anything else, so I couldn't voice chat with friends while playing.  Overall though, definitely one of my favorite games I've played. A fantastic experience that will have you laughing, tearing up, and questioning what the heck is going on. Major props to Toby Fox and the dev team for making this wonderful adventure.   TL;DR: This game deserves the hype the internet gave it. The fact it was made by such a small team is a testament to gaming as art, as this game IMO is a masterpiece. DEFINITELY pick this one up if you like RPGs, hell, even if you don't, you may just learn to love them. I can't wait to go through another playthrough making different choices and seeing how the game plays out.",

It also carried some of those emotions into real life. This game gave me determination (pun intended) to look for the good in the world and to work hard so that some day I could eventually make a difference. Alright back to the actual game aspect of the game. It's a turn based RPG with 2 options of dealing with enemies, either sparing them or killing them. Sparing is when you do all sorts of actions like talking or petting your enemies until you can spare them. While if you decide to kill them, you have to a little time minigame (it's hard to describe). What about the characters? They are fantastic. Even though then their voices qualify as a bunch of beepish sounds, you can still feel the emotion of the characters via their dialog. What about the music? It's the best I heard in a while only being rivaled by the Hotline Miami series. All of the music tells you the emotions of the situation at hand and all of it is placed at where it needs to be. What about the graphics? The graphics are in an retro 8-bit style with many vibrant colors. While some may be turned of the game because of the asthetics, overall to most gamers the visuals will be appealing. What about the story? Well the story is probably the best aspect of the game. It's seemingly querky yet serious without having things get all messy. When I say it's querky I mean that they are lot of jokes and puns in the game that always got a laugh out of me. There are many comedic bits aimed for both adults and other more innocent people. Also warning this game can get really tragic and really heart-warming. All right so thats the gist of the game, great gameplay, great music, and great visuals, an excellent story. This is an obvious reccommendation from me and personally this is one of if not the best game I have ever played. Also what do you call a lone skeleton... Bonely (Ha Ha).",

Every move, turn, word, or action completely changes the story. So many different endings, possibilities, bosses, secrets, events, and the lore is just SO AMAZING. This is a 10/10 for story &amp; gameplay, but one minor thing might be the graphics. They are old fashioned 'Mario™' style graphics, but who cares. The controls seem weird at first, but you don't even have to use a mouse, or trackpad, just up, right, down, left, shift, &amp; enter. Secret passages, encounters, and studying up on lore awaits you for $10.00 on steam.",

With that mindset, I was massively impressed by what I ended up with. I committed to killing everything in sight on my first playthrough, and even under those circumstances the level of character development puts almost all major-budget titles to complete shame. With some characters getting only a few minutes to introduce themselves, the game always managed to garner my investment in them.  Further, the game is also subtle about what consequences your actions take. Friends watching me play were able to tell me of massive swathes of the game I was excluded from due to my murderous antics - almost nothing I would have realized was missing unless I had been told about it. Often times characters will make comments that seem to be in direct response to things you've done, but still you can't be sure. The game does an incredible job of toying with your expectations, and I never even encountered any of the fourth-wall breaking moments along my journey. And that's not mentioning all of the ways in which the game establishes rules for the sake of breaking them; the UI itself cannot be trusted, constantly doing things it shouldn't or not doing things it should in creative and memorable ways.  Undertale is the sort of game where playing with a guide will absolutely destroy your experience. In that sense, it's not a game for everyone; but if you're even remotely curious, disregard the hype and counter-circlejerking and all the nonsense that has ended up surrounding the game. It is absolutely worth your time.",

Then I played it and realized part of the reason the graphics were so minimal was because of the depth the world made it a necessity. The 16-bit feel of the game ended up becoming endearing in its own quirky way. Similarly, Undertale uses simplistic graphics. Like with Minecraft the reason seems to be due to the depth of the world, though not in a literal sense here. The story is rich and rewarding. The characters are, as a whole, memorable and likeable. While the gameplay can take a little getting used to if you don't want to simply murder your way to victory or if you're unfamiliar with things like mechanics (they don't just fix cars!), it felt fresh especially when compared to other pseudo-RPGs that have come out lately.  If you enjoy stories, even a little, you should play this game. If you don't, you should still play this game and see if it can't change your mind.",

The game is challenging (especially when trying to go the entire game as a pacifist [It can be done!]). The game has a lot to offer in terms of comedic value with pithy jokes and 4th wall satire on story-driven games.  The game does also have a deeper meaning, in my opinion. One that each person will hopefully, discover for himself/herself.  I highly recommend this game to anyone willing to play it (and if you want to go all in and support an amazing game dev, buy the soundtrack to the game as well). It is a damn shame that this game did not win GOTY (although Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was spectacular) and it certainly had the making to be that game.  Seriously, this game is all-round spectacular and should receive no less than a 10/10.",

            "review_text": "Spider bake sales, fourth wall breaking skeletons and an extremely terrifying flower, what more is there to say? Undertale, arguably one of the most interesting and soulful games of the year, arrives in the form of a simple throwback to old-style Role Playing Games. What initially began as an inconspicuous crowd-funding project on Kickstarter in 2013, developed into something much larger over the course of a couple of years. Toby Fox, who had previously composed music for the incredibly popular webcomic ‘Homestuck’, had once made a foray into the world of game creation for his popular Halloween hack of ‘Earthbound’. However, until Undertale, we hadn’t yet had the pleasure of seeing his full creative prowess realized.  As the game begins a cutscene plays and the player is given a quick synopsis of a war that took place several hundred years ago between Humans and Monsters. In the end, the Humans stood victorious, and as a result Monsters were sealed underground by a magic barrier and have remained stuck there since. Centuries later, a child of ambiguous gender climbs a mountain in the wilderness and, long story short, falls inside and awakens in the realm of the Monsters. In true retro RPG fashion, the exploration portion of the game is from a top down view with 16 bit graphics to boot, and if you can’t ignore the glaringly intentional decision to do this then it may serve to alienate some. Yet, the fighting mechanic of the game is highly irregular in comparison to other classic RPGs. During an encounter with an enemy NPC the fighting is traditionally turn based, attacks must be timed correctly by landing a blow at a precise time to maximise damage, but when an enemy returns fire, the player is thrust into a ‘bullet-hell’ type mini-game, whereupon you must guide a heart around which is meant to represent your soul and dodge projectiles. A neat mechanic is the variation of the projectiles you must dodge, some are simple bullets which fly around the screen, whilst others can change colours which require players to remain still, and one of them is even a dog that you have to avoid whilst it chases after you.  Despite all this, Undertale is one of the only games I have played where you are actively discouraged to participate in needless violence and killing. Through use of narrative in the tutorial and throughout the game itself, players are told another way to cease conflict with an enemy is through ‘ACT(ing)’ and then sparing them. This mechanic allows you to talk the enemy down in a plethora of ways- tell me, in what game can you defeat a body-builder sea-horse by flexing it out of the match? Or again, could you give me an example of a game where you pet an enemy into submission? It’s this creativity which gives the game its strongest flair, its undeniable charm. It’s not just the gameplay either. The story never makes any grandeur promises in the beginning of the game, if anything it appears extremely generic, but the way you interact with the world, even something as subtle as going on a date with a character can change the entire story. Speaking of the characters, this is some of the best-written cast ever seen in a game, you’ll find yourself busting a gut again and again at some of the dialogue, and feeling crushed at some of the more emotional sections. In fact, one of the strongest parts of the game is it makes you care about the characters, more so than in any game I’ve ever played. For example, in a game like Fallout 3, an incredible game in every sense of the word, if you choose to kill people instead of sparing them it doesn’t really bother you. Whereas with Undertale, even though fighting and killing is always an option within the game, (and especially with different endings and the ability to replay the game, you are sorely tempted!) I could never bring myself to even kill a single NPC, I was that attached to the world I had entered. The music as well compliments every section of the game, during boss battles the tracks provide you with such determination that no matter the difficulty you can’t bring yourself to give up, and during emotional sections you feel the anguish of the characters.  To be frank, this is a game that needs to be played to be believed, and in no way has any game made me want to play it again and again. It’s only around £7, so if you have the means and you fancy going on an unforgettable adventure with memorable characters and addictive gameplay pouring out of the seams, don’t hesitate!",

Undertale is a Rpg, storyrich game that has one amazingly great and sometimes changing mechanic, its heart mechanic. Its heart mechanic will keep you on your toes dodging enemy attacks and using the arrow keys to maneuver your heart around the little box given to you to do so. Battles can even have some jokes in them such as a later enemy named jeffery, you and the other monsters have to ditch him (or kill him yourself) to win the fight. An amazing Powerduo of charecters will be with you for alot of the game helping, and sometimes hurting, you and you meet them pretty soon.

Pros  1 - The story, at its core, is good. Very nice premise that reveals itself as the game goes on.  2 - The characters are memorable and fun.  3 - The music is fantastic.  4 - The game has a decent amount of feeling to it, emotions, that make it quite immersive.  5 - The decision on how to play is dealt with quite well, and leads to interesting scenarios.  Cons  1 - The story, although good, can be a bit random and out-of-the-blue. Some of the biggest plot points aren't revealed until quite late, and can go over some folks' heads if they aren't paying attention. There are hints throughout the game, but it feels a bit ham-fisted at times.  2 - The characters are great, but can feel a bit one dimensional at times. Some of them have flaws, others merely exist in this creative world of monsters. Some feel like walking memes, which can be a little exhausting.  3 - The gameplay/combat. I personally had no problem with the combat system, but after watching a couple of my friends play through and listening to their complaints, I can see why it is an issue. Bullet Hell games are really hit or miss, and although the fights are fresh and creative, they can serve to annoy some players and detract from the overall fun of the game. If you aren't fond of Bullet Hell games, be wary.  4 - The humor may not be for everyone.  Overall, I'd recommend Undertale to just about any gamer that has a fondness for RPGs and story. It is a fun little game at a decent price, so there is nothing really to lose. However, that being said, it is okay to dislike Undertale. Some people might not like the combat. Others may dislike the characters. Many may grow to disdain the community this game has made, and that is totally fine. I'm personally not a part of it. Don't let hype or hatred skew your view about this game.  Give it a try, and judge for yourselves.",

Ever since I disovered the trailer I had wanted it and was lucky enough to get it on the Christmas Sale, and I can say I was far from disappointed, even when I heard about all the attention it was receiving. There is just something so unique and charming about this game that you really couldn't hate it, especially going in blind. The combat is interesting and they really mean it when you don't have to kill anything. You wouldn't even want to given how loveable the characters are (seriously, you can tell so much love and effort has been put into the characters and their personalities). The music is also astounding, and it did fill me with   determination.   Not to mention it is also highly memorable and just plain good to listen to, especially in boss battles. This game is just so full of charm and love that I can't wait to give it a second playthrough. I heard the fandom was horrid, but I was lucky enough to stay away from it as well as spoilers before I played it. I personally think everyone should play this game, just once, and form their own opinion on it. I would usually joke in my reviews but this game deserves all the love it gets.

I have no clue how one guy, with such a small team, could create a game that feels so ALIVE! The characters are likable and unique, and depending on your choices, they will change along with your choices, you shape what they become, and some characters are VERY interesting, with theories about their backstories and origins. The story, even if it may seem simple at the beggining, it gets so much more interesting and complex as you play, you discover the truth in the world of Undertale and what has happened before your arrival... and how what you are doing now relates to it all in the bigger picture. The music... god, every song gets better and better as you progress, and each theme for each character fits perfectly, and they all have such awesome melodies, basically this game has the best soundtrack ive ever heard in a video game.  This is the first game ive ever played that has delivered such an emotional impact to me, in any game ever. It reminds me somehow of the movie Bridge to Terabithia, the kind of feeling that all of this could be a childs daydream, but brought into a whole new world of possible darkness and madness, with the player choosing what becomes of their 'timeline'...  The 4th wall is broken many times in this game, usually by the more powefull characters, one of the boss fights uses this aspect to make it one of the best boss fight experiences EVER. Its also so cool how the game uses key game words like 'SAVE' in different ways, its used in the song 'SAVE the world', which obviously dosnt mean save it to your file, but save it... and how different characters interact with the options you choose like 'SPARE' or 'ACT' when you choose them.  Overall, Undertale is an amazing game!  But on a personal level, i honestly do think this is the best game ive ever played, ive never experienced anything like this game, and considering such a small team created this and the same creator made this AWESOMELY wonderful soundtrack, i have no IDEA how so much awesome could be stuffed into one person.

So this game isn't second coming of jesus like some make it to be, there are some technical problems/limitations because of gamemaker and minor issues here and there which could've been easily fixed or improved.   However most of the issues are really minor and rest will bury under how well done the rest of the game is made. I think I remember every single character I came across, I remember the journey trough the differend areas, there didn't seem to be single bad song, I had a big smile on my face for almost half of the game and every time I have that smile I remember why I'm loving games as much as I do. (also wide range of other feelings from that to nervous breakdown..in a good sort of way?)  I heard many things about what kind of game this was before even buying it, most of them were really vague because of spoilers of course. Game does use many differend approaches and mechanics, but never seems to latch onto one specific one, so going trough the story as it unfolds gives the best experience, instead of thinking the game as visual novel, rpg, puzzle game, meta or anything else. Just play is as it is and get that really nice, warm positive feeling from playing it.   Oh, and remember to get the full ending. It's really worth it.    And maybe, somewhere in the future, there will be console release which means game getting ported to bit more proper engine, with all the minor technical difficulties ironed out and proper full dualshock 4 support. Just maybe.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Kaipa se pitää heittää positiivinen arvostelu positiivisten arvostelujen pinoon.   Tämä peli ei ole mikään jeesuksen toinen tuleminen mitä jotkut antavat ymmärtää, gamemakerin takia pelissä on teknisiä ongelmia/rajoituksia ja pieniä juttuja siellä täällä jotka olisi voinut helposti korjata tai parantaa.   Mutta kaiken kaikkiaan suurin osa ongelmista on hyvin pieniä ja peli on niin hyvin tehty että loput ongelmat unohtuvat. Taidan muistaa joka ikisen hahmon jonka kohdalle osuin, muistan matkan jokaisen alueen läpi, pelissä ei tuntunut olevan yhtään huonoa kappaletta, minulla oli vähintään puolet peliajasta iso hymy naamalla ja joka kerta kun minulla on se hymy naamalla muistan miksi rakastan pelejä niin paljon. (ja sen lisäksi laaja skaala muitakin mielialoja siitä hymystä hermoromahdukseen asti...sillein hyvällä tavalla?)  Kuulin monenlaista juttua siitä minkälainen peli on ennen sen ostamista, suurin osa oli hyvin suuntaa antavia ettei paljastaisi pelistä mitään. Peli käyttää hyvin montaa lähestymistapaa ja mekaniikkaa, mutta ei ikinä tunnu oikein tarttuvan mihinkään yksittäiseen juttuun, joten yksinkertaisesti pelin pelaaminen antaa parhaan kokemuksen, sen sijaan että miettisi peliä visuaalinovellina, roolipelinä, pulmapelinä, metana tai minään muuna. Pelaa peli niinkuin se on olemassa ja koe se mukana, lämmin positiivinen fiilis jonka sen pelaamisesta saa.   Niin, ja muista saada täysi lopetus. Se on enemmän kuin sen arvoista.    Ja ehkä joskus tulevaisuudessa peli saa konsoliversion, joka meinaa pelin siirtymistä hieman paremmalle moottorilla, jolloin kaikki pienet tekniset ongelmat ovat tiessään ja pelissä olisi täysi ohjaintuki dualshock 4 ohjaimelle. Toivottavasti. ",

I mean, if you like puns, irony, memes, anime, Earthbound, and/or self-awareness cuteness you might actually start foaming at the mouth while playing this, and then go into shock. But even those who aren't familiar with some (or any) of the concepts mentioned above, commonplace in certain internet sub-cultures, Undertale is still worth a try if nothing else for its interesting blend of Japanese RPG battle systems and old school arcade 'bullet hell' shooters. But that would be selling the world and story of Undertale short.  You play as a child who has fallen down into an underground ruin that is home to a large community of monsters. Throughout the game you will meet, greet, fight, and/or befriend lots of very charmingly designed characters, all of whom are richly developed and often heart-achingly relatable. All of this is reflected both in the main world exploration and in battle. Though Undertale does at a glance look and feel like an amalgam of numerous games of also numerous genres with all the inherent pastiches and tropes therein, I've never really played anything quite like it. It takes a lot from other games but manages through immense ingenuity carves out an existence all its own. There's really nothing else out there currently quite like it.  The game is about 7-8 hours long if you play leisurely your first time through, but multiple playthroughs are absolutely necessary to get the most out of the game, due to the fact that the story and ending change in subsequent runs. Lots of games do this, but not to the extent that Undertale does. As I said before, this game is very self-aware, and this reflects on the new game plus (or plus plus, depending on which ending you get first).   So in short. Undertale is a charming little gem, with lots of fun characters, a unique battle system, and greatly rewards multiple playthroughs, and when I say that it rewards you for doing so, I really, seriously mean it. For me, the game didn't truly click until I played it a second time. It's only then that Undertale cracks open its soul and reveals to you the secrets of its universe.  It's real cool. Buy it.",

Neutral route can happen anytime by not killing all monsters, and killing all monsters will cause a genocide ending.  However, theres 1 secret route you can take if you didnt kill anyone at all (and I mean ANYONE), that is the pacifist ending (good ending) which will happen if you follow the requirements (must also beat neutral ending).  This game is very deep, and there are some crazy stuff that involves you (in person). I cant say much, you'll know it when you go very deep in the game.

Its hard for me to be too specific about these characters without spoilers, but these characters are great. Each of them has a massive amount of dialogue, and maybe I just like reading, but I inspected EVERYTHING in this game. NPC's were interesting and quirky, environments and music was thought and feeling provoking, but it gets out of the way when you need to focus on an objective. The game has a ton of repaly value, but after the second or third playthrough, you may find yourself bored with the characters you've interacted with again and again, but dependant on your playthrough, characters act differently, and the environments are different. The gameplay is different, utilizing a galaga style screen on which you dodge your foes attacks. This make your skill feel important to winning fights, and is also a very cool mechanic in general! This is where I would put a quote or in joke for people who have already beaten the game, but you couldn't understand. What's that look? Am I wrong?  ...   Villains were hated. Villains were killed.

Though I wouldn't normally do a rating system like this, I'm just organizing my thoughts so I'm not biased towards one element of the game.  Soundtrack: 10/10 - Loved everything about it. (Even if you don't like chiptunes, the composition of them was great) Story: 6/10 - It made sense half way through, but eventually I got kind of lost. Sorta weak, but it was enough, or expected. Characters: 8/10 - They really stood out in personality, but I didn't feel any special connection to them whatsoever (like this weird fanbase). The reason I gave 8 is because I liked that the monsters fought weren't just mindless 'robots' (figuratively) that were put into the game to be killed. They were beings that weren't ment to be killed. (key theme) Functions/Gameplay: 6/10 - I liked the combat system (much like traditional rpgs) and scattered puzzles, but that's about it. The gameplay felt dragging at times, but was still enough. Though I liked the puzzles, they weren't impressive. I didn't feel any overwhelming challenge (expect for Asgore). Graphics: Not good, but who cares?  Avg Score: 75/100 (not including graphics) ",

Namely, in terrible fan made stuff where people add in their own OCs (Original Characters) or causing controversy with one of the characters because said character belongs to a fandom that isn't looked too highly upon. However, don't let these things get in the way in enjoying this game. As the trailer says, you have the choice to kill or to spare every enemy and boss you fight. Also, every enemy in the game can be spared, but some are tougher than others and you might not figure it out the first time. Highly advise against looking at any guides until you beat the game once and are feeling like trying to go down a different path in the game.  Now that I said some good about the game itself there is some bad, and the community isn't one of it. The game's graphics are retro styled (8-Bit) and some might not like this type of art style. Also, the fights, while they are turn based, involve you dodging projectiles and later on this gets to the point where the game becomes very bullet hell-ish. Sometimes even frustratingly so. However, the worst offenders of this are two bosses that only appear in one of the paths you can take in the game. Thankfully, there's no achievements in this game so there isn't really any reason to play the game anymore than once if you feel so inclined.  That's about it and I hope you enjoy this game about as much as I did.",

            "review_text": "I feel like the market is oversaturated with indie games using pixelated/retro art that reminds me of the games I grew up with. Honestly, that was one thing holding me back from my initial purchase of Undertale. I figured 'Oh, it's just another one of those games. Nothing special.' But the gaming community was going crazy over it, so I decided to look further. Let me state something clearly:    I was wrong. This game is something special.   I'd also like to note I won't be adding any pictures because I feel as though it would ruin some of the surprise and fun that Undertale offers.   Basic Premise : Without giving too much away, you find yourself (a human) in the underground world of monsters. These monsters don't want you here, in fact most want you dead. Your goal is to get out of this world, but to do so you must make your way through all of these monsters. What makes this unique is that you don't have to kill everyone. In fact, each enemy has a special way you can 'ACT' that it will pacify it. For example, you can choose to encourage a sad looking enemy, or laugh at the joke of a stand-up comic enemy. That alone makes this a unique experience.   Graphics : As previously stated, it uses a retro style, pixelated art. Though I feel that it has become commonplace to see this style of art, it is stylized enough that it stands out. I normally am not big on these types of graphics, but I really enjoyed the overall feel it gave to the game. And after all, this game was more an experience than anything else. I believe that this graphic style added to this.   Sound : The soundtrack is wonderful. It fits the game and tone perfectly, there are many different types of tunes which adds more character to the experience. Just like the graphics it was a solid choice and added a lot to the game.   Gameplay : This game is structured around 3 things. The unique battle system, some spatial puzzles, and the clever writing. The battle system is like a standard turn-based RPG where you can attack your enemy or choose to do a different action. Based on what you do, the enemy reacts. Ultimately you can choose to spare them or kill them in most cases. What makes this unique is that when the enemy attacks, you dodge their attack via a small box where you control your 'heart' and dodge their attack (think old-school bullet hell style). Later on, they introduce different complexities like certain colors which have certain effects and so on.  The spatial puzzles were fine. Nothing we haven't seen before, but a nice break between the battles. I can't say I loved them, but I understand that there had to be something else. Maybe additional variety would have added to the experience since most puzzles take similar forms. That being said, they were tight enough and I can't complain.  Where I think the game truly shines is the writing. For those familiar with Paper Mario or EarthBound, it is heavily inspired by that feel. The writing is comical, over the top, but can get very dramatic as well. Also, the sense of humor is really clever and hilarious. I found myself actually laughing as I was playing (which probably made me look crazy). Also, the characters the game introduces are all great. Every one of them has a distinct personality and is delightfully over-the-top. Where many games attempt to be funny, this one truly accomplishes the goal, all while avoiding being cliche and boring.    Overall : I will admit this too: during the prologue, I was having trouble getting excited about this game. I put it down several times and just couldn't get hooked. Once I got through that segment and saw the title pop up again, I didn't put the game down. Seriously. I played the rest of it in one sitting.   That however brings up another point: if you are the type of person who likes long games for your money, this may not be the best fit. I completed the game in about 5-6 hours. That being said, there are multiple endings and different choices (as well as secrets) in the game, so plenty of replayability. It retails at 10 dollars on Steam with no sale, so that choice is up to you.  I will state again, though. This game is something special. I played EarthBound and thought that the story was good, as was the writing, but I didn't think it aged very well. This game gave me that same feeling, while bringing something new in the battle system. Even with its slow start, I am happy to have played this game. It's one of those ones that you will think about after you've finished it, not just barrel through and move onto the next one.  I recommend this game to any RPG fans, especially those of specific ones like EarthBound, Paper Mario, the Mario and Luigi games, etc. If you're on the fence, give this one a try. Power through the prologue and I don't think you'll be disappointed.  ",

The graphics weren't too fancy, the storyline seemed pretty bland and predictable, but when it went on sale, I decided, why not just buy the game?  Before I start talking about the game, let me mention that the music is SO DAMN GOOD. I could listen to the music by itself anytime, it's that good. The emotional rollercoaster this game puts you through is very unexpected, and the characters, no matter how insignificant they may seem at first, all play a very important role and demonstrate their own unique personalities. There is so much to say about how beautiful this game is, yet it's so hard to actually describe in words. My only advice is to just buy the game. Your life will change from that moment on.  One thing to note while playing the game though. DO NOT look up any hints or anything online. Play this game blindly, and rid yourself of any distractions. Fully immerse yourself into this game, and you will come to know what Undertale truly is.",

Sorry it might be a little long because there's so much things I want to say about it. It's probably going to be a messy review haha.   A friend told me to play the game so I looked it up, I saw the trailers and I told her 'meh graphics are ♥♥♥♥ it's weird and stuff... not the kind of game I like', a week later she got a crack of the game and FORCED ME TO PLAY THE GAME AT SCHOOL. AT SCHOOL. I was a bit reluctant but I did.   Yes I was kind and innocent and I got    rekt by Flowey    and it made me laugh I was like 'the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with this game' so I just kept playing. (and bought it on steam ofc :^) ) The game is full of stupid jokes, so stupid that you end up laughing at them, sometimes the game didn't even make any sense to me, I couldn't understand how someone had the idea to make such a brillant game.   Then there is the story. Oh god. I didn't expect that. You're a little boy/girl you fall down to a 'world' full of monsters and you just wander in there meeting new people and trying to go back to the surface. Pretty simple right?  BUT. Once you get why you fell there. What happened here. And what you're doing, your choices. You heart just breaks.  The very begining of the game you discover everything, you laugh at everything and slowly you begin to understand that there's so much more behind this. You can say whatever you want, that I'm weird or ♥♥♥♥ but I literally cried 5 minutes straight during the game and I had to stop for a while because I couldn't do anything about it, I just couldn't hold back the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tears.   What surprises me is all the choices you can make and what are the consequences of it. I've never seen a game going this far. All the details you can check, the conversations you can have with the monsters and what they say after every turn during a 'fight'. THERE IS SO MUCH CONTENT FOR A 10$ GAME JESUS.  And if you replay the game SOME THINGS DO CHANGE BECAUSE OF YOUR PAST SAVE ISN'T IT AWESOME?   The OST is perfect, every song is wisely chosen for the bosses / scenes etc. My favourite one is definitly 'Undertale' and 'Waterfall'.   I think everyone can feel different about the game but this one really hit me deep in the feels because of some things that happened in my life. I couldn't resist and got my very first tattoo of one of my favourite scene and probably the best quote of the game and it means a lot for me.  ' * But it refused.   &lt;3 ' If you didn't play the game yet, you'll know later how beautiful this quote is.  This game is one of the best I've ever played if not the best.  Buy it and play it.

The music is just as great as the story and every song fits the theme of the area or battle perfectly. The design and art style of the game is nice and colorful, although nothing too spectacular. The only real flaws with the game are the fanbase and the game's replay value. I'm not the first one to mention the fanbase warning, but I'm sure the majority of these other reviews don't mention the fact that the game is sadly only truly fully playable about 3 times before you get bored, and that's including the multiple endings. One thing I recommend with this game is to go in blind to have the best experience and do it your own way for at least the first few playthroughs. If you want to get a specific ending but you couldn't really figure out how, just check online. The game is definitely a work of art and one of the best indie games I've ever played next to Shovel Knight.",

It handles new perspectives of play by using a style that felt familiar because of its clear homage to vintage titles. 'Undertale' forces you to consider each one of your actions, from the deaths you cause others to your own; we as a gaming community have become so desensitized to killing NPCs that the 'nobody has to die' paradigm of this particular story really puts into perspective the damage we have done all through our years playing.  Another thing I appreciated most of all was that the game mechanics employed the old-fashioned style of teaching the player how to play as they progress, instead of spoon-feeding instructions or building skills in banal fetch quests. I was reminded of classics such as Megaman X because of how important actually paying attention to memetic patterns actually mattered when it came to successfully solving any of the numerous puzzles presented throughout the plot. With a compelling story, original characters, hilarious jokes, and original world, 'Undertale' is everything I didn't realise I had been sincerely craving in a game in such a long time. Its goodness is genuine and in no way contrived, and never takes itself too seriously. If you want a game whose simplicity begins and ends with its controls, look no further.

You're gonna like it, I promise.  It has funny jokes and a tasteful sprinkle of dank memes as well. Very simple, shmup-like gameplay that will get you hooked very easily, even on the harder fights that are gonna take you at least 5-10 attempts, way more if you're not used to this kind of stuff.  Some are outrageously difficult, but every bit of progress feels rewarding, as you uncover new lines of dialogue or new attacks by your enemy.

You finally get to this part that you assume is nearly the end of the game and think to yourself 'wow, this is a short game.' and then, out of nowhere, the game is completely different. The story line comes to life, you get attached to characters, you start making decisions that matter, facing foes goes from feeling like walking through a cave without repels to meeting new characters and in turn new friends. Plot twists everywhere! Emotions smacking you in the face! You realize what you thought was the end was not even half way through the game! You check the clock and realize that it's 5 am and you've been playing for 8 hours straight! How many times must the game end before it's truly the end?

It sets up a situation, and then you the player choose how to resolve it, and live with the consequences. The point is that the feelings you develop playing this game are entirely your own. The game doesn't say 'Happily Ever After.' You create the ending and then its up to you to decide if it was happy or not.  This game has something that RPG's generally just do not; depth. Depth doesnt mean there's a lot to see or do. It doesn't mean that there's a ton of customization or enemies to fight. When you're playing a game with true depth, you recognize it because you wonder how things could have gone differently. There are layers to events in the game. The world changes because you changed it. It's not like the RPG Maker swill you see where you push a button to make the character say the thing, and then come back hours later and the character says the thing again because that's the THEN which comes after the IF of pushing the button in front of the character. I hate backtracking and yet I went back through the entire game 3 times throught the course of the game just to talk to everyone I had met and see how they were doing. I hadn't planned on doing it, but there was a reason I went back to see someone, and while I was there I just sort of tought 'I wonder how that person is doing' and things progressed as such.  I can not reccomend this game enough. It's the kind of experience that shows how an enteractive medium is so unique. This is a story that could never be told outside a video game. It's the kind of story that may challenge your understanding of what video games should be, or it may not depending on who you are when you play it. It all depends on you. That's how great games can make a player feel, the master of their own fate. That's what makes games special. It's funny, it's dramatic, it's inspiring, and god damnit the gameplay is fun and evolves through the entire game. The controls are crisp and satasfying, and the soundtrack is the first thing you'll download after you finish the game. Play Undertale, you deserve it!",

My first run was a fully-pacifist run, but I was told that I should have beaten the game on a normal run in order to get the real pacifist ending. At least I'll have another reason to do it again after my second run...  I've never been a huge fan of fighting in general, so I was really glad to be given an option to win every battle without having to hurt the opponent (save for one occasion - you can still spare it). That's right, instead of having your character forcing you into morally ambiguous fights, YOU are the character, and YOU choose the outcome of every encounter. The combat mixing bullet-hell-style dodging, as well as interesting mechanics, was a lot of fun to use while still being quite challening, especially at certain points.  The graphics are very reminescent of the Mother series, and it works quite well. This game is one of the very few instances where the retro art style doesn't come off as lazy and pseudo-artistic 'depth'; the game benefits from it, it probably wouldn't have been as immersive with another style. The soundtrack is excellent and fits the situations.   Moving on to the story... Well, I don't want to spoil it for anyone. As for the pacifist run, it was really touching, the characters were charming enough to make you care about them, and basically every monster had its own special thing. It was a very captivating trip, and made me feel good by the end. After many twists (and about 11 hours), I finally got the ending I wanted. I was happy with the outcome of my efforts and I was having a great day. I was ready to close the game for now, feeling good about what I had accomplished.  But I didn't. I won in the way that Flowey defined as 'victory' - I got what I wanted, but I decided I'd try the opposite way out of curiosity... and take the genocide route...  This was a terrible mistake. Don't be an idiot like me, once you get the ending you originally aimed for, just stop there. I feel terrible now, and it's too late to go back. I never thought I'd feel this sorry for fictional characters, I was not prepared.    The creator of this game knows what he's doing. I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "It's taken me awhile to figure out what to say about Undertale. For me, it was a game that came out of nowhere. It looked interesting and had good reveiws to say the least. It doesn't need much help. The only thing I saw at first was some fanart someone on Tumblr posted.   So, why would I pay $9.99 for a game I know absolutely nothing about... I honestly have know idea... Maybe it was just that picture of Toriel I saw...  What can I say about Undertale? Well, I've putten about eleven hours of my weekend into it. It started off normal enough. JRPG with a morality index and a splash of humor. Actually, make that a pool of humor. There were quite a few parts of this game that made me genuinely laugh. I started the game and played for about two hours. The next day, I played for... perhaps eight hours straight? I couldn't pull myself away. I lost track of time. The story was so captivating and the pacing so well executed.   Undertale manages to not blend together, but rather feel as a complete and definable story. And I really do mean story. No Mary Sueing and no unintentional tropes. It stands apart. It made me feel engaged the whole journey. It's the first game in a long time to make me feel something other than adrenaline or on-edge fear... It's the only game I've played that put me on the edge of crying...  If you're a person who doesn't care much about story, but rather graphics and gameplay, this isn't the game for you. If you despise bullet-hell combat, this is definitley not a game for you. I love stories that resonate, and Undertale delivered. From unique characters and hilarious dialouge, to overwhelming sadness and regret of your decisions, all the proper elements are present. It keeps you on your toes as the plot is revealed through a powerful narrative.  This is a game will remember everything you do. Every mistake you make. Every swing you take. It's watching you. Even on my pacifist playthrough, I would question my decicions. I don't think I could do a genocide route. Not after the ending I got.  I can't really say much more without spoiling the game it self. So, yeah. I really liked Undertale, Toriel is the best goat mom, and highly recommend it. I don't know if I can play it again though. What does that mean? I guess you'll have to find out for yourself.",

And the humour is even on and off lost on me. Battle mechanics are unbelievably simplistic to the extent of being there just for the sake of it.  I will love Undertale until the day I pass away. Undertale is not great if you were to mark it down on its individual criteria, but how the criteria per se harmoniously meshed in the game. Never have I been so impressed by the way the music of the game had its own story telling or how effectively it injected in subtle context via the spartan turn-based bullet hell sequences, or how it let certain characters accompany you throughout the entire trip with conversations on the phone...

Yes, it includes the AU's, the cosplays, the fanarts, the mods and more. The gameplay mechanic is really neat. You got three routes to go from which are the Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide. I won't add any in-depth meanings of these but you should try to go blindly.   BUT REMEMBER , never do livestreams or letsplays with idiots telling you what to do in the game (i.e. 'dont kill anyone pls') because one wrong move will trigger these 'fans' and shout at you at your mistake. I suggest that you play it yourself. They are also fans of this beloved RPG game but there's a widely accepted rule that you should just let new players play the game as they are. Let them play  blindly .  I went to some random YouTuber's Undertale letsplay to see and take a look of the comments. Unfortunately, I found out that atleast half the comments are people telling the YouTuber to not kill someone and do the complete True Pacifist route. This is the only problem I have with the game.

            "review_text": "TL;DR BELOW  This is the first bullet-hell game I have ever played (note to self, never play bullet-hell games again), the game has a fairly decent story to it and with a lot of interesting characters.    PLEASE UNVEIL SPOILER TAGS AT OWN RISK     PLEASE UNVEIL SPOILER TAGS AT OWN RISK     PLEASE UNVEIL SPOILER TAGS AT OWN RISK   You have been warned three times.  STORY: In the game you learn that there was once a time where Humans and Monsters ruled the Earth together before a war waged between the two. The Humans were victorious during the war and locked all the last standing monster into the 'The Underground' with the use of magic, making sure they were unable to escape without passing    The Barrier   . The Underground can be access through a large hole on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere where it was once noted that whoever went into the mountain never came back.  There are 3 endings plus 2 bonus endings the Player can recieve... True Pacifist Route:    Complete the story w/o killing anyone and be friends with everyone.    Neutral Route:    Complete the story killing only some characters, not befriending everyone.    Genocide Route:    Complete the story killing pretty much everyone.    And the two bonuses Dirty Hacker: Tamper with too many game files. Post  Genocide: Doing a Pacifist Run after a Genocide Run gives you a... 'special'... ending.     GAMEPLAY: Just a reminder this was my first bullet-hell game I ever played and boy did I ever so many times felt like breaking my keyboard. But for the people who are interested/good at bullet-hell games, you should definetly give this game a shot, 70% garantee you're not going to regret it.  CHARACTERS: The NPCs you encounter have A LOT of personality, ranging from Skeletons with Puns to Anthropomorphic Goats with PIE, honestly the detail Toby adds with the characters just really make you feel like your at home and helps you relate to them. Extra points for making characters with different sexualities.  GRAPHICS: I   personally   feel like 2D games more appealing enviroments than 3D games do. My favorite example is the area    Waterfall   , it's detail just had me wowing when I first saw it.  SOUNDTRACK: Yes, some of the songs may just be re-editted versions of another song in the game, but they still have charms to them. Especially the Final Boss themes, they just feel so exciting to listen to and it really helps get your blood pumping and your hands shaking.  COMMUNITY:  Unfortunately, I feel like the Undertale community is just a redux of the FNaF community, just in a different game. But, weirdly enough, I'm more proud of being an absolute fan of Undertale than being an fan at FNaF   JUST DON'T, THEY MADE SKELETON PORN WORK SOMEHOW.  Let me just say that not every person who likes Undertale is bad... but majority of them just rub the game in your face, claiming it's the best, etc.    NEW ",

I just want to add that if you want the best this game has, go all in and kill nothing, or go all out and kill so much nothing spawns in any room. The middle road has the most boring ending and it's more filling to pick a side. Ethier side, this game it enjoyable in the idea that you truely set the story by your heart in battle and in some moments. It is worth buying and playing, just to see what this game has to offer, from the world and the people in it, to how you can shape it by your power. Simply enjoy this small game that has done so much right and more. If you are a fan of 'off the beaten path' RPGs with weird fighting gameplay and a goofy world filled with colorful monsters and a story you can be a part of, it is a must buy. If not, there's videos of people showing it off, fan art that grows bigger by the day, or try to ignore it, but I have a feeling people will be talking about this game for a while. In short, this game is almost the most perfect RPG. If you don't like RPGs, there's plenty more games to be played and loved, but I, and many others, will love this gem.",

Well, I'll try and tell you more about this game and let me say, the hype is justified on a large scale.  To start of, the game and it's character act differently depending on how you play the game, e.g violently or not. They will also notice if you've restartred the game as if they've already seen you. Is this new? No, no it's not but that does not mean that Toby Fox did a fine job in creating strong connections towards the games characters through this method.  The game works as a standard JRPG with an action sequens thrown into the battle. This is something I've pretty much never seen anywhere else. As said before, each battle offers you different ways to approach them.  Humor is a big part of the game and it's very dialouge heavy. This is what might turn some people away from this game. A large portion of the games humor surrounds youth and nerd cultures like anime, games, internet memes etc. Wich means that alot of the jokes can go over some heads.  Lastly, the design is amazing. The soundtrack is in perfect sync with the battle and helpes create an atmosphere.  As a summary, if you like RPG, internet humor (or just humor generally but internet humor is the biggest theme) and alot of dialouge with characters then this should already be in your library.  9/10",

I'm not saying it's all bad, I'm just not built for bullethell, but it spikes up in the final battle. I'm not saying it has to be nerfed just for my case, for there are those out there that love bullethells and want a challenge. I'm just not built for it.  Another thing I guess is, you have to beat the game twice to either get the Pacifist or Genocide ending... and there apparently are other endings... but the game's good enough I think it's worth a replay. As I said, I'm not built for buellethells, so you can completely ignore this con section, and still play it and have a wonderful time.",

It's one of those games with writing so good, you'll even be checking item descriptions and examining things multiple times just to hear what the game has to say.  You've probably heard that the game lets you choose your own path. If you play passively, Undertale has one of the most emotional, heartwarming, and memorable stories I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  However... If you choose to take the violent route, Undertale becomes one of very, very few games that lets you be a completely unsympathetic and unbridled villain. You're a murderer, and the game doesn't let you forget it. The story changes from being about a child trying to escape the world they've fallen into, to the residents of that world trying to stop you from murdering everyone they love. Your actions will make you feel terrible. Character deaths have weight behind them, and your actions will be remembered, and the outcome will be grim.  Some people see this as a flaw, the game treating you like the bad guy and scolding you for your actions. But, I believe that it's a very interesting take on things. You ARE the bad guy. And you're TERRIBLE. You're killing everybody, for no reason! Games are very rarely willing to put the player in that sort of position. Undertale does, and it does it with flying colors.  Give this game a shot. Go in with an open mind and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It is my favorite RPG of all time, though I personally don't consider it as a traditional RPG. This game is nearly flawless in every way, and I hope it attains the legacy of other phenominal indie games, such as Cave Story and Hotline Miami. It certainly deserves it.  As a lazy game designer, I've often pondered the idea how a game could merge good gameplay and story together without one overtaking the other. Some games have too much story, and end up having too many cutscenes or too much dialog. Some games focus on gameplay and don't have a story. Sometimes the game feels like you're just watching a movie that makes you do stuff here and there. It's a tricky balance to create, and isn't something one can just jump into.  Undertale nails this. It balances this concept of a flawless merge of story and gameplay near perfectly. The dialog is generally short, sweet, gets to the point, but at the same time it doesn't feel like it's lacking at all. The story is unique, engaging, and always makes you want to keep going, see what happens next, find out more about the curious world. The world and characters are deep, well designed, and quirky. The music is catchy, fun, and always conveys the mood perfectly. I don't know how such a small dev team put this much love into this game.  A lot of people say this game is a lot like Earthbound. I personally think this game is far better than Earthbound. Earthbound's combat system was dull, there really wasn't much input you as a player had, and  boy  did you have to grind (which involved a lot of dying, especially for new RPG players) Undertale's combat system is unique, not only in that it heavily influences the story, but it engages the players in a way that will never feel like you're just grinding away. It's easy to understand and throws new concepts in constantly. You can either go for the regular HIT AND KILL route that most RPGs go with, or you can go with the unique SPARE mechanic, in which you convince your foe to buzz off. Conving your foe to do so plays quite a bit like a text based Punch-Out, in a way. You have to experiment and figure out the correct order to calm your foes in order to proceed. It's way more interesting than just wacking everything over the head. Defending will be relevant no matter what, and wow it's fun. Each monster has a neato pattern for you to dodge, and the game never lets that concept grow dry. Every single new monster has a totally unique pattern, and some even throw in entirely new mechanics. It's so much fun, and it never grows old.  I beat Undertale, but the best part is, there's still a TON of stuff I've never even seen, though I don't feel like my inital playthrough was lacking in the slightest. There's multiple routes to reveal the entire story, see everything from a different angle, learn 'What would happen if I had done this instead of this?', it's honestly brilliant. Yes, visual novels have done this too, but never this interesting.   I only have one gripe with this game, and it's very minor; The humor. Not as a whole, honestly I was laughing my rear off at some parts of this game, but just certain jokes will likely fly past some people. For example,   the Tsunderplane joke will likely go over anyone's head if they've never heard of a Tsundere  . Other than a few jokes that only certain kinds of nerds will get, this game is still hilarious. I just thought some jokes won't appeal to some people, and may not even be relevant in the future. Which would be a shame, because this game deserves a LONG legacy.  I love this game. I  really, REALLY  love this game. This game is a wonderful experience that nearly anyone can enjoy, regardless of their skill level or experience with RPGs. It's like a video game version of Disney Land, and much cheaper. Toby Fox, thank you so much. What are you doing this Sunday? Can I take you to dinner? I'll foot the bill. Would you like me to be your personal foot stool? Can I buy you multiple dogs?

You'll either adore it, or you'll get little from it. This depends heavily on if you are the type of person who can set aside the random-encounter gameplay and breathe in the characters and the setting. This game's heart and soul is the journey, ambience, humour and unexpected twists, and not in just raw stimulation. Y'know, like classic RPGs tend to be. There is as much melodrama as there is sneaky subtleties, and even when you think you see something coming from a mile away it can still slip past your (emotional) guard. At least, it did with me. Several times.  It is far more than the sum of it's parts, and should come with a surgeon general's health warning warning : If you're a big softy, this game will stab you right in the feels gland if you let it, and the soundtrack will continue to murder your emotions double-dead long after you get the true ending if you dare to revisit the catchy, upbeat yet haunting melodies. The less preconceptions, spoilers and hype you have before going in the better. If in doubt, resist the temptation to look at lets plays for info and just try the demo on the dev's page. If you like the few demo characters and appreciate the playful but lonely feel of the game, then you're good to go. Even then, the demo zone is quite sparse compared to the main game.  What someone might judge to be a shallow, childish and hamfistedly false-retro game, it quickly reveals a deeper and more charming experience than your average nostalgia-goggles throwback. You get a side-order of surprising grimness and disturbitude here and there too. What you would be forgiven for thinking is static gimmick of a combat system actually springs into a number of mounting surprises throughout the game. Though the game does maintain it's whimsical, cartoonish theme, it manages some great shifts of tone. I'm hard to make laugh, but this game got regular and genuine chuckles out of me from start to finish, not to mention a number of times I started to seriously choke up. And dear god, the endings. A little confusing at first, but dear god the endings. It's not normal to feel 'withdrawal' from a videogame is it? I'm still stuck somewhere between afterglow and aftershock and it has been 48 hours since I finished the neutral-good and true endings. Even the evil ending is more than just a token nod to your actions, altering the narrative to fit your choice with surprising graveness.  ****The Good : **** -- The music couldn't possibly fit better. -- Even the nasty characters can be lovable little sh*ts. -- Humour that can sneak up on you when it wants to. -- It can also gutpunch and disturb you as much as warm your heart. -- You can eat bisicles and fried tennisballs. -- So much dog.  **** The Cautionary : **** -- If you can't attach to whimsical and playful themes, you may struggle to get into it. -- Some humour is deliberately unsubtle, and runs from sarcastic deadpan japes to deliberate dad jokes and on to slapstick and nerd culture references, your mileage may vary. -- The demo can paint the game a little too sparse, but is an overall good measure. -- This game will mess with your feelings, if you're a softy, you will likely hurt as much as you laugh. -- Easy difficulty, except for a few bosses in the 'bad' story route, but this does however leave the meat of the game unhindered by frustration. The bosses are cleverly designed so that a single fumble won't ruin your whole attempt. -- You're likely going to crave buying the soundtrack when you finish. &lt;3 -- The emotional reactions generate tons of hype, be careful that your expectations are not set so sky-high that you end up disappointed as a result. --   Consider doing the 'true pacifist' route first. It saves time and adds perspective to 'other' routes.      **** The Bad : **** -- Consider the theme of the game, it is comedy AND mutedly dark in a whimsical retro package. If you only appreciate fully-fledged and elaborate 'adult' writing then this may not be your flavour. -- The endings can be a little confusing if you breeze through them. Some things are implied or understated, and can be lost in the absolute wrecking ball of certain powerful events. If you don't pay attention to certain small details, you might miss something! -- The best (most involved) routes require you to devote to aggressively pursuing combat or to use only pacifism, so you must decide early and not deviate to save a full-length second playthrough for the best / worst endings, though the shades of neutral ending work in their own right. -- The evil 'no mercy' combat route has brutal difficulty spikes that may be too much for some... -- Not enough dogs. -- The game ends. Seriously. Why does it have to end?",

I wasn't sure I would like this game... it seemed like a homage to JRPGs, which I really dislike. So I pretty much ignored everyone saying what a great game Undertale is.   Well, I shouldn't have. What really makes the game shine are the amazing, tender characters, great music, extremely clever writing and gameplay mechanics that play with you while you play with the game.  There's nothing else really like it, it's just stunning how something so original can be so free of bugs and gameplay flaws.   The battle mechanics are so much better than any of the old JRPGs, though I hear they aren't totally unique. I haven't played any of the games that are said to have similar mechanics (paper mario? IDK).  The only things I don't like about Undertale is it's somewhat short (~6 hours) and some important plot information is too hidden. You need at least two playthroughs, careful searching and listening to npcs, as well making certain choices in order to find out what's really gone on in the past and going on now. It's good that the game doesn't spoonfeed you everything but I feel like some stronger hints could be dropped about a few important optional plot exposition points that I won't spoil.  I also only bought it after I saw some lets plays and streams, which was good because it convinvinced me to buy the game, but also bad because I feel like this game would be somehow better if I went into it completely unknowning. I do recommend going in completely 'blind' and not reading any guides, lets plays or wikis, try to be as unspoiled as possible. But even if you've had certain things spoiled, like I did, this is still something you should buy immediately and play.",

You wouldn't expect a game with simple graphics about monsters and talking flowers to be realistic, but in certain ways, it is. Everything you do, every person you kill or spare, has a profound effect, not just on one playthrough, but on all the rest afterwards. This game plays with your emotions in the most amazing way. It will make you feel bad about killing and even about RESETTING. It is incredibly well done, and well worth the $10 (or less on sale) you have to pay to get it.  And the music- if you listen to it outside the game, it sounds like video game music. Well done, but not earth-shattering. The great thing about the music isn't how it sounds outside, but how it flows with the game itself. Each soundtrack is perfectly tailored to the character and scene. And I'm not even going to TALK about the easter eggs. (So... Many... In the music... In the game...).  At first, I was hesitant to get it, but I'm glad I did. Just looking at the game, it looks cutesy, but not that interesting. However, after playing for a few minutes, I was hooked. Each playthrough only lasts about 9 hours or so, but there are so many ways to end it (Pacifist, True Pacifist, Genocide, all of the Neutral pathways, and those are just the single-playthrough ends).  I have no idea how Toby Fox fit this much awesome into such a small file, but he did. This game is also incredibly intelligent. Now, that may sound strange, but what I mean by that is that it knows. If you kill a certain character, feel bad and exit to a previous save file and spare them, one of that characters KNOWS. And this same character can mess with your save files. And exit the game without your permission. And view previous playthroughs. Creepy as heck, am I right? All of the characters, even the random encounter monsters, have so much character. They're all adorable, and sad, and amazing. Alright, I'm done rambling. Sorry this took so long. If you took the time to read this review, then thanks, and if this game isn't worth 10 measly dollars, I don't know what is. &lt;3 ",

It revels in the strange and funny personalities of each and every character you encounter, and it relishes from rocking back and forth between moments of touching sincerity, a uniquely silly brand of humor, and a surprising amount of gravitas.

I originally pirated this game as I expected it to be just eh. (it was in it's earlier days and I only had the impressions from the floods of undertale crap all over my tumblr feed. I came into this game expecting to be unimpressed and for the game to be sub-par.   I was sorely sorely mistaken.   This game is so good that I actually paid money AFTER pirating it (and admittedly sending to all of my friends) because I believe that this game is that worth it, and I wanted to write this review.    Now for the review. I don't know how to express it enough to explain how truly outstanding I think this game is, but I will try. I am thankful to whatever diety is out there for allowing me to spend my time on this game in particular. The story is absolutely perfect, it plays with your emotions like a thermostat, and it makes you feel like you actually have emotions to begin with. This is to the extent that I stopped .5 percent away from the end of the game just because I want to roam around and live in this world. The characters are easily loveable or hateable depending on your preference. The visuals are quaint, and perfectly match the type of game it is. Speaking of perfectly matching, THE MUSIC! (get ready for some extra length here, Skip to the break if you want to skip the music section) I have never heard music that better fits any select situation in ANY peice of media EVER. From the most obvious things of a fabulous robot's battle theme being a fast pased fasion-show-style song with an electro drum backing and some techno style sections, to the most deeply buried things such as the re-entrance of a dj character being fortold by a remix of his own battle theme. The music itself is also just well made, and being a little more than an ameteur producer myself, I applaud Toby Fox for such music that can both be dauntingly well fitting, and just great all toghether. I would pay for music like this, and I wish there was more music like this out there.   Break. Now on to the gameplay. It is actually NOT THE BEST out there, though it's pretty fun seeing what the next boss battle brings to the plate in terms of in battle visuals. The gameplay is just par to be honest. No real challenges to face while exploring, or interesting items to use that you can exploit to get to locations you arent supposed to get to. It's more of a taletale game with more exploration, and a bit of action sprinkled in. That's how I saw this game.  This game does offer a lot in the sense of control. You are given a lot of control over what you do. Each choice you make sometimes matters a lot, which is more that can be said of most telltale games and are most of the time irreversable. This adds even more to the realm of character development, as you see yourself as more of the character, and less of just a spectator.    TLDR; if you enjoy: great story, great character development, amazing music, smiling, crying, smiling and crying at the same time, being an obsessivly good person, or a murderous psycopath, moral dilemmas, long hallways, (spoilers [kinda]) endings that twist so much and so often that you arent sure what direction you were coming from to begin with (end spolers), addictions, goat moms, goat dads, goat brothers, dogs, skeletons, NOT flowers, cinnimon, butterscotch, snails, Having a bad time, and just a great game altogether...

The gameplay is a bit simple at first, but throws some neat curve balls here and there while still remaining enjoyable, the soundtrack is nicely done and adds very well to the overall experience, I don't want to go into characters too much for fear of spoilers and the like, but it's safe to say that they're probably the most memorable set in a game I've played in the last few years.

I first learned about only a week ago and fell in love with it the moment I saw it. It has amazing music that has me jamming out in the middle of a hard boss fight (MEGALOVANIA), lovable characters that make you smile, and brilliant dialogue that can be witty, heartfelt, and just downright hilarious.  The best part, though, is this. You know all that stuff that I just mentioned? Yeah, you have the power to destroy it all if you so choose. You can ravage the world, kill every character, and even lose that amazing, jamming music when it is replaced by that dark ambience thet gets ME scared. You can be an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to everyone or befriend everything and have some good fun. But the moment that you start to kill everything.....well...  Let's just say you're gonna be in for a BAD TIME.  Unless you enjoy being a soulless monster and a murderer, chances are, you're gonna be kind to everyone. Which is good.  On the off chance that you ARE a murderer, you are in for a treat. While the regular game (Pacifist Run) has a serene and lighthearted atmosphere filled with laughs and nice friends, the Genocide Run is not so happy. The atmosphere change is huge, and it is definitely somethng that you'll notice. In the Pacifist Run, the boss fights are hard but doable, and you get many different ones that usually will only take you one go. In the Genocide Run? Well... You're not so lucky. You get two boss fights. The catch? Holy jhsauighdsgfdsvjxchgvyxcfyds, they're THE HARDEST BOSS FIGHTS EVER. It took me hours to defeat the first one, and I still am having a VERY BAD TIME with the other!   My only hint for you future players is: Look for the patterns on the boss fight (of the Genocide Run) and memorize when they use what attack. Know when to heal and when to attack, and hopefully things will be a bit easier.  Anyway, if you want a game where your choices matter, this is also a very good game for you.  Every (and I mean EVERY) choice matters. Each one has some sort of importance, and the game remembers all of your choices, sometimes even in differing playthroughs. Let's say you play Genocide and then Pacifist. That Pacifist Run will be tainted from the leftovers of your killing spree, even though you already restarted the game and played with a blank slate.  Although this may seem like a bad thing, it hugely opens up the amount of possibilities of endings that the game has, so have a lot of fun trying to find them all (along with all of the secrets of the game).

            "review_text": "It is always astounding when a crowd funded game that promises more than what is status quo actually delivers. With Undertale, you are confronted with a very reflective choice on whether or not you wish to play the game as standard RPG fare or...if you are DETERMINED, you don't have to harm a soul.  Graphically, the game can be quite...lacking, but for all intents and purposes, the graphics barely hold any weight when in comparison to the writing that shines brightly amongst all else.  The story, again, is our bread and butter. A meta-beyond-meta is approached when expecting to try for all dialogue and story branch options, and characters feel like they have more importance than a typical jRPG. Whether they can be combated or not does not take away from the fact that the simple interactions you have with them shape what your journey may become.  Controls are simple, as they should be. No unnecessary gimmicks to try and differentiate from other indie RPGs (except for the bullet hell dodging, which isn't overly obnoxious.), all while keeping a player engaged in the spikes of difficulty, whether in combat or understanding the puzzles that are the different branching stories. Full directional movement, three interaction keys, and menus galore. Its really all you need.  My god, can we talk about the sound design though? While throughout the game you may see a blend of genre and musical mediums, there is a theme that lasts throughout many of the songs along the soundtrack. It creates a very fulfilling atmosphere in any situation, and honestly, it bears more weight than just some simple retro blips and beeps you may come to assume about a game such as this. Composition is fantastic, and I feel like there is a balance of melody that can't be compared when listening to AAA symphonic orchestral soundtracks.  In closing, there may be some stigma to what this game was built upon (Kickstarter, a Homestuck composer, the supposed furry fandom of the game's characters, etc.), but don't let those detract from the actual meat of the product. The character interactions, the silly dialogue, determination, and a compulsion to see what is beyond a typical jRPG playstyle of just save scumming and going on murderous rampages. At 6+ hours of initial gameplay, for the price that it is, I believe the game is totally worth just the first playthrough alone. This is a simple RPG with a lot to observe, and plenty of smart design choices which freshen up a muddled genre. Comparisons to Mother 3/Earthbound be damned, this is a game that can truly stand on its own.",

The 'Undertale' collective (i.e. the game, the official soundtrack, the free demo, the trailer, and even certain game files) are all distinct parts, each worth checking out on their own.   The game has an interesting NG+ mechanic that involves your choices in one playthrough being relevant to all future runs.  The Shoot-Em-Up based battle mechanic is interesting and used to its full potential.  The soundtrack, as well as the visuals designed by Toby Fox himself, are very stylized and pleasant. I know, the screenshots on this Steam page are very ugly, just rest assured that it looks much better in motion.  $10 is the default price for Undertale, and also is the exact amount that the game's worth to me. It's nice to see some modesty from an indie developer.     Cons:  The morality system is remarkably ham fisted. Enemies regularly try to kill you, unprovoked, throughout the entire game, but the game talks down to you if you choose to defend yourself. One possible route in particular is very presumptuous about your motivations for taking said path.  The narrative is a plain jane hero's journey from beginning to end.   The aforementioned narrative is also the main focus of the game, and nearly all of its merit is in its shock value. If you've played this game once (or, rather, once per possible ending), there's no reason to come back.   The game is horribly easy, except for two unique bosses, one of which reduces to rote learning.  Magnolia Porter shouldn't be allowed to draw anything, let alone contribute character designs for this game.  Undertale was clearly crafted to be memetic/'quotable' and pander to furries and tumblr users who use the word 'fandom' to describe themselves and talk about the creator of something they like using his/her first name like they're real-life buddies.

I would recommend this to ANYBODY who loves the mother/earthbound series and that likes superb and hilarious story.",

Undertale is a unique experience. One that I, personally, feel is best done on one's own, with as little knowledge going in as possible. The game is a unique JRPG-styled game where your hits are timed and you have full ability to dodge any enemy attack if you learn their patterns. It's simplistic, but it's very involved. And it feels excellent. The story is absolutely stellar. I won't go into detail, but I suggest doing a total pacifist run either your first or second time through. I feel it's the most satisfying. The music definitely shines too. I recommend the soundtrack if you don't mind putting out a little extra for this game. It's totally worth it.  All-in-all, it's my GotY of 2015. Not flawless, but certainly a game that I felt was a unique and worthwhile experience.",

Let me point out many peoples' gripes I see. I hear a lot that people think the game is too short. This in part is true (each run took me about 3-4 hours), but if you decide to do each ending then the game will take a while to 'complete'. Honestly, the biggest issue I have with this game isn't even the game's fault. The game has so much more of a rich experience if you know NOTHING about it. Going through the whole story clueless about what's going to happen, or what the ending is going to be made this game a hunderd times better.  Now that we have some of the problems out of the way, let's talk about what makes this game so amazing. The price is amazing. If I could get a game for $10 (not on sale) that let me go through an amazing adventure spending over 30 hours, I would do it again every single time. A lot of the tags for the game really show what makes it so great. The game has a magnifient soundtrack, and the reason I haven't bought the soundtrack on Steam for $10 is because it is useless when you can just play any song on YouTube for free. I am not going to potentially spoil the game for anyone, but the game's story is so rich. You feel so attached with the characters, and the world feels really big when it is in fact quite small. The tags say 'choices matter' (again, I'm not going to spoil the story) which the big overarching theme to this game, where the choices you make have an enormous effect on what happens. The game's art at first seems really strange, but as you play through the game more you realize how the art and the music form an amazing atmosphere and mood wherever you go. One thing that is not really a spoiler is telling you how great, and innovative the battle sequences really are. Being given the option to either kill or befreind an enemy with the action segments thrown in makes a huge aspect of the game really unique. There are so many more great things about this game, but I think that just reasons alone would give anyone a good incentive to buy this game.  I can't give a game a ten, ever. I feel that a game is never really perfect, and that I can always pick out some flaws. This game has to get the same treatment though. It does have its cons, but the pros almost completely overshadow those cons. I would have to give the game a 9/10 for the amazing experience it has given me, and not a ten for the sole reason that I wanted it to go on forever!",

I went a long time without finding any stories that truly pulled me in until I started playing this. The game's humor made me laugh so much at first, then it made me (want to) cry... then it made me smile. You don't have to kill anything in this game... not one single thing. Your choices matter. You will not spare a character and later be given a little 'hooray' for it, you will be given a huge change.  I believe the one and only true ending is that which you achieve being a true pacifist. Otherwise, you're playing the game wrong... however, I have yet to do the exact opposite. Maybe I won't even do it... but what I do know is that I'm satisfied with what I got.",

The combat system is unlike any other I've ever seen, completely out of left field for an RPG. But it works, and it works great. It's a cross between timing your attacks and a bullet-hell dodging minigame (mostly the bullet-hell), and it REALLY shines on the boss fights. Boy does it get creative with those.  I cannot and will not spoil the story of this game. It's truly something amazing and it has to be experienced for yourself. Don't look up any spoilers at all, you WILL regret it.   My total clock-in time was about 6 hours but I'm planning a second playthrough to get a different ending. Oh yeah, and this game has multiple endings OOPS SPOILERS.  Conclusion: Definitely worth your time and your money. And the soundtrack is BANGING IT'S SO GOOD. The Hotlands music is THE BEST EVER HNNNGGGH.  Edit: If you don't get the True Ending, go back and play it again and get it. It completely changed my perspective. Undertale is just plain beautiful.",

            "review_text": "I'm trying, awfully hard, to find a reason to dislike this game. Me writing this is a sign of utter defeat to the former.  Undertale is incredible. Period.  As a fairly basic RPG game, you quickly realize the story isn't quite what it seems, as one of this games unique mechanics is the power of choice. You CAN kill everyone you initiate combat with, act like a complete homicidal jerk to everyoe, or perhaps find ways to solve the problems of enemies you encounter, and resolve literally every encounter peacefully. I've found myself giggling or bursting right out laughing at many of the choices this encompasses, with some brilliant dialogue writing making every choice feel unique.   Enemy variety is limited, but doesn't fail to feel unique at every new encounter, and all with interesting combinations making combat a bit more interesting. Leading to my next point, combat is unlike anything I've seen before in a game, where your 'soul' literally becomes part of a brief bullet hell depending on how you manage your combat. This itself is fairly difficult at times to control, but is still incredibly fresh and new compared to selecting a simple combo or attack in any other RPG game.   The art style feels gentle on the eyes, but takes amazing strides later on in the game, getting very abstract and unique in the different worlds and levels.   As a sucker for chiptune/8 bit music, this game is giving me heart palpitations with how good the music is! I swear it's some of the best music in a game I've heard south of Shovel Knight or Castle Crashers.   All in all, I feel I can't say much else without getting into spoiler territory, because all I want to do is sing the praises I have for this game! At 10.99 CAD, I'm amazed the developer isn't asking more for this, as it's easily worth double the appraised value. If you can't afford it now, make it a plan to play this at some point. You won't regret it.  Addendum.  I just finished the game. I have no words to how incredible the ending was. When a game can change from making you giggle like an imbecile at some gags, to cry like a river in some moments, it has to have some emotional substance to it.   10/10  Sadly, our current understanding of the laws of mathematics prevent me from hiking my score higher. Alas, it's literally a perfect game",

It can get really tedious and the game harshly punishes you for killing and goes so far as to insult the player, which is pretty stupid considering it's only a video game. Video games are a place where we should be able to do what we want without consequence, an escape from reality, dealing with this 'murdering is wrong' bull$hit is a pain in the @ss. It takes itself way too seriously, and the message comes off as hammered in because of it. Not to mention, the combat is kind of lacking. You can only use one attack for each weapon, and it gets kinda boring. The actual game world is OK to look at but the color pallete for this game was pretty dull due to the excessive use of black backgrounds and colorless sprites. Not to mention there aren't many places to explore in the world. Even worse, no sidequests, and the NPC's aren't that interesting except the main characters. The music and battle system is fantastic, but even then, I can't really see myself reccommening this game because due to all it's hype your expectations will be really high, and with the game's flaws you'll likely end up dissapointed if you're like me. At the end of day though, I still recommend this game because for it's cheap price it's worth a shot, so buy it if you have time to kill, just don't expect anything special. It's weak in terms of RPG standards. I give it a 6/10.  If you want a far more in depth review, take a look on my YouTube channel. The link to it is on my profile. On my channel I have an Undertale review, which I highly recommend you watch as it contains a lot more detail as to why I don't really like this game all that much.",

I had some money in my wallet and I tried resisting the urge to by it to save my money. Sadly though I am a sucker for these kinds of rpgs with a real deep story so I threw the ten bucks. And holy ♥♥♥♥ I was blown away.  My first blind playthrough took a while but, it was an incredible one (Played it pacifist all the way through). The characters were thoughtfully made and filled with personality. Combat was very great and different if you went with the mercy route. And the story was deep and amazing. Hadn't had a game that gave me so much feels in a while. Play it while you can while there aren't really many spoilers out.

I would never have bought it even though I wish-listed it, because I had other 'good-looking' games that I had eyes on.  Now I'm writing this because Undertale proves to be much more enjoyable!  Let me break this up into 5 simple, positive points! :) 1) Characters, despite their 'simple' designs, can show many emotions. 2) Comprises a good mix of emotions to tingle your body and soul (Fear, joy, anger, happiness..) 3) There's many 'rofl' and 'wth' moments xD It's filled with surprises! 4) I have a weak spot for silly games and this is it :) 5) The 'don't kill' feature this game has is super cool. Imagine fighting a monster that constantly attacks you, but you don't fight back! Instead you talk your way out of it. It's really one-of-a-kind.  For negative points: Error 404 Not Found",

I didn't knew where to start. I have so much to say, I have so many items to point out, there are so many spoilers I could make for the sake of expressing the many feelings I have for this game! There are so many good points and so much writing to do that I simply couldn't pull the energies to do it for fearing not making the game any justice. So I'll make just a tiny and generic portion of everything I have to spill out:  This game touches your feelings. It gives you options all game long and you will pay the price of your choices in the future. You can be the nicest guy ever or the biggest d*ck in the entire universe. This game has ways of reaching for the very depths of your mind and emotions and yank everything out to scrub against your face with a big 'That's who you are, happy?'.  My reccomendation is that if you have kids at home, let them play the game and do whatever they want. And if they take a mean route, make them play again and this time be by their side to guide them through the 'pacifist' route. This will surely teach them to be kind to people and that it pays to make the extra effort to be a better person. If you're an adult (and mature at mind, of course), go play the game through both 'bad' and 'good' ways and you'll see what I'm talking about.",

SPOILERS BELOW OK I didn't know why it was so liked, but I actually took the time to sit down and see what this game was about. At first, I was very confused. Having tons of animals attack me, and I WASN'T suppose to attack them? Thats not the regular gaming way.  Then I killed the goat mama, and I felt bad but didnt know how to NOT kill her as apparently you have to spare her 20+ times.  Then I realized, wow. I'm playing the game all wrong. This isn't right. What am I doing. -resets game-  Once I STOPPED killing everything, game was more joyful, I got a hug from goat mama, went on a date with a skeleton.  Got chased around by a fish like I was her favorite seafood.  And I had a wonderful lapdance by a robot.   The plot of this story? Good question, I'm not entirely sure.  I think it's more so, to treat everything like a living thing. (Unless you want to be a genocidal maniac then go ahead I'm not stopping you, but Sans might)   -cough- ahem, anywho   I really enjoyed this game. How different it was.

Friends whom played the game were like ''Zomg when you're gonna play Undertale? You MUST DO IT!!!!!!1!!!11!'' and when i replied ''Dunno if i even want to..'' oh man, that was almost cardinal crime in their eyes.   However i never judging games before playing them hence adventure started. And after beating (probably) all endings....daaaamn...i haven't been so impressed for ages.   But first things first. Let's analyze the game.  Undertale is Indie RPG (more or less) made just by one guy, which is really impressive. Story isn't linear, it changes by your playing. Decisions you made ACTUALLY MATTERS. For every action there's consequences and that's why i love it.   Battles are interesting. Basically it's bullet hell where you try to survive. But worry not, it's not so hard as it sounds...well.. there are few exceptions but after learning pattern and with dose of determination you can do it.  The characters are so well written and have strong, unique personalities. Makes you questioning moral principes not just in the game but in real life as well.  The best thing (atleast in my opinion) is soundtrack. It's perfect for every situation which you encounter.  My final verdict is 10/10! Legendary game! (Explenation: There's no thing such as 'perfect' game. However this is closest thing what i found. The story worthy of replaying it,brutally changing by your action so you feel like you're playing totally different game and i love this concept.)  So yea....i finally understand why my friends were so obsessed.   Thanks for checking the review. Stay determinated.",

Good is subjective so let me clarify: This game is a rollercoaster of feels. I highly recommend going in blind without having read, or seen any playthroughs or spoilers. The main selling point of this game is the story. I've never played the Last of Us, but I assume it's also the same. Mass Effect was supposed to be also story focused, having a culmination of your choices come back to reward or haunt you. Undertale does this in its own way, which is great.  Now the 'combat', if you can call it that, is somewhat lackluster. It's quite refreshing (and challenging at times) to this series, only because it's different. The boss battles are quite unique, and the music... is absolutely fantastic. This game also breaks the fourth wall in the most appropriate ways that make it great. The 'grind' isn't bad, and there's very little back tracking required. I also recommend Total Biscuit's review on Undertale in his Top 10 Games of 2015 video (around the 35 minute mark). He basically nails it right on and speaks volumes about the game.",

I think you articulated your review very well, but honestly my man, I think you just took this game waaaaaaaaaaay to seriously.   I do respect your opinion though! I find this game to be -extremely- smart; everything goes full circle. True, there is a big chunk of meme culture in this game, but that's how stories are. I say 'story' because I felt like I was transported from trying to play a videogame to wanting to hear more and know what's next.  I don't agree with it being surface level and only including meme humor, nor the part about it being irrelevent in a year or so (and its been just under a year, yet people are still commenting and adding to the 92/100 Metacritic, hands-down Overwhelmingly Positive review). For instance, recognizing specifics of your loads and saves immediately gave me a bit of OG Playstation nostalia, when Psycho Mantis reads and comments about your saves in Metal Gear Solid.  I could comment about most of your thoughts but my main opinion is that you examined this far too hard. Its exactly what it claims to be, and the author knows that. Look at the steam page and which reviews he posted, the destription. He has built a story and persona in one. Again, full circle and encompasing,  This is pure curiosity, truly, but may I ask when you were born? I am recently 30 and am interested if maybe this game can only speak to a certain demographic, which * ISN'T * good, but again I think the author knew he didn't want it to be and thats kinda the whole point... he made a piece of art.  *I mostly watched my roomie play this.",

That must mean I'm being a good host!' The game overall has a really great message, and the more harm you cause to others, the consequences increase. See how much time I have logged into it? Well, I haven't even done all the endings. The game tells people who do genocide runs things like 'Your the kind of person, who just because they CAN do something, they have to.' The game even remembers what you did in previous runs Ex; Killing toriel and then reseting and sparing her will result in flowey saying 'I know what you did. You killed her, then you went back because you regretted it..' Overall this is a REALLY good game and I highly recomend spending the 10$ to get this game.

            "review_text": "Every few months, if not every year, there comes along a game that absolutely annihilates the idea that triple A games are the best in the market. In fact, they prove that triple A games have nullified our ideal gaming scenario: a somewhat immersive environment where no characters are even noteworthy. Undertale is an indie game that truly mocks triple A games -- a short experience, but an extremely memorable one, and completely immersive.  There are few games, especially triple A, where there are any standout characters. In Undertale, every character, even those shown for only small sections of the game, are interesting and aren't just white husks sitting on the screen. It's why I couldn't bring myself to kill all of them in a Genocide Run. (In fact, I've only ever killed one of the lead characters, and that was only on my first run of it.)  The emotions in Undertale are legitimate. The game starts off with humor that always hits on its mark. It'll have you laughing at every encounter, and want more and more. Then, depending on your choices, it can make you hate yourself, hate a certain character (you know who I'm talking about), and/or feel generally awful for the circumstances the monsters in the game are in. If you play Undertale and finish the True Pacifist ending, you WILL be in tears. It's depiction of loneliness, compassion, and grief will make you mourn for the character in question. It's an absolute masterpiece when it comes to the emotions presented in the game.  Above all, the game is all-immersive. I can't give out exactly why, because of spoilers (and I don't want to spoil this game at all, not even with a spoiler block), but you will be part of the game. At first, you won't notice it...but slowly and surely two characters will put you into the spotlight. And its those two characters who drive all the endings of the game.  Undertale has no plot holes, it's narrative is the best in any game I've ever played in my life. The amount of motivation the game creates is outstanding, and nothing is black or white (except for the characters that is). It's a complex narrative that drives you to finish it, and depending on how you play, the ending will either be the most satisfying conclusion, or it will be a devastation loss for no purpose. It's up to you.  Overall, Undertale truly slaps triple A gaming. It's a testament to why I almost never play any anymore. It only has three distinctly different endings (albeit there can be many different endings, but there are three truly different ones), but it is able to do what no triple A game has ever done: create a narrative solely focused on player choice without sacrificing gameplay to it.  Instead of dropping $60 for Fallout 4, take $10 to Undertale. (I hear Fallout has some serious problems. Too much hype, maybe?)  Oh, and the music is good too.  If you doubt the humor of this game, check the specs required on the soundtrack.",

Most of the time in a purely mechanical way, but ultimately the interactions and connections you build to the characters in the game, and how your actions affect those connections will rise above the simple GOOD CHOICE, BAD CHOICE, NEUTRAL CHOICE of so many other games that try to be what Undertale is.  And while I would claim that Undertale is mostly a game about story and how it makes you feel, underneath all of that is a very robust and incredibly enjoyable RPG system. The combat itself in the game is unique in almost every encounter whilst still maintaining the same basic principles. Each boss fight introduces new mechanics or a spin on old ones, always ensuring that it's fresh and thrilling. I didn't once find myself 'grinding' or hung up on the same boring copy paste fights over and over.  And one can't talk about Undertale without discussing the music. In a nutshell? It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It manages to invoke an array of emotions, but for me the boss music for every fight just made it so much more than it was. I think the music alone for Muffet's fight is what makes it my favourite encounter in the game.  Honestly, games for me are hardly ever worth a second playthrough - I always feel like I've exhausted the capabilities of the games storytelling after however many hours I sunk into playing it the first time, but Undertale will be my first exception. It's a nostalgic, well thought out and beautifully written game by someone who honestly just wanted to write a nice, compassionate story - there is no overbearing monologue or pretentious moral message that is being shoved in your face, it's just a story about humans, monsters, and you. And temmies.",

The gameplay mechanics are simple and generally easy to get used to, but they can offer a challenge as you get further along in the game. It may seem extremely difficult at times, but it's all doable.  Now the graphics are not revolutionary, but each area in the game has it's own color scheme, in a way.

Okay but really, if you want some legitimate feedback, here's what I have to say. I'd tell you 'Don't expect anything amazing, because this was made by one single person,' but I can't even tell you that because it's an amazing game regardless of the team of one. I'm barely even into the game so far and I can tell you it's just bloody perfection.   The music is amazing (I want to buy the soundtrack but I don't have the money :&lt;), and anybody should be proud to own it, though that's not even close to all the game has to offer. The story and characters are beautifully crafted from the very beginning, and this game has an amazing grasp on your &lt;i&gt;emotions&lt;/i&gt; (*cries while shouting angrily due to the uncontrollable urge to laugh in joyfully depressive hatred towards... idk something*). When you buy this game, do note that the game is in a pixellated art style, though I wouldn't call that a downside unless you hate pixels with a burning passion. Even then, you should give the game a try, anyway.  One thing I love about this game is that it's the type of game where everything you do shapes the future of the game. There's not a single story line; in fact, from what I understand, there are two endings you reach through extremes (thorough slaughter or intense love, though I'll talk about that in a second), and a very large number of endings you reach through mixed behaviors, simply depending on how you execute your slaughter-loving plan. Now, as far as the kill/love thing goes, that's another mechanic in this game I adore - you don't have to kill anybody (except for a select few). You can either make this a Hitler simulator and kill everybody and everything you meet, or you can go 'hippie mode' and give everything hugs, kisses, compliments and more until the entire world knows you as a friend.  Anyway, I don't want to say anymore because I don't think anybody will read this if it gets too much longer. Just know that you SHOULD buy this game. Don't be on the fence about it - if you can see that fence, hop over and buy this now. Hopefully, my review has filled you with DETERMINATION.",

It is a unique experience and I would recommend this game to everyone. With that being said, these are the strongest point of Undertale:  -Memorable characters: I have played many games in my life, but after completing them and after some time, I will tend to forget the characters and their names. For Undertale it is completely different, I can see myself remembering the characters and their personalities for a long time since I feel emotionally attached to them.   -Replayability value: Everyone will have a different experience with this game based on his/her decisions within the game and dialogue selection. This games has so many different secrets, options and dialogues that you can replay this game countless of times and learn something new on each run.   -Music: THIS is the best part of Undertale in my opinion. The music is AMAZING!! I can place the soundtrack of Undertale along with the soundtrack of Ocarina of Time and Final Fantasy VII as my favorite soundtracks ever. And it´s not only good, but every song fits the situation and the character that tries to represent. If this game doesn't appeal you for some reason, I recommend checking out the soundtrack either way.  -Funny: I have never laugh so much at a videogame as I did with Undertale!! The humour of this game is very particular and it might not please everyone, but personally I love it.  -Lore/Story: It is a very good story, and the way it is told is very unique. I would like to give more details regarding this point but I don't want to spoil anything since Undertale should be played totally blind in my opinion to get the best experience.  I might undertand that the graphics may turn down someone, but this game makes everything else right that it doesn't matter, and in fact, it gives the game a unique touch.  TL,DR: Try this game!!

Undertale is a 2015 game that despite the technology we have to put high graphics, it has that classic 16bit charm that gives us nostalgia from when we were playing earlier games back in our living rooms after school. It has a very well thought out story line that makes you feel such emotions you never thought possible and yet it succeeded in doing that with colorful characters both on appearence and personality wise that we really enjoyed without a fault. The music track is expertly made that gives us the feeling within the moment to the decisions you make and the areas you visited as well that, in turn as well, touched your emotions in a personal level where you can connect with the characters within the game as well. And more importantly, the gameplay has a mix of classic RPG and FPS in a way where it's a creative style of survival and progression within the storyline as well. Finally the Decisions you make will do a unique outcome depending on which ones you believed is right and wrong and the characters in there react differently from what you choose and how you pick them as well.  Undertale is not only a great game of the year, but it is also one of the best game that most triple-A companies should learn a lesson from the fact that great games shouldn't always have it's money burned out on graphics or on gameplay and it should be made where it makes you enjoyed it as a real game should be.

            "review_text": "This is what gaming is all about. As you can see I have played 10 hours of this game. I got it yesterday, 4 hours yesterday 6 hours today. This is not like me at all, I am a busy guy. Today I did not study for my degree, I did not go for my daily jog, I didn't eat, I just about went to the toilet (eventually). This game is completely magical.   'RPG' is a term which barely means anything anymore, it is so broad that the label 'RPG' is no guarantee you will like a game if you have liked an 'RPG' before. So I will first make some comparisons to other games (though I should first say that in most aspects this is like no game I have ever played before). The two comparisons I would make are to the original Legend of Zelda game and to the Pokemon Game Boy games.   Now I will attempt to tell you what it is about this game that has got me so addicted (the only reason i've stopped now is because i'm on the final boss and i've failed about 6 times). First of all the art style is beautiful, simplistic yet effective, the world you inhabit in this game is strange and wonderful, at first it looks pretty dull and dreary, but there are many different places to explore which have character and individual charm.   Second of all, the characters, this is a contender for this best thing about this game; the characters in this game are some of the best i've encountered. There are some lovely characters, warm, friendly and inviting, with emotional backstories and dark secrets. There are some absolutely hilarious characters who make you laugh out loud with everything they say, many who seem mean spirited at first, but by the end they'll have you smiling and when they call your character their 'friend' you really feel an emotional attachment. There are a few who are malicious, filled with pools of dark desire. I won't give anything away specifically about any of these characters, but to name a few of my favourites to look out for: Toriel, Flowey, Bratty and Catty, Temmie, Sans and Papyrus, Megatton and that kid that follows you around. Some hilarious, some dark (or seemingly so), some sweet (or seemingly so), but all beautifully crafted and developed. You will truly learn to love or loathe them.   This brings me on to the next thing about this game; the humour. This game is genuinely hilarious, this game had me laughing more even than Stick of Truth. The humour is oddball and fast-paced, the dialogue will have you laughing out loud on many occasions. This, along with the character development is what drives the storyline.  The storyline itself is extremely touching, it is one which starts of dark and mysterious and continues in this vein, revealing slightly more of itself as it progresses. Your choices matter in this game and your choices will have you feeling genuine emotions. I felt deep regret and sympathy as well as genuine happiness.   The second contender for the best part of the game is the battle system. This is truly a work of art. I won't give anything away about how it works, but suffice it to say for a turn-based battle system, it is a lot more than simply making a choice and clicking your mouse. It does allow you to make choices, but once these are made the true beauty of the battle begins and you see the craftsmanship that went into this game. The battles can also be extremely funny.   There are a lot of secrets to uncover beneath the main storyline, though I have reached the final boss, I am sure I will replay the game to uncover more of this, there are many mysteries and so many characters to interact with that i'm sure a second playthrough is warranted.   This game is fast becoming one of my favourites, there is nothing negative I can think of to say. It is fiendishly difficult in places, charming, deep, emotional and hilarious.   One last thing: take note of the tagline 'The RPG where you don't have to destroy anyone' remember this, or you may be filled with deep, deep regret.",

However, I got so many recommendations for this game that I winded up trying it out anyway and I can whole-heartedly say that I didn't regret giving it a shot. So if you have a similar mindset, take it from me and give this game a chance anyway.  It's definitely one of the most unique games I've played. Despite it's superficial simplicity, the world is lovingly crafted and the characters feel extremely genuine and well-developed. They're all unique, with their own way of interacting with the player, and depending on your choices within the game their attitude towards you will noticeable change. The fact that you can choose whether or not you wish to fight enemies really puts you in a spot where you think twice about your decisions - and no matter which you pick, it will tug on your heartstrings.   But the most important thing - in my opinion - is that Undertale has achieved what no other game since Pokemon Red/Blue has managed: it made me feel like a kid again.

It has the best soundtrack Ive heard this year, great visuals, interesting and colorful characters, cool gameplay mechanics and a story I legitimately did not see where it was going. It was full of surprises and a lot of funny/sad twists.   Game of the year for me. 10/10.",

Need I say more? - etc.   Now, there is a lot more, but I'd rather show you what I think the game is lacking.  Cons: - Sadly pixelated. (It's quite bad lel) - Random things that make no sense. ( For example, Gaster. ) - Takes awhile to play Pacifist/Genocide/Neutral. - Bloody hard af attacks thta make no sense and often you die, ( This one is purely an opinion of my own, because my God I suck at UT xD )  - Genocide Route, Mettaton NEO battle... Just... Really? Out of all the characters. You chose him to (SPOILERS) die in one hit? -As much as I hate to say this, the bloody fonts. I mean...

The ways to SPARE your enemies are also delightfully funny, creative, cute, and sometimes... goes where no dog has been before. This game makes you question about yourself. Not yourself as a character in the game, but yourself as a player, as someone who has infinite lives via saving, and has the power to change the game's outcome.  I do NOT recommend that you spoil any part of the story before you get to the 'True Ending' : it will take a giant chunk out of the experience. I recommend that you backtrack once you reach the 'True Ending': the dialogues change in a way that fleshes the world even more.  However, as great as the game is, it is not without flaws:  If you are bad at bullet-hell dodging (like I was for 10 hours of gameplay), then this game will feel very slow. After all, I beat the game in 12 hours opposed to the average of 6 hours other people seem to take. Also, the dialogues can sometimes get very corny and predictable, and the quirkiness of the characters might overwhelm you.  For me, the pros of the game overweighs the cons and this game has truly been a wonderful experience. This game easily ranks among my favorites now. Now I'm playing it again in front of my friends in hopes that we can share the experience.",

It's clearly aiming for a retro look and feel, and pulls it off nicely (the OST is great and available on Bandcamp if you want to try it on for size first.)  As an RPG, either you'll get into it, or you won't. I found it okay, but the widely advertised heartbreaking factor just didn't reach me. That, and the way the game is both ostencibly meta and controlling.  So if you're into retro RPGs at all, I recommend you at least attempt a full run (wait for a sale if needs be) to forge yourself a proper opinion and decide if the hype is worth it.

One thing that sets this game apart from all others is the connection it makes with players, and touch even those who don't play it and choose to watch. I met a frog in the first areas a bunch of times. You compliment him, and he doesn't understand. He no longer wants to fight, and would rather learn more about the world. I meet a more powerful version of this frog, and he understands my compliment- I, instead, have to mystify him. Eventually, among a deformed amalgamation of an enemy, I have to reflect upon the things I said to this frog, and see them within what would otherwise be a horrific sight- and it fills me with DETERMINATION.  Undertale is a game that focuses on story and bears a gameplay mechanic that's unique enough for me to remember every enemy in the game, whether it be to get washed by a certain colored bullet or to not move at all during a fight, I grasp the concept fast and enjoy my fights instead of grinding out kills on an enemy with no depth at all. This gameplay shines during bossfights where the entire concept is remixed into a fun, fresh fight to protect those you care about [which, you'll soon find, might be the person you're fighting in the moment].  I can't say enough. I really can't. If you're not a guy for story, it's got gameplay. If you don't need gameplay, it's got great story. If you don't like either, it's got a jamming soundtrack and has made me laugh for longer than I'm proud to admit. And if you don't like any of those things... maybe video games aren't for you.  You're gonna have a great time.",

It brings homage to older RPG games that have influenced the modern gaming age so greatly, and yet puts its own amassment of twists and feelings on the classic RPG genre. One might even say that Undertale isn't a normal RPG at all.  The combat system is extremely unique, and the karmic system's massive impact on the game's storyline feel like inFamous, but multiplied by ten.  Be warned, this game has its own unhealthy counts of fourth-wall breaks, so watch out!  If one puts the rather unlikable and generally alienating fanbase of Undertale aside, they will most likely realize that this game is a very good one, and can easily be recommended to others!   If you are one of the few users who has not heard of this game yet, or have managed to not spoil yourself of the entire game, then dive head-first into this game! Plot progression feels slow at times and navigation through various areas sometimes feels like a waste of time, but that's just my own opinion.  I would easily tell anybody to go play this game for themselves, as Mr. Toby Fox has truly crafted a successful masterpiece that (might) will be remembered in everyone's hearts someday as a great milestone in indie gaming.

Now I went into this game knowing there were multiple ways to play it so I read up and found out that being a pacifist was the best way. So I set off sparing the colorful (ironically black &amp; white) monsters. - The only con I noticed within the first few hours is the fact that you run into the same mobs multiple times and the entertaining value of their encounters wears off after the first time. But this isn't even really a big deal. - And I nearly finished the game before finally realizing why this game is so hyped. It's unique. The developers used techniques which I can't recall ever seeing in any other games. It tracks how many times you've seen a cutscene regardless of your save data, which makes for some really cool easter eggs. They literally force crash your game at certain points which (again ironically) makes it very immersive. And the game constantly breaks its own rules which (one more time, ironically) makes it extremely entertaining.  The Neutral - True Pacifist endings truly made my love for this game bloom. And just like that, I'm one of the cancerous fans.  I can't bring myself to start up the game ever again and do a genocide run. I literally do not want to ruin such a perfect ending. I only played through half of the game and it's easily a gem that I would recommend to anyone.  The only real bad thing about this game is you WILL NOT get the soundtracks out of your head.   I give this game a solid 5/7.   Now off to search 'muffet' on paheal.......again...  (oh also thanks to Joey Salads for gifting this game to me. ye.)",

I was also feeling sadness, frustration(but that was just me being bad at the game), and even fear. it was just an over stimulation of the emotions. The gameplay was different, maybe I just never run into a dodging-type game like this, but I thought it was different from the usual rpg where every attack is based on luck and numbers. This one is more based on skill, memory, patience, and literal determination. I'm not kidding, this is the first time I actually felt ready get back in there and try again just from a game over screen (although I've had moments where I took a break just to cool down).  The art style is simply sublime. I was in awe just from all the detail and character design. Oh my goodness don't get me started on character design, I'm big on character designs, so I could go on for a while about how cool/cute/interesting they look! *sigh* yes... even Jerry.  So I say at least give this game a try before you put it down for looking 'retro' or 'old'. Honestly it does look retro but the story and text are very refreshing. giving it a new, crisp feel! If you've tried it and still don't like it, thats cool. I won't judge you, we all don't like the same things. Thats what makes us different from one another.",

The game in itself is more than enough of an experience, no matter how you decide to play it of the various possibilities, and at times, you may even find it tugging at your very heart strings here and there, but... it's an emotional ride I very much approve of with all of my heart.  As for the gameplay itself, while it may seem to be a bit of a 'run of the mill' RPG at first glance, the combat system itself has a very unique feature, akin to playing a bullet hell game, that really gets you involved with the fights themselves and give a more personal and interesting touch to it all. It makes most of the combat much more enjoyable and gives you a greater sense of accomplishment when you do everything right, as opposed to just mashing buttons over and over again... not to mention, the soundtrack alone has enough power to push you between sadness, happiness, and even overly excited for what's to come.  Overall, I've thoroughly enjoyed every second of my time with Undertale, and would suggest you give it a try yourself... even if it doesn't seem your cup of tea, you may be surprised to see what'll come of it in the long haul. I know I was, and it was the most pleasant surprise I've had all year from a gaming perspective.",

There is a lot to enjoy in this game from the characters,epic soundtrack and boss battles and is overall a very fun game and experience. Without going into to much detail or spoiling anything this game teaches people to have enthapy and that people who you may think are your enemies can be great friends when you talk to them and understand things from their point of view.Now there are a few things which may seem annoying or are frustrating but their just nit picks really and dont harm the game other then just being a minor annoince and in my playthrough of the game it took me roughly 4-7 hours to beat but that was only one playthrough and as stated before this game can be played in many ways and at a £6.99 its compleatly worth it. So overall i would give Undertale a solid 10/10 its an amazing game which will make you want to keep on playing it and you will definatly get your moneys worth with this awesome RPG",

The story, the music, the characters, everything is so good.  --Story--  Not going to get spoiler-ey here at all, just want to say that the story of this game is wonderful, and, well, may include multiple playthroughs in order to... get it all.  Story == 10/10  --Music--  There was not one track in this game that I didnt love. Seriously, that's not something that I can say for a lot of games, this is one game that I wouldnt mind paying $10 for the soundtrack (Which I plan to do very soon)  Music == 10/10 No question.  --Characters--  I dont think I've ever been on a date with a skeleton, so that's cool. But seriously, the characters in this game are all mostly fantastic, and you get invested with them very quickly.  Characters == 9.5/10  --Graphics--  This I usually dont care about in games, but UnderTale did it very good, the game has the pseudo 8-bit/16-bit style, which works very well for the game that it is, I couldnt imagine it being a 3D game at all.  Now, the sprite work, most of the time, it is really good, like, really really good. But, the only real 'problem' that I personally had with the graphics, would be your character's sprite. I dont know why, it just kinda put me off... oh well  Graphics == 9/10  --Gameplay--  Have you played EarthBound?  Have you played Touhou?  This game is EarthBound and Touhou mixed together. It's pretty great actually. The only real problem I have with it would be the difficulty spikes at bosses, not that that is an entirely bad thing, it just seemed a bit weird.  Gameplay == 9/10    Overall Score 9.5/10  It's not a perfect game, but it's damn near close enough. Congrats Toby Fox and artist who've worked on this, you've thoroughly impressed me.  If you haven't already played UnderTale... Do yourself a favor. Buy it. One of the best indie games that I've ever played.      --Joke Review--  I dated a skeleton and filled him with 'Determination'  10/Anime",

Perfect music to suit the atmosphere, loveable characters, and an ending, that if you can get to, that truly satisfies. But beware, this game will bring the feels, and when it brings the feels, it will bring them hard.   In my experience with playing this game, I was going into it a little bit mystified about how it would turn out and completely curious. I mean I already fell in love with the Motherly Character Toriel, and more or less hated the planty guts of the Flower upon its first encounter and trickery.  The moments that came after, was a rollercoaster of feelings of joy, sadness, laughter, and just about everything inbetween. You will have the happy moments in the story/game, to where you will be laughing so much and forgetting about some of your problems, hopefully in real life, and in game. And there will be moments that, will test your resolve, and moments that will have you shedding a tear or two (or a few dozen in my case.)  I never realized how time flew by when I played this game. At first it was an hour, then two, and so on. I couldn't pull myself away from this game because I was so in love with it, to where it changed the aspects of RPG's that i've played. To where in a certain sense it breaks the cliche of 'All monsters are heartless', to with the paths you can choose, and the choices you can make, more or less makes this game feel less like a game, but more a story of hope and a beautiful picture of artwork, despite how distorted it can be.  Please, support Undertale and their creators, and give this game a whirl, i'm sure you won't be disappointed. Because I know I wasn't. *Slowly proceeds to eat a Glamburger*",

From the lovable Pasta-enthusiast Papyrus and his brother sans, to game show host Mettaton-I'm sure you'll find a favorite character. However, this is only if you 'spare' everybody. Thats the thing about Undertale, you can play the whole thing without killing a single person. You baiscally can Jesus and go around fixing peoples lives.  Now here's the UNDER-HAND....O-other hand. Undertale is praised for everything I said above, which is all good. However, if you choose to play as Satan's BFF, you'll go and kill everyone. This is where Undertale becomes...not-so fun. The music is made wonky, the chracters dont have any development, and you have to grind forever (The only way to access the Genocide (No mercy) route is to kill EVERYONE). But...it's made not enjoyable. You're supposued to not like it, it's suppoused to not be fun. I'm not gonna tell you to try it or not, but...you may have a bad time.  Yeah, there's also the neutral route. You honstly would run into this route if you dont know anything about the game. It's alright, thats all I can say about it.   Yeah, so overall Undertale's really good. Worth the money, 100%. Also make sure to suppourt the creater, Toby Fox. He seems super cool, deffinatly someone to look out for in the future.

            "review_text": "Undertale is a game I went in with very low expectations but came out obsessed.  I had seen the hubbub arise when the game was new and first gained a following. I saw posts overtake my dashboard on tumblr and several of my friends fall down the hole of addiction. One of my close friends played a number of tracks from the OST to try to pique my interest. At first I felt uninterested and uninspired to even check out the game, let alone play it. However, several of my friends who have very similar tastes in storytelling and gameplay were urging me to play the game. I became interested, and lo and behold, a wonderful friend purchased the game for me.  Playing blind, I completed the entire game, both the True Pacifist Routes and Genocide Routes, in a week.  The first playthrough took me 16 hours. I can get through it in 3 hours now. I'm still playing the game, still enjoying it, and I have played over 143 hours to count since I received the game three months ago.  I am still obsessed with Undertale to this day. It is a game that is very enjoyable, very impacting, and resonates with the heart. There's a reason I call it one of my all time favorite games and all time favorite stories.  Do not be deceived by the game’s first hour of play. The RUINS, where you begin playing, is not very interesting to a first time player. Until you get to know her and finish the entire game, Toriel acts much like a simple tu-TORIEL. For me, I did not find that part of the game impressive at all for my first runthrough. It was only as I continued forward that I got sucked into the world of Undertale. As simple and basic as the game seems as first, I assure you, it will get far more complicated and far more engaging to the player.  Do not be deceived by the game’s graphics. While they seem so simple, basic, and uninteresting at first, the more you play, the more you will be able to appreciate the visual beauty of the screen. There is a lot of thought and design in the pixels. There are beautiful color palates, downright gorgeous rooms, and gloriously beautiful moments in the later battle sequences.  Do not be deceived by the basic MIDI soundtrack. As a trained music composer, at first I thought this music was very uninteresting. However, the more you play, the more charm the melodies give you. The more they get stuck in your head. The more you fall in love with them. The more you realize the music that was composed was EXACTLY what needed to be composed, and that they actually have very good form and compositional structure.  Undertale, in truth, is much more than meets the eye, ear, and first impression.  It’s a story beautifully told and full of impact.  This is a game that is full of charming and endearing humor. The terrible puns, the trolling teases, the ridiculous situations, the tongue-in-cheek, the irony, and the fourth wall references all combine into a distinct, lovable sense of comedy. This is a game that will make you facepalm, laugh, and at times howl in amusement.  This is a game that is full of lovable, three-dimensional characters. The characters are so three-dimensional and interesting that, with every playthrough, you learn something new about them. A bite of an implied backstory. The motivations behind their actions. The depths of their hearts. Their likes and dislikes. Their characterization. Their penchants, their tendencies, their manners of speech. Some stories have boring characters, some stories have interesting characters, and some stories – like Undertale – have living, breathing, lovable, unforgettable personalities.  This is a game that dives into the depth of the heart and explores the soul. Though there are many lighthearted moments in the game, it also is incredibly deep and full of mature concepts. It is a game by which a player can question morality or feel encouraged about the goodness of kindness. It is a game that demonstrates the power of love and the horrors of hate. It shows the meaning of forgiveness. It explores trauma, even gets into very solemn moments about depression, suicide contemplation, and handling a genocide. The game can go into many serious concepts while bringing the story, at the end, to a resolving and encouraging finish.  This game breaks some unexpected gaming boundaries. The fourth wall is something most people have never experienced the like before. The game CHANGES based upon your decisions – and even going back to a previous save file won’t be enough for you to escape your actions. The fourth wall is integrated into the very lore of the game, and there are moments that will legitimately surprise blind players because you do not anticipate some of the plot twists.  Frankly, this is a game that is very well-written from a literary perspective. The story’s trajectory is nicely balanced. Information and experience collide and slowly build up to surprising reveals and connections you never would have anticipated. In the game, you think you start with a simple journey. By the end, you are bawling from emotion at the experience.  This game is a true journey.   This game has everything I could want. Great, catchy music. Beautiful visuals. Entertaining humor. Heartwrenching pain. Memorable characters. Great representation of many types of individuals. A cool setting and world. An engaging and well-written storyline. Fun gameplay experience. Challenges. Depth, maturity, grit, encouragement, cheer, hope. A lot of hidden secrets, areas to explore, and juicy information to uncover for the truly dedicated player. Lore that brings you a lot of knowledge, but also leaves hoards of room for theories and discussion.  Please, if you haven’t already, go play Undertale. If you are someone who is at all interested in games with good stories, then this is meant for you.  I assume most people who are reading this have been spoiled on some aspects. For those of you who haven’t, I will only say one thing, if you want to have a little guidance (this is the guidance I got before playing and I think it was worth it to hear this): the best gameplay experience for first-time players is to start with what the fandom called the “Pacifist Route.” Don’t kill anyone. Play to the end. Then, when you have done that, do what the fandom calls the “Genocide Route.” Literally obliterate everyone in every area of the game before going forward; seek out every possible monster that lives there; make sure you see the line “But nobody came” before transitioning from one location to another. See what happens. Be patient and have FUN with those incredible boss fights.  And above all, my friends… stay DETERMINED.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: I have completed the game but ONLY playing the pacifist route, so that is all I can vouch for.  Before I do a big long pros and cons list, just a quick note. This game makes you consider what you're doing as a player. When you kill someone, you as a player have murdered someone. Sure you can go back to a previous save and they'll be there, but you are now a murderer. The game knows that, and it tells you that it knows. The game works like this in other ways too, but it is something not done in any other game I know of and I believe this game is worth the purchase for this ingenious design alone.  Pros: Incredible storyline, whether you like storylines in games or not (personally I do not) this really is a gem that you can appreciate. Atmosphere, truly makes you feel all types of emotions through incredible soundtracks, strong characters, and powerful backgrounds. Combat, if you enjoy bullet hell style fights then it's an added bonus, if you don't then it in no way takes away from the game experience. Decisions, I feel like everything I do in this game means something and has a real impact on what goes on, probably because it does. Characters, not much to say here apart from each character is wonderous, fully flushed, and thoroughly intruiging.   Cons: Repetitive, The last hour of gameplay to me feels like the same thing over and over again, worth it for the ending but it does start to feel like lazy game design. Repetitive, I've met this same boss like three times now... Is this a glitch? Repetitive, Look I'm sure there's a point to this but why are you saying the same speech for like the billionth time? Repetitive, HOLY F*CKING SH*T IF I HAVE TO WALK THROUGH THIS SAME F*CKING HALLWAY ONE MORE D*MN TIME!   This game tries so hard to be 'deep' by walking you through the same places over again after revealing more information that it becomes dull and repetitive, especially in the last 1-2 hours.   All in all, incredible game. I recommend.",

            "review_text": "Undertale  Rating - A+ Genre - RPG Creator - Toby Fox  Review  Undertale was a hyped game for quite some time until we all finally were able to play it and the wait was definately worth it. The rich story , the awesome characters and the concept executed so perfectly just adds it up to a great game. The combat system doesn't work like a traditional RPG , however this doesn't mean the game is bad but instead of attacks and such you can ACT , FIGHT , or use ITEMS then you can SPARE them those are the 4 things you can do.   If you FIGHT then you are playing the game on the GENOCIDE route. Not fighting , but instead ACTING will put you on the PACIFIST route. The different routes also make the game have alot of re-playability.  The game itself has great pixel graphics , funny jokes , good secrets and the AMAZING story is great. The story itself (SPOILERS AHEAD) Is a very heart-warming tale of a human waking up in a world of monsters you play as the human , you will meet amazing characters with lots of personality giving the game a way more real feeling to it you go through multiple areas each one more detailed than the last , and I am not going to lie I cried playing this game.  The Ending of the game is A very big plot twist (SPOILERS NOW) Where Flowey (The first character you meet in the game) kills King Asgore (King Of The Monsters) and becomes OMEGA FLOWEY and with even more detail where the game will crash frequently as Omega Flowey is 'Breaking The Game'.  Personally I think the soundtrack is probably one of THE BEST soundtracks in a game EVER and I ain't lying!  Overall Undertale is a great game and I urge anyone who enjoys any kind of RPG or pixel-graphic game to play THIS GAME.",

Please continue to softly spread the word in a soothing and non-irritating manner.'  -Undertale twitter  I'm going to try my best to keep my composure, writing this, since this is what Toby wants.  . . Undertale is pretty good i guess  . . . . . Okay, no, that doesn't give the game the justice that it deserves, Undertale left me speechless, after the 11 hours of my first playthrough, i've never felt this way about a game before. The characters are so well written, and have so much character developement to them, Toby Fox does an amazing job capturing the soul of each character.    Toby Fox is such an interesting guy, and he deserves a lot more credit than he asks for, he knows his game is good, but he doesn't want to seem like a pretensious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it. He instead, wishes this game to die peacefully, instead of making a cesspool of memes out of his game. This is the guy who made the music for Homestuck, seeing how the 'Fandom' of Homestuck became a cesspool, Toby Fox wanted to stray away from that, but of course it's inevitable, seeing the background he came from.  Nonetheless, there's people who respect the game for what it is, simply, a game.  So I guess, if you don't want to be the cancer that kills this game in a non peaceful way, I suggest straying away from 'Fandoms' of this game.  I highly reccommend this game if you love RPGs, or simply just a good, silly story.   TLDR; Undertale is pretty good i guess",

            "review_text": "The game's major weakness: Practically everything is a spoiler. If you know little to nothing about this game, now is the time to play it.   Undertale is a twisted spin on RPGs with a retro art style. The basic concept is that you don't have to kill any enemies if you don't want to. This creates many diverse ways the game can be played, which the creator has taken into account and planned for. With all these branching paths, it is best to go in knowing as little as possible to get a more personal feeling while playing, instead of simply looking up how to get the 'best' ending. Looking up a walkthrough or watching a lets play really does invalidate the point of the game, so I can't stress enough how important it is to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately, due to the game's massive success and popularity, most players, myself included, already know too much on their first playthrough and don't get the full experience.  The gameplay is built on very basic RPG elements, but they are actually incorporated into the story. There are a few weapons that all act mostly the same, you try to stop a white bar in the center of a meter to get the most damage. Not the most complicated system, but still somewhat challenging for new players. Enemies, on the other hand, have personalized attacks and optional ways to spare them. The real unique part of combat is that it becomes a bullet hell when enemies attack they player, and even this isn't always as straight forward as it seems. Depending on certain choices you make, this can be anywhere from stupidly easy to hair tearingly difficult. Outside of combat, there are many puzzles to get through in order to advance. Aside from two bosses whos' solutions weren't immediately obvious and some optional puzzles I skipped the first time around, this game was a cake walk; but, there were some options I didn't take that would have enhanced the difficulty severely.   I want to do the hard playthrough, just to say I beat it; but the story is drastically altered by it, and the ending is unspeakably dark.    The game doesn't lack for beautiful scenery, if you can at all appreciate the pixel art style. Personally, I think the game looks amazing; but I know some people don't see pixel art as anything but an easier way to make a game. This game makes me question those people's sanity, as it is by far one of the most breathtaking games I've played.  The soundtrack is definitely one of the best features of the game, as the lead developer is moderately well known for their previous musical works. The music mostly sounds like chiptunes, with a smattering of realistic instruments in the background. The atmosphere is intensely amplified by the music, or lack thereof in some cases. However, if you are interested in buying it, be warned that many tracks are under a minute long. Almost all the songs are designed to loop, so most end up being shorter than they seem in game. This is mostly made up for with there being a staggering 101 songs on the album, and the sheer quality of the best songs. Maybe consider buying the official metal cover instead. It's more expensive, but it doesn't come with songs that are under a minute in length.  The story and lore of the land are top notch. I found myself deeply engaged when clues and backstory were provided; but I'm a sucker for those things, regardless. The world feels like a real place with a long history. There's lots of diverse areas,   despite taking place entirely in a cave under a mountain,  with details and secrets hidden everywhere.  One major gripe people seem to have with this game is that the characters are too,'tumblry.' I can understand where they're coming from; but it seems like a silly thing to complain about, and I didn't really notice anything too edgy. I found most of the characters to be very similar to people one might meet in real life, from angsty teens all the way to pushy salesmen.   If you really don't like a certain character, though, you can always kill them.  ",

(SANS!!! aw, c'mon. youre smiling. I AM AND I HATE IT!!!) If you like games like Earthbound/Mother, you'll love this game to bits. (get it? cause it looks like its 8-bit? GOD DAMN IT, SANS!!!)  Also, the soundtrack is the most kickass thing. Every song is has it's own style, such as the up beat bass line of 'Death by Glamour', or the acoustic lick from 'Undertale'. Its probably one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time.  And the story. OH BOY, THE STORY! This game will send you on an emotional rollercoaster, full of sad, happy, and downright hillarious moments. It also has alternating paths, which are dependent on your actions. You can effect the ending in minor or major ways.  Which is where the coolest thing of this game comes in. The alternate endings. This is one of the only RPGs I've seen where you can decide everyone's fate. Will you make friends with everyone, or will you kill everything in cold blood? Or do a bit of both?  Overall, this game is one of the best games of 2015, and it's so cheap, too. Just buy it already, damn it!",

Now that we have got that out of the way, the review!  This game implements the idea of choices and conciquences perfectly! Many times I found myself spending almost a full minute trying to decide to kill or spare someone, and you need to do this multiple times! This isn't like regular JRPG's where you get a choice that doesn't really matter, your choices affect the entire game and story! The artstyle is very cute and reminds me of the Mother (or Earthbound) series. everything is so colorfull and quirky in a way that melts my heart! If you are a big retro gamer (such as myself) or a newtimer to classic games, this is a great game to start with. The music is also phenomenal, with each song telling a story and giving you some nostalgia on the way. I guess it is ok to listen to the soundtrack, but be careful, you do not want this entire game spoiled because you were curious. Overall, I would recomend this game so much, I would want to buy it for you! If you are interested, GET IT NOW!!! It is SO worth the $10!!!",

It's an absolutely bizarre experience that will have you constantly double take and go, 'wait... did that really just happen?', and the answer is always 'yes'.  The game is story heavy and emotionally I feel, it's very powerful. It takes the core concept of a 'journey' and sprinkles in some strange and silly antics in between the world building and personal experiences you have (a single playthrough lasts about five hours). It's a game that makes you think and consider your actions, because unlike say, Until Dawn, the tone of the game is VASTLY different depending on your choices. Just be aware that the game is quite  smart , and will know if you've done wrong. Even if you try and hide it.   The characters are diverse and flawed, which is actually a strength and not a weakness, as it makes them more well-rounded and generally still very loveable. The music is extremely fitting and does a perfect job of setting the tone for the current area or situation, don't even get me started on the final boss's music.  The combat is turn-based, and mostly consists of meter-stopping mechanics for attacking and bullet hell-ish dodging for defending. Not a fan of bullet hell? That's fine, I'm not either. You just use it to dodge the enemy's attacks, and it's extremely simplistic and straightforward.  My only complaints are that:  1. I am dog-♥♥♥♥ at this game. 2. The replayability largely rests on how willing you are to be a genocidal maniac. 3. I just want MORE!  TL;DR: It's a fairly short, emotionally powerful game that will take you on a journey and make you feel things you've never felt before. Full of laughs, extremely strange, but knows when to be serious. Replayability depends on how  determined  you are.",

Undertale is an odd ball out when it comes to RPGs. It isn't your typical build a party, fight every enemy in tedious turn based battles, and explore the overworld. No. Undertale is a game where you take control of a kid and go throughout the lands exploring and meeting people. You don't make parties, but you do have to battle things. The neat thing about Undertale is that you don't actually have to fight anything, you can just be peaceful and avoid enemy attacks until your enemy gets bored and gives up. Plus, there's a great cast of characters to meet, which is a very nice part of the game. The gameplay is good, and there is actually a decent value to the replayability, as each route you choose gives you different choices in the game and a different ending. The best part of the game however, is not the game itself, but rather the soundtrack. The soundtrack is amazing, and you should download the bundle that has the soundtrack. It's worth it. Trust me.  So, if you're looking for a fun RPG experience, veterans and newbies alike, this would be an excellent choice. It isn't a conventional RPG, but that's what makes it the most fun. Only con would be the fact that some of the puzzles are difficult to get through, but they're fun. Overall 9.5/10",

I definitely see merit in the game, with its modern take on turn-based RPG and a twist to its levelling system. The graphics are a miss for me at times given some inconsistency in the style department. The combat is based on 'bullet hell' shooting games, thus requiring some sharp reflexes on the player's part. Unfortunately, I am neither partial to bullet hell games nor possess sharp enough reflexes, so I found combat in 'Undertale' a nuisance. By mid-game, I got so frustrated that I don't find the game interesting or enjoyable anymore. However, for those who do well with bullet hell games or can tolerate it more than I, I will recommend 'Undertale' for its interesting take on turn-based RPG and its tropes; else, I would say stay away.",

Note: My 6.3 hours in the game was an entire playthrough of the 'pacifist run' i.e. forgoing half of the gameplay (pressing the attack button at the right time) in order to get some different dialog boxes from the NPCs.  Pros: -The soundtrack is so good, you'll feel like you're playing a good game (or wish you were). -A few genuinely funny jokes or interesting moments. Unfortunately these have nothing to do with the gameplay and would be just as effective as comics or short animations (or even fan fictions).  Cons: -Feels like it was made in a few days. -You walk through the game. The only gameplay is a bullet dodging minigame that isn't very fun, for me at least. -Graphics aren't anything to write home about, especially for the classic pixel art style they are trying to mimic. -FNAF-style cancer community that can't see any flaws in this experience.  A lot of the cons about this game can be summarized as it being 'lazy'. Good artists could remake all of the basic pixel graphics in Undertale in a few hours. The gameplay can be recreated in about a day.  It feels like a lot of corners were cut in the production of this game just for the sake of it being easier to make.  You get the feeling that some really talented people were working on this game, but never gave any real effort and got by with the minimum.",

The gimmick of the game is that nobody needs to get hurt, but there is nothing interesting about how you do so. Simply choose the right dialogue options in the right order and maybe once or twice do something new. The story is also something people rave about and how its 'an example of how video games are art and wooshy wooshy'. Honestly if I could sum it up I would use two words 'Lore dump.' Half the game is walking through passages and having goofy conversations, the other half is standing in what feels like a library just reading, reading and reading so much exposition.

The writing was often lovely, the soundtrack was solid, and I can totally see how one could get sucked into the rabbit hole of repeat playthroughs and mucking about with save files. I've spent hundreds of hours doing the same on Dark Souls because the lore was so deep and hard to access.  But the Underground isn't Lordran. I just didn't want to explore it again. For every charming monster there was a half-baked meta-joke or a nonsequiter that pulled me out. The world varied so wildly between saccharine, self-aware, genuinely funny, and tragic that I couldn't latch on to any one part of it. So many filler areas, so many empty hallways and one-off characters. The final boss was excruciatingly hard, and too many of the sequences wore out their welcome almost instantly (the Papyrus/traps/puzzle section just DRAGGED. ON. FOREVER.) And while I understand Alphys's appeal to a broad swath of anime fans, all I could think during Hotland was 'PLEASE JUST SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP. WHERE'S YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SELF-RESPECT?'  I will say that Temmie Village is a stroke of pure, demented genius. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I loved that place.  But overall, no. I didn't enjoy playing this game.

It's absolutely a personal preference kind of thing, and given my preferences I probably should've just given it a miss to begin with. Ah, well!  On the better side, the story was doing a good job of drawing me in, and I liked the characters I'd encountered. I was sad when I accidentally killed a monster early on, when trying to just wheedle down its health! I also felt I probably screwed up the encounter with Toriel and felt bad about that.

The monsters also have a thriving grudge against humans, who some millennia ago sentenced them to this world of peace and  mass hysteria  propagated by their king, who hopes to instill in them a hope for the surface world.  As the story progresses, a demonic goat tries to mother you. You are attacked by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The king wants your soul.

You meet skeletons who mock your favorite childhood fonts, animals who speak in meme, dogs who want nothing more than to be pet. You are given the choice of killing them, or satisfying their every strange desire. At some point, you become confused and die to a stray…something white?  You are “encouraged” upon your death by the schizophrenic second voice inside your faceless skull to return and try again. And you do. You go to dinner, you go on a date, you meet a fish wearing a tin can! You meet a dinosaur who is your friend, wait, who is this person,  wait , who is  not  your friend??? You pick up a great many uniquely named items and Pose with the second coming of Michael Jackson.  Finally, you learn that the king’s recent desire to kill humans was sparked by the death of his son and also there was a human. …Since nobody else is bothered by this apparent plot hole, you decide to continue plodding onward and on  sloooowly  reading line after line of  monologue  and you hear that your ancestors (or rather some random humans who may have been fictitious) were evil because they killed a monster who turned the other cheek and plodded silently back to his parents to collapse into dust at their shattered feet.  Somehow, you reach the castle you've been looking for. The kingis there. He thinks you’re  really great , and he’s so glad to have met you and the six others  just like you , and he wants to make sure your affairs are in order, and  he attempts to brain you with a trident . You deal with that problem but suddenly remember one other shallow psychopath you met earlier but it’s not like before with that practice dummy nobody warned you about,  right??  He/It/Kthulu proceeds to give you photoshopped nightmares, and you realize you must've made a mistake somewhere along the way but it’s too late because your game is crashing! And it won’t end!! And you’re really so confused and sick of the whole mess by now that you finally just  It’s Over.   Eighth grade returns to tell you that your life is pointless. The snowman was pointless. The …thing you just killed? returns to tell you to try again, don’t worry the ending’s better. “I’d really give it a shot,” says the fan standing next to you, “just think of all the teeny-weeny little bits of backstory you missed – at least two other psychopaths, I promise! -- in fact my heart will be broken if you don’t find something to tell me-' – and you quietly close Steam, open Programs, and press Uninstall.  The sound of silence does not fill you with determination.  3/10 ",

            "review_text": "I've hit a point in this game where I don't know if I'll continue, but I decided to put up a short review in the meantime. I can't imagine my opinion changing if I decide to continue this.  We all play games for different reasons, but ultimately it's to have a fun experience. This game will not bring that unless you just want to jump on a bandwagon of LV for a mediocre product.  The game is automatically being played off on false nostalgia. The graphics, sounds and part of the combat system is familiar to a lot of older gamers. However, the reason you played those old school console JRPGs was because they were fun. You had exploration, characters that were interesting, a variety of spells and attacks, and a reason behind everything.  In Undertale, the exploration is limited to different paths that sometimes lead to a funny/cutesy/quirky thing. In one scene, I saw a fishing rod that had a picture attached to it. I couldn't tell if the picture was a philosophical parable or a very simple joke. The combat has a feature to talk your way out of battle. I found the most useful feature is Fleeing a battle because the battle system is boring. This was the one aspect I was hoping would be a lot of fun. Instead, I found myself wanting random battles to never happen. I quit talking my way out of battles because the dialog that spews from an enemies mouth is, frankly, bad. It's not funny not entertaining. It's bland.  The music and graphics are something. They captured an era, and it's the one positive I can give the game as of now. They're ugly as sin and the main character looks like a reject from The Simpsons: Bart vs. The World, however, that's what this game was going for and they nailed it. When I left the first area start my quest home, the graphics went from Commodore 64 to a weird NES/SNES look. I could dig it. The music is charming, and probably the best part of the game. It fits the environments well and it's about the best reason to recommend Undertale.  You may have heard this game shares similarities to Earthbound. Yes and no. Yes, because it has some art aspects that look Earthbound-y, but no to everything else. If you want to play Earthbound, there's many options available. And it's actually going to make you happy playing it because it's fun, cute in a way that's relaxing, and has a decent overall plot line for an old game. Undertale just keeps dragging on and on.  I don't think this game was created with a bad vision. I think it's just a very poor game and has been grasped by a certain type of indie community that feels certain games that shouldn't be popular should be popular. There's people that are going to legitimately love this game. And good. Not everyone needs to love the same thing. But I think the overhyped community, the missionaries of this game, have spoiled it. This game having certain words associated with it like 'feels' and 'deep meaning' damages the game more than honors it.  If I finish the game, which as much as I don't want to, probably will to mark off my backlog, I will update the review if I feel it needs it. But as of now, I have to say don't bye into this weird hype. I don't watch My Little Pony even though it have a strong (non-physically) community. Undertale is no exception. Bad is bad and quirky isn't always good.",

I wish I never played it, that I could forget it. The good things about it aren't worth the terrible disappointment I faced in the end. I've heard arguments for why its ending is fine, or perfect, but after months I still cannot find it even acceptable. Disregarding the fact that it made me depressed, made me go from functional to a hopeless wreck, it still has the worst ending I've seen in any video game, which ruined the rest of the (honestly unpolished and full of plot holes) story. The gameplay was fun, though not nearly as hard and bullet-hell like as I originally believed and feel it's lacking. I know that almost no one will have the same negative reaction, the same degree of contempt, that I have for the end of this game. I know many of my friends love this game, despite its flaws, or what I am convinced are flaws. But personally... I would have been better off never having played this game.",

While it's by no means a bad game, it's a game littered with a lot of unpolish that I often wonder whether I'm playing an actual RPG at all or just a parody.  The graphics are very mixed; sometimes they can be of very good quality, and at other times they can look identical to MS Paint. I feel the developer was unsure how to artistically design the game; I understand that for an artstyle it's trying to be unique, but in terms of quality, it does not look pleasant on the eyes.  For example, why is that the first level with Flowey looks retro, yet when I reach the Snowdin level I see extremely detailed trees? It doesn't make sense.  Gameplay, for the main part, is pretty mixed. I do enjoy the combat system and fighting enemies. Sadly, what I don't enjoy is the 'spare' mechanic. I feel it's a completely glorified way of making you feel bad for killing enemies, despite the fact that the majority of the enmies in the game either want to kill you, or are just extremely annoying at times. Why should I spare Papyrus if, logically, he's trying to attack me? You can't play with emotions with inconsistent writing.  Overall, Undertale is not a bad game, but it's not a particuarly good one either. If you get this game, I will just let you know that in my honest opinion there are thousands of better RPGS out there.",

            "review_text": "Even though I don't recommend this game, I'd say it's still worth 5 bucks to see what the fuss is about. But it's overhyped. Massively overhyped, in fact. Even when appreciating the game for what it tries to do and what it wants to be, there's many flaws in its execution. I'll mention several of them here but I feel the need to stress that you should make your mind up about this game by playing it, not through any review. That way, when you meet a fellow gamer who played it, you can have lively discussions about what did and didn't work for you in what feels like the most polarizing game of 2015.  What didn't work for me: the humour. Absurd comedy is very hard to pull off. I'm a fan of The Fast Show and Monty Python and what's presented here is not good absurd comedy in my book. It's not good surreal comedy either: it feels like the developer heard about surreal comedy from a friend and then tried to mimic it. Other than that, there's maybe three puns that are grin-worthy.  The combat: you'll be playing 'bullet hell' mini-games a lot. These are made frustrating by stiff controls resulting in the game being harder than it has any right to be. Only one fight was truly enjoyable to me (spiders). The bullet hells are enemy attacks, to actually defeat opponents you must either attack them or figure out what to say or do to appease them. And that ties into my biggest gripe:  the game doesn't respect your time .   Would you figure out that in order to defeat a monster you would have to try and hug it four times (getting no response other than '...' every time) and then ignore it twice? I literally thought that the only option was beating it to death because no other option advanced the combat state and then when I killed it, it turns out that the game commits the capital sin of having  very  strict requirements to get the 'good' and 'bad' endings...  Because of this, I stopped caring about the characters very quickly. To defeat my opponents I chose the path of least resistance where I could, simply because there's no rhyme or reason to most of it. Midway through the game I was ready to walk out of the monster realm and send a nuke back in for good measure. That said, when you get frustrated... grit your teeth and work through it. Don't quit the game midway, play it through. It only takes about 6 hours and you need to see the ending at least once in order to have the full experience. I nearly didn't get there, but I'm glad I did, if only to be able to discuss it with others.  The game did succeed in giving me 'the feels' once or twice. But it does so in a very ham-fisted way that left me feeling used and rather unsympathetic towards the game.  If the humour gels with you, if you can stand the combat (there's a demo that you can test) and if you are willing to work through it to get the different endings then this is genuinely a good game. If not, then 5 bucks and 6 hours of your time is the price of admission to have an opinion about the latest 'best indie game evarr'. And while I think that's a price worth paying, I wouldn't  recommend  it to anyone.",

            "review_text": "BEFORE SOMEONE DOWNVOTES THIS, READ MY REVIEW  This game is really quite interesting. Not in a good or bad way, just interesting. Let me some this game up in pro's and con's fashion:  Pros: - Amazing, beautiful soundtrack - Enticing story - Cool looking enemies - Unique battle system  - Some deep and rich characters  That's it for pros. Everything else in this game (so far) I see is simply not good. Let's start with the graphics; the most controversial topic of all. Let me just put this out for the world: I adore retro-style graphics. I live and breathe it, like games like Super Meat Boy. This game looks like it took NES graphics, ♥♥♥♥ on them, and chewed it up before being bought. It's not HD retro graphics! It looks like something the Atari 2600 would muster! Trust me, there ARE ways to make the game look good whilst maintaining retro graphics! But this was not the way to go. Bland colors, ugly sprites, etc.  Next, let's talk about characters. Everyone won't shut up about Sans and Papyrus, and it's easy to see why. They are quite funny. But, they are extremely under-developed and 1-Dimensional. You see no other side to these characters. What you see was what you get.  Next agenda is how people say how you can go about without violence. This speech mechanic is not at all what I thought it would be. It is literally an attack in how it functions. It's not say, in Mass Effect with your options to say something. No. You have a choice of attacks, and you keep using the same. one. over. and over. until the enemy 'submits', or they literally die. It's literally calling an attack something else.  My third problem is the price. This game looks and feels like a homebrew or a video game done within a week. It should not be more than $5.00, much less $9.99. If it was significantly less cheaper, I wouldn't really be mad at it.  My next issue with the game is its clunkiness. I do love RPG's that have multiple routes branching out, but here, it kind of seems clunky. At no point in the game, do I ever have to return to a single point and it all feels linear, even when I have no idea where this place is in the map.   Finally, I hate how people compare this game to Earthbound. Sure, you have equipment. But is it shown on your character? Do you have any stats? Do you have any different attacks, or a magic attack? No. You can't have a party or a team.   Let's end this game on a positive note. I like the battle system, as long as people don't shove the whole 'no violence' thing down my throat. It is very skill based, and it is quite fun to find the patterns in some attacks. Finally, the music. God this music feels like it belongs in some triple A title, not an indie game. It is so good that the soundtrack is better than the game itself.   CONCLUSION  Don't buy this game. Buy the soundtrack. If this game goes on sale for less than $5.00, then buy it.",

The music ranges from fitting to AMAZING. the mechanics are simple and easy to use (however they're a little too simple). All the characters are memorable and a joy to talk with.  Cons: It's pretty boring, the gameplay is ok on 1 of the 3 routes, on the other 2 routes you're either walking around waiting to kill something or you're walking from point A to point B with minimal gameplay in between.

The brightest part of this game is most definitely the ending. Unfortunately, as someone who didn't read much about the game until I was most of the way through, I didn't totally understand the combat options and just easily slaughtered all of the enemies that came my way. I didn't know sparing enemies would actually change my game. This game definitely has sparks of light that shine through, such as some of the characters: the things some of the characters say are funny, charming, or cute. Unfortunately, I found most of the gameplay to be relatively repetitive and I found myself mashing keys to skip through dialogue just to finish the game and get to the end. If I had the choice again I would not pay the $10 for this game.

This review will likely get many downvotes as most of the community adores this game, but I am writing this to the small majority who may need to know that this game is not for everyone. It is a very linear game that has a few hours of mediocre gameplay lead up to one big quick ending that is touching but just not worth it. In the beginning I found a few of the quirks quite hilarious but it got old fairly quick as well as the same joking style got carried through, it seemed more immature than funny. Thanks for reading, I hope the community doesn't totally hate me :).",

The game forces you to replay it but it doesn't become apparent until the middle or the very end of the game.    Having a game lie to you, and then build lies upon lies until nothing is certain is probably what sold so many people on this game - and at times it makes for an interesting plot twist.

There is so little in the world that this game at times that I would call it a walking simulator. The dialog is interesting in this game, when taking a friendly route, this game is amusing. It is not laugh out loud funny like so many people say, and at times it is just annoying. But I did laugh once through my run through, and other times I enjoyed reading the text.

On the one hand, the premise of the game is amazing; the story is interesting and the characters loveable and hateable in equal measures. It has the ability to make you feel the strongest of emotions and make you make decisions you would in real life. The soundtrack is first rate; it's original and fun, setting the tone perfectly, and some of the puzzles are really quite well designed.  On the other hand, well the game just isn't very fun. From a personal standpoint, the whole 'Bullet Hell' combat system just serves as an irritant rather than an enjoyable game mechanic, not to mention enemies pop up constantly forcing you to tolerate this mechanic. While some of the puzzles are enjoyable and make you think, others are downright confusing and make no sense. There isn't one overriding reason why i don't like the game, but it just wasn't clicking with me. Other people will enjoy this game and have enjoyed this game, and gotten a massive amount out of it. Me, personally, i don't think i'm even going to be able to complete the game.  The worst thing about this game though is the community it spawned. the FNAF fan club was bad, Undertale's is diabolical. Never has a larger mass of scum and cancer gathered together over the floor of a game like an itchy, red blanket before. You get lynched for even mentioning a single negative thing about a game, what's that people say about stupid people in large groups?  This game is not inherently bad, far from it, it's one of the most original and thought out games i've played in a very long time, and stands out in a sea of mediorcity and Pay2Win monkey grinders.

            "review_text": "Welp...that ended badly. I got to (what I assume is) close to the end until the game's greatest weakness caught up with it. But, I will make this a fair review, so I'll list the positives.  -There really aren't any unlikeable characters, all of them a pretty tolerable, and some are great (Sans and Papyrus are the highlight characters) -The writing can be quite good at times. -The history and lore of the monsters is pretty cool, I wish it was given more focus aside from one area though.  You've probably noticed that I haven't praised the actual gameplay, and there is a reason for that. The gamplay is either barebones or deceptive. The game's whole gimick is that you don't have to kill anyone. This sounds kind of cool at first, but I quickly found how shallow this is. There is really no difference between sparing a monster and killing it. The only difference is if you kill it, you gain exp(I'll come back to this). The game gives you no real incentive to be peaceful, except to get the best ending(which apparently you only get on you're second playthrough? ♥♥♥♥ that). However, the only way to have any fun is to be peaceful, because the combat otherwise is ♥♥♥♥ing awful, and mindnumbingly boring. But even being peaceful gets boring after fighting enemies multiple times, since the Act tab is so shallow and the way to 'beat' enemies never changes. Bosses become a hell of a lot less fun to fight after 10 times of trying.  Now I think it's time to get to Undertale's biggest flaw. Obviously the best way to play the game is going the peaceful route. But, the game is no longer an RPG if you play this way. As I've mentioned before, you don't gain exp if you don't kill anything, therefore you gain no levels, and most importantly, you're HP doesn't ever increase. You are stuck with 20 hit points. In RPGs, your character is meant to grow along with the enemies, so that while the game is still challenging, you stand a chance. In bullet-hell games, the game starts out easier, and as your skill as a player increases, the difficulty increases. Undertale fails at both of these. The enemies get stronger as you progress, but you have no way to get better in an RPG manner. Also the style of the combat changes so often that you have no time to truly better your skills. This is what beat me in the end, as I was dying to regular enemies. Now to be fair, I've never been that great at bullet-hells, but I love RPGs, and that is what the game is advertised as. Sorry I was expecting an RPG to be an RPG.  There are more problems as well. The whole game feels like a shameless tumblr pandering scheme. With the 'lol so random' humor that the game uses too often, and all of the LGBTQZXVN+ characters and relationships in the game. Undertale does nothing out of the box or provocative. It stays so safe.  Also, there a zero settings in game at all. You can't change the volume,controls or aspect ratio, which is unacceptable and inexusable in modern pc gaming.  I have no desire to finish Undertale, which I think speaks a lot to the game's ability to make me truly engaged with my character's plight.The plot is certainly nothing fantastic. All in all, Undertale isn't awful, but it has some major problems that should be known.  5/10",

I grabbed it because of the enormous hype surrounding it and especially because there were comparisons to Earthbound, a beloved game from my childhood, but I don't understand the hype or the comparison.  If you are considering getting this game, you should understand what you're getting into:  This game is very heavily focused on story and atmosphere. Gameplay is repetitive, trial-and-error, and the encounter mechanics and inventory system are bare-bones and in some cases clearly not thought out with particular care.   But these flaws are not all mistakes; some of these problems were introduced DELIBERATELY in order to emphasize the writing even more. Much like trying every dialog option in an RPG, the trial-and-error encounters encourage you to try a variety of actions in combat and see the prose that results, enjoying them for their own sake.  Since this game is fairly story-centric and it's hard to get any info on the story without spoiler, I will summarize the first hour: You meet a flower who acts all weird and then this creepy goat lady tries to kidnap you but you convince her not to kidnap you, but she still gives you a big long hug which is extra creepy since she just met you. Then you meet the flower again and he acts even weirder and says some ominous stuff that makes so little sense I don't even remember it even though it was like 30 minutes ago. Then you go through a long sequence of two skeletons trying to capture you but not really that hard while they odd-couple argue amongst themselves, all the while assisted by cute dogs trying to murder you but not really that hard.  The take-away for that summary is that the game is 'quirky', but for me personally a lot of sequences fell flat. I think the game is supposed to be funny, but I didn't understand the joke half the time. Why was the clingy goat lady funny? Why is turning around really slowly to shake someone's hand funny? I think a lot might be lost because of the graphics. Going back to the Earthbound comparisons I had heard about: the comedic tone of Earthbound is very Japanese, and in true Japanese style, it conveys most of its comedy through its writing. Undertale seems like it was trying to convey more of its ideas graphically, but this means that  unlike Earthbound, the low-res pixel art holds it back,  which is why I think I'm not getting a lot of it.

            "review_text": "A very overrated game.  That's basically my review in a nutshell. I really hate to give this a negative review, but lemme still talk about it honestly. After all, this is a debated thing, and I do want to share my honest opinion.  First things first: THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO ARE BORED EASILY! Basically, what i'm trying to get here, is that this isn't your typical rpg game. In a positive and a negative way. First, this game is awesome. It really is. It's story, its world, it's unique gameplay, it's characters, Papyrus being my favorite... it has everything an rpg needs to be an RPG  The story is of course essential to an RPG-type game, and it's strong in this game. It might not be as fleshed out as others are, but its strong. The world is very engaging and you want to know more about it as you go on. However, you don't get as much information from this world as you would want. After awhile, you want to know more about it, and you just don't get the info you want to make it more interesting and loveable. And as of course when its a story-driven game, it's pretty linear, so that's another setback to its engagement. Also, the story will get boring after awhile as well. Not terribly, but in a way that you will feel a bit unsatisfied.  Fortunately, the characters in this game are amazing. All of them feel unique and exciting, and some you will definitely love. Buuut, again, after some time, they get pretty old, jokes included. Not saying all of them would, opinion is an opinion of course, but I'm sure even you will get those vibes that you just dont want to hear his or hers talking, perhaps you even want to skip some dialoque. But, that isn't saying they are poorly executed. The character development is so good my brains we're filled with hopes and ideas like waterfalls. Gameplay is definitely the most unique part in the whole game. The gameplay in Undertale is centered around talking and negotiating battles rather than fighting, with an option of fighting. These battles can be ended with 3 ways in total: Kill, spare or flee. Killing of course gives you gold and xp, but also can trigger either the neutral ending or genocide ending (which we will get to a in a few moments). Sparing is the hardest thing to do basically. In battles you can negotiate the enemy with talking, cheering, flirting, or even threatening. These of course are based on the enemy. You can achieve sparing or fleeing with doing some of these options. Either the enemy is influenced by some kind of hatred or sadness etc., you can respond to these emotions with these kind of options, but some are effective, and some are not. Then, when enemy is ready to end the battle, you can spare the enemy. Then you can also flee battles, which aren't that easy. You still have to do these things in order to leave a battle.At first, you get the hang of it, but it gets gradually harder and harder, and you even might have to look up ways to do these with some enemies.  Oh yeah, the fighting. Now the enemy attacks you usually with projectiles, that can induce a lot of damage. Some enemies are really easy, but some are hard as hell. How you respond to these projectiles is this little box on top of the option bars and below the enemy avatar, where you control a heart-looking object. This is your soul, and once a projectile hits it, you lose health (duh). How you fight back, is with this timing system. You have to hit the right spot in the right time with a straight line going side to side. If you hit the right spot, you deal a significant amount of damage to the enemy. A perfect hit might even kill enemies with one shot. This is a bit dissapointing for me atleast. I just wished they would've put more effort into fighting as much as in negotiating.  But then, theres the endings. And there's not just 2 endings, but 3. These endings can be triggered with some of the options in battles or befriending some of the characters. It's amazing to see how much devotion was put into making these kind of endings. 3 ways to end a great game. 3 ways to see the story come into a end. 3 ways to say goodbye in a satisfying fashion. (I dont really want to talk about the endings, cuz spoilers :P)  All in all, its a great game. I liked the majority of it, but towards halfway to the end, it became a bit dull and boring. Thats why, I'm recommending this to those who enjoy story-driven games, rather than full-action games.  7/10 Characters and Story (I would've given it a 6/10, but I loved the characters so much that I decided to give it a 7). 9/10 Gameplay and Endings (Same category because the gameplay influnced so much into the endings). Overall rating: 8/10 ( Again, I would've given it a 7/10, but because of the sheer devotion to this game work put into developing the characters, I would gladly give it a 8/10). ",

Cons: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The characters are extremely annoying. Almost all of the humor falls flat. The graphics are ugly. Retro graphics can look nice (Shovel Knight). This game looks disgusting. The combat is really difficult to control, but is a bit easier with a gamepad. The fact that people consider this to be the best RPG. The fact people try to compare this to Earthbound. The fact this game has a fandom.   In closing, it's not a bad game. It's not good by any stretch of the mind, but it's not terrible. What it falls victim to is the fact that people act like it's some masterpiece. It isn't. It's a fun little game with some ugly graphics and terrible dialogue and combat that is difficult to control. If this game was free, then I'd say to pick it up. If it was $5, I'd say to pick it up. But with the amount of budget-priced games on Steam that are much better than this, don't pay $10. I quit playing before I got to Snowdin Town and got a refund. Regret: 0/10",

            "review_text": "In one sentence, Undertale is a role-playing interactive story, with bullet-hell game play elements.  Right off the bat, I want to say that the strongest part of the game is the music. I'm super impressed by the music, and even as I type this now I am listening to a remix album that I highly recommend listening to, even if you never have or will play the game. It sets the mood in all the right ways - it's super charming, whimsical, fun, somber, tense, and everything else music needs to be to engaging and entertaining. If tobyfox never makes video games ever again, I hope he at least keeps making music.  Sadly, for me it's all downhill from here. Starting with the lore. I love lore and whenever I got hints of it I just ate it up. But unless I missed a lot, it's very scarcely delivered. There is one area with lore written on the walls and one area where characters tell you a story. Besides those two information dumps, it's not like you can wander around the world and pick up bits of history here and there. It's a shame, because I would have really enjoyed getting more information about the setting of the game. Most of the information is about characters, however.  Which is my next gripe with the game. Characters in the game are pretty frustrating to me. Now, obviously I am in the minority because everywhere I look people talk about how attached to the characters they were and I just do not see it. Almost every character you meet tries to kill or hurt you at some point. While they attack you they say the most random non-sequitur stuff. Even the non-combatant characters mostly just say nonsense. I think this is the games try at humor. Now, I thought I loved dadaist humor, but Undertale takes it to a different level. Maybe it's trying too hard to be random and funny, or maybe I'm just a jaded old man, but the 'humor' in the game did not connect with me one tiny bit. And the dialogue that isn't trying to be funny comes off as pretentious.  I don't really want to comment on the story of the main character and what happens to you as you play, too much, because people seem to think there's something to be spoiled. I don't know why, as when I got to the end I was still confused why people guard the game like there's some sort of big reveal that will blow your mind. Once again, maybe I'm a jaded old man, but I feel like if I had read or watched the game's story before playing it myself I wouldn't have lost out on anything. I thought the ending was weak and boring, and mostly just frustrating for ... reasons. Out of respect for spoiler-phobes I won't get into it now.  So the game play is pretty simplistic. You ever play the Bioshock 2? You know that hacking mini-game? Basically dealing damage takes the form of a horizontal bar at with a needle moving left-to-right across it. The objective is to land the needle as close to the middle as you can to deal the highest amount damage points. After dealing damage, consuming an item, or checking on the opponent, it is their turn and you are tasked to a large variety of bullet-hell patterns throughout the game. It gets pretty hectic and ties into the character or story in creative ways. I thought it was pretty well done, and I was lucky enough to never die, except for the 'final' 'boss' once, although I came real close a couple times.  That's Undertale from my perspective. For a moment I was going to say I feel bad for not liking it, but I shouldn't. Not everything can be great for everyone. It's just not a game for me. I look for a very different kind of story when playing games that are story focused. And that's okay. I'm very happy for everyone who has enjoyed Undertale, and I hope they get tons more games like it in the future.  Peace.",

            "review_text": "Undertale's gameplay is simplistic and minimally interactive. The bullet hell minigame is something you would only have to play for 5 seconds in a WarioWare game, but here it is the center piece of the combat. It is a really dumb mechanic, and one of the most abstract and asinine ways to contextualize the player's input I've ever seen.   There are very few additional systems in the game for the player to interact with, things that might be taken for granted in other RPGs. No skills, no stats, there are only 2 inventory slots, there's no overworld, it's completely linear for the most part and so on.   Furthermore, the breaking of the fourth wall is a particularly lazy and pretentious story telling method for anything that isn't pure comedy. Is it still 1998 here, and everyone's impressed that Pycho Mantis knows you played Castlevania? Hidden save files and commenting on the player's meta gaming is not clever. Any game that has good storytelling and engaging, properly contextualized mechanics has no need to break simulation and rib the player for playing the videogame like it's a videogame. A more impressive game would be able to tell this story using its characters, and give the player something engaging to do while it was doing that.",

The other option is to kill the bad guy but it again never changes just tap space at the right time to win. The story is alright but the jokes are sub parr, the game resorts to immature jokes, which can be funny at times, are over used and quicly become dull. The characters are meant to be uniqe and for the most part the game does well with this but you can easily tell what each character will be like the first time you meet them.

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER  Before you read this review, please grant this one request: read the whole thing. If you cannot do that, than please just read the last two paragraphs. I am not trying to take away any joy you find in this game, I am just stating how I feel. Thank you for reading this.   REVIEW   This game is alright at best in my opinion, but what has happened to it saddens me.  Firstly, I must applaud the creators, for what has been produced by such a small team is quite impressive. In addition, this game's premise is creative and the art style, though pixelated, pontificates the great effort put into the game.  With that said, this game has some issues in terms of character personalities and plot lines.  I oft begin with the plot. It is rather rudimentary in terms of the protagonist's goal, to leave the underground. However, in the first moments of the game, the player is introduced to a morality system of sorts (the aforementioned 'premise'), which is interesting yet leads to all players thinking that they MUST take the high moral road. This is problematic, as it leads to a one minded way of thinking that stifles the game's intellectual creativity. Ergo, if you go into this game as biased player (meaning someone has told you something about the game) or an emotionally sensitive player, you will fall into the standard demographic of players. As I observe some of the other reviews, I see that there are some people who agree with this notion.  Now, I believe the best way to address the character flaws is to describe my experience with the game. I bought this game around late September early October 2015, and I had heard nothing about this game whatsoever besides the name itself. I will save my breath and tell you this, I am dry, sardonic, misanthropic, and cynical, so I got what many would call 'The Genocide Ending' on my first playthrough. Yes, I was under the impression that the introductory statements about sparing creatures was supposed to be sarcastic, and that the player was supposed to act ironically and kill everything like in what the public would call 'A Standard RPG'. Consequently, once I defeated the final boss of that ending, I never launched the game afterwards for awhile. Hence, I was under the impression that game was supposed to have a dark or 'Edgey' ending and that I did what I could. Of course later I realised that there were more endings and I began to experiment a bit more.  You may be thinking two things:  'You must of been biased, nobody would get THAT ending on their first time.' or 'Wow, you are a really terrible person.'  However, whatever you may have thought, I feel that I ought to justify why I got such an ending. As I previously mentioned, I was nonplussed by the level of seriousness in the early stages of the game. Therefore, I failed to take the message seriously. Secondly, and this is where the character flaws come into play, I hated every single character in this game. 'Hated' is a bit of an understatement as well, I would much rather say that I LOATHED EVERY ONE OF THEM WITH EVERY GRAM OF WILL THAT I HAVE. Now I know that such a statement is an opinion, but come on, they have such archetypal personalities. Let's see: every motherly figure ever, check; deceptive antihero framed to be the villain with a tortured backstory, check; secret villain who is only revealed later on, check; the most annoying, insufferable, childish, idiotic, excuse for a character with a 5 year-old's sense of humor, GIGANTIC CHECK. There are more archetypes, but I tire of listing them. In addition, there is a segment of the game where, right after you are introduced to a character, they interupt you multiple times immediately making a slightly impatient person hate them. Oh, and that character who I demonstrated a sever disliking to, happens to be the centre of comedy in most of the game.  While I am already on the topic, the comedy in this game is meant for two demographics, young children (and/or people with an immature sense of humor) and internet dwellers. I hate both of those demographics, and I am not alone. Henceforth, when you get people wincing and sighing at the humor in this game, they most likely find the humor appauling.  There is one more thing however, the saddest thing of all, that I must address. The primary creator of this game, Toby Fox, made this game and did not expect the insane spreading and popularity that ensued. He, like all creators, had an idea, and he wanted to share his idea. The fact the he gained revenue and popularity was great, initially. However, it slowly spiraled downward destroying the reputation of the game. That is why I delayed writing this review. I unsure if complaining so intensly about a game made by mostly one person, but I finally decided to do it. The greatest tragedy of this game, is that anyone who actually enjoyed this game will not be remembered. The people on the internet have ruined this game, and what they have done will never be undone. Toby Fox will not be remembered as the guy who made a poignant game which touched many, but the idiot who spawned another cancerous and disgusting fandom. This is unfair to him, because all he wanted to do was share his idea. Had this game been released around the time that Earthbound, a game that inspired this one, it probably would not have been ruined, due to the fact that less social media existed. You want to know why this game is bad to so many? You want to know why so many people hate this game?  People. YOU people. I do not fully hate this game, but because of all you people this game will be scrutinized, torn apart, and destroyed. It will be left and remembered as a game of the times, which all future generations will laugh at. If you asked me after I finished my first playthrough, I would have reluctantly reccomended this game, but now, I cannot bring myself to recommend this game.  Well done.",

It's an incredibly simplistic bullet hell but with text pompts you have to click through every 5 seconds. There's a few creative gimmicks in later boss battles but everything else is a chore and the polar opposite of fun and that's if you play the 'Pacifist' route which is more involved and what the game clearly wants you to do. Playing different results in even more shallow, repetative gameplay. I get that this is a story driven game and combat isn't the point but that doesn't excuse making gameplay so unpleasant it turns the game into a slog just to see what happens.  - Ugly, muddy graphics. There's some clever spritework here and there but overall the game is a muddy mess that's unpleasant to look at, the player character sprite is especially bad.  The ugly: - Extremely cringy 4th wall breakage. I've seen a lot of inane, awkward LOL WE KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING A VIDEOGAME/READING A WEBCOMIC but this game honestly takes the cake because of how preachy it is. It's a video game, Toby, lighten up.  - Severe lack of technical proficiency. The game hitches and stutters along, even on a high end computer to the point that I was unable to play in fullscreen without getting motion sickness. This is completely inexcusable in a paid product. I've played plenty of other Game Maker games that don't have this problem so it's not an engine issue.  Overall I would not recommend this game unless you really, really like wacky, yet shallow, webcomic style humor and have a huge amount of nostalgia for NES games. There are definitely things to love here but they're mostly overshadowed by awful gameplay, technical ineptitude, and shallow characters.",

In concept it seems like a great way to have an RPG flow down a different river: You don't need to kill anyone to complete it. Great idea! I was intrigued. The flower in the very beginning was entertaining and I was looking forward to playing the game from that point forward.  However, that's where all the positivity stopped for me. I felt like the game was forcing too much onto me to try and get me to like it, and I didn't. The flower was the best part where I felt like they were just trying to do 'something natural'. Everything else felt forced and was a pure turn off for me. Trial and error puzzles were just tedious and annoying. Trying to be funny, old school style, was just not working at this point and seemed as if I was trying to be distracted from the larger picture of the game: They really had no idea what to do with it overall.  I got as far as (to try and remain as spoiler free as possible) 'the house where I forced my way through a doorway to a pair of skeletons'. That was all the more I could take. This may be a great title for some, but it isn't for me. And right at the skeletons is where I lost all interest in playing as I felt I wasn't really playing a game, more just sitting back and moving the main character from room to room in order to further the story. Yes, I'm aware that that is the basis of EVERY RPG, but I had character attachment by then. I had zero care for anything in the game by this point, no understanding of anything that was transpiriing that lead me to try and push farther and farther in order to resolve some epic issue, or whatever.   It was drab, boring, uneventful, and just tried too hard to be something different rather than be something different naturally and get me to care about any of this world.  It is great for some, but I am not one of them.  2/10 - 1 for the concept, and 1 for the flower. Will never play again.",

You have probably heard alot of good things about this game before such as YouTubers playing it or gaming mags writing good reviews about it. Overall it is good game with a great story line, funny jokes and some classic 90's graphics but I feel that all that did'nt make up for the fact that after a while the game just became a bore. The only challenges were bosses but they were still to easy, most monsters are little ♥♥♥♥ boys and can be killed with one hit. I dont know about you but I'm not a ♥♥♥♥ing orienteering master, this game has so many little ♥♥♥♥ing paths that lead you to useless places just to listen to frosty the ♥♥♥♥ing snowman give you a lecture and then give you a piece of his icy ♥♥♥♥ so you can eat it and get a bit of HP.  Pros:    Great story line    Classic graphics    Funny jokes  Cons:    I'm not an orienteering expert    Papyrus the skeleton has a constant boner    The main character looks like Dora the ♥♥♥♥ing explorer    ♥♥♥♥ boys, ♥♥♥♥ boys everywhere    I'm gonna get so much hate from all the fangirls   Edit: I got a ♥♥♥♥ ton of hate from the fangirls",

            "review_text": "This game was once something I could get behind. A good soundtrack though rather reminiscent of certain other RPG games, decent sprite work, and a story with moderate good flow and characters. But this game in my opinion does not really live up to the hype or deserve it overwhelming praise.  Let's look at all the pros of this game:  - good paced music - good for at least 2 play throughs with genocide and pacifist  - characters though overpraised are still likeable  These points combined with the fact that Toby Fox is an indie developer is impressive.  But there is a problem, this game is hardly the concoction of one person's imagination. Between the many obvious inspirations drawn from other similar games Toby modded before, to soundtrack a little too similar to those of games over a decade old is uncanny. I am not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the developer get, game development is hard and cudos to Fox for making something this big.  But my biggest problem is at the core of the popularity of Undertale vs other indie games and the community itself. The fact that Toby was not a one man army is often ignored by people, a common excuse given by people blindly defending the game is that he worked alone.  Tony had help, from the actual user Temie (yes Temie is the title of a artist who helped Toby), as well as the plentiful people providing additional ideas and character concepts.   People ignore this fact and worship a false image of a one man game making machine, the sad part is projects better than this game has solo creators and received none of the attention.  If people would like to stick to RPG themed projects then one must turn no farther then Bethesda fans. The mods for another acclaimed RPG Skyrim give up years of their life to make brand new worlds, mods so massive and packed with delicious content that it would take 1000 Undertales to hold a candle to them. Falskar, Enderal, the forgotten city which has literally won a writing award. All these amazing projects and the authors never received a penny or wanted any. They create for the enjoyment of others even better...and yet we are swooning over ludicrous spaghetti memes?  This brings me to the main problem I have with this community is the cash in fandoms. Things like Undertale have so many Alternative universe's that are exactly the same it makes me ill. Most are pure cringe or pure drivel and keep people from actually enjoying the game normally.  I have gotten off track and shall end here, between overpraise and cringe community I am done with this game.",

Admittedly with the amount of games I've yet to try this year I wasn't ready to give Undertale a lot of time to pull me in and since it didn't do it right away, I decided to move on to other games.   Apparently Undertale has a bunch of neat ideas later on, but the basics of the combat system put me off from the get-go. I know the fight/act system is a popular topic as a lot of people consider it a strength, but I just didn't find it appealing or fun.  While I don't personally recommend the game, it's probably best to try this one out for yourself.",

Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...    ...9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    'What's the difference?' How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!    Oh, this is so hard!    Heating, cooling",

Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I\\'m excited.    Here\\'s the graduate. We\\'re very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B\\'s.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That\\'s me!    - Wave to us! We\\'ll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I\\'d make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I\\'m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I\\'m not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don\\'t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That\\'s why we don\\'t need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...    ...9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it\\'s just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it\\'ll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She\\'s my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we\\'re all cousins.    - Right. You\\'re right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it\\'s done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you\\'ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn\\'t know that.    What\\'s the difference?    You\\'ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven\\'t had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you\\'ll just work us to death?    We\\'ll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    \\'What\\'s the difference?\\' How can you say that?    One job forever? That\\'s an insane choice to have to make.    I\\'m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We\\'re bees.    We\\'re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don\\'t know. But you know what I\\'m talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I\\'ve never seen them this close.    They know what it\\'s like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don\\'t come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You\\'re monsters! You\\'re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don\\'t know.    Their day\\'s not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can\\'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That\\'s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It\\'s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you\\'re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren\\'t they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let\\'s have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I\\'d knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn\\'t it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We\\'re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you\\'re not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We\\'re going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you\\'re interested in?    - Well, there\\'s a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It\\'s a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn\\'t right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That\\'s a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son\\'s not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I\\'m not trying to be funny.    You\\'re not funny! You\\'re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!       Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What\\'s available?    Restroom attendant\\'s open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you\\'re on.    I\\'m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey\\'s always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He\\'s dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That\\'s life!    Oh, this is so hard!    Heating, cooling",

Something happened to people's minds here, and they all went insane.   The main gimmick of this game, and what supposedly makes it more than primitive turn-based RPG, is the opportunity to 'mercy' your enemies, while gaining no experience. Experience in this game is BAD - that's the thing. Killing things is BAD - that's the other thing. Its primitive and stupid, and i not consider it as a spoiler.  But having one gimmick doesn't make a good game. But for its cost you can always check it out. But beware - it's not that great as everyone tell you it is. Really. Its not that good.",

            "review_text": "I wanted badly to like this game, and I can understand why so many people do, but sadly at the end of the day it just isn't good enough.  The Good: + The story at its heart is good and indeed is touching at points. + Choices have tangible impact on the world, unlike some much 'bigger' RPGs.  The Mixed: = The writing is an extremely mixed bag. In places, it is very good. Most characters however are pretty much one-dimensional caricatures, with one or two shining exceptions. There's a severe lack of nuance with most characters. = The humor is at times quite entertaining, surprising, and 'meta'/genre-aware. At other points, though, it is dragging, predictable, and repetitive.  The Bad: - Controller support. Does it work? Yes. But there is zero sensitivity for sticks, which is exceedingly annoying. You get 100% speed or zero, with no subtle touches. You may or may not find this as frustrating as I do. - The gameplay....oh dear the gameplay. Undertale is ultimately a bullet-hell game. With poor controls. In which you can't shoot back (  usually  ). I like this in theory, since it makes playing a turn-based RPG a little more interesting. However, unlike most turn-based RPGs, combat has absolutely zero tactics. You have exactly one attack (whether that is attacking or doing the 'right' action to talk them out of fighting). You use your one attack repeatedly. When it's their turn, you dodge. If you are low, you use an item to heal. Each enemy usually only has 2 different attack patterns to dodge. Once you learn them, you can either A: avoid them perfectly quite easily or B: probably still get hit by them, depending on the attack in question and your personal skill at bullet-hell with bad controls. At the end of the day, combat is just BORING. - The grind. Random encounters are exceedingly tedious, given the aforementioned combat system. If you're playing pacifist, it's moderately entertaining the first time you run into a new enemy to figure out how to non-violently defeat them. However, you are then probably going to run into 10 more of them, which you will do THE EXACT SAME THING TO. A genocidal run is even more boring, since you pretty much just attack. - The boss fights. Boss fights manage to be simultaneously boring AND frustrating. Most of them are interminably long and consist solely of you picking the same action (whether it's fight or something passive) over and over again while dodging the same three attacks. - The difficulty. Disclaimer: I am not good at bullet-hell-style games. So I found this game exceedingly frustrating, mostly because the difficulty never really seems to hit a nice middle-ground where things feel challenging but doable. Every single attack/encounter is either trivially easy, or just something to tank through with healing items. Dying is frustrating, you have to start over from a checkpoint and redo a lot of boss fight that is already a boring, same-y grind. If, on the other hand, you're better at bullet-hell-dodging, then honestly it's probably just going to be 100% trivial for you. Non-bosses are pretty much never difficult, regardless of your skill, with one or two exceptions (  god help you if you don't Clear Mind before Talk-ing to a Madjick and get your controls jumbled  ). - The repetition. There are high points of this game. But so much of it is just beating the same dead horse over and over again. As previously mentioned, boss fights normally consist of doing the same thing for 10+ turns with zero variation. Going through an area consists of fighting the same random encounter (maybe two) 5 times. Characterization of many individuals consists of them meeting the same trope 10+ times. Dying at any point, which is pretty easy to do, will cause you to have to repeat some amount of this repetition. No place was this more aggravating to me than with   Mettaton  . The first time it was funny. The second time it was a callback. By the fourth or fifth time you encounter them, it's just an annoying, worn out joke, that culminates in a frustratingly long and boring boss fight. - NG+ mechanic. A particularly frustrating example, in which you can't   get the good ending   unless you play the game again. Yes, I know that you can beat the game, then savescum to get it, but that just strikes me as cheating and not what was really intended, as well as just kind of making the narrative pointless.  Tl;dr: Undertale's strengths of story and humor can't balance out the repetition, boringness, and occasional frustration of the actual gameplay, as well as its semi-frequent flubbing of its strengths. I sadly made the mistake of watching a ~10 minute video of all the funny things that happen and then made the mistake of buying the game, only to find out that that was every single funny part of the game, and the rest is pointless unfun padding out the next highlight.  Recommendation: Go watch someone play it. You'll get all of the good and none of the bad.  P.S. It could be a pretty awesome game if someone actually designed a turn-based RPG with a fully fleshed-out combat system based on the bullet-hell execution (especially if you got bullet-hell the enemy on your attacks)...  P.P.S. Temmie is love, Temmie is life, though.",

The dialogue is very simple and poorly written, which makes the characters I've run into pretty dull. The artistic style is just plain ugly and again simplistic. I am sure this is dilberate, and I've never been one to feel that the graphics make the game, but I do think that even games with simple or minimist visuals can still look good. This one does not.   The combat system is something new, and could be fairly interesting, if it weren't for the fact that I feel pressured to not fight. Instead I feel bullied into figuring out how to unlock the 'Mercy' option for each enemy. Interesting for a moment, but quickly got boring for me. The fights were just more simple puzzles in a game full of simple puzzles. This game was just unable to do the one thing that I really need any game to do. Care.   Of course, you should take all of this with a grain of salt, as I have only played a small portion of the game.

Because this game will actively endevour to make you have a worse time if you don't. It' snot that you CAN'T play it over, it's just that the game remembers your choices, and gives you no chance to find anything you missed. That, and if you enjoyed it the first time you played, well thats it. The game will never let you do that again. But I hear you: 'Isn't this game all about the weight of choices?' Yes! Which is why it's bull that it never lets you see how things would have gone differently. Not to mention that it's a VIDEO GAME: the entire point is escapist entertainment, which it withholds on the basis of no more than '♥♥♥♥ you, you didn't do it right.'   P.S: This is all coming from somone who played full pacifist, and just wanted to see if I missed a few things. It's even worse if you went with the alternate route.

I probably won't replay it, at least not for a long while. Some of the characters were actually pretty annoying but thankfully you can get rid of them early. Interesting bullet hell mechanics in the fights and a lot of mind♥♥♥♥ and meta commentary. Music ranges from catchy to great. I got this gifted to me. Unsure if I'd spend my own money on it. Toby Fox doesn't know when to let go of a gag sometimes. This is gonna be a hit or miss for most, for sure. I can't say for sure if you personally will enjoy it or not. My initial reaction to the game before playing it was apathy. Sadly, that hasn't changed much. But I got what I wanted out of it, a quick little RPG with enjoyable music and unique mechanics and ideas.  Chances are if you're already sold on this game you will enjoy it. It didn't click with me emotionally or thoughtfully in any meaningful manner. I think this is one of those games where you absolutely 100% have to be invested in the cast of characters, and I wasn't entertained by or attached to any of them.  It relies on the player forming a connection with the cast so it can take you where it's trying to go, but if you don't connect it falls flat on its face and I feel like that's what happened to me. I was near gritting my teeth every time Sans and Papyrus were telling one of their puns.  There's really no doubt about the fact that if I'd replayed it two more times with the two different routes I would've gotten more out of it, but I was just not spurred on to do so.  I couldn't tell you why this is, perhaps because my number one goal in the game from the start was leaving the underground alive, and not necessarily making friends. That, and I tend to value my own well-being and safety above everyone elses. That's not me trying to be contrarian, that's a core part of my personal philosophies.  That said I feel like the message of the game was pretty hamhanded. I was figuratively rolling my eyes toward the end when light was shed on certain parts of the game. There's nothing wrong with a game giving you another option than just killing, I'm a big fan of, say, Fallout, where you can do a lot of different skill or speech checks to bypass conflict in favor of keeping the peace between everyone, but I feel like this game got grating in its criticism.  Sometimes a situation actually does call for surgery with a shotgun.  In the end, this game was nothing special as a whole for me, but it did have pieces of it that made me laugh a bit, or were otherwise enjoyable.  If you're NOT anything like cynical old me, hey, it might just click for you. And like I said earlier, if you already know about it and think it sounds like a cool thing, you'll probably enjoy it.",

Some very good music, a number of genuinely funny bits, a lot of 'dang, that was clever moments'… but a great number of frustrating combat experiences where I was left reloading saves to take on boss fights multiple times. I became very impatient with the game and just wanted it to end. It also has a very 'Internet lulz' sense of humor to it, the type of humor funny to 30-something forum posters.  Again, the game was alright. I don't have a nostalgia for any of the kind of aesthetics the game presents, and a general disinterest in purposefully touching story lines in games (I'll read a book or watch a film instead). Unless you're actively interested in these retro, artsy, 'one-guy-made-it-but-not-really' kinds of games, I'd recommend just standing aside. You're not going to miss out.

Good but the hype makes it unenjoyable because it's all like OMG IT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE about the ending, and yet it's just 'they all live happily ever after'. The characters are said to be like 'real humans' but they're all generic archetypes. Alphys is the Otaku with a Tragic Backstory, Undyne is Vriska+Meenah, Toriel is just incredibly stifling mom + ex-wife of king. Asgore is just nice guy who has to kill you. Asriel has no real personality given besides friend that turned evil. Papyrus is the idiot with a heart of gold, Sans is the slacker with a heart of gold and a dark secret. Mettaton is just egotistic. All servicable as characters and pleasant, but heavily over-hyped to where you're like 'this is all they are?'  Meanwhile the gameplay... the difficulty curve is ridiculous. It's either overpowered or no threat at all, there's no gradual curve, it's just two levels: blisteringly hard or completely easy. The save points are out of date as well. And graphically, it doesn't even really follow retro rules; it's faux-retro, though heavily expressively so. It also uses the music to make you feel emotions even if the scene isn't impactful, much like an Adam Sandler film.  I also disagree with several parts of the story. The 'determination' gag is never fully explained enough to where it doesn't cause a plot hole, and the jokes about no character understanding relationships (both romantic and platonic) makes it harder to bond with them when they're acting insane the whole time. The UI also has issues, I couldn't tell when I could spare enemies at times, and the only way to change the color for it to be more obvious is something you can't backtrack to.  The background character designs (and Undyne and Alphys's) often feel slightly derivative of Homestuck and yet original, a project the creator worked on, but not exactly, so that is more of a non-issue but worth mentioning. The music feels similar as well, but that is due to most of the music in the former being produced by the same person. It is also labelled by the fans as 'Earthbound's spiritual successor' but feels nothing like it.  Furthermore, the message is obvious within 5 seconds. 'You don't have to kill anyone, if you're determined and keep at it and be a good friend it'll all work out.' No interesting other interpretations, just that throughout the whole thing. The item management is non-existent as well, and the bait and switch on the protagonist name was honestly annoying and felt slightly like a betrayal to the player.",

I answered many questions and addressed many criticisms (which you can read below in the comments sections), and am now done and playing other games. I will most likely be deleting any new comments as to further not encourage any more discussion. Discussion thus far has had limited ability to lead anyone to new understandings, and it is boring.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   There is a fundamental flaw in the core concept that drives this game:    When a monster attacks me of their own free will, and inflicts serious damage, I personally feel obligated to finish off that monster instead of showing mercy. In fact, the term  monster implies exactly that - an evil being.  There is nothing profound about not fighting monsters in an RPG game.    Undertale  has a huge following, and gets alot of community love. I wanted to really like this game, but ultimately, it just made me frustrated and put me in a bad mood. But I gave my money for the game, so here are my thoughts:   Cons:  -The core 'gameplay' where skill is involved, is dodging things bullet-hell style. And I think it is frustrating as heck, as implemented here. There are a few times where you need lots of luck to not take damage.  The fact that I had to go through with alot of this before I could 'spare' a monster was exactly why I finished them off.  -This game is the very definition of linear.  My first and only playthrough of the game took 5 hours with absolutely no backtracking. I was on rails right to the end. This bothers me because I thought, as a gaming community, I thought we had gotten past these RPG dark ages. -I thought the art was fairly poor (backgrounds more so than the character sprites). Lots of hard lines and stark contrasts. Lots of empty 'white' space. -There is humor in this game, but most of it is not for me. Tongue-in-cheek puns kind of stuff. It gets old quick. -There was alot of different character 'themes' that tended to make the whole thing not jive. You have skeletons and gods and animals and some that even looked alien. Levels where the same. -Most puzzles were mild annoyances instead of being clever or requiring serious thought. -Further, once a puzzle mechanic was introduced once, it most often was never used again (ie the flower bridges, shooting gallery, snowball golf thing, etc.) -The main character looked quite ugly and disheveled, which to my knowledge, had nothing to do with the storyline. -The dialogue can be very interruptive at times (yes, I am aware that this is on purpose), and can get old fast. -The actual 'sounds' that the dialogue make are loud and hard. Very annoying over long play sessions.   Pros:  +Music was pretty good. +The storyline gets significantly better towards the end, but you need to sit through about 5 hours to get there. +Replayability is high. +Price is very reasonable. +The 'meta' game thing is fresh.   Clearly, this game just wasn't for me. I am not into breathy, linear RPGs with minimal artistic cohesion. I think the storyline is what everybody loves here, but it was not enough for me to recommend it. Peace. ",

A friend of mine really likes this game and having been such a big fan of OFF I had high hopes for what this game could accomplish based on reviews and what my friend had suggested. But, in fact, I requested a refund. There is nothing I find fun about this game. The controls are awkward and go against everything that I've ever been taught in RPG gaming and not in a innovative way but in this convoluted mess of controlls. I should not have to use this much of my keyboard to close a menu, I wasted so much time in the battle screen dying because I kept clicking the wrong button because I can't figure out their absurd mapping scheme. And the battle system itself, while unique, is not fun and probably my least favorite element of this game. I'm sure the battle system has some big revelation later in the game later on but initially it's just not fun to play and creates way more of a headache than a challenge. The music is atrociously repetitive, the jokes are horrible, the dialogue drags on and on and on and tells you nothing and hitting the x button will scroll you through it but you still have to hit enter AFTER that just to close the dialogue box. Not to mention it won't recognize you are trying to interact with something unless you face it (it doesn't auto turn). The puzzles are boring if not extremely easy, the story is not in any way intriguing off the bat. A lot of reviews praise the story so I'm sure it gets interesting but you have to wade through so much garbage to get there that the game looses any value. I have zero interest in the story let alone when compared against everything I dislike in the game play.

It's an amazing game that has quirky humour and lovable characters, an unique battle system that makes the game original for it battle sequences. Music that shakes your whole body with emotion. And its strongest point, a hidden story that is out of this world.  I'm clueless on how Toby have achieved that with the budget of a 12'' Subway sandwich. But he done an amazing work and by all means he deserve fame. This game, UnderTale. It's seriously wakes waves and tremors of emotion if you REALLY get involved in the story. As a personal confess, the true final boss fight had me crying the whole time. I didn't wanted to fight back, i wanted to stop. But with determination, i've carried on and passed through. And it really paid off at the end with a satisfying end to close the story and making you feel you've done the best for everybody you encountered during your journey to get back home.   UnderTale is a master piece to my eyes, it takes the throne when it comes to story and emotional situation. I'm giving this game a solid 10 / 10. Would have gave 11, but we'll be realistic.

The Good : The Music, the plot twists, the various smashing of walls, the unique battle system, and the fictional world. The Bad : I'm not sure how well younger players would be able to appreciate this game. It can get quite serious, and in order to truely be a hero, you're going to be playing the game on a budget, and constantly solving puzzles. I also kinda wish the ending went a little differently, and I truely mean a little differently. In any case, not a showstopper.  The Ugly : That stupid troll.

            "review_text": "It's perfect. This is quite honestly one of the best games I've ever played in my life. I absolutely recommend this game to everyone. The game has the humor and storytelling of Earthbound and Chrono Trigger, and I'd argue that it's on par with both of those games.   - Gameplay:  This is a turn based RPG at heart, the battles consist of timed attacks akin to Paper Mario, or if you prefer a more peaceful route, you can try to negotiate, hug, flirt, play, and even pet monsters to try to win the fight without violence. Defending yourself against attacks takes you to a brief bullet-hell segment, where you move a tiny heart around the screen dodging all manner of projectiles. The very active battle system entierly breaks up the monotomy of traditional JRPGs like Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, etc. Turn based RPGs aren't generally my cup of tea, but this one keeps it engaging enough to keep it from being tedious.  There's also no grinding for level ups. Monster encounters are actually few and far between for the most part, and once you defeat a boss in an area, the random encounters stop, allowing you to explore and find the MANY secrets in the world.  My first playthrough took me roughly 9 to 10 hours, but I got it AGAIN to replay on Steam.   - Story:  I'll do my best to avoid spoilers, but it's so hard because by the end of your first playthrough, all you'll want to do is talk about this game. This is one of those games with so beautiful of story that will stay with you forever. There are three endings, each one is so brilliantly unique and staggeringly different from the other two. The ending you get is determined on how you treat the creatures on your journey. NOBODY has to die, but that's up to you to decide. Your actions in this game have incredibly deep, and sometimes perminant consiquences. The 'true' ending is the single most satisfying ending of any game I've ever played, and I hope you're able to find it for yourself.  The game also is very aware when you try to do something cute. Not far into the game, you're presented with a difficult situation, maybe you screw up, or choose violence, and spill blood. You're very quickly called out. So you feel bad, and load up an old save just before and do it right this time. Instead of being called out for killing, you're called out for going back to change things. This game knows when you're trying to be cute, and you WILL be called out. It's a very new and exciting experience.   - Presentation:  The game has very NES style graphics. A lot of indie developers take the 8-bit route as an excuse to be lazy. Theres so many games that use 80's sprites nowadays that it's just getting silly. Undertale is one of the few that uses this graphical style to GREAT effect. Everything is quite plain when it needs to be, and yet so colorful and bright at other times.  The chiptune music is some of the best. Period. It performs the job of conveying feelings flawlessly, and I still can't get the catchy as hell tunes out of my head. I find myself listening to them on my phone constantly. There are dozens of tunes in this game I could listen to for hours on end. I've found myself entering a new area, having the music stop, and going back a zone to listen to it a little longer. There's hype as hell boss music, creepy and unsettling tunes for the darker moments, and some tunes that just made me burst into a fit of laughter. Every song feels VERY good, and theres a TON of them.   - Overall feel:  It's not until you play through the entire game that you understand the 'theme' of the game. There were parts where I was as uneasy as wandering through a horror game, there were parts that felt right at home in a game for children. There was plenty of good Disney-family-level comedy, as well as some more adult-level humor. Sometimes the game preaches the values of honesty and love and friendship like a kid's story, and other parts that were absolute terror-inducing nightmare fuel. It's an absolute rollercoaster and I loved every second.   - Final thoughts:  Please buy this game. Please play it all the way through, and find the 'true' ending. I'd give anything to lose all my memory of this game just so I could play through it again for the first time. THATS WHY I NEED TO LIVE THAT EXPERIENCE AGAIN THROUGH YOU.  10/10 It's the perfect game.",

If you're not down with dorky and often juvenile (though clean!) humor, bullet hell mechanics, absurdly challenging boss battles that you will have to replay repeatedly to get through, or confronting the morality of your game-related choices, this probably isn't the game for you.  I do feel tempted to complain about the in-battle puzzles - some of them are not only difficult, but counterintuitive - but I also feel like this is the point, as you can get through a few battles without solving them and still get a decent ending.

The game involves a child who falls into the underground where monsters reside due to a war long ago between humans and monsters. Long story short your goal is to escape the underground and this can be done in multiple ways. You can kill everyone, you can be neutral and do what you think is best at the time, or you can be a pacifist.  Each of these play styles will grant their own story dialog and possible hardships.    You are going to have a bad time if you do a Genocide run.     Not all enemies are the same. Doing a pacifist run you need to figure out how to spare them or flee. Sometimes a fight is inevitable and you will have to hurt your enemy. The game has plenty of humor and jokes in it. That said sometimes doing certain things in a fight can have humorous outcomes.  The game will remember if you replay it. It will also remember if you did a Genocide run. Would advise a pacifist run before you do a Genocide run unless you want to remove your games save file for a fresh start. There was also a hardmode but it seems to end after the first area and unsure if that will ever be completed. Leaning towards it won't be completed.  Steam achievements aren't a thing and probably won't be either.  In the end I had fun, I had humor, it has a story but you need to dig around sometimes to find it. Might also need to do all 3 play styles to get the full story out of it.   It was a good use of $10 imo.",

The game combines elements of earthbound and an adventure type game where you make choices in every fight to deal with the enemy. The battling combines two things, RPG mechanics and bullet hell which can come off as being a bit hard but considering I did a pacifist run (Where you kill no one and you gain no experience) I assume the game isn't too harsh on bullet hell. This game is amazing though. Amazing music, characters, story... pretty much this game is nearly perfect and while I do have a small annoyances with some parts, to be honest, it is so pointless to complain about it. The game gives off a nostalgic feeling as if the creators knew exactly what to do to make a good game, a good RPG that can make you laugh, cry and just smile. Honestly, this is a game that is worth the cost and while only having around 6-8 hours or so gameplay, it is still worth 10 dollars.

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of silly, funny, and completely dorky parts in this game. However, the amount of thought that went into this game's story is incredible. It's amazingly deep and keeps you guessing a bit about what's really going on. The characters that you meet are all dynamic in their personalities and quirks, and the game really succeeds in relating to the player. You don't just feel like you're playing a game - you're a part of it and all that comes out of it.  With the battle system, this gives you a whole new way to approach enemies, and the way that you interact with them and the NPCs changes everything. You pretty much play how you want to, not how the game wants you to. You can rush through it, killing everything and just staying on the main path, or you can take your time helping people and exploring every nook and cranny. There are multiple endings depending on your way of playing, and they're all well written by the developers.  If you aren't sure whether or not this game is worth $10, it most definitely is. I just finished the first playthrough of it in roughly 16 hours, so there's a lot of content for you to enjoy. The game is charming, immersive, and an all-around wonderful experience.",

            "review_text": "I'll be honest; when I first started playing Undertale I didn't see it as anything special. When I played through the first area the only thing I saw in this game was something as a homage to the Mother series and nothing more beyond the usual RPG fare. This quickly changed however when I was forced to fight a main character as the first boss and realized that there's much more to this game than meets the eye.   Undertale is more than just a simple tribute to old RPG's, it's a deconstruction of the entire genre and of the audence that plays it. Every choice you make in the game is significant to the development of the story along with the characters in it and these choices are sometimes not easy to make. More often than not you'll find yourself questioning your own individual character as you make these decisions, wondering if you're really working in the character's best interests or feeling guilty for caving in and killing that one monster for a level up and boosted stats. The fact that most players can't even bring themselves to make the worst choices against the characters they've grown to love in this game should speak volumes as to how well developed they are and how much of an influence they have not just in the game's universe but on the player themself. It is an adventure that I won't forget for a very long time and happily reccomend it to anyone who has $10 and a few hours of free time.   Also may God have mercy on your soul if you choose 100% it for all 3 different endings.  ",

Simply put, you're not going to expect some things to happen even if you think you've already seen the unexpected, if this makes any sense. Even after I beat the game for the first time, the game surprised me again and again. There are no clichés here (or very few).  When you first start the game, the first thing you notice is its distinctive graphics. Whether you like them or not, they are very unique and the designers should be proud of their work for breaking out of the typical sprites or cartoonish graphics that are so prevalent in RPGs. Not only the graphics are unique, but you will also see some very particular details in the areas because of them, because of the way the game is designed. A rock is just a rock, or maybe not, you'll see.  Speaking of rocks, you know how in other RPGs, there are items under certain rocks? I didn't find any here. I found something better, dialogue. It's easy to think that the only things that matter in games are better equipment and items, but when you think it through, isn't it more rewarding to have more content for exploring the game? You discover more about the game world and find things you wouldn't otherwise. What's the penalty for skipping side content in other games? You're less strong. Here, the penalty is you don't get to experience stories, you don't get to learn about the world and more importantly, find out if a rock is a rock or a dog. This reminds me of my favorite game (Final Fantasy 8), so I may be biased on this point.  The last point I'll bring up is a very crucial one and very important for me in any RPG: The soundtrack. I have nothing else to say, except it's amazing.  I won't say anymore, because the game is best experienced if you don't know or expect anything about it.  Enjoy it, it's an amazing game.",

God bless Toby Fox, this game is spectacular!   ONE DOWNSIDE THOUGH!   STAY, and I repeat, *STAY* AWAY FROM THE UNDER'TAIL' SIDE OF THE FANDOM! We can be a decent fandom, (every fandom has their kinks), but the Undertail fandom is extremely cancerous. This is an innocent game with an ambiguous Main Character, thats great! But what do people do? Make porn of it. People that want to 'bone a skeleton' are those you should be extremely concerned for. Its like the FNAF fandom that wants to screw animatronics, its not healthy and completely uncalled for.   So, if you decide not to be sexually attracted to a skeleton, fish, goat mom, dinosaur or a robot, god bless you. If you are sexually attracted to one, I hope you can feel the sins crawling on your back.",

            "review_text": "I've always had mixed feelings about  EarthBound . On one hand, the quirky humor and intricate plot made up for the fact that I'd always disliked turn-based RPGs. On the other hand, it didn't really innovate on the core gameplay and had a lot of forced grinding. And then along came this game. For me, hearing that it was basically  EarthBound  minus the things I disliked about  EarthBound  was enough to sell me on the idea, but in case you want to know more...  This is a game that not only discourages grinding, it discourages fighting at all. Monsters you encounter will still warp you into a battle screen, but very few of them are actually out for blood, and you can usually find clever ways to pacify them and send them on their merry way, and wind up a little richer in the process. (One of my favorites is that you can almost always just beat them to within an inch of their life and then spare them, turning the game into a school-bully simulator.) And you'll want that money for healing items and the occasional armor upgrade; the late-game enemies don't mess around. But you're not at the mercy of the Random Number Gods; every enemy has a unique graphical real-time attack to try to dodge, whether it's a visually-challenged dog who swipes at you with a sword or a depressed ghost who pelts you with tears.  If you're thorough about exploring, you should earn enough cash from regular encounters to stay stocked with items without having to wander around picking fights. And even so, you'll spend far more time solving puzzles and chatting with the Underground's wacky locals. The dialog would be worth the price of admission alone; there's a reason these characters have found their way into the hearts of players all over the Internet and inspired a tidal wave of fan art not seen since the  My Little Pony  craze.",

Others would say that it's just an overhyped game that's not gonna be remembered in a year. For me, it was like an experience that I will never forget for sure. I first played the demo way back when it was released in 2013 and I was impressed quite a bit. As a person who had played throught Earthbound and Mother 3, I was hoping for this game to not be a shoddy attempt at being another Earthbound game but failing. But when the game was released and I saw the trailers and watched some gameplay footage, I instantly knew that this game was for me. The entire game, while it plays like a typical RPG is more like an experience. You are a kid who is given the choice to either make friends or to start a homcidal blood bath and what makes it more interesting is how characters and the game itself changes based on your choices that you make. The music itself is a blast to listen to that I even will listen to it every once in a while. I think that given the games' multiple endings give this a high replay value and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Earthbound or just games with a retro look to it.

The last few years have been full of some really great games, but also a lot of bad ones that have left a lot of people skeptical, discouraged, and bitter. The impact of the good ones was watered down by the overwhelming number of the bad ones. Undertale came along at just the right time with just enough quirk for people to try it out and hope it was a good one.  And it was.  This game is absolutely drenched in charm and atmosphere. Fun and imperfect characters that you grow to enjoy (or hate) as you play, unique combat that's frustrating, rewarding, challenging, and mind bending all at once, puzzles to give you a rest from battles or to brighten up a calm area. The soundtrack is amazing, it sets a serious tone or amps you up or helps you relax in just the right places. (I've listened to it for a week straight so I'm highly biased on this point)  That's the main thing I think this game does well, set the tone and the atmosphere. This is an experience. One that no player two players will experience in the same way. Because this game isn't for everyone.   That's the inherent flaw in this type of game.  The main reason I enjoyed Undertale is because it's suited to the way I play games.  It's full of tiny secrets that you'd only find by going off the main path and poking your nose into every nook and cranny you can find. I investigated every single thing I came across and I was rewarded for my efforts. The more I find, the more I want to search. Sometimes it's as little as triggering a slightly different string of dialogue or it's as big as finding an item that could give me a boost in battle (or non-battle, whatever your prefrence),   I enjoy the feeling of discovery and wonder.   Undertale let me feel that in a way that was enjoyable for me.    That feeling doesn't appeal to everyone.   However, it's biggest flaw is also it's greatest strength. No one is going to experience it in the same way that I did.   For as many different kinds of people there are in the world, that's how many ways this game can be experienced. I liked the characters so I found them enjoyable to interact with. I liked the style of the world so I found it enjoyable to explore. I became invested in both because I grew attached to them through the story that I also enjoyed.   Everyone is different. Everyone has different things they like and hate. That's okay.  I enjoyed this game because I didn't let the 'OH MY GAWD THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVARRRR!!1!!1111!!!!' hype raise my hopes beyond expecting that it was probably pretty good. I went in knowing there might be parts I didn't like and tempered my expectations accordingly.  But that's me.   While I don't think it's the greatest thing ever created like a lot of people do, I understand why they feel that way. I thoughly enjoyed my time playing it and I'll hold the memories of my journey in my heart for a very long time to come.  Because this is my type of game.   If it seems like your type of game, don't go into it expecting the best thing ever, but expect to enjoy your time playing.",

I already loved the characters and the story seemed fun. It seemed light and fluffy with a dark shadow cast over it, which only recieved a bad reputation due to the more rabid fans and people who just didn't focus on the right parts of the game (like those who've purposely fight to get a certain ending).  However, I then played the game.  To begin with, I was right. It was nice and fluffy and innocent and I enjoyed it. Then I got to   Papyrus'   battle and lost several times. It annoyed me but I carried on and had a good laugh making him run back and forth between the living room and kitchen. Then   Undyne's   battle was a bigger pain... Then   Muffet's  ... Before you knew it, I was suddenly no longer having fun and just spent my time googling ways to get past any and all scenes quickly. By the time I hit   Asgore's   battle, I'd resorted to file editing just so I could beat him (I was LV1 with 0EXP and 20HP and all boss attacks effectively violate your health bar in general). It wasn't until that last bloody fight that I found out I'd wasted my time avoiding conflict as I could only get the best ending by beating the game once... Then the final boss came along... Don't get me wrong, beat him second time around, but I honest to god had lost all will to game by this point.  Now I'm replaying to get the best ending and then intend to avoid the game for a while. Honestly, I like the story and love (most) of the characters, but the battle system is as fun as having your beanbag ran over by a steamroller. Regular battles you can live with the annoyance, but boss battles are like having a hacker on a PvP server... You just want to kill them so very badly but know you can't without one hell of a run around beforehand.  For the story, characters and bad jokes, I recommend this game. But, for the combat system, I recommend you get it on sale. A fun and fluffy game spoilt by ugly jagged battles. 7/10, will end up challenging my DETERMINATION again.

Will leave the 'had to beat the game once' here anyone who doesn't know that will be driven insane like I was.)",

If you like the impossibly upbeat and can laugh and embrace absurd humor, you'll find yourself right at home. Something to note is how steeped in internet and video game culture this game is. Although not being vastly knowledgeable in the subjects they touch on won't impact the gameplay, it might just leave you a little perplexed. However knowing all of the in-jokes and references, will only make you appreciate the level of detail that has gone into this game that much more, exponentially.  Getting right down to it, there's not much to say about the story that hasn't already been said in other reviews. It cannot be stressed enough that this game gives you, the player, real consequences for every single one of YOUR actions. No detail was too small and no context was left unobserved by Toby Fox and his team. And EVERY SINGLE ACTION you do in the game has a greater impact then one could imagine from a game. Emergent gameplay is the name of the game here (pun intended). The team that created this game has gone to great lengths to subvert tropes and make you really appreciate putting yourself in someone else' shoes (namely the main character).  When entering this game for the first time, it's highly recommended you throw away everything you knew about video games. Absolutely never give into your curiosity and really think about everything that you're actually doing. You will come to quickly learn that the habits that have been cultured by video games are not accepted here. Also the game is incredibly meta and you may find yourself on the receiving end of a 4th wall breaking comment. Finally, to really pound into your thick skulls that all actions have consequences, the game has only one save slot and the game will remember every single action you took in all of your playthroughs. This can be subverted by messing with the appropriate files in the directories folder. But if you're going to such lengths, what was the point of playing this game at all?   Never do anything YOU yourself wouldn't do if put in those situations or else you might just have a bad time.",

            "review_text": "Undertale is by all means one of the best games of 2015, if not of the entire decade. This is a game with heart and love that you will hardly find in any other one. The emotion, kind spirit, and warm, joyful, yet bittersweet atmosphere is touching in its every being and will not let you go even long after you finished the game.  This game will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and most likely, is going to make you cry. The characters, from the funniest and most innocent skeleton to the most psychopathic flower, are all likeable and memorable in their own way once you learn their story that has its three different endings, dependent on your way of playing. Each of your decisions will influence the end essentially. To fully enjoy Undertale,  do not spoiler yourself.  Enjoy it at your own parse and in your own manner. This is one of the most important aspects of Undertale.  Undertale will not hold your hand and guide you, telling you every secret and every detail you have to know. You will have to find out your way on your own. You will not fully experience this game without slamming your head against a wall and keeping to do things that are seemingly fruitless. That is another major point of Undertale. If you strife for completition, you will have to pay a high price as well. This game is full of wonderful and deep going details and secrets that you have to explore.   Whilst on one side Undertale appears kind, colourful and cute, almost childish, full of running gags, charming humour and adorable, cute characters, on the other side it takes itself very serious above this. It carries an important and very, very emotional message, features a deep and twisted story and intentionally breaks the 4th wall in an astonishingly manner, making that an essential part of the game and its meaning.    Certainly, the game's pixel-y and RPGish style is not something for everybody. I think however, that you have to look beyond mere appearance. Undertale is not about aesthetics or gameplay itself, it is about story, a lot of story, about bounding with its characters, about love to detail, dogs, maturity, dogs, pacifism, emotion and so on. It is about the game and its genre itself.  ***  All parts of Undertale fit seamlessly together, from visuals to story to gameplay to soundtrack.  Due to its 8 pixel style very simple and fundamental, the world and in particular the character sprites are nicely drawn and have their own quality that puts them above generic graphic perfection of AAA titles.    The music is another major aspect of Undertale, for it fits  perfectly  at every single moment, with reoccuring themes -- the so-called   leitmotiv  [en.wikipedia.org]   placed throughout the game and a simply beautiful track that accompanies you for the entirety of the game, both sticking out for its pure beauty and yet not sticking out more than a soundtrack should.   The combat system is the gameplay's fundamental core, of course. You have the choice to fight and eventually kill your opponent, befriend or shoo them away through various ways to act in order to spare them, use items and flee. A lot of character interaction and story happens through these fights,  all  of which can be concluded in a nonviolent way. The fights are all unique and thrilling, albeit maybe hard for people who struggle with bullet hells. No boss fight feels like the others, whether you choose to kill or spare.   ***   Play this game. Be filled with...  DETERMINATION .    Should you have any questions regarding the game  once you have finished it , check the  Undertale Wiki  [undertale.wikia.com]  or the  Undertale subreddit .",

A person can totally play the game once, not get the best ending, and be satisfied with the 6ish hours of gameplay they get. It never forces you to get 'the perfect ending' or 'the worst ending'. But because the endings are actually completely different, they're worth replaying the game to see. Even the act of replaying the game is itself worked in as part of the story, as many characters maintain awareness of what you did in previous runs.

Born and raised in the N64 era, while I could appreciate retro games, I didn't feel the same pull as them as other gamers; I haven't played and finished many games from that era, so they hold no nostalgic value to me. As such Undertale's graphics, musical style and battle system didn't quite draw me in; if anything, it's obvious affinity for a time before mine made me feel like it was directed to another audience and was probably not quite for me. Still it was only 12 bucks, I wasn't playing anything in particular, and the last indie project I sunk my teeth into- the Stanley Parable- was a brief, but quite enjoyable affair; that plus the aforementioned made me say 'oh, what the heck' and give it a shot.    It wasn't something that IMMEDIATELY grabbed me; the first half of my play time- only a few hours or so- were enjoyable but spread out over a few days. The characters were endearingly quirky, the dialogue was well written, the musical score was excellent to my pleasant surprise, and the battle system was fun and unique; I had nothing bad to say about the game thus far and was enjoying myself, but I couldn't see what all the hubbub was about.    By the time my first playthough was over however, something had changed in my viewpoints; characters had gone from endearing to people (er...monsters... whatever) that I truly cared about, certain plot twists hit me out of nowhere and threw me for a loop, what I had been doing up until this had meaning that I wouldn't have expected, and the final boss (for the 'normal' or neutral' loop) was something that was quite terrifying and unexpected.   Before I knew it I was back for more; I couldn't just stop here. I needed to get to a better ending! To leave the world the way it was would just be depressing, so I wanted to play it and get the BEST route. Many hours later, I did; along the way however, the game had pulled me into its clutches even more, sprinkling in even more climatic and downright suspenseful moments along with a few poignant moments that really touched my heart. By the time the end credits rolled around, I left this game feeling satisfied, enlightened, and wishing for more.    Sound a bit sappy to you? Well, there's a good reason for that; Undertale's plot, humor and allegorical message also serves as a allegorical message that speaks directly to the player. It pokes fun at the tropes of RPGs, it impresses upon the player of the consequences of their actions in a way few games seldom accomplish, and even speaks to- sometimes criticizing- the reasons we play games to begin with. Whether it connects you on an emotional level as it did with me or not, if you call yourself a gamer, you'll get something out of the message the game is trying to get across.    Now, literally only one day after completing the game, I can say that this game is- without a doubt or exageration- one of my favorite games of all times . It has style and substance, a perfect blend between gameplay and story, and is unique in a truly novel and wonderful way without ever feeling gimmicky. The soundtrack, just to reiterate, is AMAZING; good enough for someone who ISN'T a fan of this style to go and buy (alongside the free tribute album, Pianotale, which is exactly what it sounds like, and is quite good); I have been listening to this all day at work today, and it has not once got old. Long story short; it's an EXCELLENT game. If you're feeling like something new, give this a shot; you could do a lot worse for $12 :)",

In so many ways, this game is a huge love letter to all the old school nostalgic RPG games of the 8bit and 16 bit era, while at the same time having enough heart warming characters, story and music to carry itself without relying on said nostalgia.  Talking too much about the game, even how the game itself plays is almost a spoiler in and of itself, the game really shines on a straight blind play through. The game's length is perfectly measured, but like Portal, it never overstays its welcome, and ends when it needs to.  And finally, for a game as short as it is, it somehow managed to be so much more charming and wonderful than pretty much any of the multi million dollar AAA games in existence. I will always remember Undertale's experience, while those massive budget titles ultimately feel like just another notch on the belt.",

Genocide Route advantages: If you kill, you level up and get more health. Genocide Route disadvantages: You will be hated by all of the monsters(except one not saying who). Pacifist Route advantages: Monsters won't hate you(except one that you can't befriend only if you do the Genocide Route). Pacifist Route disadvantages: As you can't kill ANYONE to get the true pacifist ending you can't level up to get more health. Also, if you're getting this game, you should also get the soundtrack.

A light, goofy turn based RPG much in the vein of Earthbound, Undertale is short and sweet game with a unique little hook; nobody has to die. It's that little hook, a quirky cast of characters, and a unique sense of humor that really makes Undertale such an enjoyable time. Combat is (mostly) simple; you can fight or you can attempt to passify enemies with various acts/retreating, while the enemy attacks with shmup style bullet patterns. Even with the shmup elements, you're rarely going to have much trouble (with a few exceptions) with combat, so if you're looking for a real challenge and there really isn't much customization going on outside of some weapon options. If you're looking for meaty gameplay mechanics and systems, Undertale isn't really doing that. It's much more about story, humor, and characters. There's also some meta-commentary for the completionists out there, but I won't spoil that for you. I really enjoyed my time with this game; not sure if I'll go back again, but I certainly did enjoy my time with it.",

The music is amazing, and I'd say even worth spending 10 dollars to download. Every track is memerable and is just amazing to listen to  The story is a complex, but at the same time easy to understand story that'll make you feel emotions you wish you hadn't, and depending on what route you take will make you question your morals and whether or not you ever want to hurt anything in a game again.   Speaking of the story, the game has different routes, giving different endings depending on your play style and providing a great insintive to replay the game once you've beaten it already in order to fight new bosses and see new story lines emerge.   The battle mechanics may be one of my favorite parts of the game. The fact that you don't have to kill anything is innovative enough on it's own, but the way you fight enemies and can avoid getting hurt by using your skill with the keyboard to avoid their attacks is superb.   The graphics are simplistic but never make you struggle to understand what you're looking at on screen. You can tell the developers spent a lot of time making the art for this game and some scenes can be very beatiful to look at.  Over all I believe undertale is a fantastic game, and one of the best games of all times, up there with other gaming classics. If I did have to have one critism I suppose it's the game is a bit short, I took 5 hours to beat one of the easier story lines so there's still tons of gameplay for anyone to play. If the developers ever made an Undertale 2 or dlc for the game you can be sure I'll be one of the first to buy it.  (Summary) WORTH THE $10, 10/10",

I remember seeing this game reccomended to me many times and passing it off as just another RPG game that I have no interest in. I don't care for RPG games, but this is one GIANT exception.   This game has a great storyline, especially for those who are faint-at-heart or violent beings. I, personally, didn't have the heart to kill everyone (not telling you what happens, but I do know), but apparently when you even harm a single soul after playing it through, it will make you feel terrible. This game touches hearts, which brings me to the characters.  Where do I even begin? The character development in this game is PHENOMINAL! I cannot stop playing it! Even though I've completed it about 3 times, I cannot put it down! This really twists your head around characters you wnat to hate but grow to love! The challenges they are put through, as well as the lore behind their origins, it really puts the player to think where they all originated from before the underground.  To keep this from being about 300 pages long, I will summarize this game in a few sentences. (why you sould buy it).  This game has many different ways you can play it, each way the characters view you from a different standpoint. Every way you play the dialogue changes, leaving many possibilities for how the game is played or ends. The characters are very well-made and developed, as well as the storyline and the entire concept. It really puts your emotions into account with each desicion you make.  I give this game a 10/10.

Best characters ever. DOGS!!!!!!!!!!!! It remembers everything.... and I mean EVERYTHING! Replayability for days  Cons: A bit on the short side Can tend to have some nightmare feul   Overall Analysis:  Even with the few cons, this game is near perfect. Definitely worth ten bucks.   10/10 would be filled with determination again.",

I just completed the True Pacifist run, and I can honestly say that this is a game you should NOT miss out on! If anything, this is one of the few games I've played that I wouldn't mind experiencing again!  ***MINOR SPOILERS BELOW***  PROS: -Engaging story -Pacifist Route makes the game very relaxing and is sure to put you in a chipper mood. It also adds a degree of difficulty as you have to find a way to defeat monsters without hurting them, while their attacks can still damage you. -AMAZING music. I mean, Asriel's theme? Homygawd~ -The characters you build a bond with are just so lovable and quirky in their own way. Even side-characters and their conversations are interesting to listen to, and give so much depth to the world of the Underground and the lives of its denizens. -Lots of memorable moments- ranging from ones that make you burst out laughing to ones that tug at your heartstrings. -Lots of clever jokes thrown out here and there -8-bit style is well-executed -Despite having 3 main areas for you to travel between, the world seems massive in scale and has so many fascinating areas to explore- from the friendly town of Snowdin to the mysterious caverns of the Waterfall.  +/- -The battle system incororates some 'bullet hell' style gameplay. Some boss fights can become rather frustrating, and I even restarted my game because I was unsatisfied from the amount of times I died. (NOTE: KEEP LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR GOLD, BUY HEALTH ITEMS, AND USE ANY GOOD ARMOR YOU CAN FIND!)  CONS -You have to complete the Neutral Ending in order to be able to get the True Pacifist Ending. I feel like it's just a drag that you can't immediately get the 'best ending' on your first playthrough. But on the plus side, despite being a nightmare to look at, the Neutral Ending's boss isn't that hard as I expected...  Tl;dr- With memorable characters, lots of laughs, emotional moments, epic music, a nice difficulty curve, and an interesting world to explore, Undertale is a game I couldn't recommend enough. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot!  10/10, without a doubt!",

However, what is truely impressive about this mechanic is that each new enemy feels like a different experience, keeping the game fresh further than its whimsical concept alone could support.

You'll probably spend about 15 hours in the game. But you'll love it.  Okay, let's be real. If you have spent any time looking at the reviews you probably noticed at least one of three things: 1. Just about everyone who is raving about the quality of the game has (generally) under 30 hours ( this obviously includes myself) 2. There are many people who love to portray either the game or themselves as the most intellectual things to ever grace the planet (shot's fired) 3. What is this 'Hoi I'm tEMMiE', butterscotch pie, 'You're gonna have a bad time' garbage  So here are my answers:  1: you really won't spend that long on it. And that is totally fine. It's $10 and can be beaten once in about four hours. But there are multiple ways to play, so you'll probably spend about... 12 hours on it? I still think that's solid.  2: the gameplay/experience is great. Don't expect graphics. Expect surprisingly three dimensional characters and amazing music (assuming you're into more electronic type music). I wouldn't classify it as some great art piece of a game, however I will say that the dev, Toby Fox, put some real care into the game and it truly shows.  3: that's the fan base and they're fantastic. I think I've spent about as much time jamming to the sound track while surfing  reddit.com/r/undertale  reading the comics and whatever other thing someone who's more creative than I made.",

But it's more complex then that as some of the characters are dirctly aware of your interfernce in the world and screwing with the time line through SAVES but are unable to stop you because.....well they can't exactly see or hear you. You make ths choices throught the game that actually have a meaningful impact (the final boss at the true pasfist brought tears in my eyes with a smile) and i personally couldn't bring myself to play though it again because of what Flowey said at the end of the true pasfist ending and i honsetly would feel like a huge ♥♥♥♥ if i did a true restart as i would be taking away everyone's happy ending just to stacticate my own boredum (Game called me out on my ♥♥♥♥ exuse and said that there's no alternate dimesnion when you restart)  It a great game, and like others i thought this was another 'FNAF fan wave ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t' but the music is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible (San's battle music my god...soooo good) and for a game that dosen't look rather impressive when walking around in the first area, after that it looks fairly good imo. On battle phase the characters look very well made and the gameplay is actually rather fun (though if you don't like bullet hell then you're going to have a   bad time   )  I highly recomend this game, there's almost no reason to pick this up short of 'i don't have enough money.'

I love choice and consequence games and this game puts a great deal of emphasis on the consequences of your actions. Be a kind but determined pacifist, and the story will feel rewarding. Be a ruthless killer, and the game is ruthless in return. Regardless of what path you choose, the narrative is powerful.   The gameplay is a twist on traditional RPGs, allowing the player to talk their way out of a fight instead of killing their enemy. The game also forces the player to dodge enemy attacks, instead of simply relying on a chance system to determine if the player takes damage. This unique fighting system is coupled with a solid story and an amazing soundtrack, making each fight feel rewarding.   All of these elements combine to create a fantastic experience that is fun. Even when the game goes a little easy or hard on you, it's usually to further the narrative. And, even when a boss kills you over and over again and you are forced to backtrack a little to get better items, the soundtrack manages to recreate a consistent thrill that makes failure much less tedious.   The only real downside to Undertale, in my opinion, is that the game can get a little too overwhelming. It works wonders for the overall experience, but players who are highly emotional or have anxiety issues should take breaks. Toby managed to make me incapable of harming these characters without feeling intense regret and you will probably have a similar experience.  TL;DR: If you want to play a RPG with a great narrative that puts emphasis on your choices, I highly suggest playing Undertale.",

The story is wonderful in every way: how it's presented, how it resonates, and how it both contructs and destructs itself. It doesn't take much to get immersed into the spiraling story, nor is it hard for every moment to show character thoughout.  Story is great and all, though it's not the only strong suit that Undertale has. It also keep track of a lot of your actions, like you'd be very surprised how in depth it follows you, and it is one of the more interesting aspects you should look into once you play it.  I won't ellude to the story, but it is most certainly made to be played more than once, maybe even more than twice. Honestly, this game makes the most minute actions some of the most meaningful and epic things you can do, and you feel great for them (not all minute things, but a good chunk of them).  The charactrers are wonderfully written and designed, and the music is sublime!  Honestly, I'm not doing justice to this game and how awesome it is, but that is because I wanna let you experiece it, so honestly, just play it and see. If you're not into RPGs, they try this one, it's pretty damn good. Oh, it's also a bullethell, so maybe that'll freshen the pot.  ",

It only got better and better as I kept playing and got deeper and deeper into the story.   I would recommend playing the game before knowing too much about it but I will go onto a little more detail (no story spoilers) below.  What makes Undertale so great can't really be explained fully, there is simply too much depth to explain what makes any given moment fantastic. The game plays with it's own rules constantly and keeps referencing itself, twisting mechanics that you thought you learned earlier in the game. On top of all of this it portrays story through the gameplay mechanics themself, and you feel a direct connection to the story through what you are doing in the game.  Long story short, Undertale is a game that I think every gamer should playthrough in their lifetime.",

A gameplay experience that compliments this story by refreshing itself with new mechanics and unique confrontations consistently throughout the not-quite-too-short time it takes to make a single run through. Great character designs and awesome sound design despite the technical limitations. There are scenes to make you laugh and scenes to make you cry, and neither ever feel out of place because the pacing and storytelling are that good. Undertale is one of those rare pieces of art that's more well thought out than most releases 10x it's size, the kind of discovery that reminds me why thousands of years after the hero's tale was settled upon, we still come up with new stories to tell each other. If there are gripes to be had they are that fighting enemies with the intent to kill requires no strategy, tactics or thought other than timing and dodging, making it a strictly less interactive and fun method than talking your way out every time. It can be argued as being intentional, but if all Undertale did was flip what most games do (make the violence interactive and the talking more like a menu) it suddenly seems much less original and interesting, and at times it felt a little like that. As it stands, I dread starting a Genocide run to complete seeing the rest of the story because just thinking of thoughtlessly button mashing my way through the game makes me bored. I have a couple minor gripes mostly relating to the game's ending(s) that I won't post here because, y'know, NO SPOILERS. Undertale is an experience for people who love video games and stories. I'd give it at least a 9.5/10 as an honest-to-god rating. It's not the biggest adventure out there, the one with the most secrets, the most twists, or the most characters. But the amount of good ideas packed into this little package is full to absolute bursting. I honestly have a hard time thinking of anyone who I don't think would enjoy it at all. But I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you haven't heard before. The hype surrounding this little game is, to say the least, DETERMINED. Stop fighting it and know that someday you're gonna end up playing it to see what everybody's talking about anyway.",

            "review_text": "This is a very good game! It's wonderful to have an RPG where you don't have to kill anyone or anything, and it's not necessary to build up your level to get through. (During my playthrough, I only needed to 'grind' for a little bit once, right at the end of the game, and that was just to get in a few fights so I could get enough gold to buy more healing items.)  The combat system is creative and fun. It's very nice and refreshing to see a combat system that is aesthetic and visual, and which you get through not by making move after move after move, like I do with most other RPGs that I've played, but by avoiding the white 'obstacles' as they fly towards me. It's a combat system that rewards reflexes and co-ordination, so it feels more like you're in an actual battle, where you have to have your wits about you! Plus, some of the patterns that the obstacles fly in are very creative and actually fun to look at, which makes it all the better!  Also, the puzzles (and 'action scenes') elsewhere in the game are fun too. They're creative, well-thought-out and varied, so the game keeps feeling fresh. They, along with the fights, are challenging enough to keep me on my toes but not so hard that they become frustrating. Admittedly, I did need a few tries to get past some of the 'bosses', but I managed them all with a bit of practice.  The game's story is engaging and interesting. It's also excellent that there are several different ways that the story can change, based on the choices that players make. That means that there is a lot of replay value for the game - I'm certainly going to play it again and see if I can do things differently. Plus, the story is well-told, well-paced, and skillfully moves between atmospheres - sometimes gentle and happy-go-lucky, sometimes sinister and tense.  The music is very good, too. Sometimes grim and creepy, sometimes bouncy and joyful, sometimes soft, gentle and soothing. It does a good job at setting the atmosphere - especially in its use of silence! That's right, this game also knows just how to use silence to make an impact!  I like how funny the game is. I don't want to give away anything that happens, but there are a lot of funny parts.  Some people might think that this game is too short, but I don't think so. The game's story has a nice length, where it doesn't outstay its welcome, and doesn't feel like it's padded or like it drags. Plus, like I said, there are several different ways in which the story can progress and end depending on what choices the player makes, so it's good that you don't have to play through a really long game to see these different endings.  The only real crticisms I have to make of this game are quite small ones. Firstly, I think that the backgrounds sometimes look a bit bland and uninteresting, with flat colours or undetailed pathways. That might be deliberate - maybe that style was done deliberately as a homage to old RPGs? I don't know, since I haven't played many old RPGs like the Earthbound series, Final Fantasy Series or Chrono Trigger or things like that. Anyway, other times the backgrounds look okay.  Also, I don't think the game has quite enough imagination or vision. Don't get me wrong, this is quite an imaginative game, and there are lots of interesting, creative moments in it, but... well, the game's world just seems to be a bit too similar to our own, with not quite enough fantastical flair. Hopefully I don't give too much away here, but, Undertale takes place in a world different from the human world, full of monsters. However, the world just seems a little too human. There are human-like houses, human-like jobs, human-like ways of communicating... I dunno, it just felt like it could've been a bit weirder and more creative - more DIFFERENT than what we're used to. But then again, maybe that's just me - I like weird, creative stuff. And, like I said, this game is still creative and fun.  All in all, this is a very nice, well-made, fun, and even uplifting game. Thank you to everyone who made it, and well done!   EDIT, WRITTEN ON 4th JANUARY 2016:  I've recently finished this game without killing anybody, and I had a wonderful experience! So much more of the game opens up for you! You can explore whole other areas, you uncover more of the story, you learn more about the characters! It was very satisfying, and I loved the different ending. I actually had tears streaming down my face at the end of the final 'boss fight'. I admit that that was mainly because of the beautiful, moving music, but the themes and the events in the story were very beautiful and touching too. I love stories that talk about peace, kindness and friendship, and how important all those things are, and Undertale does that well! This game not only deals with those themes with its story and its characters, but it actually makes kindness and friendship important parts of its actual GAMEPLAY, and I love that.  Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who helped make this game! You did a good job!",

That's right, there are two more endings after that, and the best wasy to play this game is neutral, pacafist, genoside, pacafist, that way you can see everything! I'll admit... I looked up how to get the ending on the wiki, and I am still impressed with them, even if I haven't gotten them. I urge any of you who are interested in this game to get it... But be warned...

You see the enemy's attack in the little box your soul is in and you experiment with different actions to find out their psychological weaknesses. I feel as though these things are very unique and deserve some attention, especially the game's inventive fighting mechanic.",

You have seen everyone rave about it and sing it's praises. No one will shut up about this game! And that is for good reason. Undertale isn't just a game to me. It is an experience. It has an absolutely fantastic (and hilarious) memorable cast of characters who, when they aren't giving me stitches in laughter, are making me cry sweet, pure puppy dog tears. The story is absolutely incredible, in which you play as a fallen human who fell into a monster world, after a war between the 2 species which lead to the monsters being banished underground, and saying anything else will spoil your experience. I'll just say that this game plays like a choose your own adventure book, making the path you choose really stick with you no matter what. I have pure faith every ending will leave you happy. And there isn't just the main 3 endings either (Neutral ending, where you choose who lives and dies, Genocide, where you kill everything you see and kill every enemy in each area until none remain, and Pacifist, the complete opposite)! Any person you kill and let live WILL affect the story. Every. Single. One. And if you are like me, you always felt SOME remorse for killing SOMEONE, due to how well developed every character is. There is no hero or villan in Undertale. Everyone has their good side, and their bad side. Even the FINAL BOSS of the neutral run can have his goodness inside of him! The only true heroes or villans are the players, and the game definetly lets you know this. And the only way to truly experience this game is to do the main 3 endings, to BECOME THE HERO, BECOME THE VILLIAN, AND BECOME THE VICTOR! You do this with the most unique combat system I have EVER seen in years. You have 2 options, 1. Use the FIGHT option, and with some well timed button presses, kill the enemy, or 2. Look at the ACT menu, experiment with your options, and eventually give MERCY to the enemy. No matter what you do though, in between turns the enemy will give attacks through a small box in which you control a Soul (a small heart), dodging emeny fire (anything white will harm you). You heard that right: BULLET HELL IN A ROLE PLAYING GAME. And that is just scratching the surface of this game! Enemies can turn your soul different colors, which changes how the entire game is played, the music is absolute ear bliss, and most of all, *SPOILER*   IT HAS THE SEXIEST KILLER ROBOT GAME SHOW HOST I HAVE EVER SEEN! I'M BLUSHING JUST LOOKING AT HIM, AND HE CAN'T EVEN SEE ME!  Undertale is absolutely, positively the greatest game I have played this year. No questions asked.",

Attacks can be physical or communicative. It all blends together to tell a great story, and the more you do, the more you find out.

People are overhyping it to fantastical points and it really ruins the experience for others.   However, that's the biggest complaint, honestly. All my bad experiences with the game have just come from my expectations being really high for this game thanks to the interwebs. For 10 dollars (possibly cheaper when it goes on sale), this game is definitely an experience that's worth it.   The combat is a fun bullet-hell turn based system that is accompanied by a well done soundtrack that I still listen to often. I don't really like turn based systems because it always felt kind of slow but with the dodging of enemy attacks and the possibility to always spare enemies, the combat was still fun and refreshing compared to other turn based games I had played before. Especially if you play the Pacifist route, where you have to keep dodging and try to do the correct actions in the right order to get the enemy to like you.   Soundtrack, as I stated before, is really good. Each important moment has it's own song to go along with it and now when I listen to the songs on Youtube or on my phone, it just brings me back to the moments where the song starts playing.   Now for the big part, the story. I'm trying to keep this spoiler free so all I will really say is that.... It's pretty good.  The humor and likability of the characters are honestly the best part of my experience with Undertale. The closest example I can think of to describe the humor is the Internet.  Like, seriously. If you are a dank Internet kid, I think you would enjoy the humor and presentation of this game a lot. It's quirky and very enjoyable for those who browse reddit, tumblr, etc.  I did expect something alot more emotional because of all the hype I was reading (This goes into my point at the beginning). Towards the end of my True Pacifist run, it really felt started to feel like something out of a Shounen manga like Naruto or One Piece. It just felt REALLY cheesy rather than the 'emotional moments that made me cry' (-Some person in this review section) that people have been praising like crazy. There have been no points where I felt the need to cry where as other people have apparantly broken down in tears even when I watched the Genocide Run.   Maybe I'm a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a flower.  Nonetheless, still a very enjoyable experience with nice twists and turns. I would definitely recommend this game to others as it has a lot of inside jokes that can be made between you and your friends (Your real life friends). In addition, if you do end up liking it, there's always a humongous fanbase and fandom with extras just waiting for you at the end. Someone even made a mod that adds a new boss battle called 'Undertale Red' (and the mod runs at 60 fps, god bless).  Overall, Temmie / 10",

You can get 2 of the 3 endings in about 9 hours even when messing around and trying to be a completionist. The third requires a complete replay so add about 8 more hours. This means at best you will get a total of 17 hours out of this. Possible is also that you will require yet another playthrough due to your actions to get all 3 endings which will leave you at about 24 hours total.  The music is really freaking awesome, there is a lot of different soundtracks. Enough to buy the soundtrack DLC? I dunno I usually download music from Youtube and will do so here as well.  The gameplay consists out of you either attacking by hitting the attack button in the right moment or trying to take an enemies will to fight via different dialogue options and then just letting them live. The dialogue usually isnt all that fleshed out with about 4 options on average that consist out of stuff like (cry) (tell a joke) or something like that, no actual dialogue. Usually choosing a single option is enough sometimes you have to go deeper and do the right thing in the right moment, but generally it isnt all that hard. And attacking is literally just pushing a button at the right moment. The interesting part comes in between, when the enemy attacks and you have to dodge. Every enemy has their own attacks which even changes when multiple enemies appear at once. This together with the design of your foes means that despite the game having random encounters they dont feel like a burden, like they do in so many other games. Often you will face enemies you have never seen before with new attacks and dialogue solutions. The random encounters can be a but annoying however if it is enemies of which you know you will get hit by at least once and it just puts your health at an awkward position without actually endangering you. Random encounters are usually very rare however, so they shouldnt bother anyone.  The story is pretty awesome, particularly if you realise how much you havent seen when going for the other endings. The people you meet are all unique and memorable. SInce this is spoilerfree I cant really say a whole lot other than 'worth it'.  The game also involves solving puzzles, none of which I found very puzzling and I suck at solbing puzzles. They were fun to solve though and enriched the gameplay in a positive manner.  All in all it is worth it at full price, the trailer should give you a good final idea wether you want this or not.  Or perhaps I should review this in the manner of a typical steam review?

            "review_text": "In my eyes, Undertale is a masterpiece. In anothers, its a boring, terrible game. Undertale is definitely not the game for everyone, but it's not just a series of inside jokes for all RPG players. If you...  a) Have a sense of humor b) Can resist watching spoiler-heavy posts and videos c) Can bear with it until its not-so-good beggining is over  You should really get this game. I'll tell you why.   Sound  Undertale has my favourite video game music of all time contained within it. During boss 'fights' (or dating a skeleton) the music fits the theme perfectly, and the pace slows down or speeds up to match the mood, and helps to craft a game where a character's death actually  means  somthing, not just a 'You have gained 420 EXP and 100 Gold!!!' moment. Seriously, look up some of the tunes from the boss fights in the game- instead of listening to 'actual' music, I'm listening to Undertale music 24/7.  10/10   Gameplay  I want to say that the game is never boring, but that's not true. It does have its filler, containing much less substance than other parts of the game, but it still meets, if not passes the greatness of many other games. The only issue is, Undertale sets such a high bar that when it subjects you to its filler, you can't eait to get to the more interesting segments. The parts that are good are flawless on the other hand, are, well, flawless, and both hilarious and emotional when you get to them. Another great thing about Undertale is its replay value, which is immence. You can play Undertale in so many ways- you can be a pscycopath that kills everything or you can NOT be a pscycopath that kills everything, and instead of fighting, flirts with talking planes and date more skeletons.  9/10   Characters  You have probably played an RPG before, and unless it was a joke one like Day of The Tentacle, you have probably run into hundreds of faceless enemies- Kill, Loot, Repeat. In Undertale, it's Flirt, Defend, Spare, Date, Compliment, Eat Spagetti, Win Date, ...Repeat? This is pretty much one of the boss battles in a nutshell, and this character is so memorable, just like all the other amazing characters are. You've got everything you could possibly imagine in this game, like a Pscyco Killer Scary Flower That Is Actually A Moster Prince. If you have something more original than that, I'll call you a liar.  10/10    Verdict  This is an amazing game, and most of it doesn't come from the actual gameplay, but the story. It makes itself both hilarious and emotional at the same time, makes you care about the characters, and the music is amazing. Unless you have been in a traumatic accident with a JRPG in your past, play thid game, and even if you have had issues with JRPGs, play it anyways.  10 Skeleton Dates/10 Skeleton Dates Best game 4020",

And while Xenoblade is giving Undertale a run for its money, right now Undertale is my favorite game of 2015. 10/10 for sure, and here is why:  Story -- 10/10 Undertale's story is charming on its own. I don't want to spoil too much, but I will just say that the reason why Undertale's story stands out so much is because the player's actions dictate how the game rolls out, creating a game where different things can happen each playthrough and making the story even more interesting then it already was! Plus it means your actions really do matter! And the characters are so funny and awesome!  Music -- 10/10 This game has so many songs that I really do love! The battle themes are particular my favorite, especially the themes for a certain character met in the third area of the game.  Gameplay -- 9/10 Undertale has a unique battle system where you don't have to kill anyone or you could murder everyone. This affects how the story plays out. Dodging attacks in Undertale is also very literal where you have to move a red heart (Your player's soul) around to doge attacks coming out you. I only wish dodging attacks was a little easier and the game made it a little more obvious about how to spare (not kill) certain monsters. Also if you think the game is too short; Steam glitched out for me and I have actually played probably 15 hours or so. It is short but not too short. :)  Replay Value -- 10/10 This game has so much replay value because of all the easter eggs and choices the player has to make. Plus, the game recognizes that you are replaying the game and characters may recognize you...  Overall: 9.75/10, but I will round to 10/10 If you have any interest for this RPG I can't recommend it enough! I hope I have given you DETERMINATION to buy Undertale!",

Obviously the graphics are not anything like The Last of Us or Until Dawn, but I believe that is what allowed for the game to be so excellent. Not bashing those two games in any way, I should mention, as I'm also a fan of AAA games. Many games become caught up in the sea of how realistic it can appear to the eye, but they tend to lose their meaning within that sea. Undertale has the ability to make you happy, sad, angry, meloncholy, and everything inbetween. You become attached to every single character in the game, no matter how small. So many games can hardly even make the main characters interesting with so much backstory and exposition, while, in Undertale, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER is different. Even Frisk, who never even says a word, is given a personality based on your own desicions. At surface level, I did not think I would be remotely interested in this game, but I fell head over heels into it. With tonnes of laugh-out-loud moments and scenes filled with emotion, this game is so worth the money paid. Toby Fox did an amazing job with the story, mechanics, music, art, etc. Speaking of the music, BUY THE SOUNDTRACK AS WELL! It's so well made and helps move the plot and causes emotion so much more so than many other games. And as for the mechanics, the game is difficult at times, but does not drag on. For some fights, this is very obvious to whom have played the game in the genocide route, they are formulated so perfectly in order to make you feel so much more empathy-less when they are over. I honestly cannot praise this game anymore so than I have... amazing. Great job, Toby Fox.",

Positives:  -Story, while not complicated, is engaging -The NPCs are alive with personality -The game 'breaks the rules' of typical rpgs in ways that I will not spoil but find absolutely delightful.  Negatves:  -The puzzles really aren't all that impressive (A small complaint) -Defeating some bosses takes some lateral thinking that requires one to bend one's mind into unusual shapes. -Sometimes, the jokes can get a bit stretched.

            "review_text": "I can't sum up everything I think about Undertale in a review. So I'll just put in what really matters...  In a way, Undertale reminds me of Half-Life 2. No, wait, where are you going? Hear me out, okay?  When I played each, I had not seen much gameplay and did not know too much about the story. I tried to avoid walkthroughs for both. And I found that I enjoyed both an incredible amount without knowing why. Maybe it's the feel of freedom. Or maybe it's the interesting story and characters. (Okay, HL2 had less of those last two.) Whatever it is, I loved them both.  Anyway. Undertale as an RPG is pretty underwhelming. There are less than ten pieces of armor and weapons respectively (I think), only a total of 95 enemies, excluding special and boss monsters, (I also think) and minimalistic pixel graphics (Which I know for sure) (and which actually help to add character to the game). But that's the thing... Undertale is more than an RPG. A couple of things make it prety unique as a game. Firstly, it's the only RPG I know of where you dodge enemy attacks in a bullet-hell environment. Secondly, it gives you the option to spare every enemy you fight.  I'm not going to spoil the story, only say that it and the characters are really great and could probably rival Telltale Games. A bold statement, but then again that's how I like my fonts. (Reference, I guess...?)  Case in point: Buy Undertale instead of watching someone play it if you can, because having the choice to spare something and making that choice is something else. If you can't then watch someone play it. It's not the same, but you still see what the game has to offer.  If you ignore this game without even looking at it... . . . Y o u ' r e g o n n a h a v e a b a d t i m e .  A game where you don't have to kill anyone, and feel guilty when you do. And still has good jokes. And, if you play the game and see, still has a better love story than Twilight. (Reference.) 10/10 for the butterscotch-cinnamon pie. Thanks, Toriel.",

            "review_text": "All the feels.  No description does this game justice. I've already spent 30 minutes on this review only to erase everything and start over several times now.  But hey, think of it like this: Take a dash of the Yume Nikki/Earthbound gameplay, with a bit of Cave Story artstyle, add a bit of classic JRPG battles (but ones where you can be friends with everyone instead of killing them, if you so choose). Then imagine the story unfolding in different ways depending on if you're good or bad, with critical plot points to be found in the details of the game that make you realize how wonderfully crafted it all is. The game is littered with all these small hints that are left to the fans to speculate about their meaning, kind of how some parts of the Dark Souls series is intentionally left open to interpretation. These details will change as you do new playthroughs of the game, giving you extra information regarding all the background story to the game.  Undertale has made me feel kind of how it would be if you were in a Hayao Miyazaki movie like Spirited Away, but where the story can take a very, very dark turn if you are so inclined. Like other reviewers have already said, this is more of 'an experience' than a game. It certainly has an active gameplay component, but it's basically a Yume Nikki style visual novel with moral choices for each battle. The battles themselves are usually kind of lackluster if you're used to more intense gameplay, but you don't really have to any grinding if you're going through a pacifist run. In genocide however it's a different story so if you chose to kill everyone: it will take a bit of extra time and it can get tedious.  Overall I would recommend everyone to at least give the demo for this a try. This is a game that has storytelling at it's core. Just make sure to ignore the community. I haven't really had a problem with the community myself, but I guess when people are deeply affectionate towards something that really stirred their emotions, they can have a harder time recognizing other people might not feel the same way.  Summary: I really liked this title and will remember it forever. If you do decide to get this, play it however you want but I recommend it this way: spare everyone in the game, explore the world and talk to the characters, become friends with the main characters and let the story unfold to the natural end. Then if you want more, there is more. This is the point where you might want to look up a wiki or talk to a friend who has played the game.",

I've only played through the True Pacifist route - I didn't kill anyone, didn't fight anyone besides the two final bosses of the Neutral route and don't have any wish to reset; and even if I did, I wouldn't have the heart to. In the end, even the characters I initially considered slightly annoying grew on me.   Well, a character. I, at first, didn't like Undyne very much, but she's actually great.

The soundtrack is great, the combat is unique and challenging ((at times)), the boss fights all have unique properties, and the game certainly has an interesting sense of humor, certainly bringing a skeleTON of laughs. But above all that, it was the emotional attachement to the characters as you play the game as a pacifist. At first, this game had just been a suggestion from a friend, and I knew very little about the game. The trailer does NOT do this game's slay/spare system justice. It doesn't tell about how the bosses and overall story will change. !!(Spoilers for a quick sec)!! At first, I was convinced I couldn't save Toriel, and I was forced to kill her. As I saw her tumble into dust and saw her heart break, I felt as if something had socked me in the chest. Then, I discovered you COULD save her, and I reset the game and did so; however, this game does not let you forget your sins. Flowey reminded me that I HAD murdered her, but this incedent made me realize how strongly the game made feel for a character, despite having them on screen for less than half an hour. And I knew from that moment on, a genocide run would be impossible.  Bottom line: GET THIS GAME.",

I can safely say, that buying this game is the best $10 I've ever spent on anything in my entire life. Somehow this game that I had no intention of really acknowledging has now become my personal favourite game of all time. The writing and dialogue, as well as the cast of characters which was what originally interested me are perfectly written with clever uses of comedy as well as subtle commentaries of how people and society behave and act, being elegentally woven into the games atmosphere rather than shoved down the players throat. As well as the comedy being extremely well done, the game knows when it wants to be very serious and focus on the central idea of the game, being the justifications of your actions, and believe me when your enemies have this much character to them, you better have good reason for doing what you 'must' do. The story and writing is extremely strong however accompanied by the soundtrack just makes the experience and immersion infinetly better. Each piece is greatly unique and great to listen to, hell as I'm writing this review I am listening to the soundtrack right now. What surprised me the most however was the fighting mechanic and the gameplay towards that. The options to attack or passively spare your enemies is a lovely touch and adds a layer of complexity to the fighting. The challenge of dodging the enemies attacks is deeply satisfying as well as not being too challenging to make the player angry, well at least in my playthroughs i didnt get mad Overall this is a masterfully crafted piece of art, there arent many games where I would play twice in a row and enjoy the experience more the second time.

And most importantly, the back story, all the hints given in the game. The secret room behind Sans' and Papyrus' house, the W.D. Gaster doorway, the secret 17th Lab Record from the True Lab... It's the best game I ever played. I totally recommend it!! ^-^",

This game will change the way you play RPGs and may even change the way you go about your daily life. I know it did for me.  A  few  lot of reasons to play Undertale: - You will fall in love with at least one character in this game, I gurantee it. And if you don't, you're playing the game wrong. - The soundtrack is amazing, and each character has their own track which fits their personality perfectly - If you play the game a certain way you will end up hating yourself possibly more than you hate the final boss. - There are skeleton puns galore - I've never played a game that used the word 'tsundere' even once, let alone twice. - Beating some bosses is a legitimate challenge and learning how to beat them is satisfying - Each boss has a unique style of combat despite the game's limited combat mechanics, which is honestly really impressive - Speaking of combat mechanics, this game is super simple to learn, but difficult to master - So many little secrets, like you have no idea. I had to look things up on the wiki to make sure I wasn't missing anything. - There are at least 4 dogs. And if you don't like dogs, well, it's possible to kill them I guess but that's a bit cruel.

If you haven't played it yet, you probably should.  I do not mean to sing it's praises. It's not a perfect game by a long shot. In fact, I have some big issues with it, most notably with the way that the plot is structured. After my first playthrough, I was left dissappointed and unsatisfied.  But then I played it a little more. And then more after that. And by now, I've played it a lot. Even though I didn't enjoy it at first, I kept going. Hell, I'm probably going to keep playing even after I beat my current playthrough. Why?  Because Undertale may be one of the smartest games I have ever played. It is consistently surprising, even after 20 hours of gameplay. There is an absolutely absurd attention to detail, and I am not being hyperbolic. It is so, so clever. And more importantly, It is really, REALLY good at making you think about your choices. Undertale will hit you where it hurts; it will force you to act and then force you to confront the consequences of said actions. It is a tour de force of emotions. It may not be pretty, but from a design it is absolutely beautiful.  I love Undertale. I really, really do. It took me a while to realize it, but I love this game. Because for everythat it does, for all of it's failures and triumphs, it always succeeds in provoking thought. Even when it fumbles, you can pull something meaningful from it. Undertale will teach you about yourself just as much as it will teach you about the medium it exists in.  Also the soundtrack is pretty ok.",

This isnt just a traditional RPG with more interactive battle settings and well shown character personalities. The puzzles aren't frustrating to complete and you do get to influance certain outcomes in the game based on your decitions and level of exploration. I would for sure say try this game out.

All character fights are unique and every character feels different in this rich world, and the timeline antics make for good banter and you can see hints to the plot before you uncover it-- this is a REALLY developed world.

This game made me survive a really hard time and helped me literally to start laughing again and love something and really get emotional. Thank you for this. This is more, than a game, this is really a piece of Art. Go and play it, really.  What I want to mention especially is, that all the characters are nice, what gives the game this wonderful atmosphere.

Two of the things that I found most impressive was the nailing of the 'choose your own path' theme, and the fourth wall breaking. This game makes you feel bad about killing. And it's an RPG. The reason why is that you don't need to. You don't need to kill anyone at all actually, if you want to go through the Pasifist Route. Or you can go around slaghtering everything in your path, regretting more and more until eventually you come to peace with being a monster. And on top of all that... It's part dating simulator!

There is no wrong way to play, Undertale - but you will experience it best if you play through more than once, and if you try different things each time.  Definitely not a game that should be judged by its cover. 10/10 worth getting.",

The default keybind to move is with the arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard. Being a laptop user, my arrow keys are EXTREMELY small, and being able to rebind the keys to WASD would save so much difficulty. Honestly if I knew that the keys weren't able to be rebound, I probably would have waited to buy the game until the developers updated the game to include keybind changes.",

The story is genuine and heartfelt, the soundtrack fits the game perfectly, and the 'bullet-hell' defence minigame spices up the battle mechanics, even if you choose to do a peaceful run of the game.  In most games with branching storylines, only your dialogue choices and actions against a few key NPCs will determing whether you get the 'good' or 'bad' ending. Not so in Undertale. The smallest and most insignificant enemies are people too, and if you kill them, the game will treat you like the murderer you are. If you battle an enemy and win, they are dead, and dead forever. There is no protection of the 'important' characters.  So what will you choose? Do you go with your RPG instincts and kill the enemies to improve your stats? Or you do what the game tells you to do, and be nice? There is no hiding behind 'the game mechanics made me do it' - your actions are your own.  My only problem is that it's a little short, particularly by RPG standards, and while the character design is unique and interesting, the enviroments have rather bland texturing. Buy it, play it.

Before playing it for myself, I had heard plenty of people, friends, celebrities, reviewers, websites, etc. all saying how great of a game this was.  None of their commentary prepared me for the game that Undertale actually is. It is wonderful. It is charming. It is heartbreaking. It is heart warming. Undertale encompases EVERYTHING I love about narrative games. Literally everything: convincing and charming characters, compelling story, choices, forks in the road, consequences... EASTER EGGS GALORE. Tongue in cheek humor, blatant humor, dry humor... Emotions.  I can't recommend this game enough. I simply can't. It was so good, and I'm STILL feeling the effects of it, even now. I literally just finished it, and knew that I had to write a review. This is a game everyone needs to play. It doesn't matter if you're a traditional gamer, casual gamer, CoD type gamer... Everyone should play Undertale.  AND DON'T YOU DARE ONLY PLAY IT ONCE AND QUIT AFTER THAT! There are reasons you should play it multiple times, but I cannot and will not explain why, only that you should. I'm sure you'll figure it out on your own. :)  IN the end: Undertale is now my absolute favorite game, and I am honestly looking forward to seeing what the Undertale Team has in store for us next.",

I spoiled the game for myself and still found plenty of enjoyment. It's just the story elements are best experienced playing 'blind' so to speak. If you haven't spoiled the game for yourself yet, you're going to get the best experience with the game.  Personally I recommend you use a controller with a decent d-pad for this game. All you need is a d-pad and 3 buttons. The keyboard is required on very rare occasions so don't worry about that. You can play with a keyboard, but I personally find it substantially more difficult than using a controller. Your mileage may vary.  Go ahead and pick up the title. Go in blind if you can, and don't look back. It's an experience. :)",

You have to time your attacks, but you also have to dodge enemies' attacks. By the way, the enemies are pretty bullet-hellish. That's what makes it -really- fun.  - The story, plot, and characters. If you're playing Undertale and you already know what's going to happen, it wouldn't be a good experience anymore. The story, plot, and characters are pretty much what's going to keep you going if the combat and graphics don't cut it for you. It's an emotional, crazy, fun ride.  - Dialogue. Just get past the 'tutorial section' and you'll know what I mean.  Neutral Points, Also may be Cons: - Graphics. I'm a big fan of pixel art and stuff, but I'm pretty sure not everyone is. Plus, combat is in black &amp; white, which also might not appeal to everyone.  - Game length. I went through it pretty fast, but that's mainly because I was binging it and didn't really stop to look around and explore. I'd say a regular playthrough would last around 2.5 - 3.5 hours. Though, I'd say the game length doesn't matter; the content does.  Stuff and Verdict: I'm trying my best not to spoil anything because Undertale is meant to be played through blind. Seriously. Knowing what to do and knowing what happens because of what you did will take away a LOT of the enjoyment from the game. If you do plan on buying the game, avoid spoilers. Don't go on any subreddit or watch an LP of a YouTuber. Pick up the demo, see if you like it, then pick the game up. Once again, Undertale is an experience that'll stick with you for the rest of your gaming life if you do decide to grab it.  Score: 9/10. It ain't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. I'm only removing 1 point since I did find the game to be a tad shorter than expected. Still good, though~!",

You are not required to kill anyone, however, you are given the option to do so. Before playing Undertale, I never played retro styled games.

            "review_text": "(SPOILER FREE)    I went into this game almost blind. I only knew it was an RPG, and that people loved it. At first I found it hard to get past the odd graphics, but once I did, I was hooked. I completed my first run of the game in 6 hours over the course of two days, and I'm already an hour into my second run. There's so many layers of humor, tragedy, and excitement that its almost impossible to put down once you're into it. Not to mention that you can get a different ending almost every time depending on the choices you make.   The characters you encounter are surprisingly 3 dementional for a 2-D game. In that they too have layers, motives, and much more then meets the eye. They are also very detailed and intriguing in design, and that doesn't just apply to the main plot characters. But also to the common monster's you encounter on random, with each one having their own personality and unique traits.  There is however, one character that no matter how you play through is always evil. But he/she even has a few intriguing traits. (Assuming you play through a few times) Despite their only motive being pure insanity and destruction. Not to mention a few 4th wall breaks.  For the encounters and game-play, its pretty basic. You can either fight, act, use an item, or have mercy. Attacking brings you to a very brief time based mini-game that does more damage depending on how well you do. Acting allows you to reason with the monster, making them more comfortable around you. Allowing you to 'spare' them. And each monster has a specific quality that you can exploit to make them like you. Item's are primarily healing buffs. Mercy allows you to spare or flee the monster. Although you can only spare them if their name turns yellow. Which comes from them not wanting to fight anymore.  After your turn, its theirs. And each monster has a unique attack at your heart, that you need to carefully dodge. It starts off simple but progressively gets more creative and difficult.   The environment is also quite well detailed and creative. And the puzzles, while being a bit repetitive at times, never fail to amuse me. Not to mention the music is also great as well.   All in all, Undertale is a solid game, with no legitimate complaints from my point of view. Its a game that could easily go toe-to-toe with any AAA story-telling game. Toby Fox did an extraordinary job and I personally can't wait to see what he does next.  10/10",

Replay value goes through the roof because there are so many different ways to do things.

It's a goofy, silly, childish game, with dead serious hard hitting adult subjects. I played it 6 times, and have yet to do the genocide route for number 7. (was too busy trying get the real ending) It breaks the fourth wall in probably the most amazing way ever, and is smart, it knows when you're cheating or have erased your save file and calls you out on it subtly. The gameplay is nothing special, neither are the puzzles, but the writing is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing the complexity and the way they went so out of the box.  8/10 storline (A lot of it was too happy-go-childish for me) 10/10 replay value 7/10 gameplay 4/10 graphics 9/10 immersiveness (impressive for a 2d pixel game) 11/10 value for the money you pay to buy it (seriously, how is a game THIS good so cheap?)

            "review_text": "Wow...  What can I say about Undertale that hasn't been said before? It was one of the most moving experiences I had in a video game this past year.  If you spent any amount of time looking at this game, you probably already know that the main selling point is that no one has to die; every monster you encounter, every boss you fight, you can talk to them and convince them not to fight you. You probably also know that the game has several different endings, most importantly a Neutral, Pacifist and Genocide ending.  For your own sake, do not look up anything else about the game.  Undertale is a game best experienced completely blind. And while many fans of the game will tell you to immediately aim for the Pacifist ending, to restart the game if you ever kill anything, I have to tell you: do not listen to them! Undertale is not something you need to play 'correctly', it is something you need to experience for yourself.   When I personally played it, I wanted to do a Pacifist ending first, but I made a mistake along the way. After thinking about it for a while, I thought that I simply needed to live with the consequences of what I did, and it made my experience so much better. I had several moments in the game where I looked back at that mistake and felt sorry about the way things turned out. It might sound strange, but it was a far more compelling experience than just thinking 'good thing I reloaded and fixed it'. Eventually, I finished the game with the Neutral ending, and while it felt like a complete game, I wasn't satisfied. I went back to complete a Pacifist ending, I discovered parts of the game I never even knew existed, and finally, I felt good about myself for finishing this game.  The story, the characters, everything about this game feels so amazing. I honestly haven't felt such a connection to the characters I talked with in a long time. To give you a bit of perspective, Undertale is the only game I ever played in which I simply couldn't bring myself to replay it just to experience the 'evil' ending. In fact, I still haven't seen anything about the Genocide route. I probably will do it someday, but right now, I just can't do it.",

This game is probably one of the greatest games I have ever played with one of the best stories there ever was that could rival any story a AAA game developer could come out with. This game right here is the definition that you don't need hyper photorealistic graphics to make a good game. All you need is very solid gameplay with a very well thought off, and robust story and you're set to go.  This game is best experienced first hand and the hype around it is well worth it.

Let me go over the cons first, because there are way too many positives in this review section. - A bit easy, but it can be forgiven. - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ post-atari but pre-nes graphics (With the exception of a few scenes and the battles/shops) - Bad fandom (You've probably seen them.) - Plot Dumps. Lots of reading. - Battle system where only their turn matters (It's unique, but I'd sure like it more if it wasn't a case of 'press a button and then leave') - Game acknowledges it's a game, tries to go meta, and fails because it's a game (That's only a small one though) - SoQuirky tumblr humour. - Kinda cliche in a lot of places  Now let's go over some positives. - God tier soundtrack. - Incredible writing / Character development. - Heartwarming - Includes a 'strong and independant' woman, a homosexual relationship and ambiguous genders (For the SJW types. Don't worry, it doesn't preach it.) - Multiple routes, lots of secrets, easter eggs and extra content to last you a long while. - Extremely fun bullet hell RPG setup - I did kind of like the humour i guess  This game isn't for everyone. It's a niche RPG that tells a satisfying story and will stick with you. There's a demo you can play that will take you to the end of the first area, and if you don't like it by then, then don't buy the game. Just watch a lets play if you liked it but don't want to blow £7. It's a story game, you really won't miss out on anything but the fustration of getting slammed.",

It wants you to feel powerful -- to know that you can use that power and kind spirit to improve the lives of the monsters (people) around you.  Undertale has a lot of barriers to entry - if you don't enjoy the retro style, the graphics won't immerse you. If you don't enjoy chiptune music, the soundtrack won't inspire you.

Story about a human falling into underground may to be pointed as a 'bad copy of Alice in the Wonderland' because all you will see is a human child venturing through the monster underground world, full of dully looking, childish monsters.   From loving frogs, depressed wasps, cowardice cyclops, healthcare vegetables, bad-joking birds, poshy hat lovers, playful small and big dogs, self-confident weightlifters, dirt-hating cleaners, shy opera singers, mad cute dogs (tEM lOVES dOGS), both true and fake slimey cakes, loving walking volcanoes, flirty thunderplanes, heaty ropes... and many more, like pun-loving skeletons, goat people...

The characters are wonderful to interact with, so great in fact that you wish they were real. The moral choice system is spot on, the world reacting in a way that makes sense to your actions with no bar to represent good and evil. All actions and paths the player takes have very obvious consequences, and it never feels like your choices don't actually matter, unless the game forces that kind of result in a way to convey certain tones. The only bad part I can think of is a boss battle against a character near the end, where it really seems sloppily done and doesn't fit in with the environment of the area nor the tone of the game as a whole. The combat is marvelous overall though, normal JRPG mechanics with an interesting Bullet Hell system to let you avoid any attacks, it sounds easy, but in reality, it can be quite a challenging game. Honestly, if you think you'll like this game, you probably will. If you like RPGs and games with a good sense of humor, then you should give this a try.",

            "review_text": "***Undertale SPOILER FREE Review***    Let's talk a little bit about Undertale. Now, in all honesty, I feel my review of this game is going to be quite a bit different than a lot of other people out there, because my experience with classic J-RPGs is pretty limited. I’ve never played any of the games in the Mother series, Final Fantasy series, or even any of the traditional Pokemon games. Now before you get out your hammers, nails, and crosses, hear me out. I’m in a rare situation where I can a write a review that isn’t so damn high on nostalgia that it goes to Taco Bell at 2 O’Clock in the morning to order everything on the menu, only to forget about 10 minutes later and fall asleep in the parking lot. That being said, I highly recommend watching or reading other reviews after this one if you want to see some comparisons to older games.   So, what exactly IS Undertale? Well, according to the Steam tags, Undertale is a Cute and Funny Retro Indie RPG, that can also be a Dark, Psychological Horror Comedy game, as your Choices Matter and can lead you to Multiple Endings. As a Single-Player game, it is very Story Rich, as it should be, including some elements from other types of games, such as the Bullet Hell from Binding Of Isaac and the Dating Simulation of Hatoful Boyfriend. All of this is packaged and presented in a beautiful 2D Pixel Graphics style, coupled with a Great Soundtrack, that allows for a ton of replay value. It also has memes.   To me, Undertale is a game that seems like it was designed to hit a specific demographic, and failed miserably. By that, I mean it attracted way more attention than it intended to. But you know what? I think that’s a good thing. Like I said earlier, this game is of a genre that I had THOUGHT I had little to no interest in, but since it’s so well made I feel like I’ve actually grown as a gamer after playing it.     Normally I’d start off by talking about the game’s visuals, but there isn’t really too much to say when it comes to pixel art. It tends to be either good, or bad. There isn’t really too much of an in-between, and Undertale’s pixel art is good. (Look, I’m not an artist, I can’t draw a stick figure without a ruler. I’m not the person to ask about the pixelated graphics style)   Now for the music, something I feel I can spend a little bit more time talking about. I myself am I pretty big fan of video game music. The music in this game is like, insanely great, to the point where I’m listening to the soundtrack as I write this review. There are some games that I’ve played where it feels like the music is a second thought, you know, something added after development just to make the game less dull. Undertale would walk over to those types of games and hit them with a comically-sized hammer, before making a pun that breaks the fourth-wall and makes you smile, even though you didn’t really want to, that’s just the type of game it is. The music sets the mood perfectly in almost every scenario, something many games fail to do. Sure, some games may get the intense boss-battle music or the friendly town music down pretty good, but most games don’t have a soundtrack that is fantastic regardless of where you are or what you are doing in the game world. After playing Undertale for a little over an hour, I had to stop and look up who the developer of the game hired to make the music, and to my surprise it WAS the developer. So, props to you, Toby Fox, for being another person I can add to the list of people I will never be as talented as.   So, what about the actual gameplay? Undertale plays like you would expect a turn-based RPG to play like, but with some pretty big differences. First off, rather than just selecting an attack, confirming it, then having your opponent select an attack and confirm it, Undertale’s combat has a surprising amount of depth. When you perform an attack, you need to time it properly and hit a “sweet spot” to achieve maximum damage. When your opponent performs an attack, you do not immediately receive damage, but are able to avoid their attack by moving around your “Soul” in a manner similar to most top down shooters. This essentially means that if you are good enough, you can complete the entire game without taking damage. However, that won’t be easy as the game continuously ramps up in difficulty, and throws in new mechanics to keep fights interesting as the story progresses.   All of this is great, but is there anything else to it? Yes, actually, quite a bit. The game advertises itself as “The RPG where you don’t have to destroy anyone.”, and one can accomplish this in a very unique way. If any of you have played Dishonored, you would know that in order to peacefully beat that game, you would have to subdue your targets through methods such as strangulation and shooting sleep darts. This differs greatly from Undertale, because in Undertale you don’t need to do anything to the enemies at all, except talk to them. Undertale has an ACT menu whilst in battles, and accessing it will give you specific interactions with each enemy type. By using these different interactions, you can persuade the enemies until they are no longer interested in fighting you. Now, if you’re as cynical as me you might be thinking, “So what, it’s just a gimmick, right?” Surprisingly, no. Undertale is a very adaptive game, and changes DRASTICALLY based upon the decisions you make. And I mean DRASTICALLY. To the point where, it’s worth playing through the entire game multiple times to see how your decisions of violence or nonviolence shape the world around you.   So, I think that about wraps things up for Undertale. There’s a lot more to talk about, but I’d rather just end things here to avoid any spoilers. Undertale an experience that I enjoyed greatly, and if anything in this review has peaked your interest, then I think you’ll enjoy it too.",

I love games like Earthbound. I love Mother 3 as well. I find those two games to be better than this one. This game has a strong beginning, but it gets worse as it goes on. After Waterfall (which is the best area in the game IMO) the games slowly gets worse. Once the character Alphys gets introduced the game feels like it has to talk to you nonstop to remind you 'IM FUNNY RIGHT?” It gets a little irritating. The game also gets more linear and boring. The combat in Undertale is... all right. The bullet hell inspired selections are really fun, but have huge difficulty spikes. But combat is repetitive and boring, and when you’re doing a genocide run it’s SO bad. The pixel art in Undertale is a little ugly at times too. The over world sprites are bad, showing little to no detail. The battle sprites all much better, but in a weird design choice aren't in color. It does give the game some style however. I know some people might not enjoy the lack of color, but I don’t mind it too much. It may seem like I hate this game, but I don’t. I might not feel like it's the greatest game of all time, but it’s still good, and DEFINIETLY WORTH PLAYING! It’s an experience. By the way I don’t find Ocarina of Time the best game either so I’m not just saying it isn’t the best game because of that.

Anyway, utilizing an interesting 'bullet hell' method of dodging enemy attacks as well as methods to 'spare' enemies, this game brings quite a few new ideas to the table while playing with some of the genre's typical conventions. All of that is helped along with one of the best soundtracks I've heard from an indie title.  I admit, I was put off by a lot of the hype wrapped around this game when its fandom took off but my friends kept telling me to give it a chance. In the end, I'm glad I did and I hope you'll give it a chance too. You just might find it as charming as I did.",

I had a good time with the demo, and an even better time with the game. The story is wonderful, characters are charming, and the music is incredible. It's a perfect tribute not just to the MOTHER series, but to RPGs as a whole.  That being said, I do have some minor gripes: The regular enimies never use the soul changing abilities the bosses do, and visually there could have been a lot more done. The biggest issue is the game's replayability. After playing through it twice, going through the Ruins and Snowdin felt like a drag (and don't get me started on the Alphys stuff; I get it's purposley kinda annoying but on playthrough 2 it's just regular annoying).   Regardless, you really should give UNDERTALE a shot. Yeah the fandom is sucky, but a crappy community shouldn't stop you from experiencing Undertale's brilliance.",

It lasts around 8-9 hours or so if you are just speeding through it with prior knowledge of how things will unfold like I did.

The Music is absolutely amazing and every Track fits the Situation it is put in perfectly. Every single Character is loveable and memorable, from Maincharacters to Side-NPCs. You can really see that the Developers, Artists, Composers just everyone put their Hearts and Souls into Undertale. (no pun intended.)

I feel the game tries to force the feelings down your throat, but not in a bad way, because it ends up working anyway.  The story, even with its choices, still feels quite linear because if you play normally you'll end up with the neutral route, in which at the end you are mentioned of the two other possible routes, kind of killing the feeling of choice you get during the first playthrough.  The soundtrack is amazing, and considering it was all made, along with most of the game, by a single person,   it fills you with DETERMINATION.

I've seen someone ask a question to a person who just beat the game: 'So, at what point during the final fight did you start crying?'. This is also the reason why I nominated it for the ' Villain Most In Need Of A Hug ' award. I literally cannot think of a game that would deserve that second award more than this game.  -----------------------------------------------------  First of all, DO NOT WATCH VIDEOS OF THE GAME. If you do, you're going to lose a huge part of the fun that the game offers.   So, let's see what I can tell you about the game without spoiling it for you:  - you play as a child that climbed up a mountain (from which, as legends say, nobody ever returns), fell down, and is now underground in a world full of monsters  - the monsters may or may not be the type of 'monsters' you'd expect  - the characters are amazing  - the game pokes fun at stereotypical RPG/gaming elements  - the game offers you different ways of going through the world and storyline, which causes BIG consequences  - the games is full of different types of jokes, including puns (consider this a 'PUN WARNING')  - it gets very emotional at times. Might feel kind of like a rollercoaster. Keep in mind, what happens in the end depends upon YOU.  - the game has a fandom that can be both awesome and terrible, depending on which sites you visit. If you're going to play, try not to visit fan-sites before finishing it as fanart contains spoilers. Lots of them.  - the soundtrack is amazing. If you want to hear some samples, I'd recommend you google videos of 'Undertale OST - Megalovania' ; 'Undertale OST - Spider Dance' or 'Undertale OST - Ghost Fight'. Those are my favorites. Just don't look into the comments or descriptions as, again, those contain spoilers.  - the type of humour that the game and it's creator have... If you want to see if you're going to enjoy the humour, just... look at the game's Steam Store page. Read the 'About This Game' and 'Reviews' section. It's one of the few games where it might actually be fun to check it out.  Overall, I think that the game is... well, kind of a masterpiece, really. Oh, and it has a demo which can be found on the game's website. Try it out if you don't believe me. (fun-fact: the demo's manual changes depending on what you do). I'd say it's pretty impressive that all of this was made by a single person.",

Even when you think they could not possibly be. 　• Excellent music with professional attention to leitmotifs. 　• Game is small and runs not only on Windows, but also on Linux. 　• Minimal hardware requirements. Runs perfectly even on the slowest of modern hardware. 　• Excellent community support. Stuck in game? Questions about plot? Desperate for more content? You can find anything in the Internet about this game. 　• More than meets the eye. Way, WAY more.   Cons : 　• Graphics are rather bad, except in a few select parts. 　• Understanding the game’s plot requires commitment. If you are not ready for that commitment, the game will leave you with a bitter taste. But if you are willing to push through that, the game will reward you immensely. 　• Fanatic fans. If you letsplay this game, make absolutely sure you will NOT read ANY feedback until you’re through. They WILL be full of spoilers and aggressive back-seat gaming that DO ruin your experience and leave you with a bitter taste. Do NOT listen to them. You get so much more out of the game by discovering it on your own.   I do mean that.

            "review_text": "The hype surrounding this game is astounding. If you're reading this and haven't played Undertale yet, that's likely to make you very apprehensive about purchasing it. Therefore, I'd ask you to try and not let the rabid fanbase turn you away from this game, and let pure curiosity and information drive your purchase.  In case you don't know, Undertale is an RPG. But it's a special RPG. In this game, you play as a human who has fallen into the Underground, a place full of monsters, trying to get home. The typical JRPG shticks of random encounters, turn-based combat systems, and more are all in place, but there are a few changes. For one, instead of automatically being hit by enemy attacks, or having a random chance to dodge them, you enter what's similar to a 'bullet hell,' avoiding the attacks as they come at you. Additionally, there's one other key difference: you may spare the monsters you're fighting. In fact, you don't have to kill a single monster in the whole game. Or you can kill all of them. It's up to you.  As you can probably tell from looking at it, this game is very retro-inspired, both in visuals and soundtrack (which I adore), and its similarity to Earthbound is uncanny. If you enjoyed that game, I'd recommend Undertale without a second thought. I wouldn't be surprised if you liked it  more.   But that's where the hype factor comes in.  Overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam and a giant fandom tend to worry some people. I can understand that, but...   Undertale is by far and away my favourite game of all time.   Well, I say game, and I really should say experience. As a game, the spare mechanic can be looked at as nothing more than a gimmick, and another way to do damage. I had a lot of fun playing Undertale, but not due to it being a 'fun' game, per say. Rather, I greatly enjoyed what it did.  Earlier, I compared this game to Earthbound. There's something to take note of. Even if you didn't like Earthbound as a game, did you like it as an  experience?  Or, perhaps more importantly, did you like the humour?  The two biggest areas I see this game falling flat as an experience are purely arbitrary: the morals and the humour. The first I can't say much more about due to spoilers, and the second is purely preference. If you play this game and find the morals are preachy, and can't handle that, or you think the humour is bad, it's likely you won't like Undertale. Unfortunately, there's not a great way to tell these things before playing (other than watching a Let's Play, which would ruin the experience, in my opinion).  However, if you  do  like these elements, I believe Undertale will be a gem. Maybe it won't be your favourite game of all time, but I think you'll enjoy it. I certainly got far more than $10 out of it.  At the very least, I'd recommend trying it. If you can, ignore the hype, ignore the fandom, don't watch Let's Plays, and avoid spoilers. Don't ruin the experience before you even get started. If you end up not liking it, that's fine. I completely understand...  But if you do, you'll be glad you spent that $10. Trust me,",

I'm honestly reminded of Cave Story. This game, is nowhere near as grand in scale, but it's charm far exceeds most games of this era. And like cave story, it's a one man project of the utmost care.  Definitely recommend this beauty of a game. It's 10 dollars on steam, drop the extra 9 and get the soundtrack though. It's 101 tracks of pure awesome (if you have it on random though, beware the track with the insane laughing flower, your nightmares will never end).

It made me turn my head and consider purchasing it, but I didn't want to allow any of it to affect my own experience of the game, to prevent from raising the expectation levels too high, so I blocked it all out. Eventually, I gathered the funds necessary and began my own run of this game, to experience it and construct my own opinion on it. I decided to do be a perfect Pacifist with my run, and not kill anything, and also achieve the best possible ending doing this, without help. With all the preemptive information out of the way, let's get down to business with this review.  Gameplay: 8.5 / 10 Undertale is a game sporting a hybrid of genres, that provides an interesting, unique and fun twist on an RPG experience. To begin with, the primary gameplay involves solving puzzles (which can range from incredibly easy to moderate, depending on who you ask) to progress, and bullet-hell style battles, which can range from fair to frustrating. Needless to say, if either of these are types of gameplay someone doesn't enjoy, this game is likely not for you, since they're the primary bulk of the actual gameplay. In these battles, one has various commands they can perform depending on the monster(s), which will ultimately affect the outcome of the game itself. Due to this, especially when trying to achieve the pacifist run, some battles will seem like they drag on too long, or provide too little feedback that progression is actually occurring, and can cause some extra frustration figuring out what to do next. There are some annoying parts about the gameplay, and some which may even turn off players. Specifically, without spoiling when, where and how, the game will force close itself multiple times, and the player has to re-open the game several times. Why? Why couldn't the game just pretend a reboot or something, all in the same session? But overall, the gameplay itself is very enjoyable, again, assuming the player likes puzzle-solving and bullet-hell gameplay.  Story: 8 / 10 The story at its surface is pretty simple, and to remain spoiler free I'll not mention too much of it here. The bulk of the points comes from the cast of characters the player can choose to befriend or oppose, as that seems to be the primary focus of the story here. The player can kill everything that moves if they desire, which will spawn some scenes the player will either feel guilty about, or just shrug off and keep moving. Killing absolutely nothing is also a possibility, and the route I personally chose, which will allow the player to meet a quirky cast of characters, that are each fleshed out and given screen time. The writing of the game is generally light-hearted, but it has its serious and even philosphical moments, which I feel works out great. However, I could also see some things about it overall that wouldn't appeal to everyone, or could be grating.  Music: 8.5/10 The music in the game is all well composed and atmospheric. It has that weirdness, initially, of blending chiptune instruments with real instruments. It's not bad, and I personally enjoyed it, but it could come across as unfocused to some people, or may even turn people off entirely if they don't like chiptune sounds. Ultimately, however, each track does its job of immersing the player into what's currently happening in the game, and setting the stage.  Graphics: 5/10 The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't anything special either, in my opinion. Looking at screenshots of this game, none of them sport anything that really pops out, and makes me want to jump into the world. There are some moments where it's decent, due to the lighting conditions making some areas look fantastic, but I still believe the same thing could've been accomplished with less bland graphics. Even the player's sprite doesn't sport much animation other than walking for the majority of the game, until certain scenes.  Overall: 8 / 10 Ultimately, Undertale is a solid and fun experience someone could enjoy under the aforementioned premises of liking puzzle solving and bullet-hell style gameplay. The parts all piece together to form a whole unique experience, and the player may be left with memorable scenes and characters. I could personally recommend it for any gamer that would like a challenge. It may not always be fair in battle, but it's most certainly fair when it comes to continuing and surviving, so if you fail, just dust it off and try again. And again, and again, until you finally succeed, triumphantly pressing forward with your determination!",

You'll come to love, hate, and pity the well-written cast in this story, and their fates depend on if you want to befriend or obliterate them.  On either the pacifist, genocide and even the neutral playthrough, the simplistic (for the majority of the game) graphics gives it a stylized charm and the music is down-to-earth great. The gameplay is very enticing for bullet hell players and will keep them on their toes.  Honestly, it's my favorite indie RPG for 2015, and its intense story telling is going to very difficult to top off. My only regret is that I didn't help fund the game back when it was still on Kickstarter. A game that has you question and test your morals to this extent should be played by all RPG fans.

The gameplay places a spin on traditional turn-based RPGs in that all enemies can be defeated without having to kill them. Defending from attacks is done in a manner to shmups where attacks a represented as dodgeable bullets. The patterns are incredibly varied and are contextually appropriate for every enemy and boss in the game. The story is hilarious and heartwarming, featuring Earthbound self-awareness while having more heart and humanity than most, if not all triple A titles in recent years. The game is short for an RPG of the style, as evident by the playtime, but every moment feels engaging, whether it be from dialogue from the colorful yet extremely fleshed out and fully realized characters, or the unique combat that plays well in traditional gameplay sense, while placing those mechanics in a context that fits into the world as well as challenging the status quo of traditional game design. If the overwhelmingly positive reception hasn't convinced you yet that the game is worth your time, then take my word for it. The game should not disappoint. At $10, I have no qualms recommending the game to everyone. Truly excellent.",

Story wise? to avoid spoilers, the story changes based on if you SPARE or FIGHT bosses and mooks, with multiple variations of each- making replay value surprisingly high. even if you probably won't want to go back after getting the definitively best ending.",

I have Skyrim which I touted as my favorite game of all time, and not a single peep about it in the reviews section.   But Undertale. This game. This perfect game. It will make you feel things about a game you didn't think possible. It will keep you up at night wondering if you are making the right decisions. It will do things you didn't think possible. And at the end it will leave you questioning. 'Should I really start again?'  I would give a summary of the game and things that it does oh so right, but that would spoil the experience.

Undertale is a Bullet Hell and RPG game with a similar tone to Earthbound and Mother 3. I highly reccomend it to those who enjoyed this title.   Although a short game around 6 hours, I could not stop thinking about this game even after completing it. Did I make the right choices on my journey? Did I explore the world thoroughly? Even in a such a small game, I just wanted to emmerse myself and explore fully.  I can easily say that Undertale is one of the best games I have played in my life.

Fantastic game, one of the best I've ever played, and almost impossible to put down. 10/10  Now for the more nitty-gritty stuff. There's a very basic plot of your character trying to get home. Along the way, you meet plenty of colorful characters that can be either befriended or destroyed. And yet, there's just something about it that makes this feel more important that rescuing the galaxy or preventing World War III. There are little details everywhere that work to make use of the graphics that wouldn't look out of place on an SNES. Hand-holding animations, snow being kicked around, and tiny facial changes depending on someone's mood.   PROS -Absolutely fantastic mechanics. Arrowkeys, an A and B button, a menu button, fullscreen toggle, and a quit button. Those are your inputs, and the game manages to do so much with it.  -Soundtrack is phenomenal. I have listened to some of the tracks for hours, voluntarily, and not gotten bored.  -Story, while simple, is able to be followed easily -Elegant simplicity. This is an engineering concept where the simplest solution is often the best. Here, it applies fully. Though there is some level of complexity, there is never a moment where you need to collect twelve rat tails or do something that is completely unrelated to the task at hand. -The best ending is completely worth the effort  Neutral -Short (10 hours or so, give or take). Might not be everyone's cup of spiders, but it's something about it.  CONS -When a boss fight is hard, it can be more than a little frustrating to figure out what to do -Can't play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on the piano -As with the fights, some puzzles can require a little sideways thinking to solve -Little replay value  Overall, it was highly entertaining while it lasted, though I find it unlikely I'll be returning. Still, it's the journey, not the destination.",

I've now completed a pacifist playthrough and my opinion has only strengthened.  Undertale is an incredible game, full of both a distinct sense of joy, but also of fear and unease. In it, you are a small child who has fallen into the underground, and you wish to return home. Along the way you encounter many a monster, and can choose to either fight and kill said monsters, or befriend them in charming and wonderful ways.   The game's combat is incredibly unique, a distinct mashup of bullet-hell and JRPG. You take turns against your opponent, and their attacks come in the form of them throwing all sorts of attacks at you. You have to move around to dodge the attacks, and the attacks are wildly varied based on who you are fighting.  On the other hand, in your turns you can choose to either FIGHT or ACT. Acting allows you to perform non-violent actions, and just about every enemy in the game can be fought with these actions. The most interesting part of this is that you never have to kill a single enemy, and if you do, there are often severe consequences- even with random encounters.  Of course, you COULD opt to kill EVERY enemy, but where's the fun in that?  Undertale is a piece of art, truly one of the greatest games of the millenium as of yet, and I'm DETERMINED to get people to play it.   10/10 GOTY",

Then welcome to UNDERTALE: Where nobody has to get hurt. This game is a weird, yet astounding genre of RPG, bullet-hell, and dating sim (trust me on this one.) It has appealing graphics for older gamers who may have enjoyed classics like Earthbound, yet up-to-date witty humor with a kick of old-fashioned (in a good way.)  Also, the soundtrack. This soundtrack is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I fully 100% recommend you support Toby Fox and purchase his soundtrack. It's got all sorts of genres of music, between silly and fun, or just flat out scary and nightmarish.  The gameplay is also very note-worthy. Being a somewhat unrepresented style of gaming is the option to spare your foes that you inevitablably encounter throughout the entirety of the game. The gameplay can be intense and demand much of the player's attention and skill. The combat system is very open, with most enemies have different ways of being defeated, and harder ones requiring more focus and attention.  Anf finally, this game has feels. Feels as FAR as the eyes can see. I'm not ashamed to admit certain moments of this game had me going from anger, to happiness, to tears in a matter of minutes in a single period. If you are in for the story, then congratulations, this game has an AMAZING story, with memorable characters, who have amazing and unique personalities.  To be fair, this game isn't as perfect as I paint it out to be, however. Some flaws include the gameplay in comparison to some other titles you may play being relatively short. I completed the game in roughly 7 hours in a complete, nonstop playthough, achieving one ending. Which brings me to another point. If you are of the type who will only play a game for one ending, and then stop, then UNDERTALE may not be appropriate for you, due to the player's choices VERY HEAVILY affecting gameplay and, ultimately, the game's outcome. However, this also means that if you truly love UNDERTALE, then the replay value is definitely a big plus for any of those wanting to explore the intricate and magical wonder that is UNDERTALE.  Conclusion: Is this game flawless? No. I don't think any game is, honestly. Is it amazing? YES. YES YES YES YESSSSSS. I recommend this game in it's entirety. An amazing soundtrack, fantastic world, memorable characters, and one big mixing pool of nostalgia, fun, and feels. GET THIS GAME!   ",

            "review_text": "I recently came across this right after completing a playthrough of LISA: The Painful RPG. LISA was appealing to me simply because of the fact that the game is not your typical 'Friendship will solve all problems'. It was cruel, brutal, and dark. I was enamored with LISA and I was surprised how well an Indie game was able to capture what I was looking for, while the AAA RPGs seem to be missing the mark.  Undertale showed up on my queue recently, and the concept of the game seems like exactly what I wouldn't be looking for. 'Killing is unnecessary'. Although this is true, the game offers very different playthroughs based on if you kill, or don't kill. The reviews led me to purchase this game anyways, and at $10 I wasn't too worried even if it didn't end up being what I wanted.  This game absolute crushed all bad perceptions I had, and was an amazing experience. One of the biggest gripes I usually have with these types of games is the ending. This ending was extremely in-depth, and I was completely satisfied with the result. The game continually climbs in entertainment, and at the end it has a proper climax that leaves you wishing it wasn't over.   Quick summary.  Graphics - 8/10 Graphics are absolutely fine, although at certain points they may look sort of unpolished. They do not detract from the game in anyway and they are fitting. At the same time I kinda wish there was more emphasis on the art.  Sound - 9/10 Music was solid, and very fitting to scenes that they are a part of. They meld well with the backgrounds, and fit the mood exceedingly well. I feel that there is room for improvement, but absolutely no gripes.  Gameplay - 10/10 Combat was very well done, and is an extremely unique approach. The combat system expands constantly the further you go into the game, and new concepts are introduced to keep it from being stale. The puzzles were decent, but not overbearingly hard, and travelling through areas was eventful and did not feel like filler from scene to scene.  Control - 9/10 Controls are simple, and it would be easy to play with a controller or keyboard. I played through on controller and felt I had very good control of what I was trying to do.  Story - 10/10 The story blew me away. My perception of happy / friendly types of stories has changed drastically. This is exactly the type of game that I do 'not' like, yet It was executed beautifully and I feel as if there are games that I now have to give a chance to.   TL:DR - If there is any interest whatsoever, purchase the game. The reviews do not lie, and you will be delightfully surprised at what you find.  Edit: After playing a Genocide run and noticing that there is even more music that wasn't available in the pacifist run, I have to say that the sound should be 10/10.",

This game is insane. Only downside is my skeleton boyfriend dumped me after one date and the spagetti is terrible.  Seriously though, this game does not let you forget any decision you ever make and it the most terrifying and enjoyable game ive had the option of only paying 10 bucks for. There's a vast and undescovered ammount of story, and to each playthough should you dare to play over or tweak with the games setting should more and more uncover story wheter for good or for bad because some secrets feel quite terrifying. Nearly all characters are easly to love and love easily. Every option with every NPC can affect options presented by others, characters and the game will remember things you said and remind you later ocasionally. The story is a difficult option to discuss as because of thise the direction and ending of it is extremely flexible. its why its often recomended if you havent had spoils to not look at them and make your own decisions first time around, but the game is enjoyable even if you had already known all of it.  The music itself is fantastic, though the style to it maybe be better known to homestuck (particuarly one song...) due to Toby's musical background. but is quite enjoyable overall, and even without playing the games i can find the music enjoyable to listen to.

The story is very good  -The overarching story is very engaging and revealed to you piecemeal, if you bother to examine your surroundings, or dumped on you towards the end. In both cases, its conveyed very well.   -Little things and trends that you may observe become far more impactful later in the game  2.) Characters are engaging  -The characters are decently deep. If you really read the script and appreciate their struggles, you should be invested in them.  3.) Music is good and has good timing  -The music was memorable and entertaining (especially the boss fights)  -The music matches the mood and pace of the actual fights very well. When plot-reveal music plays it is very well attuned to the surrounding areas  4.) Puzzels and boss fights, on the whole, are well designed and entertaining  -There are some puzzles that aren't particularly difficult, but they are easy to get through and relatively entertaining  -The real 'puzzels' of this game are the fights. It is effectively a bullet-hell combined with observing your opponent's dialogue to convince said opponent not to fight, Alternatively, you can just kill everything.  5.) Jokes were pretty good  -Plenty of running gags that don't get old.   -Plenty of references  -Can't think of a bad joke that wasn't intentionally bad  6.)The Novelty of the game  -This is an RPG where you do not have to kill everyone and there are only two big roles for you to play. Will you be a pacifist or a murderer? No wizards, priests, monks, or warriors here folks.  -Depending on the choices you make, the story and atmosphere change dramatically.  -If you intend to go fully one way or the other, you better be fully cogniscent of what those choices mean (or you're gonna have a bad time).  -The dev(s?) think of everything, as a result there is a very meta-feel to the game. The meta-feel is in no way a bad thing, it is executed wonderfully.  Overall, it attains a level of novelty that few indie developers ever reach but still maintains an incredible production value even with a small team.   Recommendations:  If you play through it the first time, I would highly recommend pacifist first. If you play through it in the opposite direction first, it might seem hollow since the characters wouldn't have been very fleshed out at that point. That being said, do what you want.

I guess that if you like the mother series, this is just plain buy it now material. besides that, all aboard the feelz (mid to late game or serious spoilers will not be present in this review) This review will be based on 5 different catagories gameplay story characters art style music TL;DR - not much to complain about (excluding lack luster puzzles)... at all. unless you hate RPGs or emotion, this is a MUST BUY. Probably an guarenteed game of the year on many, MANY lists  Long review Gameplay: The gameplay revolves around a nicely made, interesting little combat system. your 'soul' inhabits the shape of a heart and is used to dodge, jump, guard, and a host of other things enemy projectiles of every shape and form, even resembling the bullet hell genre at many points. The actual attacking is a bit lack luster since it is a non essential mechanic, something RARELY (if ever) seen in games. The movement in the world consists of a classic pixel RPG open movement style. The only gripe I find with the entire game is its lacklust puzzles, but at least they have a few jokes and accept the fact that they suck.  Story: I can't say much because spoilers but you have 3 main endings under the community given terms pacifist, neutral, and genocidal. Each of them revolve around, you guessed it, the way you interact with the world. Lemme tell you, this game has nice world reaction. Something you did at the VEEERY start of the game can have a giant flow change later on, even letting you basically skip bosses because you did something as simple as hold onto an object to use. and not to spoil much but OMG DEM FEELZ. Few games make me cry. but I had to stop for a good while and just process one of the endings. Narative is essential to this game and it is some of the best I have ever seen.  Characters: While slightly stereotypical and sometimes dragged out, most if not all main and supporting characters are very varied, and very likeable. and to the flower, you are just all over the place. Even enemy fodder has hopes and dreams, really making you contemplate the idea of killing them like how every RPG mindlessly does in droves.  Art Style: This is a very mother hommage art style. It is simplistic, yet complex. Scenes really pop out and there is a duality going on between the overworld and combat art styles which actually mixes very nicely. Overall the only thing i find a little annoying is that some movements by characters can seem slightly awkward but it adds more comic effect than anything else.  Music: I can't put into one reviews the variety of songs there are, something for everyone. even when you have 1 song remixed about 5 or 6 times it is still amazing every single time. This game has some of the greatest music I've heard in a mother-esq game. The only gripe is if you dislike pixel-ish music, but even then there is high quality songs too.  Overall, few to no flaws outside of personal taste. If you like mother, rpgs, good story, feels, and just about everything to do with breaking the 4th wall (and a bit of OMG WHAT THE HELL for dessert) you MUST get this game. I think everyone should play at least 1 playthrough of this.",

And there is nothing horrible I can say about this game outside the only fact I wish it was even longer!  + Combat is fun and intuitive. + Story is adaptive and beautifully created for the choices you make.  + Each character stands out in it's own unique way. Even the enemies stand out on their own.  + Dating skeletons. 'nuff said. + Soundtrack is a total positive hit for me. The songs are not extremely over the top. And fit the mood. + The tributes to Earthbound were very well received. + Petting dogs. Pet all the dogs! + Each character's personality had me fall in love with them. All unique and colorful. Never a dull moment with any character. + Each enemy can be handled in a multitude of ways.  + Beating the game's perfect ending really made me hesitant to start another run just from the living personalities made of the NPCs. + Humor, jokes, and the horrible puns all cracked more than a laugh from me. + Many enemies have their own personalities and gave me a smile when I didn't kill them.  This game earns it's overwhelmingly positive rating. The 10/10 comes from me and deserves it every moment. I highly recommend this game to you, your friends, and your friends' friends. Come in for a journey of laughter, frustration, joy, hardship, tears, and determination... and unravel the tale.. of UNDERTALE.",

Its just a game about walking and mashing z, much like as the same way Cave story was merely about walking through tunnels and doors. If you have never played Cave Story, go ahead and play it too to catch my drift.   This is a game where I dragged my feet to actually invest time into it, I made excuses and pondered over its success and if it would only be remembered as over-hyped youtube trash or considered to be for 'trendy meme-lords.' Then I sat down and played it. All of it. Lost my save file due to a computer hardware issue and started anew and beat it in one long sitting.   It was an experince. It was a wonderful, timeless experince that relied on something many AAA or internet humor derived indies miss. It had heart. It had memorable characters. It had a friggin great soundtrack. It made my girlfriend cry for 2 weeks straight and made her friends draw skeleton pron which made her cry even more.   I love it. Love love love it. I loved it so much I have gladly uninstalled it and have no intention on playing it ever again after beating it to a 'complietion.' Something I havent done since I last owned a console game as a child.  Is this game perfect? No. But its downsides vary person to person.  Some people don't like the combat system at some points. Some don't like the couple of puzzle segments (I'm one of them- thankfully in retrospect the number of puzzles isn't stifling,) and some don't think the writing is all that great. I'll even say that if your a TOTAL 100% Complietionist this game might not be for you.  No one has the same opinion. And thats perfectly fine.   If you want a game thats charming, but not overly cutesy, buy this game. If you want a game that has wit that without falling into a satire conga hell, buy this game. Above all if you want a good story with a lot of heart buy this game.   Oh and keep your fingers nimble, trust me.

Undertale is an RPG by Toby Fox, and is just simply amazing. I first heard about Undertale from Jim-♥♥♥♥ing-Sterling-Son, and was intrigued. I then saw some more gameplay on the game and bought it. And boy was I in for the ride that would make me appreciate characters like non other. The plot to Undertale is simple on the surface. Many years ago monsters and humans had a big war, monsters lost, and were banished. You are a human who falls down into a mountain into the word of the monsters, and thus your journey begins. The gameplay in Undertale is unusual. Like any other JRPG you have your items and your attack. However there is also the 'ACT' and the 'MERCY' buttons in combat. These two buttons allow you to interact with an enemy in a way other than attacking them. This allows you to 'SPARE' the enemy after you have said or done a certain thing to the enemy. This is where the ending to the game comes into play. There are multiple ending to the game, neutral, good, evil. No matter what on first playthrough you will get the neutral ending. After the first playthrough you are left with two options spare everyone you encounter, or kill literally kill everyone. This is the most interesting part of the game. Like I said earlier this games surface story is generic, but if you get either of the two alternate endings you will be thrown into the feels well with nowhere else to go. This game is in my opinion the best game to have come out in the past few years, and I gladly will reccomend it to anyone.  I rate this game a 10/10",

This game is very long, around 6 hours for me to get the true ending, and it feels like the pacing at some parts is lacking (I'd say this is only the case for the location Hotland: which has no real towns or areas to explore or look at, it's a pretty set path with very little things going for it that previous locations). This is mostly fixed by the main characters, who always have a chance to shine and grow on you: what makes Undertale different is that most of your best friends are actually enemies at first, and you as the main character have the option to kill or save each and every one of them, and each boss fight provides a unique gimmick to it to spread things apart. Some aspects of it, such as the idea that even killing random encounter enmies is 'cruel' and 'still murder' provides a fresh idea to RPG's that hasn't been seen in a while, and definetely makes this game something everyone can find something about, even despite the pacing.

There are points in the game where a character will shut down your game, forcing you to re-open in. Also, from playthrough to playthrough, without a hard reset of the game (manually clearing it) it will remember your decisions from previous playthrough. It forces you as a player to really evaluate your decisions, being unable to really go back and just reload save files.  Going further, this game has not even been completely *solved* yet. There are sorts of... secret characters/events that have been found by activating certain parts of the game file.   But yeah.

We went to the store and I bought a Steam card, and then buying that game knowing nothing about it. But after about an hour of playing it, I learned something... something dear to my heart: 'Oh my god this game is amazing' To be honest, the intro level of the game isn't extremely fun, as it holds your hand. But after that, you get a boss battle the propels you into an absolutely bueatiful open world of snow and humor. Basically, I'll put this review into segments:  Graphics: Charming 8-bit style that reminds me of EarthBound Beginnings/Mother 1. Music: I can't even describe how much this soundtrack makes my ears have a seizure from pure joy. Story: Surprisingly deep and dark, but not complicated. To boot, the game is hilarious.

It makes you feel so much emotion it made it difficult for me to beat the game because I would almost cry. (I'm not kidding.) I'm actually suprised I didn't cry to be honest.  Even though Undertale is an indie game, it is hands down, the best game I have played this year. (I'm a sucker for emotional games.)

Totally picks the brain of a speedrunner-type person if you go through killing everything and one of the enemies adapts his combat-style in order to get to YOU instead of just killing the character.

It was an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish... One that YOU control through your actions.  You'll be filled with love for the characters and their world, or filled with hatred for all other living beings. You'll laugh with the denizens of the underground and their antics, or you'll look down upon them as you wipe their blood off your clothes. You'll see what friendship means to these wonderful creatures- or you'll see what it means to be a monster yourself.  But no matter what path you take, you'll be filled with DETERMINATION to see it through to the end.  Its a nice, quirky game with lovable characters, fun ever-changing gameplay and a really great message. Easily the best turn based RPG I've ever played. I was really surprised by how much I wanted everything to go well for the characters, for them to live hapily ever after, given how little I typically care for characters in RPG's. Theres something very special about how the world and characters are built in this game, its hard to describe it.  Side note: the soundtrack is kickass as well!  Only complaints? Unless you're looking to have a bad time, the game is rather short. It's completely worth it though, undertale provides an experience you can't get anywhere else. It's a damn shame there aren't more games like this.",

First thing you'll notice is that you can choose to spare monsters instead of killing them. That one mechanic affects the game a lot more than you would initially think. The choice to spare a monster or not has much greater effects on the story than I belived it would initally (after being jaded by Fable's very poor morality choices and the 'changes' it does based on them (read: next to nothing changes at all)). I cannot say much more about this mechanic without spoiling anything but I can say one thing; the game's tagline in the trailer is not lying. You can beat the game without anyone dying.  The characters I can not say much about either, but they are a varied bunch and they are very memorable too (as looking up Undertale online will prove (although do not do that until after beating the game. Spoilers again)).  The soundtrack is also one of my favorite ones I have listened to in an indie game too. Again, like the characters, it is a varied bunch and does not always stick to 8-bit tracks either.  For £6.99 (or the regional equivalent), I would definitely recommend it.",

            "review_text": "now one of my favorite games of all time. definitely story-driven with a ton well-developed, lovable characters, all of which allow the player to become fully immersed in the game. the actual gameplay isn't something to overlook either. it emphasizes puzzles, especially because every 'enemy' encounter in a pacifist run is a puzzle--you have to figure out the correct inputs to be able to comfort and spare a monster. not only that, but the monsters also attack using a bullet hell that you have to dodge, and it varies with each monster (plus each monster can have more than one attack), so it doesn't beome dull. additionally there are several mechanics throughout the game that alter the way you dodge the bullets, so it REALLY doesn't get old. you will experience every emotion while playing--definitely fear and sadness, but mostly joy and laughter, as all of the dialogue/text in the game is extremely funny. you might have a little bit of rage if you find a boss too hard, but that only fills you with DETERMINATION. the game is very forgiving--its save points are strategically placed before and after big/lengthy events so you rarely have to worry about backtracking to the last save point (even if you're a compulsive saver like me). don't even get me started on the soundtrack: something I have not stopped listening to ever since I bought the game. Toby is a master at composing and utilizing the motifs he creates throughout the entire experience. Every time I listen, I discover a melody from one song that reappears in another, and done flawlessly so. in-game, the music is half of the emotion; it surrounds the story and graphics to complete that feeling of immersion. there's goofy songs for goofy moments, creepy songs for creepy moments, intense songs for intense moments, etc. this game knows exactly what it wants to be and doesn't struggle with trying to be two many things at once. it also knows exactly what the player will expect from it (not only in terms of gameplay but also general story tropes) and does a magnificent job of keeping the player surprised and eager to explore every nook and cranny. people keep saying this is their pick for Game of the Year 2015 and if you play it, it's extremely easy to see why. I created a Steam account just to purchase this game and it's the best decision i've ever made.",

I'll get to that later. It provides an excellent soundtrack, ranging from those that can pull at your heartstrings - like His Theme - to silly/fun ones - in themes such as Bonetrousle - to one that really get you pumped for battle, like Spear of Justice! With such a wonderful range of songs in the OST to choose from, I guarantee ('scuse spelling lmao) that you'll be listening for hours, if you enjoy the game!   If you DO join the game, however, I wouldn't exactly recommend getting too involved in the nastier side of the fanbase. In all honesty, this - and that GOD AWFUL BOSS FIGHT I'M STUCK ON [*raging intesifies*] - is the only downside of the game. Avoid misspelling the game - Ie. Undertail - and don't use keywords such as 'sin', unless, you know, you WANT to...  There's such a loveable cast in Undertale, ranging from: the lovely Goat Mama; the adorable, friendly flower *wink wonk*; the wacky Skele-duo; Alphy and Undyne (sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.); and the L E G R O B O T. Not to mention, my personal favorite, the dark and not-at-all fluffy ASGORE! I'm sure that the characters in the game are one of the best parts.  The battle system in Undertale is a love letter to retero-style, bullet-hell RPGs. I think it's really smart how Toby builds up rules upon the fighting system and TOTALLY DOESN'T BREAK THEM A QUATER OF THE WAY THROUGH THE GAME. But, yeah, the whole way you battle in this gem of an RPG really hits you with some good ol' nostalgia.   Overall, I believe Undertale is an excellent game, and I highly reccommed it to you!  ",

Combat is great. Rythym game for those who want to fight the enemies, puzzles for those who want to spare the enemies. Bullet Hell for defense and sometimes the entire purpose of the combat. There were a few situations where I could not avoid damage but that is probably due to my lack of skill- attacks were always fair even if difficult.

You start off the game in a a cave alone on a bed of flowers. Though it the flowers might appear to be 'insignificant', they really aren't. As you progress through the game, you are given three (or four, depending on what you did) ways of playing the game. As you enter the next room, you are introduced to a smiling Flower, appropriately named Flowey [*Howdy!]. He teaches you the ins and outs of the Underground and shows you his LOVE with 'friendliness pellets'. Though your new mom (or mum) doesn't like this and stops the Flower from spreading LOVE over you like butter. She shows you around the RUINS and teaches you to talk to the monsters and not to hurt them. This is where you make your choice. Kill or be killed, or love and be loved.   Along your adventure to travel back above ground, you'll meet a lot of monsters as you progress through the Underground. Depending on what you do, they'll love you, or they resent you.   Undertale is a game that teaches you what friends really mean, and how it feels when you hurt others. The mechanic of the game is amazing and wonderful, much like the music and Mettaton EX's legs. I recommend this to anyone who has a computer/mac, it's an adventure that you should never miss out on.   If you're going to buy the game, buy the Soundtrack. I've never felt so many different emotions from just a soundtrack alone. And if anyone reading this wants to pirate this game,   You're going to have a bad time.   Buy the game to support the Dog so it can do more text-to-speech created games.    I want Undyne to teach me how to make spaghetti like she does, along with her teaching me how to suplex boulders, because she can and I want to as well.      Overall, this game is a masterpiece full of puns that are bad to the   Bone   and if this review gets 10,000 ratings I will let someone call me before I    destroy the Barrier and    entertain people!

Normally I'm not the kind of person who would go around telling everyone he knows that they need to play a specific game but Undertale is a game that I believe anyone who enjoys games should experience. This game is the first game in a long time to affect me in anyway beyond simply being a game to have fun with. This game is the first one in a long time that I feel actually has heart. It knows what it wanted and it went for it.  In Undertale you play as a human who is purposefully androgynus who fell down into a world filled with monsters. You encounter many memorable characters on your journey out of the underground, many who want to kill you and many who just want a hug or a song. The game is a RPG where you have the option to fight every monster you come across like most standard RPGs and that option leads you to a timed attack system or you can ACT to either pacify or befriend them. Either option will result in the enemy attacking you which takes place in a bullet hell type event and then the process completes until you die, you kill the monster, or you MERCY/Spare the monster.  While the gameplay is fairly simplistic the simple fact that you can beat the game without killing anyone is something everyone should do at least once. What is amazing about the game is the music. It's positively amazing and it seems to hit the right tone for each area of the game, for every boss fight, and for every story beat perfectly. I haven't been this interested in a games music since hearing 3rd Eye Maiden in Touhou 11 and I like this games music so much I bought the soundtrack.",

It's well worth the $10.",

The gameplay is relatively straight-forward and simple by most standards, but where Undertale really shines is not only in its incredible narrative, but how its gameplay mechanics are an important part of that narrative. It's hard to talk about why I love this game so much without spoiling the experience, but I will say that I love how Undertale gives a real sense of consequences to your actions. I love how this game toys with, subverts, and utilizes RPG and video game conventions in unexpected ways. I love how this game actually, legitimately, really makes you feel bad for doing bad things in the game without using any kind of cheap 'karma' system. I don't even remember the last time I played a game that gave me feelings the way this one did. The characters are unforgettable, the music is top-notch (seriously, get the soundtrack bundle and thank me later), and the writing is basically perfect. If you have even a passing interest in video games you would probably enjoy this one. Hell, even if you don't you'd probably still enjoy it.  Please play this game. Please play Undertale.",

For example, you have 3 main ways of playing. Pacifist Neutral Genocide  If you were to do a genocide run for example you'd be completely ♥♥♥♥ed at the end. But, it changes the way the game and works and it almost makes you feel sad for your actions. Not to mention that ♥♥♥♥ing jumpscare at the end. UGH. Whereas, If you were to do a pacifist run, It would change the way the game goes through the story.   You can do so much with one simple idea and it branches to a massive project.

I bought this game, already fully aware of what to expect, however it STILL managed to surprise me... in a very positive way. You get into the game, get attacked by a flower and then instantly saved by Toriel, one of videogames' sweetest character to ever exist. She teaches you the ways of being a decent human being: DON'T try to solve everything with brute force, try to talk it out. And if you thought this only meant that you can talk your way through key moments: nope, every single fight ('cept for some boss fights) can be won without issuing a single attack-command. Once your guardian has to leave because of unfinished business, the RUINS are yours to explore: here you might stumble across interesting creatures, such as a number of talking frogs, vegetables trying to make you eat healthy, a melancholic and adorable ghost, John Cena... Once you're reunited with Toriel, you go ahead and move into a small house, where you have your own, fully decorated room. And let me say this: if there was a chance to STAY at that house from the very beginning... I would've taken it. However, life can't always be awesome and so you move out to explore the world, get back to your OWN world and maybe make a few friends along the way.  The strongest point of this game -in my opinion- are it's characters. Toriel I've already mentioned, but there's also the skeleton brothers Papyrus and Sans, the adorable, albeit shy and scatterbrained Professor Alphys, the talkshow master Mettaton... there are quite a few, and ALL of them are simply awesome. I think most people know that this game has multiple paths and whichever you end up with depends on how many 'enemies' you've killed. See, this is interesting, because it means that for me, it is flatout impossible to EVER get a 'genocide' run (you kill... essentially everything and -one) going, simply because every character is WAY to lovable to harm in any way. Sure enough however, being pacifistic as hell is also really, really rewarding. I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say this: the 'pacifist' ending honestly is one of the most heartwarming things I've ever witnessed. And I'm not exaggerating.  So, should you buy this game?? Yes, yes you totally should. Should you PLAY this game?? No, you should FEEL it. Should you ♥♥♥♥ off Sans?? Only if you want to have a BAD time.",

The most fascinating thing about the game, and probably its biggest selling point, is that it really is what you make it. Every single choice you make, from deciding to kill a random monster to deciding to befriend that cool fish girl who tried to kill you five minutes ago, matters, and your decisions impact the game in a significant way. Not only do your choices affect your current playthrough, but they affect every subsequent one which makes replaying the game a new experience, whether you choose to go down the same path as your last game or not. This, in combination with the cast of characters you'll meet and come to care about along the ride and the genuinely interesting story and lore, is what gives Undertale such great replay value, but will make you hesitant to ever play it again after you've gotten that 'good ending' you've probably heard about by now.

Earthbound is my favorite game, and Undertale manages to work in all the elements of charm and quirkiness that make Earthbound so amazing to me. Every character is unique and interesting- you just want to get to know everyone. From joy to sadness, few games have made me feel so many emotional connections to every event, but this game sets the tone from beginning to the end. The music frames every moment perfectly and will have you humming along. The graphics are simple but take nothing away from the experience.  Even after finishing Undertale, I can't help but watch other people play for the first time just to see their overwhelmingly positive reactions. Nothing feels forced or like work. This is one of those games that set a standard for gaming, and leaves gaming community talking about it for years to come.",

            "review_text": "Legitmately one of the best games I have ever played. Undertale is a funny, sad, emotional and terrifying trip through a deeply innovative, but strangely innovative setting. Undertale follows the story of a small child who falls into a bizarre underground realm, populated by monsters. This conventional premise, however is turned on its head in the very first encounter. You don't have to fight the monsters, but can instead take the correct actions to befriend them and end the fight peacefully. Monster attacks are also unique, taking the form of tiny bullet hell minigames in which you must dodge the monster's attacks with a small red heart, representative of your soul. even the most basic encounters in Undertale are therefore unique and entertaining, and the boss battles become fast-paced amaglams of dodging and hugging. However, Undertale always gives you a choice. You can chose to fight and kill the monsters harassing you, but every possible choice in Undertale resonates through the storyline, and you will have to face the consequences of both playing violently and playing peacefully. The game's moral system is deep and affecting, making its points without forcing you into a certain path or getting preachy. You will want to protect this world and help these characters, not because you get an achievement for doing so or it unlocks a cool sidequest, but because you care about them.  With a beautifully evocative soundtrack and simple yet effective pixel art, Undertale is that rare deconstruction that doesn;t seem to hate what it deconstructs and it the very reason video games exist. if you still arent convinced it has a sexy robot and dogs you can pet (you cannot pet the sexy robot)",

            "review_text": "This game is absolutely incredible. To briefly summarize, it’s an RPG that rifs off of old 2D RPGs, with all that awesome pixel art going on. If you don’t dig that art style tho, still give it a shot! It’s got a lot of other awesome stuff going for it!!! It’s got a killer soundtrack, great humor, and an awesome narrative with multiple endings and memorable characters. It dumps you on your head a couple times and has at least a few surprises you weren’t expecting, or if you /were/ expecting the surprise, you weren’t expecting the surprise you received. It's only $10, and it'll only take you about 6 hours to play through it, so give it a chance!  Explore an rich underground world! Kill the monsters! Or spare them! Your choice. Date a skeleton! Solve puzzles! Eat pie! Appear on live TV! Listen to music with a dapper ghost! PUNS. Chat with your best friend Flowey the flower! Be brave, and stay determined. At the end of your journey, and standing between you and the way home, is the king of monsters, ASGORE. Just remember, this is the friendly RPG where no one has to die!  (but that doesn't mean that no one will)",

            "review_text": "Undertale is a quirky RPG in the vein of the SNES game EarthBound. You never gain any other party members, and the RPG elements aren't that heavy (you only get two inventory slots, and there is no magic.) The game has two central gameplay mechanics.  1. Defense. Rather than just a text box saying the enemy attacks you and deals X damage, you control a small red heart inside a box and must avoid projectiles and other things, making it possible to not get hit at all. 2. Pacifism. It's possible to complete the game without hitting anyone (except Asgore, and Mettaton, but only in defense). After you complete the main game and get the Neutral ending, you can play again for a Pacifist run, extending the game beyond the normal final boss. Or you can just go for the Genocide ending.  The game is short, but sweet, longer if you go for the multiple endings. It's full of memorable characters and unique enemies. The soundtrack is amazing (like Waterfall, and the battle theme of Mettaton and Asgore). I do highly recommend this, and it's one of the best games of the year.",

Keeping an open mind, albeit a bit skeptical due to the hype behind it, I must say I was surprised! The game is fairly simple yet strangely complex...almost everything you do has some impact on the story in some way, shape or form. The story is nice and simple, easy to follow without any 'fluff' per se. The combat is nice and different, a combination of timed attacks and bullet-hell dodging, with a mix of something I wont spoil. Music, it was nice. It fitted the atmosphere of the stages and battles, and the sound effects were pretty well done as well. Graphics, they reminded me of those from the NES days, and that's not a bad thing! I really like how the characters seem alive, even the weakest of the badies to the strongest of bosses. All in all, for $10 it's a game worth trying. Is it the best thing since *insert whatever here*, maybe not, but is it a good game, yes. I personally give it a 9/10.

The soundtrack is a work of art, it helps to keep you entertained even during harder boss fights, especially 'Death by Glamour' which is definitely one of my favourite boss fight songs. The characters and story are both really amazing and beautiful, I haven't felt this atached to a game in a while, having the ability to play the pacifist route and come to love all the characters makes the genocide route even more hard hitting. 10/10 game tbh",

Tip: Even if you play through your first time as a pacifist, you will not get the best ending. The game is MEANT to be be played twice.  It's two play-throughs, that are almost entirely different games, and you won't get a real ending until you do this. Last bit of advice, after you 'win' the pacifist round, walk ALLLLLLL the way back to the very, very, beggining of the game. Worth it.",

It's filled with fun puzzles which is somewhat easy once you tried them but still makes them fun. The fighting moments are great. Some of them are hard, some of them not. Being able to go full force on an enemy is ok i guess but instead of fighting the enemies you can try to solve the conflict thru non violent actions. This makes the game harder but funnier i think. It adds a bit of flavour into the game. The music in the game is superb, brings back the cool 8 bit feeling... Which is also super awesome. The characters in the game are special in their own ways. They are intresting and funny. The game has its moments when something is about to happend and you think you know whats gonna happend and bam. Randomness at its finest  Multiple times in the game, i actually cried. Real tears...  The moments, combined with the music. It made me cry...  I recommend this game if and you try it.  Dont skip the dialogs, events and stuff.  Look thru the whole game.  Read all the dialogs and study the characters.  Cause man... The story is great...  Oh man...  I wanna play it again...  ...

Some battles even show how much the creators were really 'thinking outside the box'.  It should be noted that story outcomes can vary greatly based on your decisions.

            "review_text": "In my opinion, Undertales greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness; it's an unapologetic indie game.  The fact that it is an indie game allows it to break the mold a bit, have an interesting and unique take on the turn based RPG such as the schmup style combat that changes with bosses to mix up the gameplay, a pure pacifist route option, deserved shaming for any non pacifist route (As compared to the defining scene in spec ops the line), and all the gameplay elements that break the fourth wall and alter the game experience in interesting way.  On the other hand, it suffers a lot because it is an indie game with little funding when compared to AAA games. The art direction (while good in style) is too low fidelity, the writing is sloppy and is very hit and miss, and many features are half present in the game (such as hard mode, the gaster storyline, and the arguable missed opportunity by only having 3 ending types). The biggest injury that being an indie game delivered to Undertale is the game length. Even for an indie game, RPG's are the genre that have the least trouble in extending gameplay through a variety of elements, and even though Undertale uses quite a few of them (random battles, a pure grind playthrough, and a playthrough where you cannot get stronger to fight enemies easier) the game is unbelievably short. Even if one looks for secrets, the first playthrough of the entire story should take no more than 3-4 hours, and if the pacifist run was done on that first playthrough, then the second true ending comes within 30-50 minutes later. Beyond that, the game is also suffers in it's presentation as many 'controversial' elements are presented without much tact or subtlety, once again due to it's indie origin, which serves to be extremely off putting if one is either uncomfortable with the subject matter it handles, the way it handles it, or the people the subject matter panders too.  As a player, I highly favour gameplay as the most important element of a game, which Undertale delivers on in a unique and engaging way, and I enjoy the style of humour it presents as well. While I did no like some of the overly dramatic and cliche moments at the end, nor the games short length, I did thoroughly enjoy what I did get, and would highly recommend this game to anyone willing to try it.",

Every character, which includes every enemy, is lovable. The retro graphic style is charming. And the music! It's so incredible! Every track is memorable and you will just want to keep listening to it. It's the perfected JRPG formula. If you liked Earthbound, then you will definitely love this game. I actually think that this game is better than Earthbound. I didn't grow up with that game so I can give my opinion without nostalgia googles. Basically in this game, you can choose to fight or befriend anything that you engage a battle with. Fighting will increase your level; which will increase your HP, ATK, and DEF making it easier to beat the game. And your other choice is sparing your foes. You do this by choosing the 'act' option in a battle. There are several 'act' options to choose from and they vary depending on your enemy. It's usually a very silly sequence of actions you must fulfill to befriend and spare your foes. Your enemies are so charming and cute that you would feel bad killing them! They don't just get knocked out. They die! So choose wisely! There are plenty of puzzles in this game to keep the overworld interesting. And these are not tedious puzzles. I had fun with them. The most enjoyable part for me was the humor. This game made me laugh and smile throughout my whole playthrough. And right after I finished it, I went for a second playthrough so I could get the true ending. This game only took me 8 or 9 hours to beat, but it is truly worth it. $10 is a really good price. I would have bought it for $30. The story starts out all fun and silly, but you soon will realize how dark it really is. It's going to make you emotional. Toby Fox wrote this game, designed it, and composed the music. He really is a genius. And I really look forward to what ever else he will create. Hopefully another video game! 10 out of 10!!!",

Undertale is a unique take on RPG games where rather than simply attacking or taking an attack there is a bullet hell, that is if you attack at all. As advertised you can play this entire game without killing anyone, or just kill everyone if thats your thing. Be warned though, Undertale will remember what you do. when you reset the game undertale will remember what you did in your last playthough this also adds to the games replay value. For only $10 this game will be worth every penny.  10/10 would recommend",

            "review_text": "A fantastic RPG in the same vein as Earthbound:All about its world,characters,and charm and less about its gameplay. However,for a game like this that puts more emphasis on story and atmosphere it's still no slouch in the gameplay department either.  The game is presented as a turn-based RPG,and for the player's actions it appears like such,but when it comes to enemy attacks it has the player move a heart (which represents their Soul) around to avoid the attacks of the enemy. Each enemy in the game has their own attack patterns and even enemies of similar types feel different enough that it never gets to feeling stale. Bosses even take things one step further by altering the mechanics in ways you'll never see when encountering normal enemies,such as limiting the Heart's movement to three lines or making it so you jump by pressing up instead of simply moving up or down.   Player attacks are pretty simple,after selecting 'fight' you must press the confirm button with appropriate timing to deal more damage (mistiming can either lead to less damage or even the attack missing altogether). However,while fighting is an option,the biggest part of the game is the 'act' menu and the ability to offer mercy to your enemies instead of killing them. Every enemy has their own set of options,ranging anywhere from petting them to simply flexing your muscles and just about anything in between. If you perform the right actions you're then given the option to Spare them,removing them from the battle at hand without having to kill them. This feature is key to a large amount of the game's charm and as such it's highly recommended that players do this for their first playthrough.  Of course,killing everything is very much an option and the difference between doing that and not killing anything is like night and day. Going Genocide over Pacifist takes you through the same areas,but the actual story events unfold in much different ways and leads to a completely different final boss and ending. When doing a Genocide run you must kill a certain amount of enemies in each area you go through (the number remaining is told to you at save points) until eventually they just stop appearing ('encounters' will still happen,but they will only contain the message 'But nobody came...'). Honestly this gets to be pretty dull,as the closer you are to your kill quota the longer it seems to take to get an encounter. In addition,none of the encounters in a Genocide run prove to be much of a challenge save for two particular boss battles. Personally I'd only recommend a Genocide run after you've already completed a Pacifist run as the personalities of the characters are very downplayed and it doesn't really represent what makes the game great.  Like I mentioned at the beginning of this review,the characters are a HUGE part of this game and going the Pacifist route really makes them all shine. Just about all of the major characters are surprisngly deep despite many of them seeming pretty one-dimensional when you first meet them. Hell,even a large amount of the minor characters in the game are memorable due to how silly and full of personality they are during the brief time you encounter them!  As for the game's soundtrack it's chock-full of chiptunes that perfectly reflect the areas and characters you encounter throughout the game and are prone to getting stuck in your head.   My only real gripe with the game is that it's fairly short for an RPG,lasting anywhere between 6-12 hours for a single playthrough,but considering you'll likely be laughing the entire way through it's a thoroughly enjoyable 6-12 hours and is well worth the $10 price if you're a fan of this kind of game.  (Reading this far into the review fills you with DETERMINATION!)",

If the characters had perfect personalities, they wouldn't seem real and genuine. Undertale lets you play the way you want and feel the way you want. I think the best experience is playing through the game without killing anyone, and then trying to restart and going for a genocide run.

The game is not shy when showing the results, and later, the consequences to your actions.

Undertale game play made two changes to the mechanics common in role playing game. First) You have the option to spare your opponents in combat. Second) You can maneuver your character during your opponent action to dodge incoming attacks. These changes make both random encounters and boss battles more unique.

It may seem like a gimmick at first, but MERCY heavily affects the story and characters around you. Whether it's just a handful of enemies, a mini-boss, or a big boss main character, whether or not you give them MERCY, or FIGHT them and kill them, can completely change everything about the game and its world.

Excellent use is made of a plethora of dodging mechanics to keep the game engaging, and in some cases, quite difficult. -Excellent, involving story which, much like all of the characters, has much more to it than you might think. -Great writing. The text in this game is contemporary, charming, and often downright hilarious. -Expansive meta-commentary. Besides the rather fourth wall breaking style to begin with, Undertale changes with each playthrough, showing evidence of your involvment in between saves and resets.  A unique take on the JRPG that takes themes from old masterpieces like Earthbound and turns them on their head, Undertale is an experience that is incredibly deep and complex, but at the same time refrains from over-complicating itself.

I had managed to avoid spoilers, so I was playing through it blind, but most of the way through my first playthrough of this game, I have to say I thought the game was kind of overhyped.  Sure, the writing was pretty funny at times, and the music was good, and the schtick of an RPG where you could talk your way through everything instead of killing was different. But I didnt get the story, and some of the boss fights were just tedious, to the point where I was pretty close to just quitting instead of continuing to slog through dying over and over and over on the final boss. When I finally got past him to the end of the game, it was with more of a sense of a grand FINALLY! than a grand finale.   But then, without putting spoilers in this review, lets just say that at that point, the pieces of the story that I had been missing finally clicked into place, and my appreciation of the narrative blossomed exponentially.   I no longer think this game is overhyped; in fact, I don't think it has gotten nearly as much attention as it deserves.  Since then, I have played through the entire thing, start to finish, two more times (something I have never wanted to do for any other RPG, at least without a couple years in between, and certainly not back-to-back-to-back playthroughs). Each time, I have gleaned more hidden gems of absolutely marvelous storytelling (there is a metric buttload of secrets all over the place.) The dialog and events are by turns charmingly funny and incredibly, heart-wrenchingly sad; no game has ever made me laugh OR cry as much as this one has. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

If your friends feel as strongly they might have offered to buy the game for you.   As a retro style game it makes good use out of the graphics of the age. The music while sounding much like the 16-bit music it's trying to emulate is very catchy and has already spawned many remixes of the themes on Youtube. The box 'Combat' system is interesting and often enough surprising to keep you on your toes. There are many Easter eggs and side bits are numerous and often require different playthroughs to see them. Battles change on depending on your playstle; you might fight one monster one way, or another by a different path.  The characters are interesting, often endearing. They react to how you play the game; even the random NPCs you meet have different reactions based on how the game progresses. The humor is goofy at times, but still quite amusing. The story is well written and easilly captures people's heartstrings depending on your emotional investment in the game.  I highly recommend taking the chance and play without any spoilers or guides just for the fun of it on your first playthrough. My hat is off to Toby Fox on the depth placed into this game.

The story is one of the best works of art I have ever experienced in any videogame in the history of my life. The gameplay introduces a new gameplay style that is both easy and hard to understand and use. The characters are more interesting and developed than some of the people I know in real life. They made me want to help them. The soundtrack is huge with some amazing songs that get you hyped, sad, happy, or scared. The bossbattles are excited as well as hard. They make you want to keep trying and want to over come any obsticle that comes in your path. UnderTale is the best game of the year if not the best game ever made. The overall experience of the game makes you want to keep coming back for more and when you do you just get over excited with all the energy and amazingness that comes along the way. If you haven't played this game you are missing out on something great.",

            "review_text": "It's good It's great It's awesome Best game ever? meh, not really, still awesome  Heavily inspired by Earthbound, you play a kid who is trapped in the underground world where monsters live. Almost none of them are bad but they all seem to want something from you or are afraid of you so you get the choice to ACT things out peacfully like a puzzle or FIGHT with very basic combat. There's a special ending for pacifism and a gamebreaking ending for genocide. I recommend kill one person, spare another and just play as you like on the neutral route for your first run. Characters are great in case you haven't seen the fans gushing over them, story gets real deep at times, combat is a lot more interesting. Offensivly it ranges from figuring out each enemy with actions and just bashing them over the head. The real kick is in the defense where you have to move your 'soul' around to avoid bullets. In most fights I didn't think it was too difficult but then again I've lost so many times to Ran from Perfect Cherry Blossom. Regardless Undyne will be the first real challenge in combat and in Genocide route certain enemies really mean business. If you haven't been spoiled to what happens in this game I highly recommend playing it and locking yourself away until you've done a neutral route (it's okay, you can beat it in about 4 hours). I can understand the fans get annoying but for a few hours just ignore them, get this game, and never use Tumblr in the first place.",

            "review_text": "(review gets long and wordy, you were warned) When I first saw Undertale released on Steam, I kinda glanced over it.... and I liked it. It was nice, not too stylized, but unique all the same. The music sounded great, the concept looked solid, and I thought the no-kill feature was pretty neato. It just looked awesome all around.  Pros and Cons (As always, P&amp;Cs are based off of my own personal experiences. Opinions are all different.) Pros: -Humorous (Or should I say Humerus :P) -Solid storytelling -Great soundtrack -Memorable cast -High replayability -Easily navigatable  Cons: -Repetitive jokes -You must be somewhat invested in the cast to thoroughly enjoy it -Somewhat unforgiving -Controls can be a hassle depending on your keyboard -Encounters can become boringly simple -Time battling in boss battles is directly proportional to amount of dialogue the boss has.  Note: If you aren't thoroughly aquianted with your arrow keys, well, you will be in a few minutes, because your movement in the game relies on these keys, both in battle and out. If you're normally aquainted with WASD, you may have a little trouble, but it shouldn't be too hard.  And so here we go. Undertale starts simply enough, with story and a tutorial. But as it moves on and as you make choices and interact with characters, it becomes a simply memorable experience. The music ranges from warm and energetic to haunting and slow, and that's not giving it much credit either. If you can, I definitely recommend you buy this game along with its soundtrack because HOLY HELL it is gold.  Undertale, though simple, is surprisingly deep, pretty solid with its story, and at times completely meta (or should I say Metta?). The characters are complex, ridiculously entertaining, and extremely memorable (and you can date a skeleton. Who can say no to that?). There is little, if any, of the fourth wall left by the time the game is over, which makes it that much more of a delightful experience. Not to mention you're subjected to puns and jokes hand over fist.  Undertale does come with its downs as well, and when I talk about downs, I'm talking about what the cool kidz these days refer to as 'The feels'. And this game has the feels. Oh, does it have 'em. Never have I restarted a game for feeling  guilty . And this game guilt trips you like you promised your daughter you would see her dance recital and totally missed it. Every action you make has an outcome. Every. Single. One. And it is glorious.  The game is also mildly self aware. So if you think you can kill everything with no consequence... Well, I'll let you be the judge of your own playthrough. But let me tell you. The choices you make define the outcome of the game. If you kill everything, the game remembers. If you spare everything, the game remembers. You can feel like a saint or a monster (which, in respect to the game, is offensive to the monsters) and if you think you can reset, NO WAY. This game knows. Every one of your transgressions, it knows. There are multiple endings and multiple dialogue options, and each of your actions effects these (present and future playthroughs included).  However, a few elements of the game may become tedious at times, especially encounters. Each encounter usually relies on a specific action in order to sate/destroy the monster, which can become tedious in a single area, encountering the same monster, choosing the same choices, time after time. Another mildly-tedious element is boss battles. Time battling in boss battles is directly proportional to amount of dialogue the boss has, meaning the amount of hits/times you stall usually don't matter- only the dialogue of the character matters. If you want EXP, you're going to have to kill something. Depending on your desired outcomes, this may not be so bad. But should you desire an outcome without violence, there's a bit of a curve as it becomes more difficult to find patterns and dodge higher attacks. Combine that with a low health bar and shoddy armor in a high-level area and you just might have a bad time.  At any rate, Undertale doesn't take itself too seriously (that's your job) and it's a delightfully refreshing twist on most of the games out there today- the story isn't the newest, the graphics aren't the most magnificent, but it makes all of it worthwhile. It's witty and different and I like that.  TL;DR If you want to date a skeleton, get dunked on with pun after pun, meet a variety of dogs, eat a variety of strange foods, make friends/foes with a bunch of cool people, have a flexing contest, fight a suspiciously Dr. Frank N. Furter-esque robot or  swear violently  talk to a flower, Undertale is  the  game for you. It's quirky. Its funny. Its creative. Even those words don't do it justice. But it may be exactly what you're looking for.    Absolutely perfect. Spaghetti/100. Get Undertale. You will not regret it.",

This is very uncommon in an RPG. There is the Genocide route as well, in which you kill everyone and everything in the game. And then there's many different neutral routes and a ton of different endings you can trigger.  Obviously, you can do whatever you like, don't just take my word. But whatever routes you choose to do, I guarentee you will fall in love with the characters, from the main ones to the supporting ones. All the dialouge, no matter how small, adds something to the game. In fact, much of the dialouge is highly comedic!   Also, the game doesn't really have a fourth wall, an aspect I've always enjoyed in games. Whatever you do, the game will remember and sometimes it prompts dialouge and conversations that some players have not experienced because they haven't played the game exactly like you have.

The different modes you play in the game can effect you and your game depending on the order you play them in. It's amazing how uneccesarily complex Toby made the game and programming in it. Ranging from discovering a hidden room from dodging all of the credits in true pacifist to the genocide ending effecting the true pacifist ending.

            "review_text": "This game was very sad, and also, very happy. I went on the genocide run first, without thinking about what I was doing, and I thought that that's how the game had to go, you kill, gain LV and stats, and things like that, but you don't think about what you're doing. You're going through the game, as if it is another rpg where you kill everything, and level up, but when you realize at the end, that your actions have consequences, it hits the sweet spot with moral and ethical values. The Frog at the very beginning of the game even pleads for mercy for himself, and all monsters alike, and when you go out and kill a monster, you slowly become a monster yourself by the end of the game, and not metaphorically, I mean, literally. So I went on a pacifist run, where I usually talked my way out of battle, or fled, or spared monsters, and needless to say, my efforts were rewarded in a very satisfying happy, yet bittersweet ending. I have been told though that there are lots of other secrets to be discovered, so if you like games that have mystery, or adventure, this one is for you.  I also found a whole lot of the music very calming, and peaceful, for instance, I was traveling through Snowdin, and the town was magical, the characters, given little dialogue and narration, seemed fleshed out among the other Snowdin villagers, and they just 'belonged.' It was like walking through a fantasy for most of the game, walking through the puzzles and braving the stronger opponents in the game. It was as if all of my literal dreams were being visualized, and, I will admit I used to dream and fantasize about things like that when I was a kid. From wacky characters such as Papyrus, to the bold and peaceful king at the ending of the game, every character had It's place in this big world, and I was so frustrated to find some of the choices very hard to choose. Even in the little things, like deciding which is better, crossword, or word jumble? Every single dialogue choice, big or little, has an amazing impact on things like, how Papyrus acted, or if I stayed friends with Sans, and weather I would have to fight Undyne.  And the soundtrack just added to the mystical tone of Undertale, as I fought Toriel, or battled Papyrus, or heard one of Sans jokes, all of the music just fit in somehow, to a game this small, yet so big. The sound effects were not the best, and neither was the music, but the way that they utilized what they had to make the game, and build it into what it is now, is amazing. I wish the music was more cinematic, or theatrical, but when I think about what the game might be if the music were like that, then that would ruin the art style, or at least just seem out of place, next to it. It is like an old NES game, or an old nintendo game, in that it has simplistic graphics, and movements, but it's not like it had to be completely realistic.  The fights are my personal favorite parts of the game, because it has some fast parts, and some slow parts, and some really just confusing moments, but it's not to fast for the style of the game, and not too slow either. I found a lot of what the monsters said really funny, and really inspiring, and that filled me with determination(no pun intended).  All in all, this game is not perfect, but for me, it certainly is, and I enjoyed every minute playing this game. I recommend it for an adolescent audience, or a young adult audience, because there are some things that kids should not play through.",

The combat in this game is average, and the graphics look old, but the game makes up for it in atmosphere. It was like playing Mass Effect again for the first time.   Would recommend.

Break 185g best dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl. Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them. Now remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature. While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4 (most ovens take 10-15 minutes to heat up). Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Now tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl, and tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps. With a large sharp knife, chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board. The slabs of chocolate will be quite hard, so the safest way to do this is to hold the knife over the chocolate and press the tip down on the board, then bring the rest of the blade down across the chocolate. Keep on doing this, moving the knife across the chocolate to chop it into pieces, then turn the board round 90 degrees and again work across the chocolate so you end up with rough squares. Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar until they look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is, so don’t lose heart. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there. Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like – you don’t want to undo all the work you did in step 4. Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly. Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing. Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout. Now your mixing is done and the oven can take over. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it. Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 minutes. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven. Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles. These brownies are so addictive you’ll want to make a second batch before the first is finished, but if you want to make some to hide away for a special occasion, it’s useful to know that they’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.

However, if you are look past the graphics, most people who played this game will tell you that this game is a unique experience.   Unlike most RPGs, Undertale does not focus on grinding from level 1 to 25 to eventually beat a dungeon boss. The creators of Undertale wants the player to feel immersed around the environment and characters in the game. Every character you meet in the game is likable in their own way, even the bad guys. Additionally, each character has their own theme song, and makes you feel 'OH SHI-', or in wrestling terms 'mark out' to a degree. Even with all the positives with the characters in Undertale, these characters do not add much depth to the story. However, these do not retract to what makes Undertale special.  For each enemy interaction in Undertale, you have the choice to either kill or not kill each enemy. Although, killing does not penalize you, it makes a difference in where the story ends. Not killing every enemy is rewarding at the end.   If you are turned off in how Undertale looks, do not let that deter you from playing this one of a kind game.",

A simple battle turned to a struggle and a death turned to grief. Not only that, but this game practically breaks the fourth wall. (Play the True Pacifist run and listen to Flowey very closely.) And the truth is, yes, you DON'T have to kill anyone! It's true. This is called the Pacifist ending. Very eventful. But, this game also has a dark secret. Saves travel. I'm not kidding. You can reset a game and some character will make a reference about not being able to know something that you actually do know. It's pretty scary, especially with Flowey and Sans. That's about it, don't want to spoil too much! I highly recommened the game. Get it. GET IT NOW! BUY IT NOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW",

I will not spoil anything about the game throughout this review. But I'd like to say that there a 3 main routes, ones you most likely know about now. Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide. I am sure you can figure out what I meant. But, anyway, Undertale has a beautiful soundtrack when peacefully sparing the friend, or giving no mercy to a foe. The story can be missed if minor details of thing were not read, which I like because it makes you want more and explore a lot. The dialouge, or monolouge can be so dynamic. Which I love it because of how we can 'feel' those emotions of the characters. And it shows how we might be in the situation. If you have not known what Undertale is, I recommend YOU specifically, this game.",

I'm not much of an RPG person and even I liked this game a lot. I like this game's battle system and I really liked the story and the way that the game tells it. Also, the soundtrack is one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time. The game may not be perfect in some areas, and I don't like how it punshies you when you finish Genoicde (which is one of the reasons why I'm not doing it), but I still found it enjoyable overall.

            "review_text": "Lord of the Frisk or Undertale  This indie game has become a legend of sorts. With a dedicated fanbase to match, and packed with enough content, lore, addictiveness and all the bits that assemble an extraordinary video game, Undertale will be remembered throughout the ages.  Now, before we begin, what is Undertale? Well simply, it’s the story of a lost human child, who finds herself trapped in an underground world, and she must find a way out. Kind of sets up the basis for a fairly modern RPG setting, right? But it accomplishes so much more than a simple “Enter da dungeon, kill da mobs, acquire increasingly powerful loot, encounter even stronger bosses, and save the day” game. Your avatar is a little girl. She’s not some badass knight in spiked armour, wielding a sword/axe/spear/staff, but if she gets violent, which the game allows you to do, things go down a dark, spiralling path that may be discomforting at its most. In short, Undertale is a colossal triumph, because not only is it brilliant, funny, and engaging, but it also demonstrates how unique and amazing indie games can be. That’s not to say that the bigger game companies today aren’t talented enough to make their own heavy-hitters (here’s looking at you, Bethesda and Telltale Games).   Anyway, let’s get down to business: Story-wise, Undertale stars the human girl, trapped in the underworld, trying to find a way to the surface. As her journey progresses, we come across and entire ensemble of colorful, funny and memorable characters. There’s the mommy-goat figure, named Toriel, who wishes to take in the human child as her own, there’s the hilarious skeleton brothers, Sans and Papyrus, with their cartoony hijnks and skeleton-related puns that ought to tickle your funny bone, there’s the cool Undyne, with her grand plans of capturing a human, and many more. The main antagonistic force opposing the human child is a small flower named Flowey, who attempts to kill her from the very start! This is achieved with little “love pellets”, which are in reality, bullets that narrow the player’s health to one! Luckily, Toriel saves us in the nick of time and shoots a fireball right into the aforementioned flower’s face, effectively sending him flying away.  You’ll notice that it’s not just the aforementioned batch of characters, but also every single foe in the game, each with their own ambitions and personalities. In a way, they are no different from us humans; they just want to live and enjoy life. This further encourages the option to spare the monsters, which evokes positive reactions from other NPCs.  Now, gameplay is essentially a giant bullet-hell fest. During most sequences, you are enclosed in a small box, where your avatar is turned into a heart, which represents your soul. In order to win, you must dodge every projectile sent your way. This isn’t necessarily easy, and living up to its name as a bullet hell title, that small box is filled with deadly objects that will chip away at your health if you are not careful to dodge them. There are certain patterns to each attack, and you must memorise them carefully. Once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is extremely addictive and fast-paced The graphics of Undertale retain a pixilated format, equivalent to those of old Nintendo games. Some will point out that the graphics aren’t up to par with the rest of the game, but I digress. The pixilated graphics perfectly suit Undertale, making it stand out from other games that use the same art style.  The soundtrack…oh god, the soundtrack...it’s beyond anything you’ve heard before. Whether you are walking through the woods, or a monster village, or a field of snow poffs, or a cave illuminated with glowing mushrooms, the soundtrack sets the mood and adds an atmosphere of beauty to an already enthralling adventure. During the comedic events of the game, the music becomes silly and flamboyant, to the point where you have little else to do but chuckle. The music is a key feature of Undertale, and makes you want to stand up and cheer, because it is THAT damn good, and sets an example of how amazing game soundtracks can be.  One more thing about Undertale is its ability to be funny. The humor often dabbles in the realms of the internet, and twists long-dead memes into fresh and original jokes, one-liners, and puns. Especially bone-related puns, and there are a ton of funny bones within Undertale’s body, packed with comedic calcium. From an annoying mutt that prevents you from acquiring a legendary fruit by taking up your inventory space, to the mischievous antics of the skeleton twins Papyrus and Sans, you will find few other games that will make you spit out your spaghetti with laughter then this game.  To wrap up this review, would I recommend this game? Well, would a mouse patiently wait for a slice of cheese that has become incrusted within a purple crystal? Would a sea-dwelling onion beg you to notice him? Would that dog playing poker lose, even when it’s playing by itself?! If all of those fill you up with determination, than yes! I highly recommend this game! Anyway, I can sit here and talk about this game’s greatness, but that’s absolutely nothing compared to when you, yourself, play it. You will simply have to buy it and taste the epicness that is Undertale.  And remember, no matter how you look at it…  Or whatever you make of it…  It’s still a snow poff. ---Dr.M ",

            "review_text": " Undertale 's creator was once known mostly for his  Earthbound  mods, and that background shines through in this game's tone and aesthetic.  Undertale  is a dreamlike, postmodern take on the classic RPG formula that regularly engages in genre critique and fourth-wall breaking and oscillates between scenes of sweetness and light and scenes that are, at times, geniunely disturbing. Fans of  Earthbound  will find themselves in familiar territory in this respect.  The central concept that sets  Undertale  apart is not the bullet-time feature that differentiates its combat from other RPGs, nor is it the clever way the battle system mechanizes the effort to end fights peacefully, though both are welcome additions. The more interesting feature, rather, is the game's awareness of the save file. Going back and loading your save will not quite reset everything you've done in the interim, and a few of the game's NPCs know what you've done and will hold you accountable down the line. The main quest takes about six to ten hours to complete, but the secret endings built on the concept of 'recreating' the world by starting over constitute the real meat of the game's story. It takes several playthroughs to experience every ending, and completionist players will occasionally be pointed out as such by NPCs.  While it's now easier than ever before to make a retro RPG at home and distribute it online, the resulting sea of sprite games takes a special effort to stand out from, and  Undertale  does so with clever mechanics and an interactive meta-story that provides stark tonal contrasts without feeling arbitrary or disorienting (or at least not more disorienting than feels appropriate given the nature of the story). If you liked  Earthbound , if the idea of an RPG revolving around the choice to kill or befriend appeals to you, or if you're just a fan of turn-based RPGs in general, I recommend  Undertale .",

            "review_text": " TL;DR : If you have emotions, buy it; it's worth so much more than $10.  A lot has already been said about this game in the year it's been released (at the time of this review). A lot of people comment on the heart of the game, the soundtrack, the characters... There's a lot to comment on. There is just truly so much about this game that makes it great. Forget all the memes of the annoying dog, how great a song 'Megalovania' is, how weird some of the fanart is. Forget all that. If you haven't played this game, spend the $10 and do so.   The characters are unbelievably fully-realized. Papyrus, Sans, Alphys, Toriel, even the late-game characters are so rich and deep. The human understanding it takes to create such completely well-developed characters you feel for, no matter what path you take, be it Pacifism or Genocide or some strange middle ground, the actual heart it takes to create these characters is astounding. A great deal of personal struggle had to of been experienced by the creator in some way, whether it be directly or vicariously. That struggle is omnipresent in every character, a struggle of genuine connection or unrequited love, of child abandonment or unjustifiable hatred. That struggle that a lot of people deal with resonates within these characters and what they do, the motivations they have, and the histories they possess.  Another notable facet is the soundtrack. You can create tone through anything in the story: the environment, the way characters speak, the way they dress, things that happen to the characters. It takes a notable appreciation of not only music, but of emotional drive of the relationship of character and world to have it become the driving force in how the game feels. Anybody can listen to 'Megalovania' and say that's a great song. However, with songs like 'Hopes and Dreams/SAVE the World' and 'Battle Against a True Hero' that show a different kind of emotional connection, a kind of worried, tense, ultimately sad atmosphere that tells the player that there's something much more significant, much more poignant happening than simply fighting a battle without using any words, those songs establish the tone far better than any number of big, passionately spoken words could ever hope to accomplish.  I talk about emotion a lot throughout this review because that's where this game truly shines brightest: the emotion it has, the true beating heart it always has. As much as I hate to sound like a 'le wrong generation' fedora-asshat, a lot of games these days just don't have emotion, or at least the kind of emotion that seems to evoke others to share in that emotion. Undertale just... does. It's kind of like a child, in that it seems so perfectly innocent in its own feelings until the concept of choice is introduced. A child can be taught to love rather than hate and vice versa. A child can be taught to defy expectation, meet it, or simply be disappointing. Undertale reacts like a child would to your choices: if you react nicely and positively to characters, the game points into a nicer, kinder direction of story, while growing in maturity as everything progresses,   eventually coming to a peak with an emotionally devastating battle with an old friend at the end.   If you react cruelly and negatively, however, the game grows darker and darker, a bleakness forms within the world and yourself. Characters become afraid of you and the once-imposing idea of death becomes something so completely casual, like a child learning about the constant death happening around him. The numbness grows.  It's very difficult to accurately describe this game in simple words because it necessitates emotional investment or detachment in order to truly understand and appreciate it. It doesn't look the best, but that's incredibly irrelevant when you actually get into the story itself. The gameplay is fun and different (I'll avoid innovative because I doubt this is the first game to utilize that certain system of battle and communication) and it's deep and immersive. The story and the heart of the game is the true star here, however.   10/10:",

(This will most likely be rambly and inaccurate, please do not buy this game based off my opinion, or do, I'm powerless to stop you.)  Alright let's start with the diddly darn gameplay, your SOUL, the culmination of your being is represented as a little red cartoon heart inside a black background, white border box. To survive, you must use the arrows to avoid white 'bullets' that are created from the Monster you are fighting. The attacks can range from flames scircling you with small gaps to escape through each ring of fire, to small flies coming close, stoping, and shooting for your SOUL. Every attack is unique and has challenge to it. Frogs that jump for your soul, dogs that run at you, blue attacks that won't hurt if you don't move, orange attacks that won't hurt if you move through them, I'm never bored fighting an enemy in this game.  Now the freakin' story. It's touching, it makes you feel, no matter what ending you get, unless you're SOULless of course . . . but let's steer away from that. You make your own ending due to how you acted while Underground. The current state of the Underground is told to you througha phone call from one of the characters at the end of the game. Everyone could be alive and happy with you, or they could want you dead, it depends on what kind of person you are. This is why the game would be best played without story spoilers, as it may influence your choices.  THE MUSIC. The music in this game is exciting, mysterious, saddening, it fills you with DETERMINATION from time to time, no matter what, the chosen music seems to always fit the situation you are in. Battling agianst a true hero of the Monsters? Let's get some hot tambourine in there, some shakers and bells, feel like you're in an intense fight. On a date with a handsome skeleton friend? Let's keep it light hearted and fun, exciting and interesting. Beating the game? How about an adventureous, mysterious song playing for you, luring you back to the game?  GRAFIX. In my own, personal experience, I have not played a game with a similar art style to Undertale. I recently began watching a blind playthrough of the game Earthbound, which did look similar, but I've not   played   a game similar to this. Over (or should I say Under) world sprites gave me a good idea of all the colors and a general look of the character to get ready for the impending and unavoidable battle with the character, where, while they will not be colored for the most part, you will of course see more detail on them, which is where it all comes together for me. For example, let's say we meet a character in a purple dress. We can't exactly make out details of said article of clothing yet, but we know the coloration. And we can't seem to call out an eye color. In the impending battle with said character, we can see the detail of the dress clothing, and can now see an eye color due to the eyes being bigger and clearer. The two forms of the characters, in the Overworld and in battle both help you form an idea of what the character looks like, even if both are missing some major or minor details.  tHE cOMEDY. If you decide you want to have a good time with this game, I think it will crack you up a lot, I know made me. Before I got the game, I watched one video of the game where a scene where quite a good time was had was shown. And I could NOT stop laughing, the comedy was non stop there, and even when I played that part myself I had a similar reactions, noticing things I didn't before. Anything from a potted plant, a small chair, a 'water sausage', or a bed can produce humorus text for your reading pleasure by your generic narration text. I have a good amount of faith this game will make you laugh and have fun. Yes, it will make you cry, it will make you angry, and it will make you confused, but it will do all of those right too, and handle its comedy well when it uses it.  In conclusion, Undertale is a fun experience that I think a lot of people will enjoy, and you should certainly get it. But don't take my word for it, I was gifted the game for absolutely NO REASON from someone I just met! So I didn't spend any money and would not be aware of the fact of it being a waste of money if it was!  (Wait, this game came out in like september, I'm sure thre are like a million better reviews . . . what am I doing? Whatever. WHATEVER. WHATEVER!! This will still be good!)",

            "review_text": "So after owning Undertale for over six months I think it’s time I explained why this game is a must for gamers.   First of all a bit of backstory, when I first discovered Undertale it was though the steam queue, in what I believe was September 2015. The second I saw it, I hit “Not interested” To put simply this review will be why I regret making that decision. Over the next 3 months I would hear how Undertale is an amazing game that is worthwhile, it was special, it was different. This caused me to be cynical about it, but never the less I was interested in the idea of not having to kill anyone. After getting a few recommendations from friends as well as youtubers I watched, I got the game on the 26 of December during the steam winter sale. Undertale would then join the list of games I wish I’d bought at full price.  You may notice a lot of reviews don’t exactly give a lot of details about the game, chances are you’re like me (or what I was) thinking just how much of this, “you need to know as little as possible to truly enjoy the game” is legit. I have to say this is accurate. You will on most accounts enjoy the game more.   The characters are funny and lovable; you will likely become invested in them despite how little time is spent with them. Even those “enemies” you get a sense of personality, and who they are. To do a comparison with other games, when you came across bandit archer number 3750961 and as you fought them did you get any sense of personality, of who they are and what they want to be. No of course not, but Undertale you get exactly that.   There is a lot of thought put into this game; simple things even have a meaning. Things you would never expect, but when you do think on them you get a real sense of how much effort was put in. The website TVtropes can give you an idea, but obviously I’d say do that after finishing the game. (or done all the playthroughs)  If you are a person that gets emotional then prepare for feels, this game does get emotional. The reason Undertale has reached such high marks for me is not only cause it’s one of the few games I wish I’d got at full price, it’s one of only 5 fives, that in my current 22 year life span has ever caused me to cry. Towards the end of my own first playthrough, characters I’d have fought over the course of the game revealed a backstory story that had been slowly made aware to me over the course of the game. It hit hard, I am getting emotional remembering the whole thing, it was just that powerful, the music at the time also helped.   Of course that depends how you play the game, you might get something completely different. The game has 3 endings which are known as Pacifist, Neutral and Genocide and are based on what you’ve done throughout the game.   The music is amazing and really suites the game, with its retro style. It also helps with certain battles as you play along to the rhythm.  As for the mechanics, I’m not entirely sure how I’d describe it but the closest I would say it comes to is bullet hell, with a mix of the impossible game for some battles. Each one is different and suites those you are battling. It’s one thing to say they are easy to learn but boy can it be hard to master them. In fact the mechanics are one of the few legitimate complaints I see people making about the game (they didn’t like it cause of the battle mechanics) so a bit of a warning there for people.  Hopefully my review has helped you make a decision on if to get this game, I definitely recommend it (duh). There is more I could say but that would be revealing possibly too much.",

The music is phenomenal. Absolutely immersing and emotionally driving. The characters are extremely lovable, and all are quirky in their own ways; when I 'finished' the game I felt like these guys were my family. The gameplay is really engaging and unique, a huge step up from games like Earthbound. The combat system never grew old as the further the game progressed the more unique elements were. The story was heart wrenching, and I cried quite a few times. The humor was a nice layer on top of the deep story and lore and i constantly cracked up when I played this. This is more than just a videogame. This is a story. An experience. One that I hope anyone would pay for just to enjoy. Please, buy this game, you won't regret it. And if you do... Well than I guess you didn't have enough.... DETERMINATION!",

He made a game that's probably a 7 or 8. The reason it has the popularity it does isn't because of particularly well-written characters or a highly compelling story, or even a few experimental ideas. No, UNDERTALE is great because of what it is compared to everything else around it. The ideas it has are pretty small, the GAME is pretty small, and yet those flourishes stand out amongst the frankly grey and brown world of the games that surround it.  Most people write reviews like this for the game and that should be telling. It's a mediocre niche-RPG with more heart than any game you've ever played and it might just challenge not just how you look at games, but the world around you. Personally I came to regret the monsters I killed as I realized it's less a world of monsters attacking me and more a case of me invading their homes. I wanted those deaths to disappear from my record, but they never did. And I completed the game with an interesting feeling: guilt. I didn't know! It wasn't on purpose! Yet, why should anyone forgive me? Some did, others did not. What an interesting, interesting, interesting game.  That's why people recommend it, that's what makes it fun and if nothing else, when you finish UNDERTALE you will have thoughts on it and that's why it deserves a recommendation.",

As I played it, I was purposely trying to make it seem like every other rpg (puzzles, dungeons, boss fights, etc). However, part way through the game, I realized that this isn't just 'another rpg', and that it is truly unique. people may complain about the nes-style graphics, but combined with the witty humor, loveable characters, and mind-blowing chiptune, you get; Undertale.   Pros: -Engaging storyline -Loveable/Relatable characters -FRIGGIN AWESOME MUSIC -Say goodbye to that fourth wall folks -Skeleton/Fish/Dinosaur dating simulator  Cons: -From what I can tell, was made in Gamemaker -Killing people may make you feel bad (is that actually a bad thing though?) -Current state of fandom: Desperate Cancer  Misc: -ALL OF THE DECISIONS COUNT DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA ABOUT THE FOURTH WALL NOT EXISTING.  10/10 would date a skeleton again  p.s, this review was written sept. 14th, and the 15th is Undertale's first anniversary.

            "review_text": "Absolutely incredible! My favourite video game! My favourite aspect of the game is the soundtrack. It is so well thought out and I find myself humming tracks such as Heartache, Megalovania and Battle against a true hero on a regular basis. The battling style is rare, entertaining and at the same time challenging. Each character has their own unique style that is relevant to their character traits. The designs of the monsters of the underground are so varied and beautiful and each one gives the story a little special something. For example the Skelebros Sans and Papyrus give the game a light-hearted and comedic feel where as characters such as Asgore add drama and emotions to the story. Even less important characters such as Naptablook, Mad Dummy and my personal favourite, Muffet add things to the gameand it just wouldn't feel the same without them. Another thing I love about the game is how the ending is different based on the choices you make throughout the run. Overall I must say that Undertale can give you a challenge, make you laugh and tug at your heart strings all at the same time. The playthrough time can be around 4-8 hours long depending on how long the player spends in each key location. This allows the player to try out different options and endings. I would strongly recommend it to everyone of all ages and genders. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Undertale and despite the fact it was mostly spoiled for me by the internet, I felt multiple emotions whilst playing.",

I tried to resist raving about the game but I just couldn't because I ended up loving this game so much. I am with the hype!  The first few moments alone gave me that nostalgic feel to a game that I haven't quite felt since the PS1 days. As much as other games out there try to capture that retro vibe, Undertale went an extra mile and I would say it's all how it plays out at the start. A gameplay style that you wouldn't see everyday, an engaging storyline, lovable and memorable characters and one hell of a soundtrack which all together make this a game you simply cannot ignore. Months after I played through the whole of this game, I am still buzzing about it and even still listen to the soundtrack loads.  Whether you love it or hate it, one has to admit that Undertale has established itself as a game and made itself stood out of the crowd. This to me is the game the industry needs. For those that have yet to play it, I say go for it and see for yourself what the fuss is all about.",

            "review_text": "When I first saw Undertale, I looked at the store page and wasn't interested. Months later, I'd heard the odd mention of Undertale and had no idea what it was. When I checked it out on Steam, I was surprised to see the little game I had previously ignored. It was cheap so I bought it. I then thoroughly enjoyed the game. Another draw was that there are few system requirements so I can play it on my old netbook and my new PC.  I find Undertale to be an excellent game but it won't be for everyone. If you have the money, then I suggest buying it and simply trying it out. If you don't want to keep it after the first hour of play, then get a refund. If you're willing to try it though I don't think you'll refund it. The only real suggestion I have is to play it on your own without spoilers or a walkthrough. I decided to use a walkthrough on my first run and regret it. I missed out on a lot of excitement and the ability to immerse myself in the game. Mind you, I still love Undertale, but I realize that I would've gotten more out of it if I'd worked through it. So please try to play without help if you can, you won't regret it.    Music:  The music is very good and works to enhance the atmosphere of the game. Some of the music uses a similar melody but with very different takes on it. It reminded me of Yoshi's Story since did something similar. Since I loved Yoshi's Story I'll admit my opinion is biased, it keeps the main theme from becoming monotonous when it plays.   Graphics:  The pixel art is simple, but quickly grows on you. It also serves a purpose. It's easier to look at the pixel art characters and see little pieces of yourself or others in them, especially in a game with an in-depth story and plenty of character development.   Story:  The story is written well and offers many options. Actions may or may not have consequences and you may not see them right away. Even little things can affect the ending, things you may have forgotten that you said or did. What I'm trying to say is that a lot of thought and work was put into the game's story, so you don't mind that it's story-driven. Mind you, if you want to use a shoot and loot mentaltality, there's an option for that too. In the end no one is left out.    Overall:  I really enjoyed Undertale. While not my favourite game it's certainly up there. It's a game I can and do come back to once in a while. In my opinion, it earned the success it currently enjoys. It's a game that breaks the mold and isn't afraid to do something different. It may be a while before we see something similar happen. Especially since you could say Undertale created a new genre. It's difficult to say all the interesting things about this game since saying much of anything could spoil it. So all I can do is suggest again that you try it.",

Life is not about killing. People, whether real or virtual, mean something. They have feelings. They think. They love. They care. They hate. Monsters aren't actually monstrous. They're just beings of pure love that are forced to fight by corrupt humans. Until a human of pure love saves them.

            "review_text": "It is incredibly hard to go into what exactly it is about this game that makes it so special, without giving too much away, which is one of the reasons why one should go into this game completely blind.  Synopsis: The game takes place in a world inhabited by humans and monsters, the latter of whom were sealed underground, or more specifically, underneath a mountain, after a war to see who would rule the surface. Years later, in the year 201X, a young human climbs the mountain, called Mt. Ebott, and falls down a hole into the Underground.  The reason it is so hard to review this game is largely because, if you go into it blind, your first experience will likely be one unique to you and only you. This game gives almost all control to the player, and only occasionally interrupts for brief moments when something scripted needs to happen. You have control over just about everything, including how fights go. The game is heavily dependent on the choices you make as the player, and as such, gives you two options that are unique to this title: ACT, in which you are able to choose how you react to a fight, and MERCY, which allows you to spare an enemy once certain conditions are met, or, in some cases, just straight up run away.  You do still have the typical RPG option of fighting, but the game discourages you, dare I say even calls you out for, fighting and killing enemies. This game treats enemy deaths uniquely compared to just about every other RPG I've played: when an enemy is dead, they stay dead. For keeps. Sure, you can always reset, but the game isn't going to let you forget that easily, and will constantly bring back your sins to haunt you in one way or another.  This game also understands the concept of Karma fairly well, as while the bosses and enemies are difficult even in a run in which you don't kill a single thing, they are absolutely nothing in comparison to what's waiting for you if you decide to kill everything.  In addition to ACT and MERCY, this game's mechanics are highly unique to an RPG of it's kind: battles are fought in a bullet-hell type of scenario, in which you control your 'soul' within a small window box and are forced to avoid enemy attacks. This allows for gameplay in which you absolutely NEED to be involved, you can't just press 'Attack' or 'Guard' and expect to just sit back as the game does it for you.  Game mechanics aside, this is probably one of the most beautifully-written stories to have come out in the last decade, dare I say in gaming history. It isn't as simple as 'save a princess', and it's not nearly as complex as 'a demon god from the future wants to destroy the past because backstory'. It leaves a lot to inference and imagination, without ever sacrificing detail or necessary information, and, depending on the path you take, could either be heart-wrenchingly bittersweet, or an emotionally-destructive rollercoaster of numbness.  The characters, too, are some of the most well-written, three-dimensional, emotionally-invested characters I have ever seen in a game. They can be either friend or foe, depending on your choices, but no matter which one they are, they will elicit some kind of emotional response from you.  The music is absolutely stunning, written and composed by Toby Fox, the creator of the game, as well as the creator of the Earthbound Halloween Hack, which this game appears to borrow some ideas from. It consists largely of leitmotifs, and each track is played at just the right moment to elicit a desired response. Probably my favorite track in terms of timing is 'Undertale', a song that plays towards the end of a 'neutral' run. By this point, there is no turning back, and all you can do is march forward to face the final boss of the main game, and the song fits the moment perfectly as realization after realization strikes you right in the face and doesn't let up for even a second, leading up to one of the best and most-well-built-up-to scenes in the entire game, dare I say in the history of games.  Undertale is, at it's a core, a deconstruction of Role-Playing Games, if not games in general, and by the time you have finished it, or at least, finished it as far as you are willing to, it will have reshaped how games appear in your eyes. It will make you question not only how games will learn and improve from this title, but it will force you to look at yourself and do some serious personal reflecting.  That being said, nothing is without it's flaws, and while I can personally look past them, I should at least mention that they are present. The characters, as well-written as they are, may get a little grating to certain people. The music as well ranges from brilliant to good, and the good tracks may not be everyone's cup of tea. This game is also one that is mainly for fans of retro JRPGs, such as Earthbound or Final Fantasy, and people who don't like RPGs (or bullet-hells, for that matter) may not find as much value in it as someone who does.  Undertale, to me, is perfect, not in the sense that it has no flaws, but more in the same sense that Tetris is perfect: There are very few ways in which it screws up, and when it does screw up, it is mostly based around the player's personal opinion.  9.9/10",

In my opinion this games best three aspects are: the story, the gameplay and the music. The fact that you can spare enemys is genius! As in all RPG'S you have to kill everything. It is amazing game design. Now, the one part of the game you can spoil, is the music. If you listen to the songs i'm about to list you will see what I'mtalking about with the music: Megolovania, Spider Dance, Hopes and Dreams and Asgore.

The soundtrack is different and very well made. The fight mechanic is very unique, however, exposition - particularly when in a battle with boss monsters - can drag the fight out for far too long, which becomes very frustrating, escpecially if you're having difficulty.

All of the other characters in Snowdin are barely rememberable, again, only being slightly rememborable is their appearence. Unlike in other good rpgs, is that Undertale dosen't give you that mych time wih the characters, onky giving you time once you beat the final boss. Another point about this game that's 'so rememberable and good' is the fact that the point of the game is to make friends and spare every moster, and if you don't play it the way the game wants you to, you will get bashed. If Iwanted to make friends, I wouldn't make NPC's from an RPG them for sure.all of the areas are quite unrememberable, and like the characters, they all have a counterpart in mother or earthbound. The fighting is probably the most redeeming quality of the whole thing. The whole gist of the 'fighting' minigames' where you have to withstand a certain amount of time to get back to the menue, and spare the monster, and each boss fight puts their own little twist on it. Another one of the very few good thing about the game is the muic, being some of the best i've heard in an indie game. One last note, something that really isnt about the game, but the communiy is utter garbage. Constant shippings, NSFW art, and just overall nasty art of some of your favorite 'characters'. Overall, if you want a good RPG, just get Earthbound or one of the Mother games.",

Immediately marked it as not interested. Month or so later, I pick it up because my friends are all talking about how great it is and telling me I should play it.  My first impression could not have been farther from the reality. While yes, Undertale does have somewhat of an underlying message about how violence isn't the answer, it manages to be a deep, engaging, funny RPG with great gameplay that deviates from the standard RPG formula in ways that actually make your skill matter more than the amount of time you've invested in the game. The characters are very well thought out, the story is well realized. I really have nothing bad to say about Undertale. It's one of the best games I've ever played, I just wish I could experience it blindly again.   shame the true reset doesn't reset the player's memories of the game  ",

Follow your character, through the underground ruins and work on challenging puzzles, making friends, petting dogs, and working on your choices to either impact or destroy this beautiful world. A great game that I will play over and over again.  Hoi this is one treasure that you will need to play again and again and having a 'bone' of a time.   10/10 would pun again as well as pet dogs and other stuff.",

The charecters are very well developed they all have a great personallity, I love the plot line of the story it is very well done. Nothing about this game is boring this game is the most amazing games I have played. This is better than Portal 2 and they game is Fantastic. But this is the best game that ever happend to steam. The fact that this is like Toby Fox's first game is amazing because your first games are ussualy okay. Also there are multiple types of ways you can play this game. There is Neutral run where you kill some monsters and spare some monsters at the same time. There is True Pasifist, in this gamemode you can not kill anything, not even a dummy. The last gamemode is True Genoside, or called No Mercy Run. In this one you have to kill every single creature in each region if anything is left it wont be the genoside run. Every one does not reccomend that as your first run because you are not completly sure about the combat and where all of the monsters are going to pop up from. In order I reccomend you do Neutral, Pasifist, then Genoside because there are a lot of things in genoside you wont get. It is kind of like Harry Potter books if you read the first book and then read the 4th after you wont get anything that happend In between. There are a lot of parts you wont get if you do genoside 1st or second. This game is just truly fantastic and I cant even exspress how good this game is. I got it like 2 days ago and I cant stop playing it once you start you cannot stop. I give this game 10/10. If you have been thinking I shouldn't get this it will be a waste of money... You are completley wrong You need this game not kidding you will love every second you play this game is just the best thing ever and If I had the choice between Undertale and every game on steam execpt undertale, I would pick undertale. That is how much i love It. I haven't stopped playing it and I am not going to stop playing It, ITS TO DIFFUCULT TO STOP. Now after you read my 5 minutes worth of reading just scroll up and press add to cart. :)  Ok a while after this review I have almost beaten this so let me give a new update on it. You think this is a fantastic game in the beggining. The rest of the game is fantastic, and the amount of effect your choices do on the word is cool. My favorite boss is definently Undyne. Undyne is one of the best charecters in the game. But the other charecters are quite fantastic. You really cant have a favorite charecter they are all amazing. I just love the story line of the game. You always thought a game couldn't make you cry, killing a charecter just hits you right in the feels. Please try this game.",

It isn't as extreme as everyone says it is, but hey, it's better than the FNaF plot. If you're willing to play an RPG based around the Mother series with bullet hell fighting mechanics, then go and buy the game. Just don't expect the game to be too long, though. It's actually pretty short.  Notice how in the first paragraph that I said it's okay and I didn't say I love it with all my will and might and want to marry it. This is because the game can sometimes go at it's own pace, which is usually very slow. For example, in the 'final level', you're greeted with a bunch of monsters that don't attack you, they just say stuff that goes more into detail about the Undertale plot. This is all good and swell but you can't skip this. So you're just gonna be walking up to the castle when a bunch of monsters show up and make you want to die.

            "review_text": "If you caught this review with your eye, please don't scroll anymore further. I need you to read this. I regret not creating a review earlier when Undertale was one of the hottest games on Steam. It still is a hot game to this day, and this review will convince you that the fact is true. Undertale is your classic 16-Bit RPG that every gamer knows about whether they are young/old or inexperienced/experienced in gaming. When I say that it's a game that every gamer knows about, I mean that the game has the same aspects a classic RPG would have such as having to choose a decision during a conversation with an NPC. The fighting style is also similar to all classic RPGs. You have numerous boxes that say 'FIGHT.' 'ACT,' and what not. I'm not going any further into those aspects as it would drive the topic of this review astray. Now what if I told you that although Undertale seems like another one of those RPGs where you grind and move on, it will be one of the most unique games you have ever played. Now look at the store page of the game, and read the description of the game. It says, 'UNDERTALE! The RPG game where you DON'T have to destroy anyone.' Don't take that description lightly because every single choice you make in the game will drastically affect the future of your progression route. Every monster that you kill, every monster that you don't kill, and everything you say to NPCs. Those are the three main choices you'll make throughout the game that I can remember. Anyway, all those choices will decide the fate of the Underground, which is the place you're trying to get out of. It will even decide the fate of your character and the whole world. You're probably wondering how that's possible. You'll see soon enough... Now let's conclude the review with this: Undertale is a game that takes you on an emotional/comedic rollercoaster. Your ultimate goal is to escape the underground, but the real question is: how will you do it? Let me give you a little hint: think of these monsters as actual people with feelings. Don't want to do that? Well then, you're going to have a bad time.",

The graphics were crappy, it looked really simplistic... i just didn't want to play it. After buying it and playing it, im pretty sure all of that has changed. This game is a ton of fun to play and is kind of artisitic in the fact that nobody has to die. Although that battles can get frequent, the battles were still fun.There are a ton of secrets and jokes lying around for you to discover, including a library of just plain terrible puns. All the characters you encounter you will remember for some time, each with a distinct personality. And the music... OH THE MUSIC... Although that plenty of it is 16 bit, its still a delight to listen to. In fact, while i was writing this, i was listening to the soundtrack through the Steam Browser. I have nothing but positives for this game, aside from the fandom... oh dear god did something go wrong there. Careful, this game is easily spoiled... But aside from that, GET THIS GAME.

            "review_text": "I fully expected not to enjoy this game.  Firstly, I wasn't a fan of the art style. The main character wasn't very detailed, the battle screen looked boring. But then I'm exploring a dark area that's lit up by glowing blue crystals and flowers, or I'm walking as a silhouette against a overlook of a faraway fortress that I think, 'oh that's clever.' The simple battle screen begins to crumble or change depending on the character I'm up against, and again I'm thinking, 'oh, that's clever.'  Secondly, I didn't think the battle system would be fun. I thought it was another turn based battle system. Nope, you control a little heart and avoid all kinds of ridiculous objects being thrown at you from every direction. It's always something new, and often correlates to that character or the current story. So again I'm thinking, 'oh, that's clever.'  The game starts out with some simple puzzles, but eventually they get much more clever.  Eventually, I realize I've seen so many clever things in the game, that Undertale really is a clever, well designed game; an experience worth having. No single concept is entirely new, but all of the concepts are put together so perfectly that it weaves together a great game.  So, the gameplay is worth it after all, but that's not really what it's lauded for. The story is a focal point, or so I hear.  Sure, the story is well written. You get some choices along the way as you discover yet another tale about humans versus monsters. But I don't think that is what really sets this game apart: it's the characters. They are mostly monsters, but they feel so very human-like, with their dialogue, their personalities, their faces, their mannerisms, their homes... that it puts weight to the story that makes it much more meaningful. You can hang out with a ghost who invites you into his home to just sit on the floor and imagine the stars in space... JUST BECAUSE. It doesn't affect the main story, but it affects your perception of the world of Undertale - it makes it more real. You feel a connection to the monster who tells you his latest pun-filled joke. You feel something for the monster who just wants to call to talk.  The game is not very long, although it warrants another playthrough or two. But it's an experience worth having. And it is oh so clever.",

No. Even that is not enough. Even exorcising the game completely from my computer is only just enough to purge the smallest of sins. I found the humor highly enjoyable and I love games that make you think. This is, in that aspect, a masterpiece; I find it especially impressive so much is hidden in so little space.  Buy this game. It is amazing. Probably don't do the genocide route unless there's a mote of evil or more in your soul that compels you; mere completionism is not excuse enough. Be prepared to pay for the sin of genocide forever.  But seriously why wasn't 'how many dogs are there' one of Mettaton's questions? This may haunt me even more than my murders.",

            "review_text": "I don't even know what to say here. Words can't seem to describe how much I adore Undertale. The game begins like any other. You're given a bit of backstory, you wake up as your player character, and you begin exploring the world. But oh, god, this is not your everyday RPG. Undertale has stayed with me emotionally and mentally even after I have finished it. It's unlike any other game I've ever played. The characters are all so well-developed--you really, really get to know every part of these people. They might not be 'humans', but they feel human. The characters alone are more than enough to drive this game. Then there's the multiple endings facet. This game allows you to make choices about who you are, about what's going to happen to you. I'm a sucker for choice-driven games, but this one gets so meta that it feels like the characters themselves are watching you; like they know who you are and what you're doing. Some speak directly to the player. In this world, it's kill or be killed--or is it? You have to decide what's right here. You are the one who decides if you'll try to save everybody, or if you'll destroy everything in your path. And if you regret your decision and decide to reset and re-play? It doesn't matter. The game doesn't take kindly to forgetting what you've done, good or bad. Don't go into this game thinking it's going to be a lighthearted kiddie game. Depending on what you decide to do, it can get very dark, very quickly. It can be an RPG with a good, lighthearted ending, or it can become the stuff of nightmares. The soundtrack is phenomenal. I listen to the music almost every day! It does a fantastic job at setting the mood for the game, and the melodies are catchy and help you to get to know the characters and setting. I also happen to love the game's humor. The puns, the dry humor, the things that don't seem funny at first but are funny upon closer inspection...It's one of those rare games that delves into 'actually really f*cking funny' territory. But don't get caught up in the laughs--it's a serious game with a storyline that can be heartwarming or heartbreaking. It'll leave anybody filled with determination.  Rating: 10/10. Would recommend.",

            "review_text": "When I heard there was an RPG inspired by Earthbound I had to see what the excitement was all about. Earthbound is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, so to heard that someone made a game that rivals that level of quality was worth raising eyebrows. To my surprise, this game took a completely different turn than I expected. Here I was think this game would be a carbon-copy of an already well-known Nintendo title, but there's more to looks than meets the eye. Undertale is a story-driven RPG where a genderless child must travel through an underground world filled with monsters of all kinds in hopes of returning to their home back on the surface. Here the character encounters a goat lady, a talking flower, an a pair of goofy skeletons. One of this game's strongest assets is its characters and dialogue. Despite having a genderless character be the protagonist and a mute, the side characters are what steal the show. The moment that shorter skeleton, Sans, appear I knew this was going to be a very enjoyable game. This, however, is not all comedy-based as there are some very tender and heart-wrenching moments that makes makes the player feel all that more important to the story. The music is also really impressive. Some of it sports 8-bit synthesizers, rag-time jazz, and metal. This game has a lot of spirit when it come to intereacting with characters, which the game over screen telling you repeatedly to 'Stay Determined.' Oddly enough, the battle system is what intrigued me the most as the game gives you the opportinity to 'Fight' or 'Spare.' Unlike games such as The Walking Dead, where some events can change the story internally, this game goes above and beyond and makes the entire game effected by every decision made by the player in determining how many enemies you choose to fight. When the goat lady told me to 'strike up a friendly conversation' I was afraid that this will would be a trap and get me killed for now knowing better, but after I killed the first enemy the game made me feel bad for that decision, and believe me, this game will continue to torment you by giving reminders or your mistakes. Despite this game's somewhat disturbing message about humanity, it does well in providing you with enough information about the world you explore and intereact as you solve puzzles to return home. For some reason it says I've barely played for two hours, but nevermind that because I've played this game offline for far longer than it says so. This game's art style does show resemblence to that of Earthbound, and the battles always remind me of its predecessor, Earthbound Beginnings (NES). Overall, this game is one big emotional roller coaster that will keep you wondering. For a game that drew inspiration from a Super Nintendo RPG classic, it's no wonder this game got as much popularity as it does now.",

Undertale is a revolutionary game that reminded me why I love video games so much, the rich story, secrets, mysteries, character development and soundtrack are absolutely phenomenal. There is also the fact that the game takes lots of inspiration from the game Earthbound without being a blatant copy of the game. Undertale takes the cake as my favorite game. The lore in this game is incredibly deep and amazingly ungeneric. It is full of surprises and feels, funny characters and doggos. Lots of doggos. much doggo more doggo And even after a year of the game being released, people have still not solved some of the mysteries in this game, which was buried by other mysteries and more lore! The characters are also all glowing with personality, secrets, problems and ambition. The main story from all three routes tie together with many other branches of story and lore, and digging deeper into the story is so addictive. The gameplay itself is awesome. You'll have to play it to find the bullet-hell/RPG gameplay style. the soundtrack is phenominal. 'Nuff said. THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME GET IT ALREADY DAMMIT ",

I liked Sans and Papyrus, but I didn't really like any of the other characters. Sometimes the writing was really good and other times it felt like it was being written by my mom. I didnt really like the art style, and before you say anything it's not because it's pixel art, it's because it seems really boring and uninspired. But I do however like the character designs. The soundtrack is amazing even though it can't decide whether it wants to be 8-bit or not. And last of all the final boss is amazing, never before have I felt so powerless, helpless and more mind-♥♥♥♥ed. Honestly it might be one of my favorite final bosses ever.

The characters are ripe with personality like Papyrus, the wacky skeleton who wants to be popular, Or toriel, The caring motherly character who loves you and will care for you.

Some of the scenes are heartbreaking and emotional such as the date with alphys. Later on, the game deals with some difficult subjects like homosexualality (is that how you spell it?) and depression.

It's something that helped me a lot throughout my latest breakdown, and what really cheered me up when nothing else could. Undertale is a tale about LOVE, EXPeriences and DETERMINATION. What do you put into these words is your choice. It's also about you and who you are. About who you decide to be and deciding wether you want to be a player of the game – or a person. Do you seek all the choices that game shows you, or abandon this cause so you wouldn't do bad choices? Do you help everyone and with that help yourself, or you abandon all hope and choose NO MERCY? That's all on your conscience.  This masterpiece, unlike a giant portion of the fandom, is something that teaches us not about making FIGHTS, but about moments when we should ACT, and show MERCY, and how sometimes it's okay to FLEE and HEAL yourself.  I never gained LOVE, but I gained love. And I learned how to be better. That I am better than I think I am. And I am so happy that the people that made this game for me and MILLIONS of other people, and characters that were in Undertale, did everything in their power to show us a wonderful story and HELP all of us.

The core gameplay is surprisingly fun, and your interaction with the world leaves a far greater impact than anything that I've ever seen in a video game.  If you know nothing about Undertale, turn off the internet for a while (especially from the cancerous fanbase), sit down for a couple of afternoons, and enjoy the show.",

I went in blind in this game, and while I had to look up certain boss fights later on the web (just to be sure of my approach), played the rest of the game without consulting the interwebs.  No doubt, the game (the maker actually) is very smart and ingenious. The game levels and design are excellent. Despite the boss fights seemingly daunting, the game encourages and facilitates the player to win- that part's very well thought out.  And yet, I thought the game did have some major flaws, the primary one being the confusion for the player between killing and defeating. At one point, to my dismay, I killed a character I had definitely not been wanting to, and just the exploration and experimentation while grasping the cryptic nature of conversations led to it. Having gone in blind, there was no way for me to know if there were other endings possible to this particular chapter where the character does not die. Neither was the player offered a choice to spare or not, in this instance. At another point in the game, I was stuck for a while for just the opposite reason. When it turned out (courtesy interwebs) that fighting was the only way out.  The second minor quibble I have is I have no idea about dogs and items related to them. There are some more similar quirks in the game.  Third, the controller thumb stick did not feel reliably responsive during gameplay.  Four, poorly worded questions like 'will you take this item' from a certain setting. When playing a game where ethics matter, one won't just pick up stuff without asking, that could be valuable to them. But the game will punish player if (s)he doesn't.  TL:DR version: The game makers did not clearly differentiate between defeating and killing an adversary. For a game of such refined sensibility, I consider this a big oversight. A 9/10 from me otherwise. A charming, quirky, unusual game. It's heart is in the right place and it deserves applause for it.",

You really won't be disappointed with Undertale, and at only $10 or less this game is a treasure.",

Not a bad thing, especially for people that played RPG's back in the 90's) -The game is very short for an RPG. I would consider this game an experience before a full RPG. -You    might need to 'continue a new adventure' if you want the true ending, if you really care for another go.    -Stay out of the fandom, it's overwhelming.(nothing to do with the game, but a great tip LOL)  Other than that, totally recommend it.

The story is pretty great, and it actually has some choice and speculation allowed. It also makes some of the best characters I've ever met, all of whom I have a deep connection with. Also look at the music. I love it, not just because it's great music, but because of the amazing stories it tells. Each song has its meaning, and it's part of what makes this game great, not to mention how the songs intertwine, showing the character connections and emotions, becoming part of the scenes and zones. People are talking about how it will die out and fade away, but I personally think that they just don't like what the game stands for or what they heard, because the game is so beautifully crafted that there is no possible way that the game's leaving public eye for a while. Try it. Might not be your cup of tea(or bowl of spaghetti) if you don't enjoy heavily story based work, but, who knows.  (its pretty great)",

Put quite simply, this is one of those must-play games. Beautifully crafted characters, solid game mechanics and a storyline that makes you question the things we take for granted are all doused in a gorgeous soundtrack that perfectly manipultes your emotions.  It's equal parts homage to, invention on and interrogation of classic RPGs. Don't let the bullet-hell-esque gameplay put you off - it's challenging enough to be fun for everyone without being overly difficult (unless you choose to make it so) and is varied up enough to stay fresh without huge increases in difficulty.  I won't say much more about it, because Undertale really is best enjoyed blind. If you dig the Mother series, classic RPGs or, like me, have a penchant for subversive media in general, Undertale is a beautiful experience you won't soon forget.",

There is SOOOOO much complex story in this game, from the first human Chara and her in general to Asriel (Flowey) and her backstory, this game is FULL of it. The Combat in this game is also really unique. You to move your SOUL and you can MERCY or FIGHT.

Heartwrenching storytelling that doesn't forsake being an actual game, like a visual novel might (no those aren't games). Where Spec Ops has proper combat and ammo count and the like, while having a nice story, Undertale has proper bullet hell fights and resource management.

This man is called Toby Fox. Toby Fox began with a question, a question that ruptured the very fabric of RPGs. 'What if there was a RPG,' Toby thought, 'that allowed you not to hurt a soul?' Then it was built up, through code and thought. Think of it as a child, they could be innocent but also become vile, like a bully. This 'child' was Undertale. Undertale is a RPG where you don't have to be a hunter and a deer trying to live it's life. Like a hunter, they try to kill the deer, but maybe you thought the hunter would leave the deer alone. Think of yourself as a hunter, hunting different deer, and you're guided by Undertale. Undertale, as a child, would say that you should leave the deer alone. That is your choice, you may think, but it's a child. Let me ask you personally, would you kill the deer or will you listen to Undertale and give in to the innocent child's nature? I think I mostly hear you claiming to spare the deer, I mean, think of it's characteristics. It's peaceful, and you shouldn't bother it. That's just an example, and it's not over. In Undertale, you meet a variety of characters, and the first two you meet are clear definitions. You know who I'm talking about. Sans and Papyrus are skeletons, and they're brothers. Papyrus is a fun, spaghetti-loving fan favorite. Sans is a fan favorite too, and if you dare go bad but spare him, well, he prefers his Dunkin Donuts with a little sweet flavor. Although if you're going to bag the deer, you shouldn't forget how funny Sans is. Really, Sans seems to be a little COMICal, right?   (Nobody got that joke)  . Sans also has a knack for helping his brother out with puzzles, and he thinks his brother is cool. Whether or not he thinks Papyrus is cool, you can't forget how Papyrus constantly fails but constantly tries to get you captured from his puzzling traps. However, these characters can die if you decide to paint yourself red and get all HORN-y. Now, I believe I'm finished with characters, BUT we're just getting started on the book. So, to briefly describe the game's story without spoilers, I think this will be legit. So after a war between the locked-up monsters and the victorious hoomans, a child with a name falls and meets different characters from Flowey to the King. The child decides to go evil/good by sparing/killing monsters which is fun. Then after some funtime, the child makes it to the surface after facing some bosses. END!!! Now that you heard that, let me tell you Undertale's overall. Undertale is one of those games that will be remembered throughout time, and that's why I nominated it for the 'Most Heartwarming Game' Award during the Steam Award Nominations. What I ask of you, if you enjoyed the game, is to also nominate it for 'Most Heartwarming Game'. If you don't, then that's your choice. Think of this as a favor between fellow strangers on the internet united by god-like Undertale over here. Also, if you agree with this entire review, comment any Sans pun down below. I bet you, these puns will sure be a PUN-ch to the FUNNY BONE.   I bet I'm unfunny ;-;  ",

The child decides to go evil/good by sparing/killing monsters which is fun. Then after some funtime, the child makes it to the surface after facing some bosses. END!!! Now that you heard that, let me tell you Undertale's overall. Undertale is one of those games that will be remembered throughout time, and that's why I nominated it for the 'Most Heartwarming Game' Award during the Steam Award Nominations. What I ask of you, if you enjoyed the game, is to also nominate it for 'Most Heartwarming Game'. If you don't, then that's your choice. Think of this as a favor between fellow strangers on the internet united by god-like Undertale over here. Also, if you agree with this entire review, comment any Sans pun down below. I bet you, these puns will sure be a PUN-ch to the FUNNY BONE.   I bet I'm unfunny ;-;  ",

It took the typical and boring turn-based RPG combat and turned it into something interesting and interactive, with new mechanics to keep the fights fresh. I would definitely recommend this game, even if the 'fandom' can seem off-putting to most.",

I will have to say that it was and still is my favourite game but perhaps you might want to play it on your own first before reading any of the analysis on this page since reading many of the negative votes for this game, most of them liked it but decided to downvote it due to it not being as good as other peoples' opinions led them to believe.  My recommendation is buy this game as you would any other RPG (or storybased, since it's more heavy on that side) and experience it for yourself with as little side-knowledge as you can to avoid spoilers. Only one slight problem I will explain, there's only one save slot and the three different routes for the game can easily be scratched out if you do something wrong so, if you don't want to screw up keep reading; if you want to experience this game entirely by yourself stop here.  ====================================================================================    For the neutral route you don't have to worry because you're most likely gonna get it naturally.       For the 'true ending' spare all characters and befriend all main characters.      For the 'bad ending' (and a whole different atmosphere throughout the whole game) kill every monster that pops up until the screen - But nobody came. - shows up.  ",

The gameplay is awesome, the characters are fun and have a real effect on the player. The music is to die for!  This game is the full package, feels, comical moments, great gameplay, and oh... did I forget to mention that there are 3 DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY THE GAME? And so many endings, it keeps making you go back for more!  The main paths are Neutral, True Pacifist, and the cold, dark, GENOCIDE.  Neutral is where you kill or don't kill, or do both. This path has the most endings and those endings depend on your actions throughout Neutral.  After you've done Neutral, you can play True Pacifist. To complete this path you must have Mercy on every enemy you encounter. And you have to befriend most of the main cast. There's lots of work to be done to have success on this playthrough but it's all worth it in the end.  Then, there's Genocide. You can play this at any time in the game, but I reccommend playing True Pacifist before this one. You must kill every enemy, not just the ones you accidentally run into, but you must search them out and destroy them until nobody is left.  Then there are secrets in the game, whether it be hidden rooms you must hack the game to find, secrets in the game's music tracks, or crazy new enemies, they will always be a thrill to find.  Undertale is a very unique game, I would reccommend to everybody who wants some challenge, fun, laughs, or tears. 10/10. Toby Fox made one hell of a game. :)",

Learning more about it and pondering is quite the experience, but in order to even get to said experience, one must be able to enjoy Undertale's humor. Despite the game's darker elements, for the vast majority of the game, you are going to be spending your time interacting with the game's countless characters who are all nothing short of wacky and surreal. If this type of humor does not appeal to you, then it's really difficult to enjoy everything else Undertale's story has to offer, due to how prevalent the bizzare nature is. If you do enjoy it, or at least don't mind it, then you will more than likely enjoy Undertale's story.  Despite the game being a deconstruction of RPGs, this is not gameplay that I can consider to be that of an RPG. I'm not talking about the interaction with townspeople or item management. I'm talking about the core battle mechanics, which are clearly those of a bullet hell game instead of a role-playing game. Yes, you still have a menu with your typical RPG commands, but those don't really mean much when regardless of what you choose, the name of the game is to dodge obstacles. There will be bosses that put your skills to the test, but as the fight starts, the attacks that are used are rather slow, allowing the player to get used to how the fight works before it decides to speed things up. I think it's brilliant. There are very few attacks in the game that I would deem cheap, and the boss fights manage to spice things up so it does not feel like you're doing the same thing with every fight. I had 0 bullet hell experience prior to Undertale, but I still had a mostly comfortable ride. I did die several times on my first playthrough, but it was never frustrating.  All in all, fantastic game...assuming the style of humor appeals to you.",

CONS:  -The battle system is bland. You just press a button, and time it right to hit the target... thats it. Toby Fox most likely meant for you not to fight at all but ACTing still is pretty boring. The gameplay in general is pretty bland for an rpg.  -The locations just felt... random I suppose? These play just felt... dumb. The places you travel to are dumb I mean.  -Some of the 'fans' are pure and utter cancer. I don't understand how kids got into this kind of game. Aren't you kids suppose to be playing Call of Duty and saying you fondled my mother and screaming like a baby?  -The game has no problem telling you 'You are an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for killing us' if you go down the Genocide route. I get it. Thats the point but I know that what I'm doing is wrong so I will pay the consequences later ok game? The game then says 'Oh yes you will.

            "review_text": "This game has the best ideas behind it, and I really appreciate that Toby Fox is a better storyteller than Hussie.   !! SPOILERS !!   What's interesting is that pretty much every character is written as a character. Except Flowey, who's written as if it was also a player, just like you.  Papyrus is a failure that is lying to himself. He doesn't do anything else except putting you in the friend-zone. (seriously Pap', the only accurate thing you say in the entire game is 'I don't really love you'. That's awful.)   Undyne is clearly a violent but naive royal guard .  And that is because Alphys is also a weeaboo that is lying to herself and everybody else too.  Mettaton is a ghost that abandoned all his family and friends to live inside a robot only for entertaining these 9 viewers on television. Isn't that sad ? ((by the way, who made that gay-anime-style robot ? Of course, it's Alphys. Man, she's really frustrated.))  Napstablook is depressed. But hey, is that really a family tradition ? Ghosts are so annoying in this game.  Also, Mad Dummy, it's a ghost that lives inside a dummy and wants to become incorporeal. Like, in a DUMMY. That sucks sooo much. Also, if this ghost spares you it's because you killed everyone. Basically, the ghost's hatred for you is so intense that he becomes incorporeal. After that, he is HAPPY about all this because being incorporeal was his life-long dream. Nice character representating nowadays' egoism. ((or should I say individualism ? ;)))  LET'S GET TO THE REAL IMPORTANT CHARACTERS. Like, the ones with a ♥♥♥♥ing background, please.  SANS : I'll write about this one first. This character is EMPTY. Yeah. Empty. I just know that it's a skeleton that likes awful puns and knows everything about the player dying and restarting. That's basically mr-fourth-wall-man. Get it ? It's funny because you're the one that broke him. Actually, there might be more. Sans's background is the most interesting thing. Like, all these theories about time travel, and SANS IS NESS, and gaster stuff. But this is not canon. So I won't talk about this here. I'll update when Toby will make him an actual background.   TORIEL : lol deviantart is full of her. The fandom really does suck. Basically, she's the second worst character. (after Papyrus because she's actually useful in the story) She's not even a good mother. She lost NINE CHILDREN in her life ((Chara, Asriel, the six other children, and mainly, YOU)). I like to think that she said the same thing to every human child after Chara, because I clearly can't think she's not strong enough to protect children.   She just let the player past her. She prefered to leave the trone and try to keep the humans in the most boring area of the underground than actually stay with Asgore and stop him from killing them.  It's not like Asgore is that kind of husband that was threatening or anything...SO WHY DID SHE LEAVE ?! NICE JOB GOATMOM.   ASGORE : Is that another character that was lying to everybody ?? Man, no wonder why Alphys seemed to love him. He's a ♥♥♥♥ing muscular beast that doesn't want to change things. He lost two children too ((well obviously, because he's goatdad)) and lied to the whole underground.  ((except his wife because he didn't have to : she just locked herself in the ruins))  I kinda like this character. He wanted to take his responsibilities. He's the king, so he couldn't just run away and let everyone forget about him like a disgusting monster. ((right toriel ?)) He just didn't know that seven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children would actually fall in a giant hole as if they wanted to die ???   ASRIEL : If Papyrus is the number one worst character, Asriel might be the number zero. 'mr-drama-man' So, humans and monsters are ENEMIES, right ? So why would you go to the surface with a ♥♥♥♥ing human corpse in your hands ???!!! That's provocation. And Chara knew it. But Asriel didn't expect a single thing. He died without helping anyone, too. Neither Chara nor the monsters. And that's how the drama started. That's why Asgore had to make something quick, he didn't have the choice. The monsters were desperate, so he declared war and promised the monsters to free them all. That's actually not a bad decision. I mean, are the humans really worth it ? They probably can't even help themselves. So, at the final boss of the pacifist, what ACTUALLY happens ?  Flowey absorbs all the souls. Including Asriel's. Since Flowey's the result of a really crappy experience, ((I wonder who made this mess)) we learn he is actually Asriel's essence, but WITHOUT Asriel's soul. So as soon as he gets his soul back, he IS Asriel, right ?  Asriel with all his kindness. Yeah, he's the powerful monster that wants to kill you at the end. Yeah, he's the powerful monster you want to save. Save ? From WHAT ? Becoming Flowey again ? Look, he's not Flowey anymore. He's ASRIEL. But, he still wants that power. Reseting and stuff. He still wants to murder you. And when you beat him, oh look, he becomes nice !  I hate this character so much. He doesn't make any sense.  And his 'god of hyperdeath' stuff is cringy, too. It's not because he's a child that he's so cute and nice. He's not stable. He doesn't know what he's doing. He wants to restart everything over and over again. So edgy.  The player survives just because this boss doesn't make any sense. You just can't die. That's it. Ruining all the intensity of the fight in one sentence. 'But it refused'. Well done.  Sooo. Who's left ?   FLOWEY : The only character that made me replay thrice that game. What's interesting is that it's actually the ONLY character that knows it's in a game, not like Sans that talks about really scientific stuff like timelines and time travel. Flowey is actually a player too. While he gets the most hate from the fanbase, he's the character that's the most like the player. He made way more good in the underground than the player, and eventually he got bored and made way more evil in the underground than the player. I just wanted a post-genocide route where he could not do the exact same thing. After all, isn't he supposed to remember everything ? So why wouldn't he come back to Frisk before he becomes evil ? Again, even the most interesting character has holes in it, and that's too bad. He feels emotions like love and fear for Chara in the end of the genocide route. That's weird, because he says himself that he can't feel anything because he lost his soul.   But hey, Photoshop Flowey is the best final boss I've played in my entire life. Photoshop Flowey is the best thing about Undertale.   CHARA : well that's the most confusing character in the game. It's like Toby wanted to make a meta character representing the player playing Undertale as if it were a classic rpg but then decided to give it an actual background in the story. That's really weird. Why does the player name an existing character that already made his actions in the story way before the character that you actually play falls in the underground ??  That doesn't make much sense.     GASTER : he's interesting only because he doesn't exist    JERRY: reminds me that this game has this 'S H l T P O S T' vibe  ______________________________________________________________  oh, and also, yes, please note that there's a linear player evolution to Undertale.  It goes like this :  NEUTRAL =&gt; PACIFIST =&gt; GENOCIDE  Every blind player started with the Neutral route. Then made the Pacifist route. And eventually, finished playing this game after completing the Genocide route.  The Pacifist ending isn't the 'True ending'. Because even if the player stops playing after the pacifist, he'll always launch the game at least once again and see there's still something happening after the second true reset.  The third and final true reset, leading to the genocide. that's the storyline, deal with it :^)",

The music is amazing, probably one of the best I've personally ever heard. The characters are easy to get attached to and the fact that most of them are silly in their own way puts more emphasis on Genocide route, because you will likely feel sad about it.

In an RPG you usually are supposed to kill everyone and gain levels but in Undertale you don't have to and you actually have a choice. So yeah. I thought the game was good. The only thing wrong with the game is that the graphics and sprites aren't always appealing. When I talk about the sprites I mean the ones that are outside of battle. The ones in battle are impressive even though they don't have color. Some areas like the ruins are very lacking in detail. But honestly that doesn't matter a lot. This game is good.
