            "review_text": "Soma was a truly incredible experience for me. From start to finish it kept my attention, and constantly made me think. Think about the story, about the characters, the situation, and most importantly, about what it means to be human. It’s a very appealing theme for a video game that I haven’t seen in games before (although I do realize there have been many films/books made about the topic).   Made by Frictional games, the same developers of Amnesia the Dark Descent, I had high expectations for pretty much everything. They didn’t let me down. The new HPL 3 Engine looks amazing, and gave me some of the most atmospheric moments I’ve ever had in gaming. The sound design is top notch, and the voice actors are definitely worth commending. Although there aren’t many characters in the game, those that do feature, pull off incredible performances.  Although the game had several scary moments, I personally found one part towards the end of the game absolutely terrifying. It’s safe to say that I really enjoyed the pacing of the game and how everything became particularly more intense as I progressed.  Probably the only criticism I can make is the length of the game, which I felt was a bit short. A lot of reviewers criticized the puzzles, but I personally enjoyed them all for the most part.   Soma is definitely worth playing if you enjoy survival horror. But even if you’re new to survival horror, I’m certain you’ll find this game worthwhile.",

            "review_text": "SOMA is a pretty good psychological survival-horror game. It's more like Alien: Isolation in that it builds the tension from the atmosphere of the game, rather than via cheap jump-scare tactics. There's a good story that talks about what it means to live, with talking robots that have the consciousness of their masters. Visuals are decent, while the sound design and voice acting are great.   Even when there's no immediate danger, just listening to the sound gives you the chills. Can never be too sure what lurks around. The tension by way of the audio design is particularly brilliantly done in SOMA.   You can customize your controls fully, there are some graphics options to customize and you can save at any time and exit the game.   Anyway, so far, I have two issues with the game. Both are worth mentioning but still overall my net outlook of the game is positive and that it is worth getting, especially if you like the premise of it.   The first is that the enemies can be frustrating. The first enemy I met was a 'big daddy' kind of enemy. Easy to get around him, and I never saw it again so far. Then I think there's an enemy in the water but can't be too sure if that's considered an enemy or not. Anyway, the third one is kinda tricky and I had to brute force my way through. He can sense you electromagnetically, and I'm not sure how to get past. Trial and error took me past the first, and now there's another one of it that I can't seem to get past. So yeah, maybe I'm missing something, but this enemy is kinda frustrating making me try over and over again.   The second is that the graphics optimization is kinda underwhelming. Ok sure, I only have a GTX 750, but for this kind of a 'corridor' based linear game, I expect 60fps on reduced settings. But often, being in a static room, my framerate would only be 45-50fps, and many times when moving around it may just be around 40fps. Can't really understand why. It doesn't look particularly amazing or demanding. I run Alien Isolation at 60fps no issues at High settings. The fact that the PS4 version only runs at 30fps (and even then not smoothly) where many other linear 'corridor' games run at 60fps shows that the game could have been better optimized.   So yeah, overall it's still a very engrossing and immersive game, with an interesting theme and a good story. If you like narrative-driven games and don't mind some psychological horror elements, give this one a go!",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game, a truly refined experience unlike other horror games. At first I wasn't even going to play it any further because I got damn scared at the beginning, but I steeled myself and pushed through. It was worth it.  The game oozes atmosphere in pretty much every aspect.  The environments are incredibly detailed, to the point there's a lot of incidental objects and spaces you might miss, but which flesh out the game.  The sound design is engaging to the point that your imagination starts running wild - especially towards the end the soundscape, coupled with the visuals, was just something out of this world (I don't want to spoil anything about the game).  The story especially is the game's biggest strength. There were moments where I stopped for a few minutes and contemplated what was happening, what I was doing, etc. It is thought-provoking, to say the least. That's where the biggest source of horror comes from, though it may be hard to see how this comes into picture at first. I had some idea what the story was like, just a few early plot details, and what it's about, yet it still completely blew me away.  Suffice it to say that this is one of the must-play games for horror fans and a game worth checking out for those who are looking a unique experience that will leave one hell of an impression. Even if you have little time to play games these days, you should check SOMA out.  One more comment: Some are saying that the monsters cheapen the game. I disagree, they give the game's atmosphere weight, since if nothing can harm you, you'll just carry along without a care in the world. Still, the mod is there if you truly need it.",

            "review_text": "Improves on TDD and AMFP in every aspect, this is easily Frictional's best work, even over the Penumbra series. An amalgamation of Alien: Isolation, Bioshock, Amnesia, and The Talos Principle.   It has some of the most memorable enemy encounters and environments I've ever seen in a horror game, with a brilliant and well told story that will consistently leave you with chills. Those who're looking for an easily accessible game for some simple scares - this is not it. This is a game to play alone and at night, to immerse yourself in, and to put yourself into the shoes of your character, and ask yourself the same questions he asks right up until the end.  I personally found this game to be phenomenal, wouldn't change a thing. But the gameplay is still simplified as it was in AMFP, although I find it streamlines the process and allows you to focus on the story, it's also dialogue and text/audio log heavy, so if you're not down for reading and listening a lot - this isn't the game for you.  This game will terrify you, but come for the story, not the scares.",

            "review_text": "SOMA may go down as one of my favorite science fiction games ever. The less you know about it going in the better, but it's got one of the most compelling and thought provoking stories of any game I've ever played. A lot of people may overlook this game because it has kind of been lumped into the 'survival horror' category since that's kind of Frictional Games' niche since they did the Amnesia games. But there's so much more to it than that.  I'm really not big on horror games. But I wouldn't really call this a horror game. It's a sci-fi adventure game with horror elements. There's definitely a lot of nail biting moments and there are scary parts too. It's horror in the same way that James Cameron's 'Aliens' was horror. It was more thrill than frightening, but it had its fair share of frightening moments. While in previous games made by Frictional, the story kind of revolved around the horror and the scares, in SOMA, the story is 100% the focus of the game. The scarier aspects of the game come about from the story itself, as a biproduct for everything that's happening. There were only a few portions of the game where I felt deeply uneasy and uncomfortable since the games puts you in situations where something may be...hunting you and you have no means to defend yourself. That element does play a role in the game, but the horror element pretty much stops there.  This game is like reading an incredibly riveting science fiction novel. Like one of the classics. It's so full of philosophical and existential dilemmas that revolve around things as grand as the meaning and definition of life, like what is life? Is our scientific definition for life enough? This game is incredibly creative with how it poses these questions, and it does so in a way that doesn't feel like you are being lectured to. While you are fairly isolated for most of the game, the characters that are there are complex and interesting and relatable, and realistically portrayed in terms of their personalities and interactions with each other. The world of the game itself is so well constructed that it gives itself a sense of space and scale, that it feels like a real place, not a 'video game' type world where everything is sort of compacted together to fit into world of the game (kind of like the grand theft auto games which feature miniature versions of real cities). The world of SOMA feels real, immersive, and detailed (so much so that I at one point actually pulled out a map online of the fictional underwater facility that this takes place in to figure out where I was and where I was going). It's linear but with plenty of exploration and occasionally non-linear objectives, similar to games like Bioshock &amp; Half-Life.  It's not that long of a game (9-12 hours cumulatively depending on how much time you explore/get lost). I know a lot of people probably will overlook this because they don't really do horror games, but like I said, I'm not a fan of horror games either, but I really loved this game. It's scary at times but it wasn't nightmare inducing, at least for me. Overall I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to any fans of sci-fi games.",

I could never stomach Amnesia. However, me being a massive SciFi fan I just HAD to play this. SOMA has one of the best and original storylines I have ever experienced in any medium. Whether that be movies, books, games, etc. I really didn't have a clue what this game was about, but NOTHING could have prepared me for the degree of smart, thought-provoking, and downright haunting subject matter Frictional Games delivered. PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, if you intend to play this game DO NOT read/watch anything about the story. It is phenomenal and nothing should be spoiled for anyone. I am writing this just minutes after finishing the game and I cannot get it out of my head. My only complaint isn't about the story at all. Or even the puzzles. I honestly believe the game would have been better without monsters. This isn't just because I was absolutely horrified 87.53% of the time, I am fine with that. The problem is they kinda got repetitive and felt like padding after a bit. That being said, the whole game is still on the short side at about 12 hours and the pacing is on point otherwise. SOMA is a masterpiece of story, writing, sound design, and visuals. I cannot recommend it enough!   Frictional Games, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",

During experimental brain scan, Jason blacks out, only to regain consciousness in unknown place. You soon learn that the year is 2104 and you are in PATHOS-II, research facility located in the Atlantic Ocean. At first, facility appears to be abandoned until you encounter someone, or something, that will send chills down your spine...   Game is first person psychological horror in which you will encounter dozen of creatures, progressing by solving puzzles and exploring. Just like in previous Frictional Games' games, you can't fight the creatures but rather get out of their way (and sight). Throughout the game, you will find clues in form of pictures, notes and audio logs which will provide the answer to how you got there and what it's all about.  SOMA takes around 10 hours to finish and it's pretty linear. You will have few choices to make but they don't matter in the end. Enemies are terrifying but sometimes annoying. They really like to get in your way, especially in pitch black rooms. Or behind doors. More scary than the enemies is the story. I won't say much to keep it spoiler free but it really gets you.

There is never a dull moment, as new environments and constant events keeps you always guessing what the next step is going to bring.   I know some people are complaining about the monsters bringing you out of the amazing story and environments, and these are valid complaints. The game seems to work best when it is allowing you to explore and discover this incredibly detailed and imaginative world that Frictional Games has created.  However, I would not remove the monesters because they help provide an antagonist and break up the pacing of the game. If you are worried about the monsters ruining the experience for you, I can tell you that I did not get killed once my entire playthrough. 95% of the monsters allow you to get hit once or twice before they kill you, and whenever they hit you, it just knocks you out and the monsters wander off.

I'm a fan of Frictional Games for Penumbra and Amnesia and I absolutely loved those games for their atmosphere, the story, and the horror. They know how to put together a great story and they've done it again with Soma. Despite being familiar with their past games, they've still managed to surprise me again with the amount of storytelling involved here and that speaks for itself.  Despite the great story, it has its drawbacks such as enemies coming from impossible directions. An example of this is a large zombie creature you encounter deep in a laboratory. There are dead end hallways where he shouldn't be able to come from and yet, he appears from those dead ends. You discover a console that locks and unlocks rooms. I got the bright idea to lock the creature inside a room. He was locked in there. I left him behind and there he was again coming from a dead end hallway. I went back to the locked room and he wasn't in there. This left me frustrated and broke all immersion that game had built up to that point. It's just cheesy he spawns anywhere he pleases and gets out of locked rooms. Someone must have given him a ring of security keys... I can picture that zombie creature in the locked room fumbling a ring of keys and casually trying the door with them like it's another day at the office.  Besides that part... it's really the only part that left me scratching my head. The rest is plus-grade material, awesome storytelling and great horror. Until the ending... Which I won't spoil for you but I am going to explain how I felt about it.  Here's how I sum it up:  Penumbra  series left me wondering and shocked.  Amnesia  left me with a feeling of accomplishment and empowerment.  Amnesia A Machine For Pigs  left me feeling emotionally moved and actually made me cry at the end.  Soma  left me with a great feeling of empty and cold unsatisfaction.  Please don't be deterred by my use of the word 'unsatisfaction' as it's not used toward the game itself. I meant it as an emotional result of the resolved story.  Some might call that a success, and perhaps it is a success. I had and still have some reservations about the conclusion. It's an ending without an ending and it's an ending that will obviously not have any direct sequel. It left me wanting more, expecting more, thinking what it was that I was trying to accomplish. There's a key moment at the end where you may find yourself lost in regret for ever flicking that switch or getting into that chair. A feeling of regret that ' none of this would have happened had I stayed in my apartment and accepted fate. ' An ending like that certainly leaves a great deal of unanswered questions.  Overall, it's still a journey worth experiencing and I am very much looking forward to any future games that Frictional creates. 9/10",

            "review_text": "I've been anxiously awaiting this release since I saw the matrix-esque teaser trailer that ended with 'Am I… still here?' This is hard sci-fi done right. Deep philosophical themes criss-cross the game, touching several topics that sci-fi fans will recognise. It feels like a Philip K. DlCK story with a touch of Clive Barker horror.  Horror survival and jump scares were never my thing. I played a bit on the old Penumbra series, but never got much out of the stories. Same with Amnesia; as there is only notes to unravel the story, very little character development can take place. The monster(s) often felt like primarily a nuisance., and puzzles convoluted.   This is not a problem with Soma; it does not rely on the notes and audio-logs to tell the story. The dialogue and interaction with other characters give the adventure thick and juicy meat to the tale. The monsters are not crawling everywhere, but play integral part of the story and flesh out the events. In fact, some of the monsters or 'enemies' have dialogue. Puzzles have a wide range of types and difficulties, and they always fit with the story-line. Someone else noted that Soma is more 'tense' than 'scary', and I agree. This is a good thing, but rest assured, I still think my choice of white leather upholstery for my chair may have been a bad decision while playing Soma.   The choice of environment is a breath of fresh air - if you'll pardon the misplaced metaphor. The cramped underwater installations versus the 'open' sea-bed give a nice contrast during gameplay, and gives a heightened feeling of realism, compared to similar games that take place in space. However, I don't think I'll be getting any new PADI certificates for quite a while after playing this game ...  A ton of comparisons to other games, movies and books litter the forums, so I won't iterate those. However, one game with similar feel and atmosphere that I can also recommend is the indie game 'The Fall'.  Some may compare it to 'The Talos Principle', but Talos looks more like a cross between 'Sophie's World' by Jostein Gaarder and a prequel to 'I, Robot', when compared to Soma.   A few minor criticisms: The game is very dark and blurry at times, and the usefulness of the flash light can be a bit hit and miss (out in the sea, it is as useful as high beams on a car in a blizzard). I also kept losing track of the tiny pointer; luckily it changes to something more obvious when you can interact with something, so waving the mouse around like you've got no muscles in the neck will help you find all that you need. Subtitles were also a big help, as some of the dialogue might not be as easy to hear. Being able to click once more on notes to get a plain-text of the blurry chicken scratches left by the people on the installation was a good idea, but I felt like I was missing some zooming possibility a few times.  All in all, this is a MUST HAVE game. A solid 9/10, also for you non-horror gamers. If you're thinking of watching the play-through videos; you won't get a tenth of the experience that you will playing on your own in the dark.   On a side note; I'm a Linux gamer and I was pleasantly surprised to see it work without any major hiccups on Linux.   P.S.: This is one of the few games I think could be adapted into a good movie. Someone get Ridley Scott on the horn, ASAP!",

Whereas Amnesia lacked any real storytelling and relied on atmosphere to keep you coming back, Soma has the atmosphere &amp; a surprisingly cogent and thought provoking story. With actual dialogue that brings up some remarkably profound questions about consciousness.   As soon as I started I was hooked. Ended up completing it in 3 short sittings over 2 days.  The puzzles are simple, sometimes they will require lateral thinking in areas. But they never interrupt the flow of the game. The enemy mechanics are similar to what was laid out in Amnesia and seem to paradoxically reward a bolder approach to confronting them than your character's utter helplessness would suggest. The entire game is about confronting your problems head on.  Any twists to do with the main character are fairly easy to figure out if you're paying attention. And the game doesn't dwell on them. Being more concerned with how the realisations affect the human condition.   Being just slightly over 10 hours for completion (will probably vary depending how you approach the problems), it may be a little short. But it doesn't overstay it's welcome (like isolation did) and leaves you wanting more.  Definitely worth a purchase.",

The real achievement here is the beautifully rendered decayed industrial 3D environments and the atmosphere that the game builds. There are also some very interesting philosophical issues explored in the story, great sound &amp; voice work, and it's long enough to satisfy.

Firstly, its not an action game. If you've played Alien Isolation, which I loved, this is a level below that in terms of horror but its the same type of gameplay - you use stealth to progress the story. There are no weapons, bombs or knives, you simply rely on avoidance. I actually really liked this as it adds a sense of tension knowing that you can't just kick doors in and let rip with a minigun. The recent new breed of stealth games are intelligent story driven games. The levels are linear in SOMA but it works fine and they're never boring due to scripted game events.   I really enjoyed the environment, it reminded me of the film, The Abyss, especially later in the game. The SCI FI story is excellent without ruining it, its actually very thought provoking and the ending reminded me of the SCI FI film The 13th Floor. I was impressed with the fact that the game didn't go crazy with dozens of monsters and bosses. I kept thinking that it was going to be similar to Dead Space but it was much more slowly paced. The monsters were pretty brutal at times and some of the AI seemed a bit unfair but never to the point were it made you want to give up. The game raised thought provoking philosophical questions relating to the afterlife, euthanasia and artifical inteligence. It was quite sad in parts and there was a sense of impending doom that lingers with you as you progress. I was happy to play a game that doesnt expect you to collect item after item after item etc etc, there are no health bars or mass piles of items/ammo to collect. The only time you slow down is to read the journals and listen to the audio recordings, but these are interesting - the game was like an unfolding novel and each new bit of info enriched the story.  I finished the game in 10 hours but to be honest I could have played it longer. Even now I still think about it.  If you're looking for something different with great graphics, a great location and a strong thought provoking story sprinkled with bouts of horror.. I can't recommend SOMA enough...",

Even though you barely interact with other NPC characters face to face, the game still manages to build a relationship with the protagonist and one other character merely through voice communications with good voice acting and thought provoking dialogue.  A lot of the intriguing background story and lore of SOMA is entirely missable, as it’s provided via audio logs and notes scattered around the levels. Thus it’s advisable not to rush through the game and read or listen to what SOMA has on offer.  Gameplay is mostly about exploration and occasionally solving some simple puzzles. Hostile creatures featured in certain sections of this game cannot be engaged, only evaded by running and hiding. While these parts surely build up some tension, sneaking around to avoid detection can also become annoying as the creatures seem to always stay in close proximity to the player, or even “sense” the player’s location.  To me personally this is the weakest part of the game as having to sneak around and hide from invincible enemies is just not my cup of tea, yet SOMA’s strengths outweigh my minor complaints and overall I really enjoyed playing it.",

            "review_text": "SOMA is a breakthrough for Frictional Games. It's a sci-fi horror game that stays true to the roots of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The distinguishing feature in this game is that it explores very deep and profound ideas concerning humanity.   The most noticable thing right off the bat is that the new HPL engine is very good. The graphics, sound, behavior, etc are all a huge step up from previous Frictional titles, while it also keeps the trademark mechanics of environment interaction. All in all, this results in the game being incredibly immersive.  The plot is the most interesting that I've ever experienced in a Frictional title. It's not a cliche horror plot of escaping a castle from some monsters or whatever. In the beginning, you'll play as a man named Simon that got in a car accident, who has then volunteered to undergo an experiment that involves getting his brain scanned before he wakes up in an underwater city. From there, you learn more about what has gone on since your recent memory, the future, and what happened at the station. Most of the plot stems from the idea that science has advanced us enough that the technology to scan brains and to reanimate dead muscles/systems exists, which, of course, results in people going crazy, some zombie sort of creatures, and the general running amok. From then on, you'll be breached with the ideas of who you are, what you're doing, the impact of the technology on the world, and even reality itself.   The exploration is fairly linear, as usual. There are a lot of things that you can explore and the fine details of the environment are all present to the standard of your modern RPGs. One of the main drawbacks of the game was that I felt like the monsters were so annoying that they broke immersion. Sometimes, it took immense concentration to get past a monster (especially the last one), and it completely broke the flow of the game. If the game wasn't so enriching and immersive in the first place, these monsters might not have made the contrast so sharp. Regardless, there is a mod on the steam workshop called 'wuss mode' that I highly recommend using during your 2nd playthrough so that you can pick up on more finer details that you will have certainly missed the first time.  During the game, you'll be constantly presented with gray areas about what's right and wrong in certain ethical situations. If you have the ability to bring up a simulation of a dead man, are you actually doing things to him? Does he remember them? What would you do if you ever met your clone? If someone is cloned and one of the people die, is that person dead or is the clone alive? Are you simply putting people out of their misery with that? Is there some intrinsic, yet unique, right that a person has to not get copied to a hard drive?  SOMA was one of the few games that I instantly purchased and played when it was released. I had been won over as a fan of Frictional from their previous titles and the ideas/plot to this game were perfect for my taste. Hope you're ready for low action, deep thinking, and scary hallways.",

            "review_text": "As a longtime fan of Frictional Games, I knew what to expect when I bought SOMA, and I'm happy (I guess) to say that I got what I expected but, if I'm honest, this time around I didn't care so much for the endless crouching behind cover and not looking at the creatures that always seem to know more or less where you are. This was creepy in Penumbra, and I'm pretty confident that the stress of all those hours playing Amnesia:TDD resulted in some amount of long-term psychological damage. However, the monsters in SOMA aren't very scary and, on top of that, they feel overused and almost unnecessary. I found myself hurrying recklessly through the hide-and-seek parts of the game just so I could continue with the main story, which is really the great thing about SOMA.  One quick way to explain SOMA is 'Bioshock meets Amnesia:The Dark Descent'. Except that Rapture has been overrun by technodemons and looks like a hellscape straight out of Harlan Ellison's 'I have no mouth and I must scream'. As the protagonist, you are confronted with questions of existential horror at every turn: Who are you? Your conscience? What is the physical meaning of conscience? I can't get into any further detail without spoiling the story but, in my opinion, this is exactly the juicy bit of SOMA. It helps that the writing and voice acting were done competently, so the characters feel real, and their reactions genuine and believable. When horrible things happen to them, you feel it. And as the credits rolled at the end, I was overcome with the discomfort of being repeatedly made to think about stuff that most people just routinely flip under their mental carpets. Time, humanity, death, the self. It's all there, and it's a blow to the back of the skull. But if you enjoy having your brain tickled that way, SOMA is definitely for you.",

            "review_text": "SOMA... where to begin.  I've been meaning to review this game (and some other games) for quite some time now, but the pressures of doing my Research Masters have made this to be quite the impossible task. I like to put some thought into my reviews and a game like SOMA deserved some more time for me to... gather my thoughts.  And for good reason. I was merely a few minutes into the game and I could tell I was going to at the very leasy enjoy the experience of SOMA, it looked intelligent, seemed to be touching on neuroscientific ideas very early on. What I didn't anticipate was just how much I would enjoy this game.  I'll cut to the chase and proclaim SOMA with little doubt (though there is some; Life is Strange was stellar too), my GOTY. I'm usually hesitant to say things like this nowadays as I enjoy different games for different reasons, and it's not usually fair to do like for like comparisons of games like, say, Invisible Inc. and Life is Strange.  SOMA is intensely thought provoking, philosophical and damn well terrifying. Not the scariest horror game I've played, but it's pretty damn high up. I'd say Alien: Isolation holds that crown, but SOMA is well executed horror. It builds up the feeling of horror through atmospheric tension, small changes in your environment, sounds. No reliance of cheap jump jump scares to generate horror. Smartly done, draws you in, retains immersion. Almost a perfect recipe, in my opinion, for horror.  Something that really stood out for me was the atmosphere - the ambience. SOMA is set deep under the Atlantic Ocean (would you kindly?) in a decaying scientific research facility. There is great scope to utilise darkness, and the sounds of the ocean to really help immerse you in the story. SOMA does all this and more. What I love is in the decaying, abandoned corridors of rooms and ships, you can catch glimpses of the facility and the world around you, through audio logs, televisions, ship recordings. It's essentially stuff that's just THERE, but it adds so much to the experience.  The dialogue that goes on is great. Another strong point. The discussions that go on between you and Catherine are intensely thought provoking. SOMA explore themes regarding life, death, sentience, consciousness, morality, and the very idea of self. And SOMA does it in such an organic way - it's an integral part of the game and it's story and it all comes together, in my own opinion, almost perfectly. As a budding neuroscientist, these ideas especially spoke to me and I was drawn in.  The gameplay is nothing too complex. There's no combat, much like predecessor Amnesia: The Dark Descent, there's no fighting - only hiding and clever navigation. So use the darkness as cover, hide when you can, don't make noise. All good stuff. The design of the various beings you meet is especially intriguing, particularly as a research interest of mine is organic-inorganic interfaces. From an artistic point if view, I felt these ideas were highly imaginative and pretty original. I feel these artistic choices were key components of the horror aspect of the game.  Also furthering the strong points of horror and game design was that, much like Alien: Isolation, it doesn't hold your hand. There aren't way markers - you gotta figure out your way round yourself, by finding maps or deducing from instructions - even if it's pitch black and some unholy beast is stalking you.  Graphically, SOMA is pretty good. In terms of technical ultra realism, It's not amazing, but at the very least, it's certainly a good looking game. What I would expect from an Indie studio that doesn't have millions to throw at the most advanced graphical engine. I've touched on this already, but the artistic design is very good. I'm a sucker for futuristic/sci fi stuff so I may well be biased. For the most part, many things actually don't look too futuristic or far out, in terms of your environment - it's almost familiar - but when you start meeting other... say, inhabitants, these ideas of sci-fi/futurism become more apparent.  All of these things tie together to make the storytelling of SOMA one of the best I've come across. The characters, the dialogue, the themes, the overall story, the environment. I don't have enough praise for SOMA. It's not a perfect game, of course - there was the odd graphical glitch and on occasion the AI would react weirdly and I wished the game was a little longer, but all in all it's so damn good.",

Wow. I'm impressed.  I didn't buy it when it came out, because it was basically featured as a 'horror game', which is a genre I usually find boring as hell. Well, it might actually contain horror, but primarily of the psychological sort. Once you start to think about what is really happening, what the situation you're in really means, that's the moment the horror sets in.  I played the game with the 'Wuss Mode' mod, and I'm more than happy I did, because it removes the one element that I know would havbe me annoyed to no end. This does basically turn the game into an interactive movie, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  The mood and the atmosphere and spot on. Play this with a good surround set or headphones in a dark room, and you'll be 'right there'.  So glad I experienced this. To think I almost missed it!",

But if you bought the game expecting it to be as scary as Amnesia: you'll be disappointed. Sure the game has moments that get your heart pumping but it doesn't have the same atmosphere or sense of dread as Amnesia. When you look at some of the WAU's creatures static appears and it makes a horrifying sound; this would be good if you could tell the difference between the sounds of when it's spotted you or when you've gotten to close. They all seem to sound the same, which can add add more suspense but honestly flat out confuses you.  It's story is very compelling. You get your brain scanned as a result of a car crash and wake up in the distant future. After waking up you find yourself in an underwater base called PATHOS II where all the people you can find are either barely living or robots. You meet a robot called Catherine and you agree to help her find her experiment. SOMA's is very much like bioshock with it's underwater aesthetic and is also reminiscent of Dead Space; this is due to the design of PATHOS II, very futuristic yet very dark rooms.     Later in the story your lead to find out that your mind has been copied over into a robotic suit. To reach the deeper section of PATHOS II you have to copy yourself into a more heavy duty suit; the only problem is that the original will still be there. You are given the decision to leave or kill your copy. This is the kind of choice the game gives you that can affect how you view the game.    ",

            "review_text": "Bottom Line Up Front:  SOMA is an excellent game with a story that will leave you pondering your idea of self. It is absolutely worth playing, though be aware that it only has ~10 hours of gameplay. 97/100   Gameplay: SOMA has roughly 10 hours of gameplay which seems to go by faster than that. You'll finish the game wishing that there was more. Maybe there will be content to come in the future, but for now, SOMA is lacking in replay value. That being said, those 10 hours are absolutely fantastic and you will spend plenty of time after it is all over thinking about it and its ending. SOMA's controls are very intuitive and require little or no learning, a plus in my opinion. It is based on puzzle solving and some exploration. The puzzles aren't too difficult, you may just find yourself looking around for a while.  Graphics and Audio: The graphics are very good, and if you're into the sci-fi aspect of this game, you're really going to enjoy it. The audio really stands out though. Everything sounds so good, I mean...wow. The audio makes the game; everything from monsters screaming at you, to airlocks filling with water, to when you walk into that little waste basket on the floor, everything is excellent.  Story: This is why you play SOMA. This game will blow your mind with its story. Play it.  Monsters / Horror: SOMA is not the scariest game out there. If you're a hardcore horror junkie (which I am not), this game may leave something to be desired. The atmosphere is often creepy and you're going to be chased by quite a few screaming monsters in very dark places, SOMA even has a few jumpscares for you, all of which may put you on the edge of your seat, even raise your anxiety levels, but you won't be clutching your flashlight after you turn off your lights.  Overall, you need to play this game. It is a bright beacon of hope in the realm of video game single player experiences and stories. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.",

This happened to me once or twice, the worst being from a known bug when first trying to enter lambda. Really took away from the experience, but luckily...  However annoying that above was, I still highly recommend this game. The story is 10/10 - all my assumptions about the plot were wrong and I loved the game for it. There are some fantastic moments in the game, with the last third being some of the best. There is just not enough movies and games that deal with the abyss of the deep sea - I was truly inspired by how terrifying it would be to be lost down there. Moreover, the ideas presented make it a true scifi - moreso than what Hollywood calls scifi these days. Sci-fi asks questions and presents ideas in such a way that it should make you think long and hard about those ideas.   Also, the sound design must be praised, all the environment and ambient sounds were fantastic - constantly creating tension and a sense of unknown while giving life to every environment and stage within each chapter of the story.  This isn't a perfect game, but however occasionally frustating it is, this is a game that takes advantage of its medium - most games parody film in telling a story - this game shows how it can tell a story better than a film could.   10/10 Catherine is from Taipei",

It is this narrative and the atmosphere created by it, however, that really make the game shine. What starts out as a more or less regular visit to a doctor quickly turns into a biomechanical underwater nightmare that repeatedly questions the philosophical concept of the self and what constitutes as a human, anyway.  Long story short, SOMA basically is a glorified walking simulator, but unlike most other games in that category, this title actually has a story engaging enough to let you forgive its rather lacking pure gameplay. Those looking for a pure horror game that constantly keeps your heart pounding may be disappointed, however.",

You'll need to figure out how the tech works to make things ON or OFF, look for clues in letters, audio logs or posters. Everything is immersing you ( literally ) deeper and deeper in the story, the characters, consciousness...   The main asset of SOMA is it's scenario. I did not play Amnesia ( and still has to ) so didn't really know what I was signing into. I would suggest to just jump into it whitout reading or seeing too much about it.

That's not to say it's without flaws. I found it crashed sporadically for no apparent reason (running Windows 10), occasionally the voice acting was a little stilted, and the amount of time you spend walking around with the 'light prism' / rainbow vision effect was a bit much at times.

These are not easy, and they will stick with you long after you make them.  If you were able to handle Bioshock or Dead Space, you will enjoy this game as well.

It's actually scary, so many people nowadays say 'not scary' to literally every horror game there is, I'd say this is simply because these people are *too* used to horror games from either playing too often or watching others play them too often. Also these people needs to sit in dark rooms with headphones at midnight, not outside on their balcony in the middle of the day. Just because YOU didn't find something scary, that doesn't mean others will feel the same.  Anyways: *The story and everything is perfect, and it leaves you thinking a bunch about life. Lot's of lore stuff everywhere! *Graphics looks great! *The ambience/atmosphere/setting is beyond perfect, deep underwater abandoned stuff, creepy dark hallways etc. *Controls works great and the game has full controller support, but I would personally recommend playing with a keyboard. *It's scary. The amount of times I've gotten myself some tickets to NOPETOWN are beyond measure at this point... *Mod support!! -I've heard the game isn't optimized too well, so I'd say you should make sure your computer handles the game before grabbing it.  If you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, this game is definitely for you. You probably won't find it as scary as Amnsia, but this is still very good.

The data mining from consoles and 'Black Boxes', having Simon encounter various 'people' and 'things', and also speak actively compaired to the writings or rare flashbacks from Daniel in Amnesia really helps the mood and setting of the game. Along with giving you bits and pieces of the story to work on as you progress to the various areas. Complete with genuine reactions after a lot of the events, too.  Gameplay is exactly like Penumbra and Amnesia utilizing the moused based physics to interact with props and some doors. Sneaking around is more or less the same, but the enemy awareness has had a definite upgrade so avoiding beeing seen won't be as easy as in previous titles. When you get caught by an enemy you enter a physically hurt state where Simon is slower and limps around making finding the next healing 'polyp' a must for him to move around effectively and points out why they put so many in the areas.  Enemies are not to annoying and come in a small range of shapes and sizes. Each one never overstaying it's welcome and being varied enough to keep the encounters fresh. The game looks fantastic the sound design really hit it off for me. Every enemy, prop, and even the ambience are all unique and seperate to each area creating great diversity in visual and sound while still making you believe every area is connected.

At times you would run out of patience and just try to rush through it and can cause frustration. Which would subtract the fear you once had in the beginning.

It's difficult to write about this game without getting into the plot, but outside of a few plot holes and the main protagonist being an unlikable psychology 101 student I'm fairly satisfied.  I only have a few real complaints about the game. Loading saves takes quite a while, there are a few plot holes, some of the areas towards the end were tedious to avoid monsters at, and some of the outdoor areas you could easily be attacked in supposedly safe zones. Also there are a few 'chase' sequences which are not well identified and go contrary to how you learn to deal with the monsters, but that's really about it. I never had any issues with the game crashing, and genuinely enjoyed the atmosphere that the developers clearly put a lot of effort into.  The game is solid survival horror, so if you're looking for something to get your heart rate up or otherwise give you a good scare look no further. Or look for Amnesia: The Dark Descent, by the same developers. There's a lot of times where I saw something in both games and couldn't help but think how screwed up what I was looking at was.",

The world evolves in a constant turning of events with you slowly uncovering your place in it. There were scenes that had me sitting back to consider what I just witnessed. Others had me afraid to blink. Dialog is super, too. The characters often echoed my own thoughts on the current situation.  Gameplay is pretty streamlined compared to previous Frictional games: no inventory or tools, puzzles are simplistic (without feeling like an afterthought), but the experience overall definitely benefits from this. It lets you concentrate on the story, which is much more coherent (as it should be, but it still takes a bit of focus to piece everything together, considering how many characters you are introduced to and how few of them you interact with).  Although I can understand people wanting a low cost per hour of gameplay, I thought the length was perfect for a game like this. It lets you hold the whole thing in your mind without parts of it fading.  Sound design is the real stand-out here, I'd say. Really helps the narrative: beautiful coupling with the environments. It had me cowering in various corners sure that the monster was in the room with me (of course maybe it wasn't).  If you haven't played any other game by Frictional, this is all you need. It'll be hard to top. If you haven't played any horror-survival, also start here. It would be a waste of time  not  to play this one.  p.s. I cried a little at the credits.",

Glad I was so wrong.  SOMA is incredible, great narrative, immersive environment, proper visual effects and sick voice acting.  But this is no 'horror game' in the strict sense, some of you'll quickly find that instead of keeping you on the edge of your seat at all time, it instills a sense of growing uneasyness that's hard to shake off.

Incredible attention to detail in many regards; sound design, atmosphere, pacing, environment, storyline, etc. I love how much information can be ascertained from the obvious things such as terminals and data caches (and that I actually had the desire to stop and check these things) but also from less obvious things like the placement of certain objects or the design of an area where you can find clues as to what happened.  There are 'puzzles' in the game, which I'm usually not the biggest fan of, but the implementation of these obstacles is excellent. There is no cheesy highlighting of objects or arrows pointing to an objective, it's laid out for you to piece together, but not incredibly difficult. Just challenging enough to make you 'panic' as you try to piece together how to escape on the fly while narrowly avoiding certain death as the malicious being lurking in the dark breathes down your neck. It's very satisfying to figure out what to do on your own without someone holding your hand; at the same time it's great relief, because you survived and no one was holding your hand, as you are very much alone.  The interaction system is very good as well, it was good in Amnesia and i like that Fractional stuck with it. It really helps with pulling you into the in-game world, and giving you a more immersive experience. It also goes well with the no-hand-holding puzzle solving aspect, as you get to 'physically' manipulate most objects, so it's not obvious which object you will need to pick up to help you progress or which object you might end up throwing on the ground for the hell of it. It adds to the experience of this game in that your escape is sometimes dependent upon you have the motor skills to 'unlatch', 'pull' or 'twist' your way to freedom, rather than 'hitting A' to open the automatic door. I think more games should adopt something like this, i've never been so satisfied simply opening a door in a video game.  The story is engaging and I love that half of the 'horror' isn't just from the ever looming threat of something roaming the darkness, but from the existential concepts being conveyed to you that linger on your mind as you traverse the abyss. The progression of the characters is engaging, and your feelings of them may waver as some of their actions sit in an ethical grey area, and their intentions may seem vague.  This game was a great experience, one that will stick with me, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, and would recommend it to anyone.",

The smart, ambitious storytelling and themes more than compensate for the simplified gamplay mehcanics. Not doing an intro to the story because it's in the game description when you first loaded the store page.   It's a perfect blend of Sci-fi and horror, but it's not as oppressive and scary on a visceral level as Amnesia was. On an intellectual level, however, SOMA is more terrifying than Ameneisa and most others in its genre. Specifically, the questions it asks (or spring in your mind as you progress) and its thematic elements.   But SOMA isn't smart or scary just because it asks philosphical questions about consciouness and what it means to be human. Heck, SOMA isn't even the first game to ask those questions. It's because the game forces you to reflect upon those said questions from a dark, uncomfortable perspective you may never thought of using.   This is why I think the simplified gamplay mechanics add to game rather than serve as a detriment. It allows your mind to do all the beautiful work of reflection and introspection while the game is tormenting you in depths of ocean hell. And then you employ your stealth or run the **** away and hide here tactics when you do encounter the occasional monster, much like Amensia. Speaking of Amensia (again), if you played thourgh to the end of that game and felt relieved (or umimpressed), SOMA's ending, not to spoil it, will leave a more powerful impact on you, as in your soul and mind.

I enjoyed roaming around the areas, searching for answers and clues to uncover the history of the place you find yourself in. What this game did right, was that I looked forward to finding more answers rather than looking forward to the next hostile encounter, which was just an added bonus in this immersive atmosphere. I was always captivated by what was going on around me in SOMA and the game changes it's scenery frequently enough so that nothing gets stale. The game's story and premise has you questioning yourself multiple times throughout it, and you may find that you see and answer things differently by the end of the game in comparison to the start.

I stopped to read and listen to all of the notes I ran across. The ending is REALLY good and even if you expect it the execution is flawless. The biggest flaw I noticed was it does suffer from the 3/4 syndrome that most horror games fall to. Around that point in the game progress does begin to feel sluggish.

I personally would define SOMA as a mystery adventure game rather than horror game. SOMA has some horror aspects but it's not the central focus. So if you are looking for same horror experience like Amnesia: TDD or Outlast, you will be disappointed with SOMA. If you are not a type of person who like to explore environments or spending a time reading notes or listen recordings in the game, then I don't recommend SOMA too as the surrounding items and clues are part of the game's story telling. But if you really like a good story-driven game, then I really recommend the SOMA.  Side note: there are some people who complaints the monsters are annoying or nuisance when exploring the environments. If you feel so, you can load the game using Wuss mod, it will make the monster can't attack you (except on certain scripted chase scene).",

SOMA introduces a variety of characters that, when opportune moments come (both in their favor and against them), will display a side of themselves that they have never shown before, whether to others or even themselves. Morality and 'mankind' are held to extreme ideals here, and some may baffle you and make you question the integrity of the people associated with the game. You might even empathize with some of the characters as well. Who's right and who's wrong? The answers are more complicated than one may initally ponder.  However, let's not forget that this is also a horror game, one that leaves you with no weapons to fend for yourself and one to leave you more tense than shocked. The game does well with setting the uneasy atmosphere and doesn't rely on jumpscares that much as a scare factor. 5/5 I highly recommend playing this game.",

            "review_text": "Brilliant and emotional writing, and it could have been perfect if they didn't pander to 'horror' fans.  I went into this game blind, having received it as part of the Humble Bundle, and I would recommend you do too if you are considering playing it. It was magical discovering it from entirely fresh eyes. This review will try to avoid spoilers, but may touch on subjects that may partially reveal the nature of some parts of the game.  This game explores some deep questions about humanity, identity and morality. The setting for the game was amazing and the storyline affected me in ways that not many games have managed to do.  Beautiful art and sound design enhance the feeling of mystery and dread. You really feel the sense of confusion and frustration that the character would be feeling in this situation.  I cannot say enough good things about the story, the atmosphere that the game creates and the production in general. Top notch work.  However, I do feel that they dropped the ball when it came to the horror aspect of the game. It seemed tacked on, and it didn't blend well with the rest of the mood somehow. I do feel that there needed to be a threat to ramp up the feeling of dread, but it was executed poorly and in the end, 'dying' had no consequence but for having to try again to evade your enemy.  By the end of the game, it began to follow a very obvious pattern. There would be plot exposition and exploration of your surroundings, you would make progress, then you would see the autosave icon flicker in the corner and there would be an enemy obstructing your progress. If you failed to evade the enemy, you 'died' and began again from the autosave. Once you cleared the area containing the enemy, you were free to enjoy exploring and revealing the plot further. It seemed to detract more from the game then enhance it. It was very compartmentalized.  A threat becomes hollow once the player realizes that there is no real consequence to failure, so it becomes more of a nuisance than anything else. Perhaps instead of the enemies simply killing you, you are tasked with trying to 'save' them, and failure to do so alters the outcome of the game. I can see how this could have worked with the plot line. Unfortunately, as designed here, the enemies are simply pylons standing in your way as opposed to being integral to the story.  There is some mild to medium puzzle work, fetching items, using devices. This was all very good and felt natural to the story and the environment. It added so much to the game that it more than made up for the annoying enemies. I never had to turn to the forum or a walkthrough, but there was some areas that got me thinking.  There is lots to discover, read and listen to, and it was fascinating stuff. They let you put things together in your head and it really makes you feel absorbed in the story. The voice acting, while maybe not Oscar worthy, is very very good and I felt an emotional connection to the characters.  I was frustrated by some of my character's decisions (throwing away a weapon after using it once?) but he is what he is. He is not Duke Nukem, or Gordon Freeman. He is an ordinary man thrust into highly unusual circumstances.  There was some areas that were a little bit frustrating to navigate, due to poor visibility and lack of landmarks, and it really drove up my anxiety level, but the sense of relief when I managed to get through made it worthwhile to endure the frustration.  In the end, I wish more thought had been given as to how to integrate the enemies, as it stands they feel tacked on in an attempt to make the game a horror game, when it would have been an extremely good sci-fi game otherwise. This developer seems to like the helpless hero who can only run or hide, but there could have been more here. We are not in a haunted mansion running from monsters this time, but it sure felt like it at times.  Whoever wrote the story for this, please do more work with these guys. Rethink the 'enemy' ideas a bit though. I think there could even be a direct sequel here if you use your imagination.  9/10  As much as I hated one particular aspect of the game, this is probably one of the ten best games I have played recently, perhaps ever. I mourn the fact that it had such a tragic flaw, but moreso I mourn that I can never again play it for the first time.",

Some of them include... - The game is pretty easy and the threat of death is numbed by the fact that most enemies don't kill you without multiple attacks. - No crafting/inventory system at all.  - Choices mostly mean nothing although in some cases it is better this was as you aren't told how 'good' or 'evil' your choice was.

Yet, SOMA seems to go above and beyond what I thought was at the time, the best horror game I had ever played.   The writing and characters are good in both games, although the characters and overall breadth of the story are more limited in Amnesia. SOMA however, goes beyond just a story. It makes you think deeply about what the definition of the human existence is. If an extinction level event happened, how does the human race live on? SOMA went to a depth I never expected out of a horror game. You become emotionally tied to the story, the people, Simon (the player character), and the human race as a whole more and more as the game progresses. You think hard about the decisions you have to make in the game because on the surface it can seem like one thing, but when you dig deep and think hard about everything that has happened, happening, and may happen, it could mean something entirely different.  What is life? What does it mean to be human?  Those are questions you would never ask in any other horror game I've ever played.  SOMA to me was not as scary as Amnesia. Amnesia did a good job with the monster jump scares and brooding atmosphere, but SOMA is not about that kind of horror. SOMA is about something deeper, and the kind of horror is more psychological, emotional, and existential which combined with phenominal writing and narrative weaved carefully into the unique and well crafted world, makes for one of the best games I have ever played. Sure there are monsters (or are they really?), and stressful encounters, but that is just a small part of the big picture.  Story aside, the rest of the game is a true marvel. The graphics are noticably better than Amnesia. There are more variety of enemies, environments, and characters. Each site location within PATHOS-II are uniquely designed. I never felt like I was revisiting somewhere I had previously been. Everywhere had a distinct and unique feel. The sound is also greatly improved. Run into things on the ground, pick up items and throw them, environmental sounds, great voice acting from the main characters, and of course another well done soundtrack make for a captivating, and immersive game atmosphere.  There are also mods available, and the ability to create custom scenarios.  This game easily goes on my list of best games ever made.",

That's with looking around, admiring the world, and listening/reading all the in-game lore/files. The underwater world is really awesome. It looks beautiful, sounds beautiful and feels beautiful. The places you go throughout the game are also different and unique. Pluis, the atmosphere is great too! This game really brings out the sci-fi horror and I had a blast going through this one.  The story I enjoyed and thought was interesting, and I enjoyed progressing through and finding out more about what was actually going on. I really enjoyed the ending too. I thought it was a great ending with how they did it. The only 'gripe' that you could have in this game is that the choices you made throughout the game do not do anything to affect story or the ending, though I did hear comments about my choices. I personally didn't mind the lack of different outcomes though, as I was still happy with the ending, but it would have been pretty neat for you choices to possibly change things in a more major way somehow. People do love their decisions and outcomes in games hehe. I do think of a lot of 'what if' scenarios after the game, but hey, they probably left it to the imagination and I won't get into all the details, as this is meant to be a review, not just a ramble on all the things I have thought of.  Another 'gripe' I have heard is that people said they couldn't 'explore' the entire game properly because of the monsters. However, I had no trouble exploring, even with the monsters I was trying to sneak around and read/listen to lore. I think it added challenge to earn the right to listen and learn more. Though, if you really have trouble or just want to get another fully explorative playthrough to make sure you never missed a thing, you can always download the 'No Monsters' mod.   Anyway, the conclusion: I say give this a go! And I hope you enjoyed it as much as me.",

As a commentary on human consciousness and existence, it excels... provided you are willing to invest and immerse yourself. This what I bought the game for, and it delivered in spades. I won't pretend that I'll be walking away from this game with my eyes opened with new knowledge about the human condition, but I *will* be pondering the choices and themes SOMA has presented for a very long time, especially the ending.   Perhaps SOMA's greatest attribute is how it makes you think. Curiosity will fuel you through this game, wanting to know what happened and what happens next. The notes and audio logs contain a rich narrative that takes some effort to piece together, but is entirely worth it in the end.  Another strong point for SOMA is the environment it lays out for you. Frictional have really honed their craft in this area, able to tell stories entirely from visual cues and details. One area in particular comes to mind, an Escher-esque tower that is home to one of the most memorable sequences in the game. Diagrams and documents prior to this area explain exactly why there are toilets on the walls and ladders descending horizontally, but I will leave that a secret for now.  The long and short of it is, if you want a good story, great environments, and a thought-provoking commentary about human life, this game is for you. If you want a survival-horror scarefest, you will leave SOMA with much less than everyone else.",

The hide and seek gameplay is surpringly well balanced, present enough so that the game remains a constant threat, but not too prominent that it becomes tedious. For a stealth survival horror game, it's incredible that I can count on one hand the points of the game where I became frustrated. Puzzles are also vastly improved from Dark Descent, relying on genuine environmental interaction and player awareness than just being several stages of putting together a shopping list.  The story itself is the source of the real meaty horror. You are trapped in an underwater research facility after the world ended with a suspect protagonist identity and facilties full of transformed hybrids out to terrify you relentlessly. But scattered throughout the areas are robots who all genuinely believe themselves to be living, sentient beings. And by the end of the game, you might believe them. I did. The game's morality is vague and inconclusive in the best ways possible (ways I never thought a game could be able to convey so effortlessly).   The human element of SOMA is the horror that really gets under the player's skin and lingers even long after the monsters have shambled away.",

The game starts off incredibly well, with plenty of atmosphere building and a few slight hints as to what's going on exactly. I myself was left guessing until I was around halfway in, at which point the game will just do you a favour and spill the beans. It has an incredible story that gives a real insight into the human condition without coming across as forced or pretentious. As the player progresses, more and more philosophical dilemmas appear that require the player's input to be solved. The side characters are well rounded, none of them come across as either unnaturally good or evil.  That's not to say the game is without faults, however. The main character is surprisingly dumb when it comes to comprehension of basic concepts, which will affect the ending. His voice also sounds rather flat, and only really seems to get emotionally involved near the end. While lighting effects are good, certain areas are too dark to see without turning up the gamma, but such areas are rare. Getting grabbed by a monster will not kill you immediately, but if you got grabbed near the monster's spawnpoint, chances are you won't get the chance to run because being hurt slows you down.  All in all, good game, although I wouldn't recommend it for the horror. Instead, I'd recommend it for its story, which is one of the best I've ever seen.",

Thinking about the game during and after playing, for me, was the hallmark of a great game. I'm sure my friends and family have grown tired of me filling them in on the story and asking questions about what it all meant!  I would thoroughly recommend the game. It confronted ideas of existence, AI and personhood, causing me many hours of philosophical debate internally and with others, in an engaging and challenging manner. There are many threads on Steam and Reddit going into these at great length, if you are interested I would advise you look them up! The characterisation of NPCs and the player through these ideas is well handled and believable (though sometimes Simon comes across a bit naive I feel). The voice acting to back this up I also felt was top-notch, along with a very nice soundtrack/environmental sound stage.  Graphically the game looked fantastic. Water effects were obviously key and handled very well, including rarely used underwater effects (such as blurring at extreme water pressures) that were very nice indeed. Game mechanics were good as per usual with Frictional's efforts, rewarding exploration with detailed information and useful advice.  The monsters are the main sticking point for some. Yes I agree that they felt, at times, like they had been added because it's Frictional's style and that it added little to some points in the story. Overall however, I felt that the tension generated from the encounters was a benefit to the story arc and made the environment feel a bit more alive and oppressive.  TL;DR: Recommended game. Great story, challenging ideas, nice graphics and sound to go with. Short but sweet and wish there were more out there like it!",

            "review_text": "SOMA is a thriller/horror game from the makers of titles such as Amnesia. If you have played that game or the others by the developer, you pretty much know what you are getting into and if not, I'll try to give you an idea.  You play Simon. He suffers from an illness caused by an accident. You join him as he heads to a doctor who promises to help cure him. After stepping into his brain scanning machine, you are suddenly transported to strange surroundings...  Straight off the bat, I'm going to tell you that I didn't really enjoy this game. Would I recommend it to others? Definately, because I know that others will enjoy it. While trying not to spoil the narrative (and this is a narrative heavy game) I'll try to explain why I didn't like it.   It really comes down to this type of game not being for everyone, but being a very experienced and passionate gamer, things about this game's design really irk me. First, it's the protagonist. Not only is he a shallow, one dimensional, bi-polar yawn-fest, but he is also complete gimp, armed with an I.Q somewhere between Forest Gump and George W,Bush (or is it the other way around). I sat there rolling my eyes and finding myself grunting 'You're a ♥♥♥♥ing special kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aren't you?' when Simon struggles to cope with very simple concepts or is surprised when something happens... EVEN THOUGH IT'S HAPPENED THREE TIMES ALREADY UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think it's an intentional character flaw for him to be a particularly dense, I think just bad writing or a case of the writers overestimating how complicated their game is. For me, it was an annoyance, as the protagonist was always a few steps behind when it came to figuring out the puzzles. More often than not, I figured out what I needed to do in order to solve a problem but wasn't able to carry those actions out as Simon wasn't up to speed and the game wouldn't let me continue before doing a bunch of other stuff first in order to push Simon along. It slowed the game down for me and made me want to charge at the enemies head first to put this cretin out of his misery. And speaking of the monsters:  Sure, it's cool in the beginning when the creepy music plays while your vision goes haywire as enemies draw closer to you, but it doesn't last long. You see, there are no weapons in this game, so beating the monsters just requires knowing HOW they operate. Once you know, it ceases being scary and just becomes tedious being near them. The first monster, for example, you are told how to get around it: When you see it, don't move and whatever you do, don't look at it. I know what you're thinking: 'It can't be that simple, he's just exaggerating.' I'd be thinking the same. But no, that's literally all it is. You have to turn away from it and stand there in the corner staring at the wall much like a little kid covering his face with his hands and saying 'You can't see me now!'. The problem isn't the idea that it's a different game with different mechanics: that's a good thing... but after figuring out how to beat it and waiting for it to VERY slowly waddle past, so I could continue with the game, I found myself just waiting and waiting, looking at Whatsapp, checking my emails on my phone... you know... stuff to fill in the time. My question is: why am I doing this while playing a video game? Shouldn't I be busy doing something and having fun? Seriously, it took me (according to Steam) 13 hours to finish. I'd estimate that about between 1 and 2 hours of that in total were spent with me sitting in a corner, facing a horribly rendered wall while waiting for monsters to get out of my way. Annoying me further was the fact that, though I was sneaking around like a Cat trained in Ninjitsu, remaining hidden from enemies, they would always shift their patrol routes so that they were always close to where I was. I've got no doubt in my mind that this was to keep tension high, but it's so blatantly programmed that way by the developers and shoved under you that it's bordering on insulting.  All of this to me, is just gameplay stuff. No, it's not a pretty game, but I understand that this is not from a AAA developer. No, I don't think that the dialogue is particularly well written (or sometimes voiced, but for the most part that aspect is satisfactory) and no, it's not really my cup of tea as a result. For those of you who are gluttons for bleak, story driven narratives and who aren't ridiculously picky, ridiculously hard to please and cynical old men like me, will no doubt get a kick out of it.  I do recommend this game if you can get over my qualms because I know that many of you will love it, despite it's flaws. The gameplay is original and I know that a great deal of people love these kinds of narratives. For that aspect, I fully recommend it - to other people.",

Non-tl;dr lovers, thanks for sticking around! (Some spoilerinos!)  Last year, I got incredibly hyped that Frictional was making a new horror game, with some very strong Bioshock vibes to boot! I preordered the instant it was available to, waited and watched the weeks go by, and on that fateful day, bought pizza and drinks for what I would hope would be a long night...  My hopes were dashed when I found the game wouldn't run at all. Poor frame rates, artifacting, and several crashes forced my hand to a refund out of anger. I wrote a previous scathing review, and was met with immediate community outrage. I retracted my review, and thought little else of SOMA.  Jump to two weeks ago. I check my Humble Monthly sub to see that SOMA was the game of the month. Figured what the hell, a few buddies said it was fantastic, and it's been patched and fixed well enough now.  Two days later, I got off my computer after two sessions with the game.   When a game gives you enough solid scares to make you keep your desk lamp on, make you question your own morals and ideologies, and leave you with an ending that feels so... bittersweet, it sticks with you.   Admittedly, the plot involving the creatures and monsters of SOMA feels somewhat shoehorned in. A character shows up in the later hours that basically resolves the monster plot, but still shined out to me as a personal favorite. Several monsters had movement and attack patterns that felt difficult to pick up on easily, and I feel that I had to cheese two particular monsters to complete the game. While I later learned their patterns aren't terribly difficult, I still felt somewhat cheated that it wasn't more obvious.  Having a partner for the larger chunk of the game felt somewhat calming, but the separation between points of contact, having to be near a docking terminal to converse, kept tensions extremely high. Indeed, seeing the remnants of a society under the waves, felt far more disturbing to me than the horrors that happened in The Dark Descent, and felt riskier and more personal than I would have preferred.  Having said that, gorgeous environments, stunning, screenshot worthy moments all, amazing sound design, and some fantastic story writing, all make SOMA a horror game you should absolutely play! Just don't expect to leave the same way you go in  8.5/10",

It provides an atmosphere that is almost safe in nature (meaning its kind of hard to die) while at the same time it makes you grip your controller in fear for your life. They mastered the ballance between the repeatitive nature of horror games where you die and restart, then die again and restart, and finally you master the pathing of the enemy and continue on ward. They found the balance of making it seem like a desperate attempt of survival while not destroying the horrific atmosphere. Because of this continous sequence of horrific events you will never feel like you are beating a game, rather you are surviving the atmosphere. It's movie like, and because of that this is the first game I have ever played where you can feel horrified and continue on feeling like every fight was a 'close one'.   The story behind this game cannot go without notice either. It revolves around an idea that has been hinted at before. but never truly exposed and explored in such a manner that it will make you horrified and interested at the same time. It brings to the table a new philosophical debate as to what is life, and what does it mean to be. Without going into spoilers and what not, there are parts in this game that will simply make you shiver not from the hyper-active monsters but from the circumstances and choices your character will be put through.   So for me, this game was exactly what I was looking for. A fun weekend game, with a lot of atmosphere, some horror, and a mystery mixed with thoery that will keep me thinking for a very long time. This game is worth the money, and more. I can't wait to see what Frictional Games will come out with next.",

I think you have to enjoy the story and the themes because the gameplay is a bit boring; the monster encounters are poorly made, and I feel like they don't really work. If you enjoy a philosophical scare/story-focused game, with a lot of dialogue and walking around in a creepy underwater base, I think you'll love Soma, but if you are buying it for the scares and the gameplay, I think you will be quite dissapointed.",

            "review_text": "SOMA is the latest in Frictional Games' horror set, following Penumbra and the Amnesia games. Let me get it out of the way that SOMA is simply not as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I feel its scary 'enough' and should not be missed by fans.  The main character is Simon Jarett, and ordinary Canadian nerd undergoing theapy for a traumatic brain injury. Upon getting a medical scan in Torono, he wakes up somewhere very, VERY far away. The story is obviously inspired from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (the short story, not the game), as well as H.R. Geiger's art. It is complex and tragic, and worth the price of admission alone. There are a few problems with the story, but those are my opinions and I will keep them to myself.  Gameplay is very much similar to Amnesia - A Machine for Pigs. Simon is armed with only a flashlight and his wits, interacting with a handful of characters, solving simple puzzles, reading documents for clues and weaving around dangerous monsters without being seen. This is simply not as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but is still sufficiently scary.  The problem is that in The Dark Descent, some monster events were scripted for cheap shots, while the more effective scares were from the fact that you were in an open field of corridors and room, in which you had to solve puzzles while simultaneously avoiding one active monster in that area with you, leaving you at the mercy of RNG and the monster's AI. SOMA has one, and ONLY one sequence that does the latter, and its excellent, almost in line with Alien Isolation, a game I am too terrified to complete. The rest of the time, monster appearances are fixed, along with their behavior. By the end of the game, you will have most of the monsters wrapped around your finger for the next playthrough, except 'that one awesome part.' In this sense, SOMA is somewhere in between Dark Descent and AMfP, but leans toward the latter.  I'm delighted to have played this, and I would recommend it to anyone. Just don't expect Dark Descent, because you won't get it. Consider SOMA on its own and you should be glad you played it too.",

Thankfully, not much seems to have changed.  For those who haven't had the pleasure of playing Penumbra or Amnesia, all of the games from Frictional Games have a pretty unique method of control where you use the mouse to imitate actions, such as grabbing a door and sliding the mouse to open it or pulling down a lever. It's sort of counter-intuitively intuitive in that it adds a great deal of immersion by representing the inherent unintuitive nature of our bodies compared to the telepathy that's represented by most games where you just press E to open a door, and it also adds a lot of tension to the gameplay, making the difference between frantically grabbing for a lever and pulling down as fast as you physically can to seal a door off from a monster and just running in and tapping a button. Every time they make a new game I always get worried that they're going to change it, because a lot of people complain about it, and I was doubly worried that it would be removed here due to it also being on a console. Thankfully, it hasn't been altered, and hopefully never will be.  But anyone who has played a previous Frictional game already knows all about that, so how does it compare to the previous games? Gameplay-wise, it takes some somewhat unwelcome hints from A Machine for Pigs in that you have no resources to manage except health and your flashlight never runs out of energy, but despite the lack of inventory the game does still have a fair amount of puzzles to go through. But unlike AMFP, SOMA has a pretty typical Frictional Games amount of enemies to cower behind a box from, which was a welcome return. One noteworthy improvement over Amnesia is that the game no longer puts the game in slowmo to dump a narration on you every time you enter a new room, and instead spaces out the narrative in the form of logs and notes in a more traditional manner.   The biggest difference from their previous games is that the protagonist is now voiced, and has discussions with other characters throughout the game. Some people may not like this, and I personally hated the idea when I first realized that he wasn't silent, but the main character grew on me pretty quickly, and by the end of it I liked his inclusion in the game. The dialogue between the characters does a pretty good job at balancing things out so that it's present enough to let you learn to care about the characters, but not enough to diminish the atmosphere or remove the sense of loneliness that the game builds.   Overall, I thought SOMA was a pretty worthy addition to Frictional's catalogue. I don't think I could put it above Penumbra, which I still hold as one of my favorite horror games, but it surpassed Amnesia in almost every way for me. At $30 it might be a bit expensive depending on your tastes, but it's worth getting sooner or later for any horror fan.",

Sound quality is 10/10 really went well with the fantastic atmosphere the game provides, reminded me alot of the first bioshock. All in all a pretty interesting game with some edge of your seat moments.   Pro's-  Edge of your seat moments Excellent sound and atmosphere Fairly well optimized at least in my experience controls felt good Graphics are good not amazing but good.  Cons Not enough scary moments lots of padding e.g finding thing to go here then finding other thing that needs to go here. beginning of the story was a little weak didnt explain alot.   Final score. 8/10 - would try to flush my computer chair down my apartment tiolet again.",

It has a wonderful art style and the premise has a ton of potential. Maybe this premise delivers in the end, but I'll never know. At the end of the day, SOMA is a video game and it has to be fun to play. In that way, by this reviewer's tastes, it falls flat on it's face.   Some gamers might praise a game like this for 'expecting more of the player' or 'not holding your hand.' That is true of some games, such as The Legend of Zelda or Dark Souls. The difference in my view is that those games contain obtuse systems that become incredibly rewarding once you master them. SOMA, on the other hand, is a narrative heavy game that kills it's own pacing and delivery with labyrinthine level design and clumsy stealth mechanics.  Perhaps I will return to SOMA sometime in the future. Maybe then it will click for me. If it does, I'll be sure to update this review to give it a fair shake. For the time being however, SOMA has left me with serious buyer's remorse and to reflect anything else in my review would be dishonest.

We'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers; the less said about the plot, the better, as it's worth the ride.  If you're after a linear story and streamlined game experience that does a good job immersing you in the world they created, and don't mind a one-and-done game experience telling a very speicifc story, I'd certainly recommend this.  However, gameplay-wise, the game can best be summarized as a 'crouching / waiting simulator', as you move from room to room or area to area and almost universally simply crouch and wait to avoid the enemies.  While the enemies are interesting at first because they're new to you, they devolve into an overused 'walking potato' which is not fun to get around (slow, random) and cheats in its movement in order to create drama and tension, which in turn creates more waiting. Distractions and any interactions with the environmental props to bait and lure enemies simply doesn't work, meaning you don't have any options but to crouch... and wait.  There's no inventory mechanics to speak of. You use items automatically when necessary and only when they're the solution to something. There's a few puzzles along the way that are fun for how long they last, but generally you're back to crouching and waiting when an enemy is around. The moments of pure exploration are really more fun than the encounter sections.  If you enjoy heavily directed narrative experiences and are more in this for the story (and it's a good one) then this is worth your time. However, if you're looking for a GAME experience that has more interesting enemy mechanics and interactions, seriously play Alien : Isolation instead.",

The setting was magnificent, easily as awe-inspiring as Rapture from BioShock etc. The ambiance also raised comparisons with the Dead Space series. But in both these games you actually did something, you felt more involved than a button pressing tourist.  The philosophical nature of the plot was a great idea but it did not hook me... I am sure a younger audience might enjoy a few 'Mind = Blown' moments but there was nothing new or challenging IMHO.

If the game would have involved less excessive walking around, maybe I would have had more patience for the 'bad guys', but it really just came down to a desire to move things along.

Certain mechanics and plot devices are just thrown at the player and neither the player nor the NPCs bother to question them. Sure, hand holding would be bad it is still never clear what rules SOMA's world lives by. SOMA raises a lot of questions but does not bother answering them or at least showing any kind of author's viewpoint.   Another big disappointment comes from the fact that gameplay directly counteracts the story. Attempting to listen to audio logs gets you killed by enemies with 200/20 hearing, for example. At the same time the enemies are hardly interactive and, being also invincible, become more of an immovable object than something you can outsmart. Most of the time the best course of action is to sit until you can no longer hear the enemy and then make a break for the next door hoping it actually allows you to progress, since it's impossible to have a plan.  The pacing is also heavily damaged by lack of clear objectives or feedback. While it is realistic in the setting of the game, more often than not it feels like the game simply wants the player to guess what he's supposed to achieve at any given moment.  All in all I find it really hard to compliment SOMA on anything in particular. The graphics and sound are okay, it does not crash to desktop... ...anymore, there are no loading screens.

A game about life, choices, morality, phylosophy... it makes you think, it makes you grow your mind. The game starts pretty easy and then builds up the tension and the story. 'It really makes you think what it means to be human'. In the end you reach the peak.  The monsters are nicely designed, not hard to understand. I only had a problem with the 'last' monster (won't spoil it but it's actually the one before the last), which I couldn't understand really. The monster sections were actually not long. Unlike the reviews say though, it doesn't require a try and fail approach to understand them, but just taking care of reading the notes and listening to what the characters say. The game has pretty many jump scares, even if some are small, they are mostly unexpected. You'll build up adrenaline with monsters around anyway.  The story...what can I say... you'll love the twists. They are just epic. The story is just AWESOME. The choices you take, even if they don't affect the game really much, will make you think very hard, they will question who you really are, and what you think. I won't spoil anything. I will just say the end will... shock you.  The graphics are cool, especially in the underwater parts. I let you judge them yourself, but they are a big improvement from HPL2  The sounds and music... I don't have to say anything about this. The author name says it all. They are one of the most important things in this game. Just superb. I have to add: unlike the reviews say, I find Simon voice REALLY, but REALLY REALISTIC. Simon will not talk everytime. The game will leave you the silence for your mind to speak.  I recommend this game for real. Don't miss the opportunity to play this, and don't watch videos if you REALLY want to enjoy the story, and the game itself.

Lots of legitimate scares, with a wonderfully creepy undertone. I felt rewarded for exploration with new little pieces of the world to understand. Most of the puzzles were well designed and made me feel a little smart for solving them. Sometimes I had to go online to figure out what to do, only to realize I should have known all along if I was really paying attention. The story is very interesting, and the ending... oh man. A really great ending. Short but super sweet, beautifully crafted environments and wonderful voice work... pretty good puzzles, great story, and a hell of an atmosphere... oh and pretty much the best sound design I have ever experienced in a video game... all makes this game an absolute recommend.",

The monster is SLOW, but when it gets close to you, your 'mind' starts shutting down and you start lagging. I love this fact as you feel like you can get away any moment, but he just keeps on closing in!  the story is VERY rich, so do NOT skip any cut scenes and it's really philosophical.... great job there!  graphics are amazing!  all in all, I highly recommend this game, not as a horrifying horror game, but as a creepy one.",

The main point of this game is to question what it means to be human- what is real and what is fake... And for you to explore your own humanity- your own existence. Again, if this freaks you out, steer clear lol It's going to be a pushing point bascally from the start. Now that we've gotten our warning out of the way, allow me to say that this game is AWESOME. What many people forget when they say this game isn't as scary as Amnesia is that there are no custom stories yet where new and fresh scares can rise up to keep you entertained. Let's face it, if you thought Amnesia was scary, this is going to be basically just as scary. The monsters have decent variance and the atmosphere is dark and claustriphobic. Past the scare regard, this game incorperates two things that Amnesia wasn't very good at. What are these elements? Character building and puzzles. Don't get me wrong, Amnesia had puzzles, sure, but they were often times a frustrating mess, and there was basically zero character interaction. In SOMA, you get to see our two main characters Simon and Catherine connect and grow while receiving background info about what the hell happened to put planet Earth and Pathos II into the state it's in. Not forgetting about the puzzles, the only thing stopping them from being solved is you. Every puzzle makes sense and is layed out well enough for anyone to solve it IF THEY'RE NOT TRYING TOO HARD. Come on- we all do it. We try to hard when the answer was pretty easy and we struggle through what should have taken no time at all. Often times you'll stumble on the answer without really even trying if you just keep looking lol All in all, SOMA is a worthy successor to Amnesia and I can't wait to see what kind of awesome custom stories fans come up with (and will hopefully be creating my own in due time.) 10/10 - IGN. 11/10 with rice",

Definitely did not get boring or drag out too long. Some of the puzzles, enemies &amp; exploration can be confusing/frustrating but I think it stays within the bounds of what makes sense. Fairly short, but it's of the 'short and sweet' flavour. You may feel that your choices have no impact on the game, but the point is that your choices should have an impact on  you .

Gameplay is relatively linear but you don't mind because the story keeps you engaged throughout.

The storyline is great, and makes you think about conciousness and existence (especially at the end of the game).

Hours after I finished I was still thinking about the decisions I made    Especially involving killing the last living human being in the Tau Infirmary    and what had happened in the game.

Here are my highlights  Playtime: I'm putting this first because it's the most irritating. I read and listened to absolutely everything I could get my hands on and still managed to beat the game in *4.8 hours*. I'm pretty disappointed in how short this thing is.  Horror/Scares: What can I say, it's Frictional so the atmosphere and horror aspects are top-notch. Just wish there was more of it.  Puzzles and the Environment The puzzles are infrequent and easy. Yes, you can manipulate many things in the environment (one lesson learned from AMFP), but the items don't come in handy. There's no inventory to speak of as you are only ever carrying a couple of items which appear when they are needed. Why no inventory? Why not maybe some puzzles involving items gathered from the environment? Why does this game have to be so easy?  Story: The story is good, but obvious. It is revealed much too quickly. The ending provides nothing; you finish your objective and that's it, good work, we're done here, go home. There's no mystery or suspense; you know who everyone is, what you're doing, and where you're going. By the time the ending comes you aleady know it.   I'm doomed to compare everything Frictional does to Dark Decent / Penumbra and that's probably why this game is disappointing to me. SOMA didn't live up to Frictional's potential. Given its price, I'm still recommending it as a nice survival horror pick to run through in a couple nights.",

SOMA focuses most of its attention on the story and its underlying commentary on perception and reality, which is great for those who truly enjoy lore and really 'getting into' a game. Overall, I think SOMA was a great scary story, perhaps even among the best to date. I'd say a more reasonable price would be $20-$25, but it is still worth the money. 8.2/10",

Yes there are parts in the game where you are so scared you want curl up into a ball and stop playing, but that is not the main focus of the game. One thing that people thought was dissapointing was that no matter what choices you made, you got the same ending. But, the choices that are presented to you arent to change the outcome of the game, but to challenge the player into thinking of 'ethical' or 'philosophical' questions. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!

I'm mostly an FPS guy but I enjoy good single player and good stories and this was both. I felt helpless at times because it was primarily an evasion and sneaking around game. This made it frustrating at times where I had to stop playing and come back later in tough spots. Overall I recommend it for the experience and the story. If you are a thinker, this game will leave you with some thoughts to ponder. It's not worth top dollar but if you pick it up for a reasonable price, it is recommended.

The story plays out like one of the better Black Mirror episodes, a philosophical tale of what it means to be human with new technological advances around every corner and it tells it with great finesse. Even when the twists are predictable, it feels like the game expected you to figure them out before the protagonist does and presents them in a beautiful way. With the mod installed and with time to fully explore and appreciate the place we're thrown in the game plays like the most atmospheric walking sim made so far, so if you enjoyed games like Gone Home and Firewatch do consider playing it with the mod yourself (if you actually do enjoy the monsters though, more power to you).

SOMA is nothing like Amnesia, story, objectives, characters are all amazingly well made to suit and fit every inch of the game.   You will feel totally emerged into the game once it really kicks off, you will be scared, you will feel lost, and unsecure in every step you take throughout the game. SOMA has a unique world of it's own, some people may think by the trailer it follows some aspects of the world in BIOSHOCK, but not at all. The ocean you are in, is agressive, held together by a virus, cancer named WAU, and has a far more deeper visual design, it feels like an abandoned space station lost in the abyss, where something went terribly wrong, and it is haunted by it's own creators.  The game lasted me just over 10 hours, I played it out as 3 hours per night, which made the game even more exicting to get back to everyday.  I would recommend this game, and yes, it's scary, a different type of scare than Amnesia, the scare in this game isn't here to make you jump, it's here to make your body shiver and send a cold wave through your spine.  A real Masterpiece.",

Being the same studio that developed the Penumbra series and Amnesia: The Dark Decent, Frictional has nailed it once again with SOMA. Part of the horror comes from the monsters that lurk in the halls of Pathos-II, but the other part comes from the feeling of dread as you learn more about the world around you. This is a fairly ambitious work of science fiction, and it delivers beautifully.  I only have two gripes with this game. One, the load times are bad sometimes. Initial load when you haven't played in a while can be upwards of 3-4 minutes. And in-game, the game will freeze (very) occasionally while a larger section is loaded or while the game is saved. Two, I wanted it to be longer. I haven't been this scared since I played Amnesia, and I loved every minute of it.

The environments reange appropriately from dark, cramped, and claustrophobic to uncomfortably wide-open. The creatures are horrifying and diverse. The sound design is creepy and sometimes unsettling enough to make you want to take your headphones off every now and then just so you can actually breathe. And the story and character progression really leaves you thinking for sometime even after your done playing. Overall, I say ignore the nay-sayers and 'purists' who say nothing could beat Amnesia: TDD. This is not Amnesia, this is Soma; it's an entirely different beast, and what I consider to be Frictional Games' magnum opus. Seriously, get the game and go into it with a clear mind.

I have very high expectations when it comes to Frictional games and they never cease to deliver what they promise the community. Amnesia rocked the horror genre years ago, by striking fear and tension into those who dared even touch it. Soma however, takes a different turn. Instead of hiding in the closet and keeping your cheeks as clenched as possible, lest you suffer the ol' servant reach around, Soma fills you with dread as you walk down its dark corridors, with an ambient music setting, and a complex story in which exploration of every little detail will shed new light onto that story. You are thrown into Soma with absolutely no warning, and every step you take, you feel both intrigue and dread out of the fear that you have no idea what is making that noise down the hall, and intrigue by the story that compells you to move forward to see it to its end. To answer the questions youll be asking yourself throughout the game. The game is deep, the game is thought provoking, the game is suspensful. This game is without a doubt one of my favorite horror games of all time. the only con i really have for this game is that the voice acting COULD have been better for Simon. In some cases he shows little emotion. that and the teleporting monster. ♥♥♥♥ that guy in particular. 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "Okay, so I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not a regular review writer. But, I am a glutton for punishment, and have a desire to find good horror games.  I wasn't a fan of Amnesia. I know, I'm a bad person, but I had my reasons. The monsters were overbearing, and had rather cheesy looking designs, and we saw them way too often. The entire thing was just really hopeless and kind of made me stop caring about Daniel or the story.  In contrast, SOMA is all about hope, finding that light at the end of the hellish tunnel. The player character talks, but not constantly. His little quips help the game keep flowing, as do all the little bits of lore you can find. Lore usually comes from three places: dead bodies, disabled comms, or computers. The first two are voice acted, listening to conversations of characters who came before you. The last is obviously just reading some text dumps, but still neat for story-junkies like myself.  In addition to these little bits of characters, the game drops one main companion on you fairly early. This is actually done quite tactfully, in the classic 'voice with an internet connection' sense, they speak to you over radio most of the time. Now, this might sound like a really easy thing to fall flat, but the interactions between the two characters are AMAZING. Great dialouge and chemistry fill the otherwise dull 'exploration' segments where you aren't running for your life from twisted creatures.  And said horror times? They're all rather tense, without being omnipresent. This means each encounter is unique, and you've had plenty of time to calm down before being face with another creature hoping to rip your brain out. The enemy AI isn't the most impressive, but they're smarter than the Amnesia monsters. And, perhaps most notably, there's no hiding under tables or in wardrobes. Your only option is to run. And run you do, the levels are crafted wonderfully, with multiple options to get through the situations your tossed into.  But, what really drove me forward, and made me push through these segments was the characters. The PC and his companion are both usually silent during these sections, lest they attract unwanted attention. And, for this reason, I HAD to push through them, so I could get to the next bits of dialouge, so I could experiance the rest of this wonderful story.  And, when I finally escaped the last monster, solved the last puzzle, and pieced together the last plot twist? I was met with an ending that did not dissapoint. A conclusion that, while bittersweet, was the perfect cherry atop the adventure.  Do I have my complains? Definately. Several segments seemed to drag on, especially around the mid-game. Both Theta and Omnicron felt like I spent a lot of time wandering around without clear direction, and the puzzles at Omnicron were a lot of trial and error before I understood what I was supposed to do. And the final stretch of the game, while intense, was also aggrivating. The only hints you actually get on how to deal with the 'final boss' don't really seem to work as you expect, and at several points it felt like I was in the hands of the game's RNG.  And the existance of comm centers and lore bits during chase scene felt very aggrivating. I wanted to stop and get these bits of information, I wanted to learn the story. But the proximity of monsters prevented me, and made me feel punished for my desire to know more.  Similiarly there are several things that are never actually explained, mostly in terms of game mechanics. I will stop my mostly spoiler-avoidance to say one thing. THE BIG GLOWING BLOBS HEAL YOU, BUT CUT OFF NEARBY POWER.  Why do I feel the need to say this? Because it is NEVER explained. Your companion tells you to stop touching them, and the PC insists they are helping him. But you never actually get any clear answer to what they do without extensive trial-and-error.  But, these gripes aside, I will still recommend this game for it's intense story and atmosphere, even if the gameplay feels a little lacking...",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying one thing: Wow.  This game is special. It starts off... decent. Enough to keep you going for an hour or two but it doesn't feel like it'll be the truly special experience that Amnesia: The Dark Descent was and honestly, it never is. Simply put this game is... not... Amnesia and it mostly isn't trying to be. It's its own thing. If you compare this game to Amnesia then you will be disappointed. It's not nearly as scary at least in a supernatural kind of way. I won't tell you how it's scary beyond that it's atmospheric as I feel that would be a spoiler but if you accept this game as it is you are in for one of the best gaming experiences of your life.  No... the games not perfect. Not by a mile. This games one similarity to The Dark Descent is the way it handles monsters. You hide from them and try to distract them while tip toeing around the level. This mostly works decently in SOMA but there are bugs and bad design decisions with the AI. This didn't happen in the walkthrough I watched so it may be a rare bug but one of the monsters stopped moving and reacting to me completely in one level. It didn't react to sound, light or me running all over the place as loud as I could but it just stayed in the door way I needed to get by. The only way I could get past it was to stand directly in the doorway and let it kill me, then when I 'woke back up' (you rarely lose progress when you die) the AI would spawn somewhere else glitch still in tact. Made for a pretty not scary monster but this was only for one level.  Another moster related issue I had happened near the end of the game. One of the last levels is very narrow with few places to run and hide. This meant the monster would frequently be absolutely impossible to get by even as it was patrolling. To make matters worse when it killed me (or knocked me out) it would spawn literally 15-20 feet infront of me and kill me instantly (you die after getting knocked out 2-3 times).  SOMA is a game relies heavily on atmospheric and situational scares. There are jump scares but on top of being rare they are very well done. I don't want to go into much detail here but for this game to be scary you REALLY have to engross yourself in it. Absorb every detail, read every log, watch every video. Fortunately unlike so many other games with audio logs there aren't very many in SOMA and they're generally very interesting. Regrettably you can't move very far while listening to them. But taking the time and doing as much as possible will make what unfolds in this game matter.  I only just finished this game about 30 minutes ago but it's very hard for me to not declare this the best story I've experienced in a game. I'm sure upon further reflection I'll realize that Life is Strange is still the best ;) but right now I feel that emptiness you feel when you just finished an incredible TV or book series (A Song of Ice and Fire better NEVER END!!!). I'm sure there are plot holes. This is a horror/sci-fi hybrid after all. Both generas practically require plot holes as much of the content is impossible in real life. If you can forgive such things this is truly a great story. To me the absolute most important part of any story is the ending and that just happens to be SOMAs greatest strength. I could not imagine a way they could have ended it better.  The voice acting for the lead character did cause some eye rolling a few times. Same with the script. It's not an even package. However all key story moments were acted and scripted exceptionally as far as I can recall.   I've noticed something that seems to be quite common amongst water based settings in video games such as SOMA and Bioshock: Above water, the water effects suck. While walking around normal open areas the water shader looks flat, water moves unrealistically and splash sprites are pretty bad. However, as with Bioshock, the moment you go underwater the game looks absolutely stunning. The attention to detail in SOMA while underwater is second to none. I felt like I was watching a scene from Titanic when it shows the sunken ship. That's exactly what under water looks like in SOMA and the way everything moves and sounds and feels so heavy elevates this games setting well above sea level (sorry I had to :P ). The more traditional graphics such as corridors and the like also mostly excel. One thing I would have liked however is higher resolution textures. They're not bad but they're not as good as they could be.  As far as engine performance I was mildly disappointed. I'm running a GTX 980 Ti, Intel Core i7 4790K at 5760x1080 (that's 3 monitors side by side) installed on an SSD. While I absolutely averaged 60 FPS with very rare dips there is constant microstuttering from beginning to end. Also, while the game looks GREAT on three monitors and the UI adjusts properly to the extra screen space it's not perfect. The edges of the screen warp noticably but MAN does that peripheral vision help in a game like this!! I can only imagine what VR would do. Also there is occasional VERY BAD texture pop in.   In closing: ****ing wow!! What a wild and thought provoking ride! At $30 I feel like I owe the developers more money.",

I actually got interested in playing it about when it came out, but held off till I got it in a monthly humble bundle. It proved to be worth much more than what I paid for it.  I guess it's no surprise SOMA is labeled a horror game, but it's just as much a sci-fi game. However, it's so much deeper than just a solid horror/sci-fi title. It is indeed about what it means to be human in addition to a one of a kind deepsea adventure. It's very rare that you experience this kind of clever and insightful storytelling in a video game.  Beyond the superb story you get one hell of a gameplay experience. You feel a constant looming threat and the isolation is absolute. When you're not exploring abandoned habitats, you are traversing a simply gorgeous underwater environment. Venturing ever deeper you can't help but be amazed at the world around you. The path to Tau (and the station itself) has stayed with me after completing the game. What an amazing experience! I definitely recommend that you play this alone, in the dark, to get the full SOMA experience.",

            "review_text": "I'm reviewing this mostly for OLD SCHOOL ADVENTURE GAMERS.  POSITIVES:   1. As an exploration game, this game is top-notch. The visuals are stunning--beautifully rendered and artistic. It is worth playing just to wander around and watch the story unfold. The story is interesting, although the 'ruminations on what it means to be human' trope is well-trod territory (see: pretty much any film or book about artificial intelligence).  2. It does what you want adventure games to do: immerse you (in this case, literally!) in another world. It's as if the movie The Abyss were a postapocalyptic game.  NEGATIVES:   1. No challenging puzzles (as a Myst fan, I prefer the games that balance story with engaging puzzles). The puzzles here were mostly 'How do I get the machine to turn on/the door to open?' over and over again. They were very easy, usually just a matter of finding the right switch. The only times I got mildly stuck were when I couldn't find a hidden entrance (because it was hidden, duh!).  2. The monsters were more annoying than scary. They interrupted gameplay (you're exploring, and you have to stop and hide and soforth). I turned them off (used godmode), because I just don't care (I'm an old school adventure gamer; I don't want to shoot things or hide from things).  3. If I'm honest, I found the story pretty darn bleak, and I found myself wishing for more flexibility (alternate endings and so on). The linearity of the story line forced you to make certain choices, whether you would have IRL or not. There are *some* choices you can make, but they make zero impact on the ending or the main story. They're mostly an attempt to force you to have some deep thoughts, man.  CONCLUSION:   A bit expensive, although with the neat visuals I can see why. If you have the cash, I say go for it. I did, and I don't regret the purchase, although would I replay this in a few years, as I have with the Myst and Tex Murphy games? Probably not.     ",

            "review_text": "When I first started playing the game, it was rather underwhelming. The first monsters you meet are lumbering, easy to evade, and most importantly, not frightening. It actually placed doubt in my mind, thinking that Frictional screwed up again (ok, A Machine for Pigs was a joint effort, but still). After playing through the game, I almost feel as if this was intentional. In Amnesia, they waited quite a while to introduce the first monster, slowly building the tension. This time, I believe they aimed to lower your guards with easy monsters, only to get the opportunity to truly surprise you. It worked for me.   The game is visually beautiful. The environments, from each station to the terrifying abyss, each have their own style and atmosphere. Elements are recycled throughout the game, yes, but not overdone or in a manner which is disruptive. The sounds are executed flawlessly to build tension. This did not seem to be as scary as Amnesia, but that’s perfectly understandable. Amnesia was my first true horror game, and obviously as the first it will have the largest effect. Soma had its share of horror, with different monsters having different methods of evasion. What works for one monster will result in your death from the next. If you miss the clues, you may have to tempt the monster to figure out its kinks. The flashlight in the game does not have a battery (or oil) and thus does not run out. I am undecided if I like this or not. On one hand, I do love my flashlights and want to use them whenever I want. On the other, the need to consume the power sparingly added to Amnesia. Do I risk running out of oil for a little bit of comfort for the moment?   The story tests psychological and physiological thinking. You will encounter many scenarios that are morally confusing. It tests your capability of thinking. And to that, I say wonderful! To have a game so actively draw intelligent thought is never a bad thing. It is open and interpretive, changing through perception. I’ve heard criticism of the game where it was mentioned that the game seemed more sci-fi than horror, with the horror element being secondary, an afterthought. Is it so bad to have a horror game that delivers a strong, deep story that stands with gaming’s best? No, of course not. Horror works as Slender, but it thrives as Soma.  The characters are few, but very well done. The dialogue was well written and the emotion was portrayed effectively, whether it be hope, hopelessness, or whatever else we humans feel. Not much more to add there, is there? I was actually surprised to see the credits after the game as there weren’t too many people that worked on it. To those that did, I selfishly hope they never leave the industry. The voice actors too deserve recognition for their work.   I have not tried the feature yet, but mods are included. As it were in Amnesia: The Dark Descent (and not in A Machine for Pigs), the game supports custom stories from players through the Steam Workshop. The main story takes around 10 hours to complete, with the potential for many more through mods.   Does this deserve its own paragraph? Probably not, but I like the death and health mechanic. What I mean is, it takes TWO hits to die. And after the first, the monster relocates giving you the chance to rethink it and try again. Why do I like this? Because a horror game loses its appeal when you have to keep on redoing the same section. After being hit once, you become slower and your vision blurs. To heal, you simply insert your fist into these weird robot holes scattered around the game. Sounds weird, but there is logic behind it in the story. I think Frictional paid attention to the fans from their previous games and found a nice balance in difficulty while maintaining the horror aspect.  Now, the negatives. What did I not like about the game? Well, for one, it crashed around a dozen times throughout my gameplay. It seems this is not a common problem through from some research. Maybe it was my computer acting up for all of those times I accidently fell asleep and left it on through the night. The puzzles were quite simple (although I am a genius, so maybe that was it), and they kept the light-flashing-when-a-monster-is-nearby mechanic from A Machine for Pigs that I never liked. Lastly, perhaps the biggest negative that I’ve heard complaints about from others, the fact that you miss out on some of the surroundings simply due to the aggressiveness of the monster. I know for a fact (as I’ve seen others play it) that I missed some things (although I then got to see it), and it’s simply disappointing to miss out on any of the story. To remedy that point would prove difficult, I understand, but nonetheless it is there.   So, yes, if you read this far, I recommend the game thoroughly. If you’re new to horror, give it a shot. If you’re unsure about horror, try a free horror game to see if it suits your fancy, like Cry of Fear or Penumbra (also developed by Frictional. One of them is free, although older and a lot more clunky).",

The monsters are scary, and they stick around; in Amnesia, they showed up, scared you, and ran off. The story of SOMA is deeper and more compeling. The implications are much more interesting (contemplation of the definition of self). Whether you end up agreeing or not, if you liked amnesia, you'll enjoy this game.

            "review_text": "SOMA, the most recent game by Amnesia's developers Frictional Games, can be best described as a hybrid between a walking simulator with puzzles and a horror videogame. The player takes control of Simon Jarett, a Canadian affected by a brain condition, as he's misteriously moved all of a sudden in an elaborated scientific base at the bottom of the sea with no other human being in sight.  The gameplay elements that made the main beef of both Amnesia: The Dark descent and Amnesia: A machine for pigs return for this third game as well, albeit significantly tuned down, to the point that SOMA has more in common with a walking simulator than a survival horror with puzzles: said puzzles often revolve around interacting with computers or other buttons, so item manipulation is kept to a minimum. Simon also has a health system of some sort: depending on how much health he has left, monsters can either knock him down for a few seconds or outright kill him. Health is recovered by interacting with nodes in the environment and its exact amount at any given time is near impossible for the player to determine, since there isn't any kind of UI element aside for a very simple inventory screen (which, truth be told, isn't exactly essential).  Much like its predecessors, SOMA also pits the player against dangerous monster he/she must avoid in order to advance. Such encounters in this game are much less of a focus than in the previous ones: you'll have to deal with only one monster at a time in each sequence and its presence will be pretty much announced to you, so you'll know when to start crouching. To the developers' merit, however, every monsters you'll avoid has a different pattern to it you must discover before even trying to get past it.  SOMA's main attractive however is its story, which deals with important themes like self-awarness and the very definition of the self through a very interesting plot, also helped by a very consistent and enthralling sci-fi atmosphere. Personally, I think this is the main reason to buy this game, even if, I must really say, the main Amnesia formula has gotten thinner and thinner over the years",

Listen to your buddy talking about it, and get the game. 3. Don't bought the game, because you just don't want to, or maybe because it's not the type of game you would play afterall... and then of course, feel regretful about it sometime later about it, when people start talking about this masterpiece and... you know... get it. 4.

Just the right amount of light and dark, with plenty of cool effects to make the whole experience seem real.   I'm a huge fan of the Myst series, so for me the exploration and puzzle-solving were the best parts. The game would have been fine without the 'monsters.'

Soma has some serious moments that end up making the player feel guilty and leave the given player with the painful memory of that same dreadful moment that just had to be done. These moments are then tied with some creepy monsters that will of course try to kill you and a bit of lore to discover what happened. As you progress, you will figure out more about yourself and how you ended up at the bottom of the ocean, yet as the game goes on the creepier it gets. The game is made by the creators of the Amnesia series so be warned that if you did not enjoy the Amnesia series than you may not enjoy this game for dealing with monsters are closely tied together, yet if you enjoyed the series and want more of the Amnesia scares than get this game.

I can't say much without spoiling anything, but the game is exceptionally detailed, and looks gorgeous.  All that said, some of the horror elements of gameplay got annoying. I enjoyed getting chased by baddies a couple times, but I died often enough it made me wish this game was more of a walking simulator than a 'run away' simulator.

As you might know Frictional Games has already produced amazing titles for the horror genre such as Penumbra and Amnesia which should tell you that even before you purchase the game that it's up to par with the quality of their previous titles.  Now taking into consideration the other key elements like the sci-fi and philosophical aspects that are present, if you are a fan of games that have either one of these core concepts then I also highly recommend this for you.  What's the core gameplay like you might ask? It's very similar to Amnesia where you must solve puzzles, gather items, and explore in order to advance the story while at the same time avoiding monsters that you cannot fight but ones that you can outsmart.  All of this gameplay is of course surrounded and caked with an intriguing story. You play as Simon Jarrett, a man who walks into a clinic for a prototype brain scan that could hold the key to saving his life. Seconds later however, he is whisked away to a world that he knows nothing about. I personally bonded very well with Simon as well as the other main character that you meet on your adventure and have a feeling that most of you will as well. At every major area in the game there is a chance for you to discover more about the plot through searching various nooks and crannies.

Play it in short sittings; and when i'm getting to uncomfortable i'll take a breat and shoot some ball in Rocket league until my heartbeat is back at a normal pace again and the adrenaline has worn off.  I'll probably need a few weeks before completing this game, but i don't mind about that, it'll only keep me longer busy with the game, enjoying it for a long long time! I've got amnesia too, didn't have so much fear/anxiety problems with that one when it was was released. Probably because the realism factor in Soma is much much higher (almost looks like a move at a lot of times) compared to Amnesia; although that also looked very good in it's day. But in Amnesia i always had the idea i was in a videogame, with Soma i sometimes forget that and experience it as real, because of the realism...   I can only recommend this game, even if you're like me, not a real fan of horror-games; this can still be a nice experience; though you'd best play it in shorter parts when the fear/anxiety starts to kick in... the game saves almost everywhere so taking a break at any given point should not be any problem.",

Fictional Games have once again proven that they are the best in the industry when it comes to tension and atmosphere. A welcome surprise is the emphasis on beautifully engineered sound design. There are locations in this game that simply must be experienced because of it. You will never see or hear anything like it in any other game. It is that good.  Seriously, if Frictional Games doesn't get some kind of award for their sound design, the industry is beyond saving.  The story could be considered even better than the audio and video in the game. It starts off pretty ambiguous and makes more sense around the same time as its moral compass starts to veer south. Without giving anything away, its themes on existentialism may stick with you long after you've finished the game. It's one of the few games where I just zoned out for a few hours and thought about not just the fate of the characters, but the fate of the world the characters lived in.  This is the kind of game that appeals to both psychological horror fans and sci-fi buffs. Make no mistake, this is not a game about hiding from scary monsters. If you're looking for that kind of experience, Slender or Amnesia might work better for you. There's no hiding from the horrors that exist in SOMA.",

From what I've seen, read, and thought of, this game is a true 10/10.   The storyline is truly thought-provoking, and I totally dig that. This game will make you question yourself in so many ways! Everything is beautiful in this game, from the story, to the art, to the music, to the physical in game attributes.  I 10/10 recommend this game for anyone who is really into this sci-fi type of horror stuff.  At first glance, you can maybe be reminded of Dead Space, with the whole 'spaceship' type stuff. Don't be fooled though, since it's definitely different from Dead Space!  Thank you, Frictional Games, for unveiling this masterpiece. &lt;3",

            "review_text": "[Editted: Posted as two parts to get around Steam character length review submission bug]  Recommended, but with severe caveats - this game is far from the perfection of the genre, as it is it feels 'adequate' to me. Throughout playing it I was reminded of (what are to me) similarly atmospheric yet far superior games like system shock, metro last light, bioshock, dead space, etc which is not what I want when playing a new game, I want to become immersed and to think solely about it. From the philosophical and narrative perspectives, I found The Talos Principle to be far more thorough in its exposition and it generated a lot more of an emotional response from me.  I think Soma is worth picking up on a sale, and playing through once, but I wont ever rave to a friend about how brilliant it is (since it isnt) and I wont ever replay it, which is a sham because it feels close to a brilliant game, but has just missed the mark.  Pros:     Nice sci fi story, which tries to ask a bunch of philosophical questions in 'show me' format by giving you A/B options, neither of which has any in game consequences, but they should hopefully cause you the player to reflect on your choices. I really enjoyed the incredibly bleak scenario, where the best outcome could be considered horrific.    I liked that the main antagonist WAU was not evil or misguided.      OK graphics, music and level design, great sound effects, leading to overall OKish atmosphere.   When you arent being shambled after by enemies, its quite nice wandering about enjoying the scenery and reading stuff.    I love the level of physical interaction with stuff, even if all of it is pointless, it just makes the world seem likea more real place.   Cons:     The protagonist is a completely ignorant idiot who cant grasp something when it is spelled out for him repeatedly (and well after you the player will have figured it out by yourself). Super frustrating being stuck in a stupid persons mind/body. I liked that the other main characters are smart and particularly when one becomes frustrated with our characters blatant stupidity.    There is just one ending/outcome regardless of the choices you make.    Enemies are incredibly boring. They have very predictable behaviors, and you cant 'hide' from them which would be quite nice for generating tension, you can only crawl away. I had literally no tension while playing Soma, which I wasnt expecting, it was quite disappointing! I was sometimes bored while I waited out the enemies routines.    I think the rigid body physics in air is generally excellent everything else was quite inconsistent. You dont have a body except when climbing ladders etc, you dont ever cast a shadow, items dont cast shadows from various light sources (this I feel is a major missed opportunity to generate atmosphere and immersion), you spend a bunch of times underwater but the physics was completely off, etc. Probably known limitations of the engine or performance decisions, but would have been nice if we could enable nicer 'stuff' through options at a performance cost.    The characters talk about 'coin tosses' at a couple of points but this is completely wrong. The processes being discussed are deterministic. The only potential 'coin toss refers' to    what perspective the character has after he gets copied    which is also deterministic for the purpose of the game (determined by the developers).         I dont think the death mechanic was necessary, given the plot. I would have found the game and story to be far more coherent if you could not die, and I think by having this (with some twists that are not present in the game) there was a chance for real horror to be unveiled (a world in which you cannot die).   NB: The game isnt actually 15 hours long, I simply left it running for several hours while I did chores, watched movies, etc.",

Soma has something that I feel like a lot of horror games lack: A compelling story which doesn't just lie in the background. I am simply not a big fan of horror games that only try to be scary and not much more. I don't want to be startled, being afraid of a generic monster, I want to be unsettled by the setting and the story.  Soma, unlike many others, felt immersive with its storytelling. I kept wanting to learn more about what was going on and I wanted to see how the story would end. It's the kind of game where I probably couldn't forgive myself if I had left it half-finished. Even past that, choices somehow felt meaningful here. I had no idea if my choices in the story mattered, but the choices I had to make forced to to stop and think about them and what could be the morally greater choice. Overall, the story is incredibly impactful and is undoubtedly the best part of the game.  This isn't to say that the scary stuff isn't good, either. As I said that I don't want to be simply startled, this game doesn't do that, there are no boring jumpscares here. What this game will do instead is make you panic and cower, and I love that about this game compared to other horror games(...even though I don't handle adrenaline very well). You know when the 'monsters' are close and generally where they are, but that doesn't make them any less frightening. Realizing that I forgot something important in the other room, getting chased back to that room, and then fumbling to lock the door, not many games have made me panic like that.  As for visuals, the game isn't technically impressive and I saw some pretty low shadow resolutions in some areas, but the game did perform very well(played the Linux version). But you know what? Graphical fidelity isn't what's most important. Where this game shines is within the visual design, particularly the atmosphere. The atmoshphere can really get you immersed in the game and lets the whole creepiness of the environment settle in.  Overall, this is definitely one of the best horror games that I've played(if not  the  best). It's definitely a game to pick up if you like horror games or good interactive storytelling at all.",

SOMA isn't scary but it has a great athmosphere and unique feel to it, personally I wouldn't classify it as a horror game.   Story is good and ending isn't bad either, also the fact that there are many monsters rather than just one makes it interesting. It's worth the money, depenging on your playstyle and on how much you want to keep reading texts found inside the game and looking around I would say it's somewhere between 6-10 hours (if you aren't speedrunning ofc). I used a good 10 hours on my first playthrough and enjoyed every moment of it!",

So why are you still reading this? Buy it and play it for yourself! Have fun!",

It amazes me how no matter where it is I am fearful of something popping out. Even in the beginning I was paranoid. It makes a great use of it's atmosphere and preys on a fear called 'Thasslophobia' which is fear of the ocean or deep water. I greatly have this fear as do many other people, so the developers made damn sure to use this fear to their advantage. Just the thought of them putting me in the deep ocean, it attracted me like moth to a flame. The graphics are astounding and it really uses the bloom effect well. The enemies are literal creatures of nightmares and fear. Much like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Frictional Games have out done themselves with this amazing game. I do hope to see more like this by them. It really makes up for A Machine for Pigs.",

This game puts 'thinking man's' sci-fi first and foremost, and relegates scares to moments of figuring out the scares more than senselessly being thrown at you.   You play as Simon, an unfortunate brain-injury victim who is also an unfortunate guinea pig in an unusual science experiment that transports him to an underwater compound. You soon meet Catherine, a voice from an unknown origin, and she leads you in your exploration with trying to figure out everything that has gone on Earth and with humanity.  Over all it's a brilliantly executed premise, but is unfortunately hidden beneath a layer of 'horror game' phobia, which I think does a disservice to this thought provoking game.",

The enemies are creepy, never let up, and they scared me more than the monsters from Amnesia. 2. The sound design is outright AMAZING. EACH item has it's own unique sound. Even random objects that have no meaning in the story have their own sounds. PERFECT sound quality. 3. The story is very involved, provokes plenty of questions, and sometimes just makes you feel sad. 4. The gameplay is much like amnesia, and that's a great thing! nothing bad to say here.  My overall score would be 9.5/10 Frictional Games has once again proven to me why they are the BEST game designers. Thanks for making such a great game!",

Its something straight up my alley.   I had this game in my wish lst for a while and never wanted to take the leap to purchase it because of the price. However it went on sale and I decided I would finally give it a go. Now that I have played it, I can say its well worth its orginal price because of the games quality. So, if you are hesitant.. your missing out. You wont regret buying this game.   This is not a lengthy game mind you as I did finish it in about 2 days. However, I don't feel cheated by that aspect given the fun play and wonderful story. This is a game that did give me the chills though! The atmosphere and monsters will give you a pit in your stomach but , in a good way. I don't usually play horror games, so It might not shake you as much as it did for me. Anyways though.. its quite an addicting game once you start. You can't wait to get to the next area as you travel through the game.   I would certanly give this a 10 out of 10 and I don't really have any complaints. Its a real gem and unique. I hope I can find similar games like this in the future.",
