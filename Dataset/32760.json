Tachyon is perhaps the most accessible flight simulator I have ever played. To simulator fans, it may be too simple but it was just right for me and I had a lot of fun playing through this.  The game also features the voice talent of Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame.",

Went out and got the full game a little while later. Yeah, its not the best flight sim out there, but it is alot of fun in its realtive simplicity compared to Freespace2 or X-wing vs Tie-Fighter. The game will run on just about anything now a days, so it is one of the games that stays on my laptop for down time between lectures and after class.",

Years before Mass Effect, this is one of the few other games that you feel like you're exploring a really well-concieved sci-fi world. Worth it for the voice acting alone.",

I couldn't have had more fun replaying what I consider a classic. Graphics were good for the time. New users may be dissapointed, but PLAY THE GAME. The gameplay is what really seals the deal for me, and is the reason I still love Tachyon: The Fringe. The flight side of this is intuitive, and fun. And, non-repetitive to boot. Both branches of the storyline are also excellent. It honestly saddens me that many of my friends who started gaming on PC have never heard of it.   8/10   It should honestly be 10/10, but the game is now quite dated. I think this will be a game long remembered. I certainly did. And, I'm glad steam has it. Trust me folks. There haven't been many better space combat simulators. Happy flying Jake Logan!",
