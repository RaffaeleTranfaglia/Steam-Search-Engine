What I ended up with was quite a suprise for me and a couple friends who tried it with me. I am a big fan of FPS games and I have played a lot of them from original CS too current day Modern Warfare and BF4. Lately a lot of FPS games have bored the hell out of me and I have been shying away from them. This game brought me right back. I expected a lot of P2W and crashing but what I got was a well thought out 8v8 team death match. The way in which they set up the skill points/weapons/items/perks is the way it should be done. If you are thinking about trying this game please do. Do not get me wrong survarium has its issues as all games do but for a free FPS game this is the best set up for on that I have ever seen.",

Well thats because it is yet to be completed. It states that.The pvp is currently being used by the creators to polish andfine tune the engine, beforethey release the open world element to the game. Which has been stated it will be this year. Ignore the hates as this game is free, so u can try it for yourself and have nothing to lose. just give it a try.  So far i am actually really enjoying it, its a fun challange. And because i understand it is a in development game, i can enjoy.  Key things they have really done a good job with is the sounds, visuals and great atmosphere.   Unlike the few haters who have WRONGLY JUDGED, I am very optimistic, and belive that this game has very strong potential, just needs us to play and enjoy.  Hope this helps",

The current TDM game mode is fun, and it gives you a good taste of what is hopefully to come in the Free Mode and Co-op mode. As this is a game that is in Alpha, it plays as well as I would expect, the options for your character are quite limited, and the game appears to be mostly P2W, as the majority of items are only purchasable by gold.   I would only recommend this game to those who like to get involved in a game's community, and can help and contribute to the game itself. If you want to play a game that you could put hours into and have a blast with your friends, I would not recommend this game at the state that it is currently in. Wait until at least the Co-op or Free Mode are released, then it should get better. Vostok need to get their act together, it's been quite a few years since the game has been available to the public, and the only game mode is still TDM...",

I won't mind playing bad games from time to time if they are fun to play and don't ruin the experience too much with its bad developement, but this game is not one of them. I tried to play longer to see if can get some enjoyment out of it but it didn't. Its just came down to a boring and uninspired gameplay which I don't have much attention span for to keep me playing.  Avoid it like you would avoid getting hit by the emission or you will be consumed by the emission than you will become the servant of the C-Consciousness like so many were before you.  I would strongly not recommand this game to anyone, and should be forgotten by all of the stalker fan of its existance don't care if its in beta, if its not a fun game from a beta state than there is no way it can get any better in its finished state.",

I am disappointed that they still havnt reached that target but they have also put it in the description which will make more people download it. Although, as a pvp fps game its actually an alright game. Its realistic and you can bleed out. They graphics are decent and the game is good.

Now the feedback after just playing it about 5 minutes ago. (03/04/2015)  I can easily say that the graphics to this game is rather beautiful, however I was not entirely impressed with the mechanics. I believe the game has got potential, but the issue that got to me was the character controller felt a bit too slow on user inputs and the gravity (physics) seemed a bit low according to the movements of when I jumped off cliffs.  I respect Votok Games for making the game, Free-to-Play, but as a Indie Game Developer myself, I would say well done on creating this wonderful project, but I wouldn't play it yet until some polishing was contributed towards the project, but like again, this is a Beta stage and we can all only hope that the full release will have some exciting implementations as well as improvements to current features.",

            "review_text": "This game is very interesting, it has a lot to offer in his DNA, but the economics model makes the game very frustrating, you have to play with only two weapon for a very long time before getting some levels.  I think the game currently act like a free demo, and then pay to 'play'. Indeed you can play the game for free but restriction are huge. Too bad..  I think i would buy the game, but not the 'premium' and stuff account that in my opinion destroy the pleasure of this game. It is still a beta, maybe some evolution to come in the economics model.

My friend emailed his notepad version, I copied it and changed the notedpad so my PC could find the file and the game still wouldnt load. Downloading and re-downloading doesnt help this. So do not download this game.",
