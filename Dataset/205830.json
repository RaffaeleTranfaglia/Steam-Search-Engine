            "review_text": "Luxor has always been one of my favorite match-3 games alongside many others; mostly played during my late childhood. This version of Luxor, after almost 10 years, takes the cake. Fast paced action, amazing soundtrack, and definitely more intense than its predecessors. Not only that, but you also have bonus levels within the game. (You'll have to find out what they are yourself, though.)",

            "review_text": "I can be shallow sometimes. Luxor Evolved first got my attention with its unusual retro vector look, imitating arcade classics like Asteroids, Tempest, and Black Widow. Earlier Luxor games had an offputting sort of Egypt kitsch, but Evolved nicely ties the scarabs and pyramids into stylish, colorful vectors.  It's not entirely skin deep, either. Evolved still follows the basic Luxor design, with the player shooting colored marbles from the bottom of the screen at a train of marbles twisting across the screen, trying to match them three or more at a time before they can reach their destination. But the tempo of play is dramatically faster than other games in the genre, power-ups have more dramatic effects, and visual effects are exaggerated, all helping to create a genuine feel of arcade mayhem.  The bosses have a clever design that creates tension by forcing the player to manage matches in several places at once. Secret levels are cute homages to arcade games from the early 80s. It even encourages a one-credit clear by disabling high scores if you choose to continue after losing your last life.  Luxor Evolved is certainly a casual matching game in genre, but it's got enough arcade trappings that it might grab you where similar games failed. Check it out.",

It can be easy at first but things can go a bit fast and tricky but it will be rewarding in the end. You get to use power-ups and all that. I use my own tactics to complete levels. I like playing this game. Also I'm giving those who I recommending this to a warning, it can be a bit addictive, so be careful on how much you play.",

It's short though - around 2 hours to beat it on Normal. Very polished and quite enjoyable.",
