Ignore the Negative reviews, 90% of peoples complaints have already been fixed. Don't care about alternate backgrounds/music, I doubt I'd use them anyway.   As far as the game itself, it's KoF '98 so there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. Great ♥♥♥♥. The Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo of KoF.",

Of course, some features from the PS2 version of original KoF 98um aren't there, but omissions those are marginal compared to the rest of this title. It has the best online featured in an official KoF title, or at least that I've seen. Like fighting games? Just get it.",

I have been playing KOF series since KOF 95, and just playing this game bring me back to my childhood. For those who have never played KOF series before, I would suggest buying KOF 13 instead. KOF 13 has much better graphics representing characters and their special moves. KOF 13 should be easy on the eyes of the first time players. The combos for these games are pretty difficult to perform unless you practice alot using sticks that is perfectly compatible with this game.",

While I'm hyped for KOF'02 UM also, KOF'98 UM is a wonderful warm up to the 'main meal'. I grew up playing this and other classics in arcades and this is a very compensating game to have as much it help you develop more skills. Yet today, love playin' this game with friends, and never get old. If you're in doubt, take a chance and just go for it! The King of Fighters is awesome!  Thank you, SNKP!",

With all the necessary balance changes that original 98UM needed (i.e. Krauser), this is the best KOF.  ",

It was a game with 56 playable characters -a ridiculous amount at the time, even more so today - and I made it my business to get to know them all. By the end I could play a team at random and have a decent chance at pulling out a victory against my friends. KOF 98 Ultimate Match takes that core gem, that timeless classic, and throws in even more characters. So now there's no need to ask about your fav because your fav is RETROACTIVELY IN THE GAME (unless your fav is K9999, sorry) I admit I'm smitten and old and my perspective is hardly universal: if you're new to KOF or fighting games in general, this is a lot to absorb. And the game's tutorials/challenges are terrible at explaining just what the hell is going on or what you need to learn. But if you can find your way into this game it can give you an infinite amount of replayability. And SNK packed this game with so many colorful personalities that I promise you that you'll fall in love with at least one character who may or may not be named Yamazaki.",

Nothing's gonna stop it it's 1998!'  Other than the classic intro, the game is probably one of the best King of Fighters games out. KOF 2002 UM is nice as well, both developed as dream match games, but this one just has a nice charm to it. It's well balanced, has good music, and it's decent port for PC as well.  Pick it up if you have the spare cash or get it with the 3 pack with KOF 2002 UM and KOF XIII.",
