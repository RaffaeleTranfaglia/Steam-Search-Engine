The game however is way too short, and I am talking like 20 minutes to complete the game short. It is fun though but I think the developer could’ve added a few more levels.    Graphics and sound:",

Loaded it up expecting a crazy dragon destroying everything in sight and that's exactly what I got :D  The game reminds me of Rampage from way back in the day and that's what's so great about it.  The asking price is slightly high but if you play this game you'll immediately feel a sense of satisfaction from the amount of keyboard bashing you'll be doing. It's a great way to destress lol :P   You can finish the game in like 20 minutes but it'll be 20 minutes well spent. The cartoony graphics are great and the game plays really well.   Hopefully the developer expands upon the title with future updates. More levels or a different type of dragon could be cool.",

            "review_text": "I feel a little bad, but I have to say I can't recommend this game. Honestly, I had to check again and see if this was still being developed. There are so many little issues that need to be fixed before you can really call this a finished game. Firstly, the hitboxes for the people and the houses feel awkwardly precise, this should really be more fluid and intuitive. Second, art and animations are buggy. The dragon's sprite won't change until you move, and won't change again if you continue moving. Also many things abruptly appear or disappear: the dragon doesn't die, it just blips out. The buildings don't look like anything until they're built. If these things weren't at least attempted in other instances (that the dragon changes at all or that the buildings have some kind of build indicator) then it would be forgivable. But because some things were attempted but not all, it makes it seem incomplete. There's lots of potential for this, but it needs lots of polish first.  Pass until they put out a patch.",

            "review_text": "I myself enjoy the game even though most people seem to dislike it. I feel the reason people do dislike it is this its very very short for the price of 7$ and even though i got it for 15% of it still seemed short for the price. If they were to maybe add some new levels, more customization and possibly even some story to the rampage plot, or at least make it an option to change the background. Customization could be like which power up you like more and want to drop on your 100ks drop, or even more exciting giving dragons clothes and hats! But all in all its a great stress releasing game and definetly reminds me of the old rampage games. Also I feel like I'd really enjoy the creators should slowly releasing updates and adding little bits here and there and that will surely keep me happy and probably the rest of this games small fanbase.  Would have to say 8.5/10",
