            "review_text": "Wildfire in its core is a major community made update to the Jagged Alliance 2, the king of the turn-based squad-sized tactical games.  There, in the Wildfire modification, we simply got a much more real-deal bang of firefights, more guns with more natural stats, more deepness in the economic model, refurbished layouts in the every sector, and more of fixed code, that was not perfect in the JA2. You know, those little bugs, which are not worth for a direct patch, but still troubles when you meet them.  I repeat it in the usual pro/contra manner:  + Almost the same refined JA2 experience from the original game. Yet we have new economic system and difficulty of the game was raised significantly because of better and more complicated AI behavior. That means – even more tactical thinking is required.  + By “Refurbished layouts” I mean rewritten maps, with changed buildings and other stuff in the sectors. That was done in favor of the possibility to take upper hand using different stages/floors of the buildings – which is certainly better than usual 1-floored flat-ground firefight experience.  + Speaking of firefights, enemies learned new tricks with maneuvering, and items using. Expect more challenges, more ambushes and traps (and also mine fields, fences, watchtowers, perimeter lighting, and alarms), more soldiers with better brains and much more wild and rapid fire on your way through Arulco.  + To the lovers of the boomsticks, there was added a plenty of them, all with real-world stats, sounds and behavior.  + Some newer team-mates were also added, to make new combinations and getting newer experience  + In comparison with the JA2 Gold edition without unofficial 1.13 patch, you’ll get a better visuals and compatibility with higher resolutions  - Some fans of the original JA2 may find it hard to adopt newer additions in the economics or in the difficulty settings  - Even with all thorough work made above code of JA2 in Wildfire 6, game still crushes and lags too often for a stable project  - Some quests remained the same, and some were remade – and if it were about new voice acting, that was done badly, due the lack of pro actors for voicing anew  For new players, or for those who were not hard in love with original JA2, this mod will be over-the-head hard experience of being outnumbered and outgunned. And, again, crush of the game in the last phase of the long-going battle for the first airport killed many amateurs hopes for making a quick run through. Face it – it is a project for hard-headed fans of old-school turn-base. You can spend a dozen of hours clearing one sector there – and no, you’ll not get an achievement badge after success. Nobody will know, nobody will care, I fear. That’s the final blow of realism that game can offer.  In the end, I’ll give Wildfire 7.5/10 – because I love turn-based games and hard, but obtainable challenges. As a recommendation, I’ll suggest to try the vanilla JA2 first, add 1.13 patch after it, and only then, if you still be in pursuit of another go through Arulco, try Wildfire. Just try to get a normal life before – who knows? Maybe you’ll succeed and not be in that much awe of such tenacious time-killers, as that game there. ",

            "review_text": "When I bought Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire, I wasnt expecting much. When I got into the lore and backstory of this game, I was impressed. What amazes me about these older games is just how much they place into the game. Modern RPGs might advirtise open world, and an interactive world, and years earlier, games like this where already doing it. The game is hard, like XCOM hard. At times you have to wonder if attacking with the mercs you have is a good idea, or if it is better to wait for you soldiers to heal up.  Unfortunatly, the game is not meant for Windows 8. I got frustrated with the game, not because it was hard, but because of how long the opponent was taking thier turn. What should take 5 seconds takes a minute. Then you have to wait for the civileans to take their turn, its just a mess. That being said, this game is still a gem. I highly recomend this for any one who is into RPGs, strategy games, sim games (I forgot to mention each merc has a personality. Some Mercs like to work with some mercs, but not others), and table top games.",

            "review_text": "Wildfire was my intro to Jagged Alliance, I have not played vanilla JA2. I have played around 80 hours at the time of writing. I have not completed the game, but I have progressed fairly far and have cleared many towns/mines. I'm writing primarily about my opinions on the difficulty and some of the frustrating aspects of the title.   Wildfire is hard, unforgiving, even on the novice difficulty I'll find myself restarting a sector 2 or 3 times to get a decent clear. The learning curve is steep, however once you find the flow of the game it is extremely rewarding. It is possible to clear sectors with minimal/no damage taken.   This is not a game for everyone. Wildfire rewards patience, forethought, discipline and punishes lazy tactics and unrestrained movement without remorse. Expect dead mercs if you go parading around corners, it is easy to get someone killed in a matter of seconds. Understanding the interrupt and action point systems is absolutely critical.   The increased difficulty of Wildfire is welcome in my opinion. The health/bandage/wound system is very cool (once you learn how) and the increased damage really makes you fear the lead, getting shot is a big deal. Fighting well equipped enemies is much more exciting than in some other tactics titles, and leads to extremely tense situations that I have not experienced elsewhere.   The presentation of the game is almost the exact same as vanilla JA2. I have read that there are changes to the merc roster that are controversial, and the actual sector maps are different. I cannot make any fair comments about the changes given that I have not played vanilla JA2. I won't comment on the rest of the presentation because it is easy to read the reviews for JA2 or watch a bit of gameplay to get an idea of what the game is like.  I will say that the goals/missions in the game are extremely vague. I think for my first 20 hours of gameplay I didn't even know about the rebel hideout in La Omerta. This means that to truly progress in the game you might need to look up a guide as far as what objectives you need to complete and who you should talk to.   Many of the in game systems such as healing, setting a destination on the big map, training milita, and training you own mercs are not intuitive. There is no tutorial for these things, so you might need to consult the web for help. This should not be a big deal to anyone who has played classic games before.  All in all, a great classic title with epic turn based gunplay and surprising depth. I prefer games that dont hesitate to break your arms and leave you stranded, this is not a title for those of little patience. Save often!",
