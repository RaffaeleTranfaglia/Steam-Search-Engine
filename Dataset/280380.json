    "description": "Uprising44: The Silent Shadows[/b] combines third-person action play with real-time strategy. It is a unique combination of the two modes of play, and has an in-depth and interesting story-line which has not yet been used in WWII computer games – the greatest civilian Uprising against Nazi occupying forces – the Warsaw Uprising.",

Third-person &amp; tactical module isn't all you can find in this game. Start little too slow but level by level is more fun, more nazi to eliminate, more place to discover I would recommend this game :)",

            "review_text": "The game itself was a good idea, you run to cover, you shoot, you run some more, you shoot some more, you do one of the other things but apart from that the game is bad. The game in its current state may provide light enjoyment for some people, but if you are expecting something great, you will be dissapointed. Graphics are like something from 2005 and the enemies move in the same way. Also it does not provide much of a challenge, unless you are trigger happy then it might be a challenenge finding ammo. However if this game was updated to something that would pass as a modern game then i would recommend it but right now its just not worth it.",
