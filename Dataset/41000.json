            "review_text": " This review is a little lengthy, so if you want a quick summary of why I recommend Serious Sam HD The First Encounter skip to  Results  and read from there.   Croteam makes a smash and they do it without any logic, realism, or sense.    The Campaign:  Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is an epic game which takes place in Ancient Egypt. This first person shooter is based in the future where the world is about to be destroyed by the monster Mental. All hope is lost until we discover that the way to defeat these monsters can be traced from our past. Further research reveals that humanity has discovered an ancient race the Sirians who had also fought and lost to Mental's might. Humanity finds the ancient Sirian technology known as the Time-Lock which can allow one person to traverse time and space. Our protagonist Sam, who may be very serious, is a champion, a hero, and a legend for humanity. Fighting off every alien he encounters to the end Sam, a true warrior, is given the ultimate task. To use the Time-Lock to travel back in time and to defeat Mental while he is busy dealing with the Sirians.    The Gameplay:  Serious Sam is revitalized in HD with a stunning thirteen levels (plus an additional two secret levels) digitally remastered and designed to meet the demand of modern day consumers. The graphics are not going to be anything like your blockbuster games, but that’s because the original was produced in 2001 and this is just a remastering. But the game looks rather clean and plays incredibly well. This game not only has secret levels, but is filled with little secrets for the avid gamer. Mysteries abound and things to find Serious Sam leaves you without want.    Result:  I played Serious Sam: The First Encounter only a little bit when it was released in 2001. Then purchased it recently because it was on sale. Not being an avid fan of the series I can definitely say this game is a fun purchase even if you never really played the original. There are an abundance of crazy enemies, a wacky story (that makes you keep wondering where all the humans are), awesome weapons, fun boss fights, and lots of crazy items. This game not only challenges you in combat making you feel like a hero, but also puts you to the test by throwing puzzles all over the place. The game requires you to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and defeat enemies in order to progress. The levels are long, the campaign is long, the game is a blast, it’s a must buy. If you like puzzles, you like first person shooters, you want nostalgia, or you just like to be a hero then this is the game for you.  Pros: +Incredibly fast paced combat +Puzzles in every level +Secret levels and many secrets within each level. +Lots of fun an interesting enemies +An abundance of bosses +Crazy amount of fun weapons to shoot about +Digitally remastered and in 1080p +Fun and gripping story that mixes reality with fantasy  Cons: -There is a limit to the amount fo auto-saves, you will lose older auto-saves in order for new ones to save, but don't worry you can just continually make saves yourself (I had over 200 by the end of the campaign). -The sensitivity can randomly spark (meaning it just shoots up and your character can suddenly turn with only the slightest mouse movement facing you the wrong way).",

For a long time I thought just that and always avoided this series. On a whim (and recommendations from both totalbiscuit and yahtzee from zero punctuation) I purchased a little game known as painkiller. I loved the gameplay so much I bought Serious Sam HD Gold Edition. I have loved every minute of the serious sam series from its subtle humor to its satisfaction of coming out on top no matter the odds stacked against you. I HIGHLY recommend this game to any fan of first-person shooters or fans of challenging games. This is a true gem of a series and worth full price and more! I loved the series so much I bought a serious sam shirt and every time i typed the work series i almost typed serious. BUY THIS NOW!   side note: this game is very difficult.",

The game goes from fairly slow to frantic paced. The difficultly goes from don't hurt me to I like smashing my face against brick walls (not what the game calls it but I do LOL).  There are many secret places to find and killer weapons to pick up, keep your eyes open.  It is a fast paced shoot things game that in my honest opinion is a ton of fun, but for me the replay I think is small, your mileage may vary but for now one play will do me.  Sound track: It adds pretty well to the atmosphere of the game, at times maybe a bit repetitive but mostly very good.  In the end, I think if you like FPS you should like this game, I recommend it. :kungfusam:",

I mostly played the single player campaign and loved every second of it. If you're looking for the latest and greatest graphics then keep looking.

For anybody unfamiliar with Serious Sam, this game is anything but serious. There is pretty much no dialogue and a bare minimum plot. But that's because this is a classic FPS when games involved a character running around with more firepower than an Armored Tank Division. Blast your way through crazy enemies with bullets, lasers, rockets, and...cannon balls.   One of the highlights of this game is the massive environment. While some maps are contained to the insides of buildings, lots of the game takes place outside in the deserts of Egypt and the maps are impressive. Not because there's a whole lot to see when running around a desert, but rather there's something majestic and awe inspiring to crest a dune and see a massive, ancient Egyptian city sprawled out before you.  This is a run and gun masterpiece and worth every penny.",

'Serious Sam' is really more of a bizarre genre hybrid all its own--an unholy mix of FPS and SHMUP that ultimately plays more like a SHMUP than an FPS (despite being in the first person). Much of the game play is navigating various patterned waves of enemies with absurd firepower in huge arenas--which sounds like a SHMUP to me.  So is it fun? Yes. For the first half, anyway. However, by level 6 or so you have seen everything there is to see in this game, so the next 7 levels of mowing down the exact same enemies in increasingly similar looking arenas can get tedious and redundant fast. I guess it's a classic case of too much of a good thing. Had this game been half as long it would have been twice as awesome. As it is, though, I was bored to tears by the time I finally reached the (admittedly awesome) end boss. ",

Serious Sam has none of those, so it feels like a half-baked mod with a bunch of silly concepts.",

This game has a small story which could be easily ignored if you would like.

The soundtrack is also one of my videogame favourites, up there with the likes of Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and Max Payne.   Co-op is still fun as ever, and leaderboards are integrated with the Steam Community which is a nice touch.

The second encounter is a pretty much the same formula with better map design choices that will leave your scratching your head as to what the devs were smoking when they made these levels but all in good fun.",

The action in this game is extremely quick and can have you aiming, ducking, and dodging enemies from every angle with a slew of fun to use weapons (fans of games like Unreal Tournament will recognize this formula)  The HD coat of paint is a nice touch, but the game still keeps it's classic 80's action hero vibe with challenging combat the higher the difficulty goes.Saving constantly is a must because most times the games won;t do it for you and enemies can be unforgiving.  Challenging, but not impossible, it's a nostalgic blast to the past for me and well worth playing.",

For those who haven't ever played a serious game don't expect something deep, it's a remasterd (I think, I kinda confuse remake and remaster) version of an old game and its main purpose is to be light, immature, funny (in its own way) and making you go everywhere guns blazing. For those who have already played a serious game (I personally had played serious Sam 2) you can expect a really nice experience, although a big part of the game consists of walking in big rooms and and facing hordes of enemies (which is not bad but happens a lot), and also watch out for health pills and such because there are A LOT of enemies spawning because you picked up a pill. Overall a pretty nice game that I would recommend as long as you buy it because you want a game that is relaxing and funny, so if you buy it I can only tell you one thing, go slay them all (there will be a lot)",
