            "review_text": "Finally, the day has dawned when there's a rugby league management game of real, genuine quality. It isn't perfect but this is a huge day for the sport as we finally have a management game to be proud of. If you are willing to learn the nuances of what you can do here, this title is as in depth as any you might come across in any other sport. It isn't perfect and will need to evolve over time, but this is the first game in a new franchise and is a fantastic effort. I was fortunate enough to have early access and I am addicted.   You can take a tiny club up and down the divisions (my spell in charge of my local team Blackbrook resulted in relegation before immediate redemption the season later) and the level of detail you can work on is huge. Stadia, academies, training facilities, gyms and so on. Each one will chip away at making your team better and making more available to you.   The 3D match engine is surprisingly impressive and you can see the calls and tactics you come up with being put into practice, which is a really good feeling when you have success. You can have team calls that work with your preferred style of play. You can concentrate on attack like Leigh or you can concentrate on the gritty, rough defence like a Shaun Wane 'inspired' WIgan.   There is so much detail to go through that you can have different experiences in different leagues. Different tactics prosper in the lower levels when you have less tactical nous at your disposal. The NRL has a higher standard of player and will not hesitate to punish you or your team for making errors or not being fit enough.   I can't praise this enough - it isn't as vast as Football Manager and anyone expecting it to be so is being unrealistic. The difference in budget is massively pronounced. But it is absolutely the king of Rugby League management games, and it is a crown that I have been waiting for a title to take for a very long time.   Well,well worth a buy if you love rugby league.",

            "review_text": "An excellent basis for the series to push on but feels slightly dated for a modern management game in places, though an excellent effort considering the size of the development team and resources available to them.  Nicely detailed with licensed teams and players, youth systems, good tactical options to play the style you like, ability to upgrade all sorts of club facilities, player pictures also a nice touch.  Just needs polishing in some areas, for example, by making the user-interface smoother and easier to navigate and improving the match day presentation to look more 2015-like (matchday can be satisfying at times when you're watching your players implement your tactics as you want, but it would be nicer for it to be prettier, as when you've spent hours perfecting your tactical plan you want the reward of being able to watch it implemented as something nicer to look at. Team selection needs to be made a smoother process (changing positions around can be a touch tedious). Also contract/transfer negotiations are too simple and easy.  Overall a very enjoyable game that's essential for any Rugby League / management sim fan. Look forward to further, improved installments.  Additional note: Please pay for the game and support the small development team so they can continue the series.",

            "review_text": "[This is my opinion] As a big rugby league fan, I do absolutely love this game, and will spend many hours on this game in the future. I played the 2013 version of this game and there is definitely a huge improvement.   Good points: - Ability to change between 2D and 3D match views. - Realistic Super League Squads (Updated 2016) - More Realism - Includes the Magic Weekend fixtures &amp; World Club Series Matches (St James' Park, Newcastle. Although not sure whether the 2013 game included this or not)  Bad Points: - The menu systems can be hard to navigate for new users, however a rough tutorial is supplied. - I experience a bug at the end of matches, meaning I have to re-launch the game, and re-play the match.  As a Rugby League Fan, the game is fantastic and enjoyable. There are a few little things that could be improved, but it's nothing big. I recommend any rugby league fan, NRL or Super League to buy this game.  ",
