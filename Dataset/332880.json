            "review_text": "its pretty good, I found that due to the game being mouse driven some of the mechanic made things more chaotic than they should have been e.g I went through a teleporter but my mouse didn't move so my character attempted to zip back to where my mouse is and then I lost because it ran into some bullets.  Aside from constantly beating levels obviously atypically to how the level design would suggest, it is a fun little puzzler that should be an app but is good enough of a game to feel right at home in my steam library.",

            "review_text": "Fan f-ing Dance  I was on board with this game up until one of the last levels in which the game rotates your mouse control (that's the only way I can rationalize it; in practice it feels like you have no control) with no UI and the result is an unplayable level, even on easy. The game was hard but possible up until Fan Dance, so that's still a good 1-3 hours of content depending on what difficulty you play on. But Fan Dance is terrible game design and definitely soured the experience, especially considering it's so close to the end.  Get it on sale.",
