            "review_text": "I lost count of how how many times I completed FF IX. This is the first time I completed it on Steam and it still is one of my favourite games ever. Honestly I still think this is Sakaguchi's masterpiece.  Even 16 years after I played it for the first time, the game impresses me to no end. One of the reasons why I like this particular entry in the series is because of how diverse Gaia is. Sure there is room for the fairytale-like kingdom of Alexandria, but soon enough you'll wander around in Lindblum, the giant city where everybody is working on the technology that will help the people of Gaia in the future. These are just some of the general examples, but I still love how this world has a bit of everything: technology, magic, different cultures, a diverse cast of people walking around... this is what I consider 'fantasy'. Sure, everyone's definition of fantasy is wildly different, but in FF IX it just feels right. Exploring the world is still a joy and the majority of locations you will visit haven't lost their charm.   Another reason why I still love this game is because of the amazing cast of characters it has. Zidane is a great protagonist who steps away from the sulking and overly 'too cool for school' leads like Cloud and Squall in the earlier Final Fantasy-titles. Don't get me wrong, this is not to slam on those characters. But it still feels like a fresh breath of air to see the friendly and sociable Zidane supporting his friends through the game. And being a bit of a ladies man. I wish more FF leads would be like him. And of course... who can forget Vivi, the little Black Mage who could! Vivi remains one of my favourite characters in the series. The young mage stumbles through the game looking for answers he won't like, but he powers through and comes to face his personal demons. It's impossible to hate the little guy. Garnet/Dagger might be the one who keeps doubting herself, but eventually becomes a great and strong lead as well. As for the others... Steiner remains funny as the comic relief of the game, but you respect his sense of duty. Freya and Amarant seem a bit underdeveloped, but luckily they get their moments too. Eiko has fun scenes too and Quina... well... she's Quina right? She just likes frogs man. The many supporting characters are great too. The Tantulas gang always have a knack for getting a smile on your face, Regent Cid will (gwok) suprise you with antics (ribbit) and who can forget the mad queen, Brahne? Lots of memorable characters all around.   Gameplay is solid; it's the FF battlesystem/equipment you know and love, but this time easier to grasp (thank god!) than FF VIII's overly complicated junction system. Just just equip items to lean skills and voila; awesome moves you can use. One thing I do appreciate about this Steam version are the enhanced loading times. In the original PS version loading times were long and over time made it harder to fully enjoy the game. It made sense, because back then FF IX was asking a lot of the PSone hardware. But now on a pretty fast PC the game runs smoothly and with quick loadtimes. It's so fast, I've reached the end after only 31 hours. With the original release it would atleast take me 40(!) to get at the same point. So kudos for that. But if the many fights start to tire you out, why not enjoy several fun sidequest with great rewards? Or even some minigames, like the amazing Chocobo Hot and Cold, where you can dig up items and treasure locations? Especially with a high level Choco it's amazingly fun to hunt for treasure. I could go on for hours, but really, check it out for yourself!  I could go on for a few more pages, but at a certain point you just want to stop reading. So here's my final say on this amazing game; for me Final Fantasy IX is the last great FF game to be made. It's truly a shame we'll never see another game like this from Sakaguchi. With IX he created an amazing world with loveable characters, wonderfull places to visit and more importantly, an adventure worthy of your time. Helped by Uematsu's amazing soundtrack Final Fantasy IX still remains as one of the best games in the series. Your really should play it.",

            "review_text": "I never got the chance of playing this game back in the day (because I didn't own a console) so first I wanna say a wholehearted THANK YOU to Square Enix for porting this game to the PC. I hope FFXII and FFXV will follow suit, especially now since FFX/X-2 HD is released. With that said onto the review!   I was skeptical at first regarding this game because I've heard so much good things about it but on the other hand it wasn't really a 'hit' in terms of sales (it didn't get to the popularity of VII), but rather than it got a cult following which I can appreciate. And because of that I decided to try it out having never played it before but hearing good things about it.   So here I am at the end of it and I must say that it surprised me completely with it's characters that were very well developed (especially Dagger &amp; Vivi and let's not forget how awesome Quina is). I got so much into playing this game for the past couple of days without stopping until I finally reached the finish line.   It's one of the most 'complete' Final Fantasy games in the franchise that I have played and it has managed to reached 1# on the FF games list for me followed by FFVII and FFX.   Do I recommend this game? YES! Especially If you are into old school RPG's with an ATB system, it's charming characters and a soundtrack that will make you sometimes sad and sometimes happy.  PS: This must be mentioned, but the PC only features that Square have implemented in these Final Fantasy ports in terms of boosters have been a godsend for those who want to go back and play the game out of nostalgia or for those that don't have hours and hours to grind through and make the minigames enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "The wait is over, my favorite FF game is finally on Steam! I won't comment on the actual game since it came out 16 years ago and y'all should have a pretty good idea of what it is. I will however comment on the quality of the Steam release. Now I know that it's been out on Android for some time now, but having not played the mobile version, I cannot compare the two.  - After reading some reviews (both negative and positive) and the forums, I wasn't expecting my Xbox One controller to work without getting a Joy2Key and performing the 'run the game, then connect the controller when you get to the options menu'  black  magic. To my surprise, the controller worked right away. No tweaking, assigning controls or any use of keyboard+mouse was involved while I was playing.   - Some said that they don't have an option to choose the 1080 resolution, I wouldn't know why that happens since I didn't encounter that issue.  - Reworked fonts and menus look crispy clean. I didn't think it would matter until I saw it!  - I'm not a fan of filters/other emulation enhancements and I took a moment to compare the standard emulation to the Steam release. The difference between the two is colossal. Yes, the static backgrounds haven't changed all that much but the new character models textures make more than enough difference.   - The new autosave feature is extremely useful and works flawlessly. For some of us who has gained real life responsibilities since the last time we played FF9 this is an actual lifesaver.  - Unlike FF7 and FF8, it was never ported to PC before so the MIDI sound issue 7 and 8 Steam releases had is not present.  To sum up my first impressions, I think the Steam version looks fantastic. This  does  feel like playing a remastered game. I know there's a lot of disagreement on what a remastered game should look like since the level of expectations goes from low to realistic to unrealistically high, but in my opinion this is a remaster worth playing.",

The memory is there, playing as Zidane a well developed character is fantastic! Re-Meeting Vivi and Garnet and the others was SUCH an amazing feeling, it's less playing a game from your childhood and more reuniting with some childhood friends, telling stories from your childhood and just being a kid yourself again! FFIX was and is a big part of my childhood that I'm MORE than happy to bring into my adulthood!

            "review_text": "There is no ifs or buts. For me this is the best game I've ever played From the bottom of my heart, thank you for not only bringing it to PC but for making it magical again!!! If you're a JRPG fan it's a must play, but don't just play it. Experience it! The gorgeous updated graphics, the charismatic characters that tug on your heart strings, the memorable and engaging storyline and the soundtrack that will stay with you forever! This is one of the most complete JRPG experiences you will ever have! Thank you so very much for making me relive my childhood all over again and experiencing all the same heartfelt emotions and love that I have for gaming in general  It won't be long until I not just play it, but experience this heartfelt and beautifully perfect game (for me) all over again 11/10  For the people that never grew up with a PS1 or played FF9 I still think this game is well worth it if you're a JRPG fan. The button layout for the most part works very well on a keyboard, it's only a challenge early on during the minigame to impress the crowd and Queen Brahne. If you succeed there's a nice achievement to unlock as well. The game starts off with the Main character Zidane travelling with Tantalus to the castle of Alexandria to kidnap Princess Garnet while performing the play I Want to be Your Canary. This introduction introduces us to some of the characters nicely and helps you form a bond with them early on. It's also a nice introduction to combat which flows in real time. There is a bar in the combat box that fills over time and once full you can make selection into what attack you make to defeat your enemy. There is also the Trance meter that fills overtime and once full your character will enter the state of trance for a number of turns. Trance gives you different abilities and improved strength for your characters  Defeating enemies rewards you with experience points to level up your characters, AP (Ability Points) to help your characters learn new ablilties that are obtainable from different equipment for your characters and Gil (Currency) to spend on items and equipment.  The environments are very varied and beautiful. From the beautiful architecture of Alexandria and Lindblum Grand Castle to war torn Burmecia to the stunning Cleyra. Every destination is a treat for the eyes and makes you feel like the developers put there heart and soul into every brick and flower to really draw you into the game.   The characters themselves (Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, Steiner, Freya, Quina, Eiko and Amarant) are very varied in personality but compliment each other very well. By the end of the game they feel like family to me such was the connection I had for them. Even all side characters and NPC's are very interesting and have something important to say. I always wanted to go up engage them in conversation and often had a smile on my face whilst doing it.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in gaming, the intro music makes me feel like I'm about to play something special and every destination has a catchy and memorable tune that I often find myself humming along while I'm doing other activities. If your interested look up on youtube 'Relaxing Final Fantasy IX Music' and give your ears a treat into some of the music you can expect from the game  The story is very engaging and draws you in right from the very the moment Zidane lights the candle to provide light in the main area of the ship. You will go on an emotional journey with them, finding out where the came from, where the are going, what they are doing and why they're doing it. I don't wanna give away any spoilers cause it really is the main drawing point of the game and will keep you coming back again and again.  Overall if you love JRPG's, love memorable characters, simple but challenging combat, engaging heart felt story, gorgeous environments and a great soundtrack that sticks with you this is a game I highly recommend you play. If you're experienced in the genre this game combat wise will be quite easy for you but if your new to the JRPG genre this is an amazing introduction just like it was for myself 15 years ago. (There's plenty more to discover but I want it to be a nice surprise for you when you discover it)",

            "review_text": "Let me start off by saying, WOW at how they cleaned this game up. The characters move very smoothly and the clarity is unreal. I can actually see the details in weapons that I never knew were there in the old Playstation version. Everything is very much up scaled. I'm kinda bummed Square Enix didn't remaster the music too (it's amazing to begin with though) but this isn't a full on remaster so it's whatever.   Thus far, my only gripe(s) is that sometimes the frame rate craps out only slightly because they up scaled the characters so much that the back ground gets a little constipated. Like when you take control of Vivi and the camera zooms in with 'Alexandria' fading in and out of the screen. Then when he gets knocked down by Puck... sweet baby jesus TEH blur. I also noticed it suffers from the same nonsense the other Final Fantasies when they're ported (to/from) andriod--the interface. The stupid battle menus look like the same cancer as before which perplexes me.... this was meant for PC but I feel like it being held back because of the port to android?  One last thing, no matter what screen ratio you choose or even if you full screen or window the game has this border on both sides that's distracting. I blame android. I feel this could have been SO MUCH MORE if they didn't bother with the android stuff and pushed for a PC release only. Just my opinion though.   ANYWHO! I'm grateful this was 'remastered' because it is my favorite Final Fantasy from the Playstation era. It's nice to see it at least cleaned up and easily accessible for me to play again. I love it for the nostagia factor yes, but I also love the game in no matter what format it's in. (Even if it's android....provided that if I didn't have a computer :p )",

Everything about this game is near perfect. The story is second-to-none and the character development is the best the series has seen since FF6, as you end up growing attached to (almost) every character by the end of the game. The music is spectacular, as was standard for Squaresoft in the 90's. The graphics have aged quite well and look great remastered in HD (especially the cutscenes). The only negative thing I can say about this game is that the graphics in the world map look fairly poor by today's standards... Oh, and there's Quina (worst FF character ever!!)... But it really isn't that big of a deal because everything else is so well done. If you like the Final Fantasy series (or turn-based JRPGs in general) and have not yet had the opportunity to play this, then you owe it to yourself to experience this absolute masterpiece in gaming.

Although many times the Final fantasy series have similar plots such as the protagonists being branded as outcasts, run around the world then at some point managed to save the day and concludes with a happy ending but it still never fails to captivate me. In addition, FFIX has very detailed characters where each character holds a very deep story of their own. Not to mention, all the characters are very likable. Like take for example animes, dramas, movies, novel and basically anything that is a story; there will always be that 1 irritating egg head character that stresses you to the point where you would go ‘JUST GET THE FUQ OFF ALREADY KUNT?!?!?’. But for some odd reasons these characters somehow someway get a lot of screen time... WHY? -.-‘ Nevertheless, FFIX has none :3 (maybe Steiner in the beginning I guess LOL).  Moving on, FFIX also has great music that comes along with it ( yea.. Garnet.. and her mellifluous voice [I think she was my first crush &gt;.&lt;]) I must say I absolutely adore her when she was singing the ‘Melodies of Life’. Then there’s also Beatrice. Her theme and her character without a doubt carries their charm too. Although there is also Freya and Eiko but since they are not as visually attractive.. I have decided to skip (Don’t judge me :P)   The graphics and gameplay matter little to me back then, they still matter little to me now. The fantasy FFIX brought me through remains beautiful.

The character models and cutscenes are much more polished looking in this version, and the autosave/faster load times make this the best version I've played of this game.   The only things that bother me with this version that I've seen so far, are that the game caps at 30fps, and there is a bar on each side of the screen (at least at the resolution I have it set at for my monitor). However, I'm hoping that these issues will get fixed with mods. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the old Final Fantasy games and never got around to playing this one, OR if you just want to play the game again and relive your childhood.  9.5/10",

            "review_text": "The Fantastic-  -An actual native port of one of the most beloved games in the Final Fantasy series. The graphics look fantastic, it plays smooth, the horrible 'wobbly' textures and warping of models as seen in the PSX version is gone, gone gone. Attention to detail has actually been undertaken to make this game a rare gem for me to play.  The Good- It's got cheats, or 'boosters' yes they will come in handy but I've always been a fan of the grinding, so I won't be using these but I can see other players might like to use them.  The Bad- Controller support is woefully inadiquite. The Xinput plugin for unity used is way, way out of date and lackluster. The Backgrounds, although I know myself they have been replaced with higher resolution versions than the PSX, they stand out really bad on higher resolutions.  The plain ugly- Where do I start? First of all an older version of unity has been used making the game prone to game-stopping bugs (which I will report below). There's zero graphic customization, there's a horrible aspect ratio fix and ugly grey bars, forcing me to create my own mod just so I can enjoy the game, you know, so it stretches to my screen. Heck a PSX emulator can do better. But don't fear, my mod for this is up on the guides section in the community. Although it has been claimed that the movies are 'HD' the one at the start (where vivi walks around and the alexandria text comes in) is plain awful. Pixellated, blotchy, low res rubbish. At least use a slight blur and a sharpen Square to get rid of this. And why the heck are the movies been renamed to .btyte when they are clearly theora? Why make it so hard for the modder community to improve a classic game further?  And the big one. The game, for some, doesnt work. Period. Getting into the first battle is impossible for some and the music plays, but your world will go black. And here's why.  I was able to reproduce the issue people have been having, it seems it's related to a really dogdy plugin that square enix made for this game, called FF9SpecialEffectPlugin.dll, it's in the Plugins folder. A look in a hex editor at it mentions bones, SFX and framebuffer effects. Deleting this plugin results in what people have described, cant get into the first fight, the music plays but the screen is black. This is definately what is causing the problem. Square if you are reading this fix your buggy plugin or should I do it for you?!!!  All in all, I do recommend this game as it is *almost* a vast improvement on the PSX version. However, Square, you need to fix all these bugs, upgrade your unity version, allow people to mod your game more easily (this is 2016, not 1996 anymore) and stop treating your PC fans like idiots.  Buy for the price and the possibility of this getting fixed but steer clear if you want to play now.",

Quick loading times, smooth transitions, no input delays and 60 FPS. The soundtrack was also not touched unlike in FF8 so you get to hear it in its full awesomeness.  There are some added features that can help you out a lot mainly for achievment grinding/hunting and give you some extra variety to play around while remaining completly optional. The UI is very mobile oriented (since they also did a port for android) but only noticable during the main menu and battle scenes, apart from that looks very clean and polished.

This was something that I originally looked at in 2000 when it was released, but I didn't have the money or the console to play it. Now I can finally say I have played Final Fantasy I thru XIII (not the sequels yet) (except for the online version FF XI).  This particular generation of FF is dear to me; I'm speaking about VII, VIII, and IX, the ones released on the original Playstation. There is a lot of charm in the prerendered backgrounds, the simple Active Time Battle system, and also the story and characters.  FF IX features a different model style than of it's previous two games. I've heard it being called ugly by some critics, but do not judge this game by its looks. There is a lot to do in the world of Gaia, and the majority of it is enjoyable.  What I do not enjoy about this game is Chocobo Hot-and-Cold. It's a minigame that's essential to earning valuable items, and it does get tedious very quickly. I also do not enjoy TetraMaster, the card game that's a evolution of VIII's card game. You'd have to play it many times before understanding what the rules are, especially the numbers on the cards, before you can start winning. Even then, it's easy to lose. It's not the most friendly minigame to new players.  Now, another feature of these games is the grinding for EXP/AP. I know most people do not enjoy repetitive battles. I, on the other hand, like the lethargic task. Frankly, it's calming to me and I can't explain why. But this is indeed a game for people who like that sort of gameplay; definitely not for gamers who want to rush things. With this port however, you have readily available options to max out everything so you can enjoy the story without the need for grinding.  However, despite the minigame flaws, the overall game is very enjoyable. It's easy to get sucked into the story and gameplay with these games, and IX is no exception. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the PS1 period of JRPGs.",

O_____O FFIX can do no wrong in those departments for me.  Pros-  - Pausing cutscenes/any time really is fantastic baby.  - The UI is just fine for me (in reference to neg. reviews). It doesn't look all that different and I'm not all that picky tbh.  - Contoller working fine so far (xbox 360 wired) - General Beatrix - Button mapping for both Keyboard and controller always a plus - At first I thought the sound was off, but then I plugged in some decent headphones and realized it was my lappy speakers. So, the sound is pretty much as good as the original thus far.  - Continue option for busy on the go gamers or for those who must unexpectly stop playing is a huge bonus.  - Game boosters. I say this is positive because it is optional. I don't use them, but again, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ since they are optional. Its the same as when they added fast travel in Oblivion. ITS OPTIONAL, quit your ♥♥♥♥♥in'. And maybe at some point I will use them just to enjoy the storyline. Again, the continue option and this make those who are busy have a much easier time to enjoy the game.  - GENERAL BEATRIX &lt;333 mmmmmmmmm..........  - Indicator that tells you who is willing to play cards. Especially great for new players, so you dont need to waste time and ask everyone.   Neutral - The graphics updates are nice in general, but I also am perfectly fine with all the old graphics too.  - Bars on the side of the screens. Not horrible, but also not right.   Cons-  - That said, the graphical updates do contrast with the backgrounds which can be less appealing. I love the original look, but since they refurbished the characters for a higher quality it would have been nice to have matching backgrounds too.  - Button mapping should be before the start of the game at the initial title screen.  - Occasional slight pausing (not sure what that is called. Screen tearing?) during cutscenes that isn't game breaking, but does make the cutscenes look less fluid and smooth. Could be my PC or lack of V-sync option or whatever.  - Jumproping",

Certainly the best FF for PSX, and maybe the best ever.  There are a couple of nits (one of them a bug that should be fixed) to be aware of:  1. You can remap the flawed XBox controller defaults (actually, I switched it back to default so my buttons match the prompts and that feels fine - still, this is a bug), but if you do use custom mappings, the onscreen prompts will all be incorrect! A frustrating bug that should be fixed!  2. There is some stuttering in various places with my older hardware (Core 2 Duo 2.6GHz, 4GB RAM, GeForce 650 GTX). I'm not sure if it's my older bus speed, or my slow hard drive (using my SSD didn't seem to help), but scrolling and screen transitions on the tiled screens is stuttery, until the textures are loaded - then it's smooth (hopefully they add a way to preload all the textures per screen at once - slightly longer load between screens would be better than stuttering).

The story, in my opinion is wonderful and heartfelt. The setting is a living fairy tale world with just enough steampunk to keep it entertaining. The characters are wonderful.  Enough about the old stuff. What about the new? The new character models are excellent. The ability to speed up battles is also great. Turning off random encounters, while not something I would usually do, is becoming tempting because of the encounter rate in certain areas. There is a lot of good. I have especially enjoyed the sharper graphics and enhanced cutscenes. I am seeing details that I didn't know were in them, and I have played this game countless times through. This is the best version of Final Fantasy IX.  So...what do I wish was better? The backgrounds and some of the NPCs could have been touched up a little. I know that replacing backgrounds would have required phenomenal effort, but I know there are some high quality backgrounds floating around the internet. Perhaps a future update could gradually improve the visuals that way. Honestly, it's not a deal breaker. This is the best version of the game.

Holy balls, no more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 2004-era resolution, now you are only as limited as your hardware. It's almost as if Square read my negative review of FF6 and agreed with me when I said it was shameful that KOTOR 2 released an update allowing for higher rez, and this brand new game was capped at a lower rez.   Things only improved once I heard the music. They actually ported the PSX music from the original. That's right, no lame MIDI music a la FF7 port here. Cinematics look exactly the same, except somehow even cleaner and crisper than a PC emulator. Now lets get this out of the way straight off the bat, because some ♥♥♥♥tards on Steam have been giving negative reviews based on this next fact. Yes, there ARE bars down the side of the screen, so it doesn't take up the full screen. It is a negative, yes, but unlike those perfectionist ♥♥♥♥tards, I don't believe that is enough to say the entire game is ♥♥♥♥ because of it.  Overall, is this game an HD remake as believed? Yes, a thousand times. In my FF6 review, I argued that they should have just taken the SNES version, ported it over to the PC and not change a single thing, and it would have been perfect. Square did that with this game, and so much more. They took the PSX diamond of a game, and polished it to a mirror sheen. The scenery is gorgeous, the combat feels fluid, hell, even the text of the dialogue looks crisp and more legible than ever. It's not one single detail that elevates it, it's the thousand different details that make it so enjoyable. Unlike FF6, I have no intention of refunding this game within the first 30 minutes of playing; I intend to play this game for a very, very long time.   Bravo, Square. You CAN learn from your mistakes, you CAN be taught. Just give the fans exactly what they want, and they will eat it up in droves.

Pros:  *Great story, emotional and a life couching if I may.  *Amazing main character, the best of the series up there with Ramza Beoulve from Tactics.   Going against the typical darkish and negative-ish protagonists that the saga has provided until the IX release  .  *Each character is unique on their battle roles, so no over powered main character who does it all.  *Return to the basics of the series: the vintage classes, fantasy related world, empires, kings and whatnot.  *The variety of paths you can take to finish the game, each combination of characters provides many challenges.  *It is a damn long game to play if you go for the whole 100% thingy.  *Many minigames and secrets that really add a lot of fun time to mess around.  *The score is the best of the series.  *The old school feel was successfully ported.  Cons:  *To any RPG fan this game will result pretty easy to beat, once you get the hang of it.  *Not much replay value.  *Some minigames are just a grindfest to obtain things that won't matter that much.   ****SOFT SPOILER ALERT****  *  Although the villain has an awesome personality, I do feel it is too easy to beat him, same with the last boss, not what is felt against the secret boss, which is by far the hardest thing to beat on the whole FF series if you refuse to do the friendly monsters quest.

This isn't going to be a review of the actual game, as I'm going to assume you already know it. But I just wanted to say that they did it! They actually went and bloody did it! They ported/ adapted/ remixed (whatever you want to call it) a game that was in sore need of love and recognition, and they didn't screw it up!   If, like me, you were worried that there would be some issues that would need to be modded/ fixed by other users to deal with the lazy ports of VII and VIII, then fear not! They got it right! It looks gorgeous, it sounds beautiful and you don't have to painstakingly set up any controls in the menu (I'm using a 360 controller, and it works like a dream).   I don't think they did much work on the maps as some of the backgrounds and their respective animations... they look a bit... choppy (e.g. the audience in the fight between Blank and Zidane), however that's not a problem, it was like that in the PS1 version, so it's no big deal. The character models look stunning too! Christ! They're incredibly sharp! The FMVs are wonderful too!  I cannot reccommend this version enough! If you loved the PS1 version, then you'll be blown away by this!   Also I kinda like oglops.",

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy IX is easily one of the best Final Fantasies out there. Zidane was a breath of fresh air after Cloud and Squall depressed us with their emo mannerisms. All of the characters were fun and exciting. The story itself seems to transcend its own seriousness in lieu of light-hearted silliness and many many opportunities to get sidetracked with other activities, like Chocobo Digging and Tetra Master.   The PC release offers us help in the form of fast forwarding, easy skills, and max gil. I will admit to being tempted to use them, and I would recommend it for any buyers who lack the patience for an old grindy game, but there has been and always will be a feeling of satisfaction that comes with seeing your efforts pay off when you finally learn a new skill or level up after a lengthy grinding session.  I have heard a couple of reports of controllers not working, though my lame Steelseries 3GC works just fine, and I have seen people using the 360 controller reporting no issues as well.   The polished character models are fantastic! I can, for the first time, appreciate the detail that went into these characters. Faces that simply looks like colored blobs of pixels, now actually look like faces and their bodies have details I had only noticed in cutscenes and closeups. Unfortunately, the backgrounds were not upgraded. I have read that this is due to much of the original material being lost over the years.  All-in-all, I'll say that this game is worth the price, especially since it is discounted off the bat. I would have gladly paid $25 just due to the sheer amount of content in this game. You will get your moneys worth in this. Don't fret over how old the game is until you've seen how much is in it.",

My first introduction to the Final Fantasy series was 7, and that strongly shaped my taste in the series. When I first saw this game, I didn't get it. I understood this was going 'back to the roots' of Final Fantasy, but at the time I didn't have a solid reference point.  Well, I finally did it. I beat it. Granted, I cheated using the new boosters, so do keep that in mind. I just needed to finish it and see the story, that was my main goal, so I could put this to rest.  Cheating like this taught me something interesting about this series. I beat the story only in about 15 hours, skipping most battles. That means these games typically have 45+ hours of literally nothing but level grinding. That's crazy.  What was usually to me a 6 month endeavor, became a weekend speed run. And it was awesome. I really liked this game as a whole. Though I did have a few issues with it.  There is a lot of 'furry' type content, as well as pedophilia. For instance, the main character is a monkey-boy in love with a human female, and later aquires a 6 year old admirer. It's pretty weird.  Anyway. The story, music and graphics are great and this is part of the golden trifecta of 90s JRPS, FF 7, 8, and 9. The updated models really look nice, as even back in the day they looked very jagged.  I was surprised that the loading times into battles really doesn't seem that much better, even with fast forward turned on. That made that 45+ hours of grinding really laborious on the original, and isn't much better now. I haven't timed it yet but it's still an annoying wait for every single battle.  I'm going to play the others in a similar fashion to confirm or deny a theory I have that not a real lot actually happens in this game. I want to make sure it's not due to me rushing through it, but aside from battles there are only a handful of meaningful plot points in the entire game. I feel like many of the other Final Fantasies featured far more intricate plots and character development.  One cool thing that I'm not sure if the other FF releases on Steam have, is that it has a cutscene viewer once you beat the game. How awesome, I always wished I could easily rewatch those, pre youtube at least. Bizzarly, it also unlock a blackjack game on the main menu. Why?  9/10",

I haven't yet played it through on the PC but unless the port is garbage I have almost no complaints about this game. I've played it 3 or 4 times and Even watched/guided my friends through playthroughs a couple of times too! The few things that I don't like about it are as follows (Again, this is from the original, not the port, so technically it's possible these aren't relevant): 1) the battle system is a little slow. Even if you go into the menus and ramp up the speed as much as possible it's still the slowest atb driven FF game out there. 2) Some of the side quests are just luck if you didn't know about them beforehand or are incredibly tedious. There are a lot of items hidden around the maps that you can only find by clicking when you get an exclamation point above your head and many side quests (optional ones though) are primarially driven by this interaction. It makes for either tons of tedious searching, using a guide, luck, or just not finishing them. 3) Similarly, some of the side quests are simply poorly designed. The chocobo hot and cold quest in particular.  These things are all supplemental to the main game though and aren't enough to significantly impact anything. It's an amazing game with incredible characters and a really solid story. If you are thinking of picking it up, do so.",

I haven't tried keyboard and mouse but for ease I do recommend a controller. The graphics strike me as a little strange. They did upgrade the cut scenes and characters but the backgrounds are washed out, 2D messes. Some people have said they have had problems with the game crashing? almost 2 hours in, I have had no problems with crashing or lag. The storyline is very enjoyable in my opinion and the music entertaining. I have to admit though the mini games is where I have the most fun, especially the card game! There are cards hidden through out the whole game and you can win new cards from the people you beat. My second fav is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. You can get some great stuff from that as well. Over all, I do recommend this game to most people. This was one of my favorite Final Fantasy Games and I hope to see the ones not yet ported come to PC sometime soon!",

I implore everyone to buy and play IX, because it is, in my opinion, the very best of Final Fantasy. It took Final Fantasy VI's and refined it to perfection; it had some of the most endearing characters ever put into a game; the soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu is perhaps his best work; everything about Final Fantasy IX is as close to perfection as an RPG has come.

But even when I put aside those rose-tinted nostalgia goggles, I can safely say that this one is a timeless gem and well worth playing if you haven't done so yet.  I've played through the entire game and completed all side objectives multiple times back in the PS1 glory days, when FFIX was in its original 4-disc form. When I found out that this perennial fav of mine was being brought to PC in a remastered state, I was overjoyed-- and also, like many other fans, a bit worried that the port would be of poor quality. I anxiously awaited its release, and when it finally came out I was extremely relieved to see that the game was nearly perfect. They even kept the quality of the lovely and memorable musical score intact.  The character models look better than ever in high-res, and for those less fond of that JRPG grind there are now optional cheats to breeze through the game (though I'd never touch 'em, personally. I'm an FFIX purist like that!)  Controls work fine with either a controller or keyboard/mouse, but I recommend using a controller as that is the way the game was meant to be played.  The only issue I've got (and it's a relatively minor one that not much could've been done about) is the blurry backgrounds, which in most PC resolutions are quite noticeably fuzzy. This is unfortunate, as these pre-rendered backgrounds feature some very stunning art and help to create the game's amazing atmosphere. But fortunately they can still be appreciated, even in this state. It's far from a deal-breaker, at least for me. It bugged me a lot at first, but I can deal with it now.  The story and its characters remain as timeless and charming as ever, and it's the same emotional thrillride for me that it's always been. I will never stop adoring this game, and I'm really pleased to have it back in my life.    TL;DR --&gt; An above-average port of the best Final Fantasy game of them all.

Also something I like, is that in any other RPG with overworld airships or the like, you're always the only one flying around, but in FFIX the airspace is full of othe vessles traveling to and fro. I quite enjoy the ATB battle system.     This port also has some nice features Emulator players will recognize. You've got your Max Dammage Mod, and a Frame skip (fast Forard) mod that doesn't speed up the music like in a regular emulator, which is a great feature to me.     The only problem i have with the frame skip is if you have it activated and go into a cut scene, it will still be Fast Forward, so be carful with that. Speaking of the cut scenes, they look great in HD, once you get past the frames they were originaly rendered at.  So yeah, with just 6 hours in, I already love this game.",

            "review_text": "Let me start off by saying that FFIX was my first Final Fantasy game and because of that it became my favorite so it's difficult for me to be unbiased in my review. For the sake of this I will focus on this title's validity as a PC port. PC gamers may see the framerate which is regulated to 15 fps in-game and 30 fps in FMVs as a negative for this title but being as this is a Playstation-era game with pre-rendered backgrounds the framerate doesn't hinder gameplay. I was completely oblivious to the framerate throughout my entire playthrough and if it hadn't been for the FPS counter in Steam I would have never questioned it. In-game character models are updated to show more detail and to be less jagged around the edges but still keep that familiar PSOne look. The best way I can think to describe their look is to think N64 character models which to me always looked more solid than their PS counterparts. The boosters are the biggest change to this version. There are numerous boosters that affect gameplay drastically with a few being located in the 'config' menu that cannot be turned off once they are turned on in a single playthrough. The less game breaking and to me ultimately more useful boosters can be found by pausing the game and using the shoulder buttons (assuming you are playing with a controller). These boosters can give you full MP and automatically put your characters into Trance, make you deal max damage (9,999), turn off random encounters, or speed up the gameplay. These last two I recommend for anyone who wants to do a 'pure/cheat-free' run but is hindered on time. One flaw I did not notice back in my childhood that became painfully obvious while playing this port was that the game suffers from horribly slow battle time. Here is where the game speed booster came in handy as I would use it for level and ability grinding but turn it off during boss encounters. I can't recommend using this booster outside of battle because you character can quickly jump across the screen and it can be easy to lose track of them, anyone who has fiddled with emulators will be familiar with this. The no random-encounter feature is a godsend for end-game when you are maxed out already or when you just desperately want to leave an area as the encounter-rate in the game is fairly high. The story remains faithful to the original with the same translation as before and outside of boosters the gameplay is untweaked from the original.  The only cons I can think of would be that the pre-rendered backgrounds didn't receive the same enhanced treatment that the character models and uncompressed FMV sequences did. I understand that some pre-rendered backgrounds move and that the original uncompressed files could have been lost but it would have been nice if the game had looked polished in its entirety rather than just partially. Still this is a small nitpick that doesn't detract from my recommendation of this game. The Continue feature also seemed to be unreliable as I would sometimes receive a Game Over if I wasn't too careful during grinding sessions and be forced to rely on an old Save instead of the Continue feature. I quickly learned to frequently save though so this feature became a non-issue for me. Due to its sporatic nature I wouldn't recommend using it and to instead stick to the tried and true Save/Load option. In short:  Pros: -Optional boosters can remove tedium for those looking to just enjoy the story or those with less time than others -Enhanced character models breath new life into the visuals -Uncompressed FMVs let us see how they were meant to be seen.  Cons: -Some boosters cannot be turned off so if you save and decide later to revert you need to restart. Thankfully these particular boosters are not mapped to shoulder buttons and are had to accidentally turn on. -Pre-rendered backgrounds still look muddy and the muddiness is only accentuated by the clean visuals of the character models and FMV sequences. -Continue feature is unreliable and generally sporatic in terms of where you pick back up. If you are level grinding against difficult enemies (say Grand Dragons) and are afraid you may get a Game Over I recommend relying on the Save and Load features instead.  Neutral: -Framerate lock may or may not disappoint some but doesn't take away from the visuals or gameplay in any way. Personally, I couldn't even tell.",

While the 'game boosters' are for the most part cheat buttons, the added autosave function feels like a feature that belongs in an RPG where save points can be far apart with boss fights seperating them. The graphical enhancements are noticable, but aren't jarring or out of place like in some other Final Fantasy PC ports.  I did have trouble getting my xbox360 controller working as apparently every one of my buttons is bound to down on the d-pad for some reason, however it seems this is an isolated incident and the keyboard controls aren't pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, which is a good sign for any port.",

Yet, all the improvements, especially the HD cutscences, they brought me back in time. That thrill whenever the CGI kicks in - it refreshs my childhood memories a lot.

Playing this game on the PC/Steam version has most probably got to be one of the best and ultimate version's out there and i am beyond thrilled to have got to play the steam version in complete HD as oppossed to playing it on my PSP OR PS VITA.    SOUNDTRACK  Oh wow what can i say as previously mentioned above i can't fault the soundtrack in the version at all,   from start to finish every part of the soundtrack in each and every scene was exactly how it was when this game first got released by squaresoft at the time many years back and i am utterly glad that none of the music wasn't touched or changed otherwise i honestly couldn't see myself purchasing this game if the music was changed or upbeated so i am very content that it was all kept as the music itself reminded me of my childhood gaming on final fantasy 9.     GAMEPLAY AND STORYLINE   From start to end the gameplay cannot be faulted in the slightest, the fact you are also able to activate trance when required to make a fight a hell of alot easier as oppossed to getting trance when you are attacked is incrediable in my perspective and it makes the battles so much easier when you want to master abilities towards the end of the game if you can't be bothered to spend a lot of time investing into abilities grinding if you just want to go ahead and finish the game and wipe out the final boss etc etc but i myself decided to put so many hours of grinding but it was nice to know that the booster was there if i really wanted it.     OVERALL THOUGHTS AND SCORES  Honestly theres no doubt that final fantasy 9 is still one of the best rated final fantasy's out there however a little underrated in my view but hell this game really is a tip of the iceberg that sqaure really do invent fantastical games and really know how to capture people's emotions and get us emotionally invested into storyline's character developments etc etc and it goes without saying of course that the PC STEAM version has probably been so successful and i want to thank sqaure for going down the PC route it was the best choice they made and very smart to considering the love people truly have for this game.  With that being said if you looking to start a new journey and want to get emotionally connected with this phenomenol master piece then seriously it will be an investment you make for life and you certainly won't regret it because i sure didn't.    10/10",

Let me also say I have never played any other Final Fantasy game with the eception to 10. And anyone who got through that, got bless you, you have far more tollerence for it than I did.   FFIX opens with a botched kidnapping and a long slow build of intreague. Anyone who says the newer Final Fantasy games take a while to get going won't have to worry here. There's just enough intreague and subtle hints at something building almost from the outset that, as long as you read closely, won't leave you bored.  I'd also like to say that, for the extreme completionists, the cheats they've added to the game really speed things along if you're not into the whole 'level grinding' thing. However, be mindful that using some of them will prevent achevements during gameplay. That's just how it is.  All in all this game is good and fun and a worthwhile romp with many scenes you'll want to see again to try things a different way and see different results of events.

So understand when I say that i love FF9, that I really do, despite this review. Sadly, despite the improvements to image quality, this is a far from being a perfect port.  Pros:  1. Music from the original game is retained and NOT replaced with crappy midi, so enjoy the original score.  2. Background Image clarity is good compared to what it is on PS3. I've had to play it on a PSP (very small screen) to get close to a sharp image.   3. Character sprites look clear and sharp.  4. This is FF9, one of my most favorite FF's.  Cons:  1. Despite support for 1920x1080, the actual game screen does not stretch to fit monitor, leaving a 2 inch dark gap on both the left and the right side of the screen. This is not a good thing (at least playing it on PS3/PSP i can stretch that image to fit). Check the images above on the store page and you will see the border I am referring to.  2. Terrible Font used in the game's text. The orignal game used a very unique looking font (check out peeps Youtube playthroughs of original and see for yourself), the style of which, fit the game wonderfully. Despite the clarity and sharpness of the text, this port's Font looks like it got ripped from RPG Maker ACE or something.  3. The redone (and very blocky looking, at least to me) battle menu is too large and looks like it was made for ANDROID, as a result, it fills more of the scrren than it had originally filled on the PS1/PSP/PS3. The combination of this and the replaced font, just feel wrong. As a result, I find myself wishing that the game at least had UI resizing or transparency options to offset this somewhat...  4. The built in game cheats (which i do not use), cannot be turned off once turned on.  5. The 'Quit' button is hidden in the config sub menu, rather than the main part of the menu. Seriously, it is actually hidden at the bottom of the Config sub menu so that you actually have to scroll down and find it. Just sad...  6. Other than resolution and the choice to play in'windowed'mode, the game 'options' are not accessable until you are 'in-game', no options menu appears on the start up.  7. Backgrounds still not as clear as they should be for PC.  For Android this is fine I guess, but for a PC version, It just feels 'half-@$$ed' to me.  Will I be playing FF9? You bet I will...on the PSP",

Listen Square, if you want a good review, FIX YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE! FIX THE DAMN GAME! There's numerous issues on the forums that you have yet to even publicly acknowledge. Disgusting, simply disgusting.  I'll do a more thorough review when I can finally play it properly -.-  I'll be doubling this up with a BBB complaint. I'm gonna get some progress.",

            "review_text": "This is a port of a Mobile version of FF9 and has many UI and control problems. I requested a Steam Refund for this title as it is not in a playable PC state, comes with very, very little graphical options or updates and as I kept my PS1 copy, I'm more than happy to wait on a real PC version of this game to come along.  Some of the sounds, especially during the card minigame are horribly EQed as well and aren't a patch on the original PS1 classic. (The noise of the card game made me want to stop immediately.)  Shameful port of one of the best games of all time. :(",

            "review_text": "Before you buy the game you will need to know the negatives and positives of the game:  Negatives/Mehs: - Does NOT have Widescreen support, you will have gray bars on the sides of your screen as shown in Screenshots - Uses the Mobile version's UI and it does take up a lot of the screen during battle - Locked at 30fps, personally never expected otherwise but still needs mentioned for others  Neutral: - Price, sorry but I was expecting 15-16 bucks tops, so I wasn't that happy with the launch price but if cash isn't an issue for you or you're fine with the price go ahead and count this as a Positive.  Positives: - New Character Models look amazing, but don't always mix well with the backgrounds - HD Cutscenes look great, but it's hard to miss when not everyone shown are using the new models - Toggle Cheats/Options, they can enhance or ruin your experience with the game, so do take care when using them  Final Verdict: If you were already gonna buy the game, then chances are you already bought it as soon as you saw it and this review isn't for you, this is for people that are hesitant and want to research the products they're thinking about buying before they spend their hard earned dollar. I completely understand the love for this game, it's my favorite in the series, but I was expecting a little more effort out of SE and if modders fix the issues I have, I'll re-buy the game and change my review to Recommended and link all the mods that fix the issues, but until then I'll pass.",

Playing with a controller is impossible as there are no settings to fix Zidane from moving permanently in one direction, or using the dpad to navigate menus. It's an extremely lazy port of the Android version, which SE refused to refund me despite having the exact same problem with the controllers there. Thankfully, Steam is much easier to get a refund from.  Come on Square Enix, pay attention to defails for once. Please. This isn't that hard and it completely ruins the experience of playing your games.",

This game however only allows the controlled character to move to the right, the ONLY way around this is to use the D-Pad on the 360 controller and even then i have to fight the right direction which causes some extreme issues while trying to navigate. Troubleshooting I've attempted: Using only KB/M with no controller or receiver plugged in - right turn only KB/M with receiver plugged in - right turn only KB/M with receiver and controller on - right turn only Removed any unused HID devices in device manager - right turn only Unplugged keyboard, used controller with mouse and reciever plugged in - right turn only Unplugged mouse, used controller with keyboard and receiver plugged in - right turn only Updated all drivers associated with controller, keyboard, and mouse - right turn only before and after driver updates  Once the control issues are fixed, the game was always a favorite and the updated graphics look smoother.",

            "review_text": "Is this a joke? 2 extras months of waiting (aside from the 16 years PC users waited) to get an straight port of the Android version, with not even widescreen or proper controller support. Not to mention, constant crashes! Really Enix-Square, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.  UPDATE: As always, Enix-Square didnt fix ♥♥♥♥ (except releasing a 3GB patch that didnt do anything), but people in the forums did. If you set the game to compatibility mode with Windows 98, the game stops crashing, so you can actually play it.  Port itself its ok, the 3D models look a lot better, but they made the backgrounds look terrible. The auto-save option is a cool adition, but still looks like they put that option in for the crashes.  About the game, is the best Final Fantasy ever made, simple as that. Is this port worth $20 bucks? nope, unless you never played it, and dont have a PS1 laying around to play the original. If you already played the game to death, and only want this game on PC so you dont have to hook up your PS1 every time you wanna play it, then wait for a sale.  UPDATE 24/5/2016: Enix decided to patch the game so 'the fix' wont work anymore, the game is unplayable again. ♥♥♥♥ YOU.",
