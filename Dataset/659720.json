    "description": "Xenocite Clad places you in the long forgotten ruins of an advanced civilization that seemed to disappear overnight. Now, centuries later, the ruins have filled with life, both threatening and non. Brave the ruins against predators and more as you search for not only a way out, but the answers to the questions strewn all around you.",
