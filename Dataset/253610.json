Really bad: - Killed nemies often explode into robotic gibs, wich are way too many and large resulting in items that lie close by to blend in. This will force you to really pay attention to every step you make if you do not want to miss pickups...  Still, there are not many games out there trying to bring the Doom/Quake feel back, so I strongly recommend all fans of this genre to pick it up and give it a try!",

            "review_text": "Good developers love their games and that's exemplified by a patch for Wrack. The creators loves their game, to this day play their game ( I see on of the creators in Wrack all the time on steam!), and still patches the game. Maybe you should try the darn game! No honestly, it's quite good.   The game is steeped in old school glory, but is not confined to emulating other games. Wrack is not Doom, it's Wrack, and that's awesome. The game play is in the vein of old school FPS, what we get here is FAST, smooooth, and intense. The enemies often litter the screen, with different types of monsters intermingling into veritable swarms of deadly goodness that you will circle strafe and juke around at a constant 60fps. There's also an interesting score mechanic that revolves around kiting enemies into situations where you can kill lots of them quickly, keeping the combo timer going means minimizing the time in between kills. The timer seems a bit harsh, but it's all doable and you can check the leader boards top player's game play videos within the game to give you an idea of how you might increase your score. The old school vibes extend to the level design which are huge, filled with keys and switches, and of course, secrets! TONS of secrets you'll be struggling to find for a long long time. For my personal preferences I felt the levels to be a little tough to navigate but when you hit a switch that powers a far away door they at least show you where that door was cutting out some of the monotonous guess work of older games. Setting wrack apart from games of our generation and past is the exquisite polish you'll find in every aspect of the game.   The art direction is insane, from menu to in game everything looks amazing, and fits within this new Wrack universe. The music also, is some of the more memorable music I've heard in a game in a long long time. I'm a huge fan of video game music, and this material really stood out to me. The melodies are sometimes reminiscent of old school tunes, but in a way that like the game, is fresh and unique. I can't stress enough that the game plays smoothly, I tried hard to find glitches and areas with frame drop and it just doesn't. Solid 60 fps everywhere no matter what you're doing.   The leaderboards are a cool feature, the ability to watch the game play of leaderboard top scores is even cooler, but the built in workshop content is what'll keep most players coming back after they beat the hell out of the main campaign. There is the obligatory doom level recreations on the workshop but I'm more excited for what the modding community brings in terms of original wrack levels. Anyways, if you like old school, if you like polish, you should check out wrack. Especially while it's on sale in a humble bundle.   Even AAA games aren't coming out as complete as Wrack is, and you gotta respect that a small team can deliver such high quality content. Check it out!",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I had the main developer in my friend's list once but we were at best: acquaintances. I spent much of my time in the Steam Group Chat with him and some other users who, some, became my friends. I don't like him, I don't hate him, I'm quite neutral towards him.  Wrack is Maze-Based First Person Shooter, obviously, trying to hit that nostalgia weak spot of the Doom fanatics with a very clean and attractive cell-shaded look. I love first person shooters and if your game description included 'Doom' in it, then it better be as good as 'Brutal Doom'!  Lets get the story part done with quickly, you're Kain, who is... some guy that needs to stop Earth from being invaded by the Aliens. He does this by, surprisingly, shooting a lot of stuff and preventing them from stealing the great Hyperion Generator! He's preety much the only character that gets any characterization, but even then, it's minimal as hell. Starlyn, which seems to be his girlfriend, doesn't have much to do during the whole story, only a convenient romantic plot device. She even gets kidnapped and the game forgets about her. The there's Fabian who has luscious long hair brown hair and is also a funny ponce, so basically John Romero. Finally there is the main villain, Exo, who just comes by as your average quirky bad guy. So nothing much on the story side but 10 euros isn't gonna get you an epic greek odyssey.  So what would make this a Doom-Like FPS? Well, during the glorious decade of 1990's, FPS concentrated on offering a labyrinth of nasty monster that you had to shoot. This was before Halo and CoDs came in and astonishingly enough, made an already simple formula, even more basic. Back then you had to work for your survival, traverse through some complicated well-thought out level design and use a good variation of weaponry to blast away your enemies! So does Wrack achieve these objectives?  For me, the most important part of any shooter is the actual shooting! Level design is great and all, but if I'm not seeing limbs of corpses flying, weapons shouting god's fury, skill-dependent guns, screen shaking (not too much though), walls being painted with visceral red fluids and better gunplay feedback than early access fanboy reports, then you're gunplay has, as Jim Sterling would say: 'all the impact of the limpest willy of America'. Wrack comes about halfway with this portion. Cartoon gibs explode to the air like a leprechaun pub vomit and most weapons sound preety good. The sword is as good as Serious Sam 3's sledgehammer (quick and snappy kills, although it is a bit risky), the pistol is ♥♥♥♥ weak, shotgun is competent (kills nearly everything in one shot and the fire rate lets you decide which body falls next), plasma pulse rifle is ok (requires some good aiming since the shots fall off) and the rocket launcher has nothing wrong with it to be honest. Each rocket is a precise mini nuke that'll make a room full of enemies, a quick sludge of organs. Not an amazing list of weapons, so I'd say it's competent, but combined with the speed of your character, then it's near to an adrenal fueled experience like that of Shadow Warrior (2013).  Wrack's gimmick includes a combo meter that can power your weapons with powerful secondaries. I do think it's a nice little idea, however, it doesn't work perfectly. The secondary shots aren't all that imaginative. The shotgun and the rocket launcher just make a bigger bang, the pistol shoots thing railgun-like laser, the sword gives also a bigger bang firing three plasma shots and the pulse plasma rifle fires a slow gigantic projectile that eats everything on its way. The combo meter decreases quickly and most enemies require at least 2 shots to kill them, so you better keep up. And once you clear a room with a combo meter prepared then you'll have to hold down the secondary fire button for a good while until you find a suitable target. Honestly, I wish you could fire these special shots any time you wanted as long as you had the special ammo for it. This would probably work better in an FPS arena-based shooter.  As for the level design, it's alright, for moments you'll get some nice imaginative sections, but they're a handful. This issue comes along with the enemy variation. Now if the enemy variation was low but dynamic, then I wouldn't mind, unfortunately you'll only face robot spiders, kamikaze robot spiders, kid aliens, adult aliens that change shirts from time to time, flying turrets and a giant damage sponge robot. Most of them fire a small colourful projectile which aren't too hard to dodge. The real challenge is when the game combines a group of enemies and one closed room, this happens quite often ambushes. It's not bad, it's actually what these kind of games and I love it, but it can be sometimes quite cheap. The WORST enemy would be the railgun laser alien. He charges up his laser and no matter where you are, how fast you are, you're gonna get hit unless you hide behind a wall, preferably one of the size of a chest. They're specially annoying when they're placed real far away from you, behind a bunch of of enemies and you can't hear them charge their laser rifle!  Now I don't like boss fight, however, most of the ones in this game are tolerable. Except for three of them: the last one (annoying, but hard as expected), the penultimate and the second one. All because of black missiles! They're heat seeking missiles and they track you so well that not a even a speedhacks can save you!  Now, what I've been saying during the rest of the review might make Wrack seem like an average game, but I don't think I should demand immensely from a game with a 15 euro price tag. Even then, I would recommend other games like Brutal Doom for it's gore and Rise of the Triad (2013) for its expansive levels over this one. But you know what, a simple (by that I don't mean one that shoves you into a gritty and grey line), fast-paced, short (5 hours) and well constructed first person shooter in the middle of time where you don't get much Doom-like games like this one is more than welcome. So I recommend it!",

            "review_text": "I tried so hard to like this game that now it feels like a complete waste of time.    When I first saw the trailer showing an old school fast paced FPS with cool graphics I was thrilled. I wanted to play it. I needed to play it. After all those story driven and military shooters, this game seems like it had so much potential to bring back something that I thought to be long last.    Unfortunately things aren't always how it seams.    I have to admit I actually enjoyed the game at first. I still do. The game offers most of what you see in the trailer: it really is an old school fast paced FPS game. It also has nice graphics and I had no problems with the sound effects and music.    However...    The first weird thing I noticed is that ..YOU CANNOT RELOAD. That's right.  Let's elaborate with an example: Your pistol in this game can carry 300 bullets: 50 per clip and 6 clips. This means 50/250. But when you finish those 50 bullets SURPRISE. No reload. So you have to change the gun. So you fill in those 50 bullets and then start filling in the other clips. Sure, this only happens once, when you get the gun. But that's when you need the bullets the most and walking over clips on the ground makes you take them but not use them. So you'll end up with 250 bullets that you cannot use and you'll have to use other gun or the super big super slow sword that's very likely to get you killed.    Another problem is the extremely small space you have when you have to fight some big guys or even the final boss. I played many old school fast paced shooters so far but non had this problem. What's worse, the game usually lags like hell when it comes to these fights BUT ONLY THESE. You won't encounter this problem nowhere else in the game. And dropping from 120 FPS to 5-10 is something I cannot accept that easy.    Another stupid problem occurs when you quick reload a game. Say you're in the middle of a fight and you save. Then you die and fast reload the game. In my case this results in a black screen with some action in background (this means the bad guys are active and are heading your way or even shooting at you) for 10-15 seconds. Then, I would experience 5-10 seconds of low FPS before the game goes up to 100+ FPS. I made the mistake of saving in the middle of a fight and I had to chose an older save point because I was killed before I was able to do something. Again, unacceptable.    I tried this game on 3 different PCs and had the same problem. And I had no issues with Bioshock Infinite, Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider, Shadow Warrior and so on, all maxed out.    But I am willing to give this game another chance, as soon as these bugs are fixed.",

With a game that runs as smooth as a babies backside and has an awesome sound track by Bobby Prince (Remember him? Yeah he did the Doom soundtrack)  It's interesting as it attempts to take on the older 90's vibe of crazy levels, tons of weapons and tons of enemies, tons of weapons and large boss fights.   It also attemps to do it's own thing by adding a pretty cool little combo mechanic where every hit you get with the shotgun will chain together and then you can launch a super mega attack with the secondary mouse key in the same vien as Unreal Tournament's alternative fire.   It controls really well and is very tight. Which is exactly what I'm hoping for a fast paced game of this nature.  Tons of mods, tons of varied levels and tons of fun.  Easily one of my fave indie games from the past few years.",

The gameplay is very close to Doom, it's smoot fast paced action with a combo meter with multiple finishers for every weapon. Boss battles every couple of levels that are actually challengeing. Fantastic soundtrack that almost always has me coming back that matches that of Doom, you almost all of it uploaded on Youtube.  The graphics are very appealing. All of the UI and other menus are comic book styled. The weapon designs look really great and the animations make very weapons fun to use. The boss designs from what I have seen so far were very great. The enimies seemed be a mix of robot and alien creatures and you can usually distinguish each one from other rest.  It has fairly good re-playability, and even more so with the Steam Workshop. I honestly didn't dislike anything about the game. I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "I bought Wrack in March when it was on sale for 6 euros.  I really loved Doom, I still do, I install it on any system bar my actual main PC so I could play it outside whenever I'm bored as it entertains me.  I saw that this was meant to be about action with a chain system.   I played through about nearly 2 hours of the game in the hardest difficulty unlocked. (I believe it was just hard and there's no higher difficulty if I recall correctly) and I had just come off Hotline Miami 2 at the time so I wasn't really unfamiliar with difficulty, in fact, I welcome it in most of my games.  The game is outright boring, the weapons feel almost as bad as Skyrim, being either peashooters, or cardboard guns. I felt like my weapons were too weak and that I'd have to pick them off one by one with the sword. I really hated the chain system as the levels aren't really filled with enemies and when they are, enjoy running about hoping you can squeeze enemies into your killstreak rather than trying to just kill them without taking damage as you would in Doom.  The soundtrack is god awful, the ''story'' is cringy. the enemies do not feel threatening. I feel as one would easily have a better experience with Doom, any version of it that's on Steam is fine.  So I decided to add some mods from the Workshop and keep in mind, I had bought this game in March, I literally only found a good few visual mods, and a mod that recreates Knee Deep in the Dead. So I played it, and the gameplay issues of walking TOO fast, guns sucking ♥♥♥♥, enemy types being reused over and over again wasn't fixed at all.  Just go get Doom, if you're bored of Doom, install level mods, unless this game is priced at less than a euro/dollar/pound/Indonesian Dong, avoid like the plague.  ",
