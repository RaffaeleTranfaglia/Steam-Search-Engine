            "review_text": "I have like/hate relationship with this game, resulting in positive, but very cautious recommendation.  Ghost 1.0 feels very ambitious in many places, which I commend and support wholehearthly, but there are some blind spots that show up very often in design, story, art and gameplay, ultimately making the game take a serious hit.  Story is really a weakest part of the game. It's not the worst story ever, since main characters are likeable, but the all other elements seem to be duct taped. Pacing is schizophrenic, bombarding you with cutscenes and (reasonably good) exposition early on, which then is put into halt. Aside from the main 'twist' there is no story at all, making whole supporting cast insignificant and dull. Humor fails flat most of the time, with lots of unfitting referential humor and jokes that overstate their welcome. I recall that I only laughed once in the game from a clever joke. Whole main trio's voice acting is decent, any other character sounds extremely unprofessional.  The base gameplay consist of you exploring the space station and trashing robots with various weapons. Exploration is fine, but the most hidden secrets use the 'souls' system which is sometimes completely idiotic, requiring you to do seemingly random task, without telling you what exactly to do. Combat is also sound, with good gamepad controls and satisfying shooting, but the overreliance on kill-rooms in form of alarms, shows how the design is ultimately a little bit too shallow to flesh out interesting set pieces and level designs. Whenever game tries to mix things up with the gameplay, it falls short throwing tedious, disguised puzzles as an answer. In result, both Labs and Rescue Mission levels are really tiring and not as good as the rest of the game.  I must give to the devs that they got in some interesting innovation in form of two completely different game modes. They change gameplay structure significantly, giving a high replay value and a reason the play the game at least twice. The Classic Mode looks like Metroidvania, but it only takes an open-ended level structure as a base. There are no gamechanging upgrades that open new areas for example. You still get improvements for your robot and while they are mostly useful, they don't change the style of the game that much. Survival mode is the real innovation, mixing the classic formula mentioned above with upgrade acquisition in style of Binding of Issac or Risk of Rain. While story advances regardless of your skill and deaths, the more you stay alive, the more difficult the game becomes and more ridiculously powerful your character gets. Die, and you reset the difficulty to level 1 and lose most upgrades. Great idea and great execution.  Art and music is good, but I'm ultimately disappointed with it. Locals and areas become really stale after a while with lack of variety. Music score seems to have some really nice ideas here and there, but they aren't really realized enough, leaving some seemingly good tunes not as engaging or memorable as they were planned to be.  The soundtrack really mimics the state of the whole game. It's a decent title, with effort put into it, but something doesn't really click here. I would be really happy to ignore many of the title's faults, like in many other games I reviewed very positively, but in the comparison, the core gameplay and game structure isn't really consistently good enough to blind me to them. Then the game was in it’s best, I couldn't stop playing it, but the moment something slipped, the positivity started to fade.   I ultimately give it a positive recommendation, because good parts of Ghost 1.0 are still there and you really get a bank for your buck content wise. It's really shame that this content isn't really polished enough to be really outstanding.",

Nice production values, good humor, a lot of references, both in narrative as well as in the game itself thanks to the geek items but, the most important aspect of it all, great gameplay.  Ghost controls really well, there are many secondary weapons to choose from and many upgrades, the skill tree has some interesting choice to make a character that fits your own play style, some rooms present light puzzles which require a little thinking as well as good execution and backtracking to get all the secrets is nice thanks to the teleport between save rooms.  On the negative side of things, I encountered a couple of weird bugs, though they were minor things and not game breaking and considering updates keep coming it can easily be overlooked.  Ghost 1.0 is a great improvement over their previous game UnEpic (fun game but with some decisions I didn't enjoy) and a strongly suggested purchase for any fan of the genre. Hopefully there will be a Ghost 2.0, but even if there isn't I'm looking forward to @unepic_fran's next game.",

While Nintendo may have forgotten people love these types of games, the developers of Ghost 1.0 put polish and creativity behind their take on a genre that is loved by many.  First things first: when starting out, you will need a controller unless you are a keyboard wizard. This is because you can freely aim and shoot while moving in another direction using the right analogue stick. 'Ghost' moves swiftly and controls beautifully when she is in her android body and outside of it as well.  The greatest feature for navigating or even scouting ahead is using Ghost's ability to leave her battle chassis and take over an enemy or worker android body. You can eliminate foes, collect energy for the purchase of weapons, and solve puzzles this way.  Everything is very intuitive, the game plays like a dream, and I am wondering how I missed out on this excellent game.  If you loved or still love Metroidvania type games or Metroid style games in general this game will be worth your time.",

Kind of reminds me of some really old stuff like Impossible Mission for the C64, moreso than Metroid in a sense. Not quite as epic as unepic yet (one of the best games I have ever played), but I'll keep playing.   In the meantime, I may have encountered a minor bug. When the controller is disconnected, it doesn't seem to find it again once it is reconnected (or in the case of the wireless Xbox 360 controller, turned back on). That won't keep me from playing but it might be worth checking on to see if it is an actual bug that needs fixing.",

Ghost is a great game that clearly inherits a lot of sensibility from Unepic-- but it has evolved in nearly every way.  Ghost's difficulty settings include traditional easy, medium and hard settings, but also include 2 modes of play- a traditional Metroidvania approuch (ala Symphant of the Night) and a roguelike setting that strips most of your powerups from you after you die, with a chance to recover some of them from your grave.  I've been wholly impressed with the balancing of the Hard difficulty: it challenges me without trying to prove some sort of 'I Wanna be the Guy' point. The Roguelike setting has proven interesting- creating a system of esclating risk and reward that is woven into the gameplay seemlessly.  All and all, I'm happy to have picked it up.

There are skill trees, upgradeable heroes and a bevy of guns to choose from. The controls are also very fluent and easy to get used to.

The alarm-raising mechanic makes for surprisingly interesting strategic decisions, and the death mechanics are particularly refined, including some great innovations that I haven't seen in any similar game before (The quasi-savepoints before bosses are an incredibly nice feature. I hope more games borrow that mechanic in the future.)  Aesthetically, it's got very well-drawn art across the board, from the character sprites to the cutscenes to the level backgrounds and so forth. The music and sound effect are both quite nice in my opinion. Unusually for an indie game, the writing and the overall story are both excellent. Even more unusually, the voice acting is so good that it's actually noticable when the actors occasionally flub a line-- which I only noticed two or three times over the course of the entire game.  In short, this is actually a pretty strong contender for my favorite game of the year. I'm as surprised as anyone by that. It's definitely worth full price, go buy it now.",

For those that haven't played Unepic, Ghost 1.0 is a solid game providing hours of content and replayability. The graphics are consistent, the sound design is solid, the combat is intuitive and fun, and the story, while slow to start out, is good enough. But the little things will drive you crazy in this game. For instance, there are no default hotkeys for swapping out secondary weapons beyond the mouse wheel, forcing you to scroll wildly in the heat of combat if you run low on ammo. Some of the level designs are poor, such as corridors too small to jump in with turrets at the end, shooting you before you can react. During alarm sections, your team will constantly call you with useless information, which for some strange reason removes HUD visibility DURING COMBAT.   However, if you can get past these small issues, Ghost 1.0 is a very fun game.  ",

Let's get this out of the way:  It doesn't stack up to unepic.  Sure it's different setting and it's much less of an RPG, but still underwhelming.   It's not just me hating on new things, because they are new though. If I played this first, then unepic I would write exactly the same review.  Pros/cons compared to unepic.  Pros: - Voice acting (though it's not really that good, but still welcomed) - Targeting system like in 2D shooters - More gimmics - Gimmics are less evil (I still see brain boss in my dreams) - (SUBJ) Less relayabilty on elemental damage (NO axe good against trees, cold good against fire elemntals, etc. In unepic it turned into rock paper scissors and you had to respec your character) - (SUBJ) Argueably better graphics/style - Lots of different weapons - Android possession mechanic (ripped straight from oddworld)  Neutral: - Less of an RPG and more of metroidvania shooter platformer with occasional puzzle elements - Shorter, but more focused and more plot driven  - Sci-fi setting - Focus on ranged combat instead of melee  Cons: - Abysmal story (if you've read/watched a sci-fi story ever you will see the grand twist from a mile away. I literally knew what the grand twist is going to be since I entered the garden) - Bad characters (too simple and not interesting at all, but a lot of time spent to 'develop' them) - Story taking itself too seriously (there are still lots of jokes and references, but overall plot is more serious. The problem is that plot is too weak to pull that off)  - A lot of arenas with waves and waves of enemies on a timer - Stupidly overpriced powerups and weapons in shops - Getting currency is really slow and tidious - You loose ALL of your currency upon death and you can't recover it - Energy cubes that drop from enemies/crates and give you currency disappear REALLY fast (even with an upgrade) - Smaller world - Too many secrets (almost every room has a little reward for uncovering a secret, but it's too cryptic and time consuming. One time you need kill all the enemies or reach the end of the room, another to switch secondary weapons or possess a certain robot) - Less bosses and they are less memorable - No multiplayer (sure, unepic multiplayer was broken and horribly unbalanced, but it was fun with friends, so that's a letdown) - Spammy combat - You don't get any powers through exploration and they are not linked to exploration (for example in super metroid you find morphball and now you can get to previously unaccessible areas, in Ghost 1.0 your progress is gated only by colored keys and you have to manually unlock your moveset with currency or upgrade points, but it is not reqired (or needed) to complete any areas)  Another BIG, but very subjective con for me is the way how all the references are 'current'. The year is 2048, but the media did not advance one bit it seems. Towards the end of the game ghost tells our geeks that they played too much Kojima games, and that's fine, but it's a joke that could be made today in 2016. It would've been more fun if they said something like Kojima bought konami in it's entirety to get a hold on MGS IP and then made another 14 MGS games or something.   It's fine, but those geeks really don't look like they are in 2048.   Ok, summary:  The game is fun overall and probably worth a playthrough, but there are some really poor design decisions that make that game infuriating at times.   Story is too stupid and predictalbe to care about. In fact I almost wanted to scream at the screen, because characters wouldn't catch to their own ♥♥♥♥ing plot. Oh and there are plot holes and motivation problems as well.  Even if Ghost 1.0 did not have it's shortcomings, game is still just less interesting overall compared to unepic. You will have 10-15 hours with it, but they will not be filled with fun and engagement.  It may very well come down to personal preference, but this game definitely is a mixed bag.",

As it is, i just can't recommend the game, simply based on the fact that many technical details are off, making the whole thing feel and play clunky. The particular issues i have at the moment:  - not everything that happens ingame has sounds, according to the dev this is to keep it from being too noisy  - worst of all, the entire game has constant and noticable input lag, which is especially bad since this game is mouse-aimed. this is not vsync, this is a problem with the render loop  Once at least the last of these things is fixed, the game may be good, but as it is, it's too clunky for me to play and enjoy, and i can only recommend it for people who don't mind a thing or two wrong with their game.  Edit: Dialog button order has been fixed.",

            "review_text": "Well I saw this game and read it was like Axiom Verge and I took the plunge. I played for about 30 minutes and quit. It's not atmospheric like I feel Metroidvania games should be, you are stopped in every room for a bit of dialog which is mostly lame attempts at 'video game humor', there's no sense of exploration, I could go on. Unfortunately, can't recommend this one.",
