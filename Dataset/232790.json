            "review_text": "Quick disclaimer for this review: I have 9.6 hours on record for this game, but the time played for the game is actually half of that (at around 5 hours), as I revisited the game to replay the first part and screw around for achievements, before giving up entirely. I've included some spoilers for the game under warning. Be aware of it if you don't want spoilers.  Having that said: It is now three years later. The Double Fine Adventure kickstarter asked for $400,000 to make this game and they were given $3.45 million to do it. Double Fine, rather than budgeting themselves to stay within that target, sold the first half of the game on Steam so they could raise money for the second half. They already had more money than they needed, but they still sold a half-finished game to bring in more funds, bringing up to around the $4 million mark. It also took them over a year to release the second installment of the game.  Broken Age is like eating a beautiful, delicious cake, and finding out that Double Fine saved money on frosting by using leftover spackle. Then you have to watch Double Fine eating better, more edible cake, bought with your money.   ART: The game itself is, admittedly, gorgeous. The art style and animations are very well done. The voice over talent, too, is pretty decent. I'm tired of hearing Wil Wheaton drone his way through video games, but Pendleton Ward and Jennifer Hale are welcome sounds for your ear-drums. That's where the general positivity ends.  STORY:  The story is abysmal. You play as two characters, Shay and Vella. Shay is trapped on a spaceship under a domineering, overly-loving computer named MOM, with basically no life. Vella is about to be sacrificed to the Lovecraftian 'Mog Chothra' monster because 'tradition.' You control each character in turn, and can switch between either, but they're both sectioned off and unrelated adventures for the most part. In Act 1, the game does a pretty decent job of setting up mysteries: What is Mog Chothra? Who is Marek the Wolf? Why is the ship's computer, MOM, so seemingly hell-bent on imprisoning Shay? Who is the mysterious man in the DeadEye Mountain and how does he have technology like we see on Shay's ship? Why are we still pretending Wil Wheaton has a career in acting when he only ever plays himself with a beard?  In Act 2, these questions are swept under a rug quickly. Players are plied with half-hearted exposition, contrived answers, and massive plot holes that are never filled. Characters from the first game are given completely different rules and motivations than before, but offer no explanation for their behavior change. Shay is useless in the grand scheme of the game, and affects NOTHING of the outcome, when you get right down to it. Acts 1 and 2 favor Vella heavily as the 'get ♥♥♥♥ done' protagonist and she gets most of the interesting story as a result. Getting into spoiler territory below.  ***SPOILERS***  The portrayal of the characters is severely infuriating, too. Shay is a poor protagonist, especially in light of Vella's achievements throughout the game. Shay affects almost nothing story-wise and, in some cases, actually causes problems for Vella as a result of his actions. He is infantilized, both by his overbearing mother and his reliance on child toys for assistance. At one point in Act 2, he is actually, literally replaced by a blow-up doll, while other characters comment on how useless he is. Vella, by contrast, is smart, capable, solves most of the game's big puzzles, directly fights the game's main enemies, and we are told explicitly that she is the most important character in the game because her blood is coveted by the enemies.  The enemies of Broken Age are introduced in the last hour of the game (if you complete Shay's half of Act 2 first) and they barely make an appearance until the last 15 minutes. They are cadaver-white, mutated humans, that have been using eugenics to 'purify' themselves and they use the Mog Chothra ships to secure targets for eugenics testing or something. The game kind of skips over most of the exposition when it comes to their history, character, and motivations, confining it all to a single conversation with Vella before she fission bombs them back to the stone age.  The end result is that Shay is a useless boy, easily replaced, and isn't capable of resolving issues without his child toys. Vella is a strong black girl using death lasers and nuclear bombs to take on the (essentially) Aryan Establishment, who desperately want her blood so they can fix their failing genetic structure. The game ends when Vella melts both Mog Chothra ships together into a literal bridge between the 'normal' world and the Plague Dam, offering no further information about what the characters do, or how the story ends.   ***SPOILERS***  If I wasn't so aware of Tim Schafer's personal politics, I'd almost assume it's unintentional, but it comes off as preachy, pretentious, and frustratingly lackluster.  GAMEPLAY: The place where this game truly, truly fails... is the game-play. That's a cardinal sin in gaming.  Some of the puzzles for Broken Age are clever. They remind me of old-school gaming, where the solutions to problems generally involved the inventive use of a otherwise off-the-wall item to resolve issues. In the entirity of Broken Age, I'd say there's about a dozen examples of this and it works well for the game. The problem is the other several dozen puzzles, which are not intuitive, inventive, or explained. I'm going to save you all time right now and tell you that one of the puzzles in Act 2, regarding a Boa Constrictor, requires that you stop playing the game for three minutes and wait. The game does not tell you this and does not give an immediate or clear indication that the you should wait. It's not explained before this that the snake will get tired and fall off so you can collect him. It was only after getting frustrated and looking up what to do with the snake that I, and my friends, realized you had to stop playing the game for a few minutes to progress in it. Another cardinal sin.  The WORST PUZZLE IN THE GAME is a wiring puzzle, in which you have to rewire helper robots to perform different functions. This isn't easily explained, the instructions aren't listed in a spot that is easily accessed, and even then, they're not marked as instructions on how to fix up the robot. You have to perform this puzzle at least 5 TIMES, although that number skyrockets if you don't know what you're doing, and the answer is ALWAYS randomized, so you can't just look it up. Trying to figure out this rewiring puzzle easily took up over 45 minutes of my time before the game gave me a hint that the answer was somewhere in Vella's half of Act 2. It was another hour before I found the instructions and realized what they were for. The fact that I had to perform the rewiring puzzle another 4 times after this, for different robot 'modes', was just lazy and not fun in the slightest.  The rest of the puzzles in the game either had really boring solutions (like raising/lowering the pH of a mixture, which was more time-consuming than difficult), or they were just run-of-the-mill item fetch quests for things that shouldn't be issues. Shay has a cupcake, at one point, with icing on it and you need to take the icing off, but Shay refuses to just take the icing off. Why the hell is this even an problem!?  SUMMARY:  This is a gorgeous game beset by a lot of gameplay and story issues. Double Fine CLEARLY rushed through development on Act 2 and it shows. There are massive plotholes, the game has no real ending, and the puzzles they set up are lazy in Act 2. The fact that Tim Schafer says this game is a success and he plans to do another kickstarter is reason enough not to support this game, especially after the SpaceBase debacle.  TL;DR:  Game is pretty, but dumb and not fun at some parts. Save your money, buy a better adventure game.",

Really Tim Schafer? You're going to non-chalantly drop a bombshell that one of the main character's family members was actually a traitor and that the villain is a group of genetically self-modified super mutants and that have been harvesting young girls (which, though the game itself points out as sexist and stupid, never gives any real answer for). And, after their targets escape their evil city (which you never visit), they just give up and accept the people they've been subjugating for hundreds of years.   Really!!!  TOTAL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T ENDING!!  If there were plans for an act 3, I'd quickly say, 'Wow, what a cliff-hangar?', but no, everything builds up and just stops on a dime.

            "review_text": "Broken age is the game that really got kickstarter started for games. While it's not the first game, it helped opening the floodgates. And a lot of great games have come out of kickstarter. So, how does Broken Age hold up?  Let me just start this review with saying that no, I've not actually beaten the game.. And I don't feel like doing so, despite having less than 1/3 of it left. That's probably saying a lot about the game.   Graphics &amp; Sound  Broken Age has a very distinct art style. While it might not have the most advanced graphics on the market, it has its own visual identity. If it looks good or not, well that's up to each and every one of us to decide, but the screenshots are representative. The game looks like it does in the screenshots. Personally, I'm a fan of it, I think it's a very pleasing art style. Some of the animations do look a bit off though, and the character models sometimes look like they're not really a part of the world, but overlayed on it. For the most part though, it looks good. One can't talk about Broken Age without mentioning the voice acting. It's excellent. The voice actors all convey the personalities of the characters really well, and it does not sound phoned in. Looking at the list of voice actors this is not surprising though, these are veteran voice actors. The soundtrack is no slouch either, and while it's unlikely to be remembered as one of the all time greatest, it works well with the game, and actually sounds really good.    Story &amp; Setting  Broken age follows two different characters, Vella &amp; Shay, who live very different lives. Vella grew up in a colourful fantasy world, terrorized by a big beast who demands a sacrifice of maidens (and she is one of the maidens who's going to be sacrificed), while Shay lives on board a space ship that caters to his every needs. And never the two shall meet. Or so it feels at least, during half the game. The two characters are entirely separate, and their stories don't seem to relate in any meaningful way. And this, I feel, was a mistake. As the two stories are so disconnected from each other, it's easy to just focus on one character at a time and ignoring the other. The stories do of course end up crossing each other, but then they split again. I found Vella to both have a more compelling story, and to be a more interesting character. Shay just felt a bit bland, where when I was playing through Vella's story I found the game interesting and it motivated me to push forward.    Gameplay  This is a traditional adventure game, in the vein of the games made by Lucas Arts in the mid 90's. Puzzles are mostly inventory based. Find the item that goes with the other item or character, which gives you an item that you then can use to solve a puzzle that gives you another item. It's all very traditional, and there's nothing wrong with that. The issue are with the puzzles. During the first half of the game you're mostly confined to small areas with few items, so even if you can't figure out a logical way for the items to fit together, you don't have many combinations to worry about, so brute-forcing puzzles is easy. During the second half the puzzles gets more involved, but they also don't make much sense. Even after having solved some puzzles, I don't know how I was supposed to know what to do. Moon logic is often used to describe puzzles like these, puzzles that don't make much logical sense, and there's a good amount of moon logic in Broken Age. The worst offenders are the puzzles that require you to use one character in order to find hints on how to solve puzzles for the other character, where the two characters have no way of communicating with each other. It does not make much sense to switch to another character in order to solve a puzzle when they have no way of interacting. The game also does not communicate that you should do this, and in the first half of the game it teaches you that you don't need to switch characters to solve puzzles.   Final Thoughts  While Broken Age is by no means terrible, I feel that I can't recommend it. The moon logic puzzles in the second act and a story where only one half feels compelling just killed it for me. Had the stories been more intertwined and the puzzles better, this game could have been a winner, but as it stands, it just feels like wasted potential.",

            "review_text": "(Note: I'm a backer for Broken Age and it's currently one of the only ways to actually play the game. My money supported Broken Age so I'm obviously biased. Nevertheless, this review is for non-backers who are interested in purchasing Broken Age.)  Broken Age is both a huge risk for Double Fine and a return to form for them. Broken Age's origin is a popular one of initially a small revival of the old school adventure game genre with a small asking price of 400k. This was back when Kickstarter wasn't the monolithic giant that it is now. The project raised much more than that and went as high as 3.4 million dollars. The development of Broken Age can be called rocky at best with expectations being much higher than the Broken Age team ever dreamed of. As a backer I've had the privilege of seeing behind the curtain of game development and have seen the best and worst from the dev team. I had high hopes for Broken Age and the documentary gave me a higher investment for the project than any video game that I've ever looked forward to. Hell, any thing that has your name in the credits is hopefully something that you're proud of being involved with. So call me a fan boy or anything like that, but I won't back down from my stance on Broken Age. After much anticipation I must say that I really enjoyed my time with Broken Age.  The best thing that can be said for Broken Age is how great it looks. Every single environment has the look of it being hand painted and treated with care. You can notice it from looking around by how many things have smiley faces or from how everything seems to fit together perfectly. It was a joy to walk around every new area to see how bizarre yet familiar every environment looks. It's accompanied by a wonderful score that fits each new area. My personal favorite came from Shay's part as it reflects the space ship theme. All of it can fall apart if the actual game play and story don't mesh together well. That isn't the case for Broken Age.  Broken Age's story is one of two characters that are each in different time periods and different situations that are worlds apart from each other. They both can seemingly never meet each other yet both have similar situations. Broken Age is a story of personal triumph from oppressive adults. Whether it be Shay's computer mother or Vella's grandmother both are set out to accomplish self-sacrifice for a goal that is of high importance. They both must decided if they should rebel against their elders in order to break tradition. You'll be able to aid both of them in any order you want to. I went with Shay's story first as I was more excited by space. Without spoiling anything I found the story and dialogue of Broken Age to be charming, funny, and nostalgic. This is the first adventure game that Tim Schafer has made in a long time. Grim Fandango was the last big adventure game that he's worked on as a writer. You could easily notice that he wrote Broken Age by how funny it is. The dialogue tree in particular made me laugh several times. It also has a lot of humor from using your inventory on any thing or one in the environment in order to get some kind of reaction. I haven't played a traditional adventure game since Tim Schafer left Lucas Arts so it was truly a nostalgic trip back to the days when adventure games were big on PC. That said, Broken Age isn't just a trip down memory lane. It's a story of breaking away from the past and paving a new future.  Double Fine promised a return to old school adventure games and it's a promise that was kept. Broken Age play like you typical adventure game with both a mouse cursor and an inventory. In Broken Age you'll have to solve many small puzzles in order to continue forward with the story. Some of these solutions make sense but others are as ridiculous as you'd expect from old adventure game logic. Luckily, it doesn't suffer from pixel hunting problems and brutally difficult puzzle logic. However, I wish that the game offered a button to let you know what kind of items are in the environment as most of the items that you'll put into your inventory don't stand out as well as I'd like.  I also found most of the situations to be fairly easy to solve. I would've liked some more complex puzzles to be in the game. There's also a arm grabbing mini-game in Shay's section that is harder than it should be for something that is necessary to solve in order to beat the game. It's at times far too easy and mostly overly difficult for such a simple mini-game that isn't all that fun. It's also a game that deserves the Beta moniker as the game crashed multiple times for me. It also had numerous bugs such as text being unreadable and characters getting stuck in the environment. These bugs and crashes are an unfortunate part of the early release for us backers but hopefully it shouldn't be a problem once the game is released to the public.  It was probably impossible to fulfill the high expectations that many felt after the huge success of the Double Fine Kickstarter. However, as a backer I'm glad to say that my expectations were met for Broken Age. It certainly isn't the greatest adventure game ever but it's still a well worth your time and money. Broken Age is a highly polished journey that has memorable voices from Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, and even Elijah Wood. These voices were treated right and aren't simply cameos. Everything surrounding Broken Age is filled with the love and care that you'd expect a Double Fine game to have. That's the same with Broken Age but it's also amplified higher than ever before. A lot if riding on Broken Age and I felt that they succeed in making a great adventure game that can hang with the best of the genre. This could all go to ♥♥♥♥ if the second Act in Broken Age sucks but I'm confident that it won't after playing the first Act. It isn't perfect of course. I still feel that the mechanics and puzzles in the game were far too easy to solve or simply obtuse enough for me to be confused for longer than I'd like. Hopefully the second act has better puzzles to solve. The story and everything is strong enough that it overshadows the puzzles but it still hurts the overall package. I can't wait to finish the story of Broken Age as a backer and a fan of old school adventure games.",

The dual PC/split POV narrative has promise and some really fantastic bits (can't say more here without spoilers). The writing is never as outright hilarious as, say, a Monkey Island game, but it does stay consistently amusing throughout.  Also because of its pedigree, the gameplay is gratifyingly streamlined. As an example: in older games, getting from one side of the map to the other was a chore, consisting of watching your character amble along each screen. In this game, if you double click an in-room destination, the character will jog there. Double-click an exit and you warp to the next room immediately, bypassing the walk animation completely. This may be one reason the game is so much quicker to complete, but I'm a huge fan of the feature and others like it. Adventure games should be challenging, but never tedious.  Is it worth full price? I received the game as a gift, so it's hard for me to say whether you will get $20 worth of fun out of it.

And why would I only end a dialog completely but not just end a line the character is saying?  I found the story just not very good. Many characters act so very much without intention and logic, I couldn't let myself get drawn into the world.",

Unfortunately the game is let down tremendously by Act 2 and the poorly-explored story. The ending puzzles are also stupidly frustrating and artifically difficult - after many hours of getting nowhere I didn't bother to finish the game and just watched the ending on YouTube. I was glad I did because I would be annoyed if all my hard work resulted in it!  This is quite a gentle, slow-paced game for the most part. While there are some timing puzzles that require you to be quick, overall everything takes a leisurely pace. This didn't bother me but some may find it too slow.  Act 1 of the game is the only part of the game worth playing. You play as either Shay or Vella up to a certain point, and then switch to the character you didn't choose at the start to play through their story until the two stories align with each other. While Vella's story is more interesting, there are moments in Shay's that genuinely made me laugh. The NPCs are interesting and have some well-written dialogue and the environments are rich and colourful.  Act 2 is very confined to the areas you can explore and doesn't tread much new ground. I was disappointed by this as I'd hoped that it would add more new areas or expand old ones - you barely get a glimpse of the final area which ws built up to be this large and menacing place. The puzzles spike in difficulty, with some being made artifically difficult and frustrating. The second part of the story is also rushed through at a tremendous pace and almost entirely through dialogue with the antagonist. It was interesting that the tone of the game became a lot darker, but it was never fully realised. The execution is clunky.  Overall this game was a big disappointment. If you want to play I would advise keeping a walkthrough handy and having a phone nearby to take photos of some puzzle elements that need to be memorised, but even then you're going to be frustrated.  Pros:  - Gorgeous art style and smooth animation - Writing that's actually quite funny in places - Act 1  Cons:  - The story attempts to be grand but falls flat - Very few areas to explore overall - Some puzzles require big leaps of logic or remembering a lot of information - Unsatisfying ending - Act 2",

I would, to certain kinds of people and I know for sure that they are out there, it's just that I wouldn't to the majority out there. But let's get into this because as I said: It's complicated...  Let's talk about the mechanics first.  It's your standart Point'n'Click Adventure. Inventory system's a bit wonky but it does its job. Collect items, drag and drop, solve puzzles. That's about it.  The only new and interesting thing - and the one that drew me to it in the first place - is that you switch between the two main protagonists and experience the world from their points of view. They didn't really do anything with it mechanic-wise until Part 2 though, so up until then it was only a gimmick really. But a nice one. I enjoyed switching between charakters every other puzzle and it helped to paint a better picture of the world and its story, in my opinion.   Oh, story. In theory I should love this game. For me narrative is more key to a great experience than mechanics (a blend between the two being the 'perfect game') which is why I enjoy games that do focus on it more than I do 'skill-based' ones. Adventure games typically one of the genres that shine in that regard.   And the story to Broken Age is interesting. Well, the ending of Part 1 that is and some of Part 2 up until its rather anticlimatic finish.  All in all it's a story of coming-of-age, paralells and juxtapositions between the protagonists drawn rather well. All characters are likeable, the voice work is well done, the humour keeps your attention but nothing really stands out much. Looking at the other arts as well, the designs are great and so is the music, the animation does its job and all in all they work together well.   But never before in my life have I found myself so physically tired while playing a game. Not frustrated, not bored, not overjoyed, not laughing - nothing. And that's a pitty because I like this game. It just does everything well but supposedly not well enough for me to really be enjoying it. And even when thinking back about the games I've played in my life this one will probably be forgotten somewhere down the line and to be honest, I'm kind of sad about it.   Well, if you want to give it a try I can't NOT recommend it either. It's a bit pricey for the experience you get out of it, in my opinion, so if you ever catch it on sale and are curious about it, please, do help yourself.

            "review_text": "You've likely already heard a lot about Broken Age as it's been covered in a lot of media... Long story short, it's the adventure game that was publicly funded using Kickstarter, the man behind it is Tim Schaefer (of Full Throttle / Grim Fandango / Psychonauts fame), and was touted to be a revival of the adventure game genre.  Whether they've succeeded seems to be open to personal opinion, with the majority that don't agree disliking either the art style (which you can see in the trailer and screenshots, and I think is gorgeous), or that the puzzles are too easy. I'll come back to that point in a moment.  The game itself is charming and always interesting. There are two protagonists, you pick one at the start and begin to play through their story. They are in completely different worlds (one science fiction, the other fantasy), and you can swap between the worlds to experience the other's story at any time. This gives you the opportunity to take a break and return with fresh eyes, or just mix up the pacing. These two separate story-threads do start to show hints of coming together towards the conclusion of the games first act (whilst act two will release later this year as a free update).  One thing the game doesn't have is particularly tricky puzzles. It is worth baring in mind that as only the first act of two so far, the second act has been promised to have more difficult puzzles when it launches. I don't think the puzzles are SO simple to be insulting, but you certainly won't be stuck on any puzzles for longer than a couple of minutes. Most solutions are readily apparant with a little thought, and there's usually enough clues through the environment or the character's comments that you soon realise what needs to be done.  I fully recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good story. As an adventure puzzle game it's a little on the easy side, but the story-telling, dialogue and superb voice acting, setting and music all make for an interesting experience regardless. If the second act has harder / more complex puzzles that's a bonus, but I personally feel there's enough to enjoy here.  (Full disclosure, I backed this game on Kickstarter for $30 / £19)",

I thought it would make for a better gaming experience. Secondly, I am a huge fan of point and click games, having played dozens of them over the last twenty years or so. I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to dumb, illogical puzzles - it kind of comes with the territory with these sorts of games. I don't mind the occasional glance at a walkthrough to get me back on track. So, now, the game. As many others have said, Act 1 was great. Although some the puzzles were really very simple, I didn't mind that, it meant the game had a good flow. The art style/look and feel of the game is great. You're introduced to some interesting characters and a lot of intriguing plot lines are started. You're compelled to keep playing, and that's always a sign of a great game. Unfortunately you then move into the second half of the game, and it was so bad that in several places I almost stopped playing (almost - I haven't abandoned a single point and click adventure yet...). Some of the puzzles were nothing short of absurd, and repetitive game-padding to boot. Unless you really enjoy pretend wiring robots. Strangely, that's not on my all time top ten list of fun stuff to do. Actually, it's not even in the top 1,000. Still, if you're getting really stuck and frustrated and want to progress, you can just consult a walkthrough, right? Wrong, because this game actively hates you so much it had randomised some of the solutions, so you either solve it yourself or you don't finish it. Why the game would want to stop you progressing when you're already at the brink of 'I give up' by removing a walkthrough option, I don't know. And whatever happened to games giving you gentle hints?  Almost as bad are the controls - sometimes for a puzzle you need to click and drag, sometimes you just click and click again, with seemingly no rhyme or reason behind the change, which adds to the frutstration for no reason at all. There's just no excuse for having inconsistent/clunky controls like this. Don't worry *too* much about the gameplay though, because the story is far worse. Did they stop writing this halfway through and chucked an intern at it to finish the rest? I'm only exaggerating a little when I say the 'pay off' in the second half equates to 'because reasons.' Most of the 'plot', such as it is, is relegated to a few lines of dialogue while you play as Vella, whilst Shay is busy on fetch quests for nearly the entire second act. Without wanting to give away any spoilers, don't expect this game to have an ending, because it doesn't. It just stops without any of the story telling 'this is what happened' finesse that viewers and players would generally expect. As an example, something major about a character is revealed towards the end and it passes by without comment from any of the other characters - at all. I prefer plumbers-rescuing-princesses type stories to this. The other main issue with the second half is that there are no new areas. (A couple of new screens I think but nothing else, other than slightly altered versions of first-half environments) It's just the same places that you already explored in the first half of the game. That's it. Walking endlessly back and forth through the same scenes, because as I've mentioned, this game dislikes you and does not want to give you a quick-travel/map option. It wants to see you walk back through 10 screens again and again. Because reasons. I really didn't want to hate on this game as it started so well and it's the kind of game I love so much, but come on, Although the audio was great, it's not as critical as gameplay and story -please spend less money on Jack Black and Hobbits and orchestras, and more money and effort on writing and places to explore. By the way, my playtime is so high because I fell asleep twice whilst playing this game (again, the second half of it). That should be indication enough of how good it is. If you want a more modern point and click game, play the recent Sam and Max games, or Book of Unwritten Tales, or even some of Pendulo's stuff. Because this game is likely to disappoint you, even if you didn't back it on kickstarter/wait years for it to come out.",

The game is incredibly short and since this is supposed to be about half of the game, I am very worried for the total length of this game when it's complete. The puzzles are very simplistic and straight forward which means that the story, characters and enviroments is what has to be good to carry this game.  And they are. The game oozes of atmosphere with great characters, great enviroments all realised with a beautiful artstyle. The story is also good so far but I can't put down a real opinion there as the game is not finished.  [UPDATE: May 02 2015]  The second part is now out and I have to say that the game all in all, is a disappointment. The first thing that is important to mention is that there are very few new assets or anything new to experience in the second part. All characters and enviroments are reused although re arranged and modified a bit to be the setting of the new story and the story in it self is not very good. It doesn't make much sense and the end doesn't manage to satisfy in any way.   The length of the game, as I was afraid of the last time I reviewed the game, is indeed very short and is mostly hold up by some puzzles that will take a long time to figure out. This is because the difficulty spike in the second part is enormous. While the first part was way too easy, the second one can be frustratingly hard. All in all there is one word I would describe Broken Age with and that is disappointment. It might be worth to play if you catch it on a sale for the art and atmosphere alone but otherwise, stay far away from it.",

It can be the developing on, or the perfection of, a preexisting genre, mechanic or idea. It can even be a single transient inconsequential moment when a game made you laugh, cry or – dare we hope? – think.   When writing this review, BROKEN AGE invoked words like “well-presented”, “pretty”, “excellent voice-work” and “interesting.” What it failed to invoke was anything that I will be referencing or discussing one year from now. The paper cutout design is a high-point and should be praised, but I feel that the developers could have done more with it if they had not been aiming for a smooth “nostalgic” style, originally imposed from technical limitations rather than artistic thought. The obligatory challenges are extremely easy, sometimes appearing more as parody than puzzles. The story is decent, but heavily telegraphed. As for the characters, they are well-rounded, with some witty dialogue and funny back-stories.  In the end, BROKEN AGE can probably serve as a very good example of a archetypical point-and-click adventure, tempered by the 2010s decreased focus on puzzles (and accompanied puzzle-related frustration) in favour of story and charm. If that is what you are looking for, BROKEN AGE will most likely suffice. But if you are looking for something 'more', you will not find it here.  ADDENDUM for Act 2: Frustrating backtracking through the locals and people of Act 1, with the added addition of what I think is some kind of overlay graphic bug (not present in the ipad version) that makes two puzzles practically unsolvable.",

I hate episodic gaming, so I was really disappointed when I came to know the game would be split in two chapters. I decided to wait until the whole game would be out, which resulted in a LONG wait. Eventually, the game came out and we played it. Was I happy with it? Well, yes and no... If you're wondering whether I recommend the game, the answer is yes. But don't expect the masterpiece that we were all waiting for, considering the names involved.  The two chapters are so different in terms of story and gameplay that you cannot help but talk about them separately: you probably already heard up to the point of nausea of what everybody talked about. Of how more story-rich but incredibly easy the first part was, and how the puzzles were much harder in the second part where they forgot adding some story though. That's completely true, and depending on your inclination towards adventure games you'll most definitely like one of the two parts much more than the other. I personally prefer richer puzzles and so I enjoyed the second part more, gameplay-wise, but I totally agree that the first part was much more interesting in terms of scenarios, characters, dialogues and story. The second part seems to almost completely cast them aside, which is a pity.  Anyway, since this is supposed to be a review on the game as a whole, let's focus instead on what unites the two parts. First of all, the UI: I don't think I ever hated the UI of a point'n'click adventure so much. It was so obviously conceived for touch interfaces that you cannot help but feel deprived of a much richer experience. There is just a single button for everything: no one was expecting the SCUMM verbs, but was a left/right click interface too much to ask for? This results in a much limited experience in terms of user interaction, as watching/using/talking/etc. are all done the same way, and the game decides what to do for you. Apart from that, I'm also not a fan of how the game looks: I guess the cardboard look&amp;feel was specifically conceived like that, but it feels cheap, especially considering the budget. The music, while decent, is quite forgettable as well, which is a stab in the heart if we think Peter McConnel composed it.  At this point you might be wondering: well, if all of this sucked so far, why are you recommending the game? Well, it's still a Tim Schafer game and it feels like it. Dialogues are (most of the times) funny, and, especially in the second part, puzzles are clever and rewarding. The music is often dull but pleasant and, while as explained I'm not a fan of the graphics, there is some art that is really good to look at (the clouds world, for instance).  Just don't expect a masterpiece and you'll enjoy some 12-13 hours of your life.",

            "review_text": "Even with a beautiful art style, animation, and voice acting, Broken Age turns into a dreadful game. The puzzles start out whimsical and somewhat charming, eventually becoming frustrating and downright asinine. The gameplay relies heavily on backtracking, trial and error, and obtuse 'logic'. You will be forced to run circuits throughout the same 6-8 scenes over and over and over again, deseperately seeking to stumble upon some absurd situation, or item-combining nightmare, for which no precendent was set. This leaves you swinging blindly most of the time, just trying to trigger the next element to some puzzle that really has nothing to do with anything.   Imagine, as a child, it is your birthday, and your parents throw a wonderful party; it's nicely decorated, and your friends show up in elaborate costumes; the presentation of it all is amazing. It is not announced, but now it's time for party games; it's time to break the pinata! ...because... well, you know you have to break a pinata. ...but, you don't know where it is. So you run back and forth across the various sections of the yard, and all throughout the house, looking for any sign of the pinata. The clues to its whereabouts also probably involve calling random strangers in the phonebook until you discover someone who is also having their own birthday party. You should probably get them find and take apart an old VCR though (hint: they don't own one; nobody does anymore), because ...WELL, JUST DO IT. Then, with the VCR in pieces, which you know has something to do with the solution to something somewhere, it still doesn't make any sense. Instead, you wander and cry for an hour before you finally stumble upon where the pinata is hidden. Except, you have no implement to destroy the pinata, and are not tall enough to reach it. Then you realize that trading your aunt some string for a piece of gum, which you then place in the path of the Roomba that is vacuuming the house, will cause it to make a loud whining sound that causes someone outside at the party to trip and fall into the pinata, breaking it apart. Except there are no treats inside, only tears -- tears of the fallen gods, who died out long ago after playing this game.   There is some genuinely funny humor in places, but it is peppered in among cliches, and contrived circumstances built seemingly to make a joke. The dialog and voice acting is otherwise top-notich, though the quality of Act 2 overall, especially in cutscenes, did not feel well-honed, giving it a sense that the project was rushed. There are some good ideas in places, such as with sharing puzzle solutions between protagonists, but they are executed in such a frustrating way that makes playing the game an exercise in patience and tolerance.  Perhaps all of the shortcomings of the puzzles and backtracking could be overlooked if the payout of the story delivered something surprising or exciting, but it never does. The only twist in the game comes early in Act 1, and the rest of the narrative just leans on absurd puzzle situations without actually delivering an interesting overall story. For as odd, and deeply imaginative as the setting and situations are, the story falls flat and doesn't deliver any incentive to see it through. There is just no payout, and that's what makes this the most disappointing. If you must play this, do it with a walkthrough at the ready.",

I think the game suffers from a lack of a single cohesive world, two main characters that have no relationship, and what turns out to be a pretty ridiculous and silly plot (which would be fine in a comedy adventure, except it doesn't pay off the expectations that are built in the early parts of the game, i.e. it's a total let down). Many of the characters don't seem to have any purpose other than to be an artificial road block for puzzle business in the story line, and only a couple of characters I found to be memorable (often the characters that had the least screen time unfortunately).   The second half of the game also spends the most of its time recycling the same environments and characters for the sake of some pretty tiresome puzzles. The timing puzzles are particularly irritating and don't communicate well visually. I worked through most of the second act without needing any hints, but eventually I hit a point where I just wanted to be done with the game and so I read the solutions. No regrets there.  I really like the art in the game, but I think a different, more traditional adventure game art style may have helped get the game done sooner, and I would have rather played a game with worse art, that felt more polished, with more environments, better developed characters and more refined puzzles, than this game, which feels like made a lot of compromises simple because it was so damn time consuming to paint and animate.  Finally though, I have to say that I don't feel ripped off and I still hope Double Fine can come back from the damage that Kickstarter and Early Access have done to their reputation in the past year or so. The documentary is great (particularly the first 10 or so episodes before development started getting into trouble) and was worth the price of entry alone, and it's clear that the people at Double Fine care a lot about what they do, but this project had some fundamental problems right out of the gates and the result is a game that I can't put up alongside classics like DOTT or Full Throttle.",

Even though I had to check internet aid in pretty early in act 2, I also got puzzles that made me use pen &amp; paper, which is fantastic.",

I don't really care for point and click games that much, but even I've played way better - what the hell have you guys been playing?  YEAHYEAH the music is good, the art is neat in it's own way blahblahblah. The voice acting is decent (save for the ultra-mousey and annoying as hell Vella) but I expect that with the cast that's on it. 3 million dollars you accomplished that much - congratulations.  First off, I wasn't expecting to beat this in about 5 hours, that's bad. I know it's in two acts, but we're sitting at 10 hours play time total? And I was lazy while playing it since I was bored by the 'amazing' story.  Revolutionary? By no means. I mean, how is this at all advancing or re-defining the genre? I get that there's not a lot of point-and-click titles, filled with crap like Anna and Gone Home... but if you think this game changes anything for the better, you just aren't familiar with the genre. At all. Maybe that's why everyone keeps gushing out the word 'nostalgia' - as if boasting about rarely playing a genre makes you a better game reviewer.   Honestly, you can get the Deponia series for cheap thru the frequent semi-annual sales on steam, and all three acts are good games on their OWN, you don't even need all three. They are filled with at least 10-12 hours *per chapter* and with more interesting and inventive puzzles and game mechanics. You know what else you get as opposed to this game? An interesting story, amusing dialogue, and much better characters. I cannot see anyone playing the Deponia series and coming out praising Broken Age. This is just very boring pretty fluff.",

The virusals.. the musical score.. the voice acting.. Just the very first scene of Vella waking up under a tree sets the tone for the rest of the adventure. It's enchanting. It's like watching your very first cartoons with children's eyes. There are quite enough puzzle, mostly very easy, but the adventure focusses more on the dialogues which you souldn't miss a single line as they are so well written and acted. Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Will Wheaton, ... even Pendleton Ward is in it :) For the french speaking person i am not very much used to recognize english actors by their voice, i was surprised and pleased to recognize them in the game! The subtitles are very well translated, by the way. Really, it praises quality ... over quantity, which is the game's only downside. The game is very short (typical for point'n'click adventure games) and Act2 isn't even released yet, but it will be soon and for free. I just can't wait for it.

            "review_text": "This game is very good, but not as good as Grim Fandango.  Broken Age is a point and click adventure game by Tim Schafer, about two teenagers who live two seemingly different lives. First there is a girl who has been chosen to be sacrificed to a monster but decides to fight back. Second, is a boy who has been raised on a spaceship by an overprotective super computer, but now he wants more excitement in his life.  The art style and environments are gorgeous and Imaginative, the characters you interact with are colorful and memorable, and the humor is well written. The story, while not as good as some of Tim’s past work, is a pretty decent story with some interesting twists and turns along the way. And while I do believe the game’s ending does leave some questions unanswered, I personally found it satisfying.  My personal problem with the game was that some of the puzzles felt a bit too cryptic. I felt like I was forced to find the solutions online, and after finding the solutions, it made me wonder how any normal person would figure them out without having to resort to a walkthrough. It would have been helpful if the game had a hint button like they had in the Monkey Island special edition. Despite this, it didn’t really ruin the experience for me.  If you in the mood for a nice, charming, adventure game then I would recommend checking it out. It may not be perfect, but is still an experience worth having. I give this game a 7.7/10. ",

Everything is a bit sparse, very few things to interact with.  Puzzles are absurdly simple, there's a couple of odd leaps of logic as per standard but since you have such a tiny inventory and so few things to interact with it's hard to get stuck. Given this was backed on the love of oldschool adventure gamers, this should've been way more of a focus. Also for people who are used to exploring rooms you'll find a lot of dialog is out of place - your character is suddenly asking around about things they've not yet heard of.  The two stories are charming but shallow, old adventure games were marketed at kids but the complexity of them was what made them stick. This has none.  It's hard to picture how DoTT had a budget of 600k, while they only managed half a game with a tiny fraction of the depth, with 3.3million  In Act 2: Puzzles go from barely existing to frustratingly vague, random and even glitched to impossibility. They don't even make sense, the two characters need to share knowledge on several occasions through the player, there is no possible way each could get the solutions the other needs to find out for them. For one of them there is NO way to find out the answer, you have to just rely on the fact it's not the other 3 options and the game has given you a fourth out of the blue.   A lot of the fail states are mind numbingly boring to reset - do it enough times and the game will actually step in and cut out some of the steps so it's not like they weren't aware the puzzles kinda sucked.  I'm sort of imagining this is the backlash from everyone complaining act 1 was too easy, but there's a thing called balance and this is both of the worst ends of the spectrum.  Story wraps up in record time - but still makes no sense - and then the finale is forced and anticlimactic, dialogue is much shorter, much less witty, character development is nil. Revelations that should be earth-shattering and psyche-breaking are shrugged off in seconds. The ending not only doesn't make sense, it doesn't even solve anything.  All in all if this were a quirky bargain bin game then sure pick it up, play for a bit and then forget. As a story it's a mess that clearly wasn't planned in advance. As a promised hark back to the old school games of yore, it's a nail in their coffin.   This is not the game we backed.",

Fascinating story, insane twists, some good humour, interesting puzzles, this is a great point-and-click game! I don't often go for point-and-click, I'm more of a survival horror or realistic FPS gamer, however I'm very glad that I bought this. The artwork, the soundtrack, the voice acting (I swear one of the characters sound like Jack Black!), and the world that is portrayed is very unique. I sadly only got 4 hours out of the playthrough (Yeah, Angry Joe wouldn't approve...), but it was 4 hours of quality. If Act 2 is included in this purchase, I'd definitely say it's worth the price, however if Act 2 is a whole seperate game that costs more than $15, I might think twice.   Yeah it's awesome, but I don't think there's much replay value here. I guess it all depends, if you like interesting characters, stories, worlds, twists, all in an artistic point-and-click game that will more than likely have some sequels, yet can overlook a somewhat lack of replayability and a less than 5 hour playthrough, then this is definitely for you. I typically consider myself a strictly FPS/RPG/Survival Horror gamer, yet this caught my attention and I'm glad I played it, so I suggest giving it a look to see if it tickles your fancy.

            "review_text": "I can't say how much I recommend this game. This game is literally the reason I got into gaming (I saw the NPR piece about it and I knew I had to get my hands on something that lovely).   Story: The first half is fantastic story. In the documentary they pointed out that things really kick up once Merrick shows up and that's definitely true. You don't really know what is going on or who to trust. Then you have the end of the first half and the beginning of the second half.   The big mysteries in the first half are pretty quickly filled in within the second half but personally I loved the ways they were revealed (for one my husband was watching over my shoulder and exclaimed in surprise) and that the focus of the game was then executing specific tasks, rather than hunting for clues.   I also really liked the ending; it reminded me strongly of the ending of Transistor with it's understated approach and use of the credits.   Overall the story was just suspenseful/unnerving enough without being something I wouldn't recommend to younger players and fantastically winsome and memorable.   Character Balance/Development: In the first half Vella's world is more flat than Shay's. She's less clearly motivated and the objects she carries don't result in really any clever dialogue at all (as far as clicking on them in inventory, offering them to everyone, etc). Shay's world on the other hand was amazingly rich. The spoon and knife I didn't really discover until my second play through and they alone make his entire world more charming.   In the second half that's much more balanced. While Shay still has more interesting tasks since he isn't trapped as much in one locale, Vella picks up the knife and a fork and some new characters show up in her locale (along with an old one I was really hoping we hadn't seen the end of!) that give her more engagement. Shay has more of the 'I don't think we can use that that way' lines in the second half.   Shay is in my opinion more rounded and makes more sense than Vella. We don't get a good sense of Vella without really digging into one or two lines; otherwise she comes off as needlessly and oddly intense. But they are both very winning and you feel a vested interest in them.   One thing character wise that bugged me in the second half was the fact that one character stands around on a beach and you can't really talk to him. His big issue is pretty easily solved and then he's just there for most of the game. If you try to talk to him you get the auto 'Never mind!' line and have to walk away. That seemed really pointless.   Puzzles:  They are definitely uneven but not unduly so. The first half of the game they are realizing things are not as they seem. The second half they are trying to cope with certain big revelations and new realities. It makes sense that other things are suddenly harder as well.   I have NO idea why people hate the second half so much. The puzzles are clever but not so obscure that you would never get them (I found the knot puzzle easy while I would miss certain more obvious items, like how to get the shell). Most of the time if one side got old I would switch and play the other and suddenly things would make sense to me. So I felt like it played very smoothly. You need to diagram some things out but please, that's point and click standard. If you don't see that as the sign of a good game then don't play point and click.   I also didn't understand the claims some have made about not having a hint system. When your character tells you 'Maybe I should look for X' how is that NOT a hint? Same with your character asking another repeatedly if thing X will cause reaction Y.   I like all others would have liked more new territory, but again, that's point and click standard to have one environment you really scrub over again and again. If it had all been released at once it would have been less striking.   I know there's more I could say here but these were the reasons I got into the game and these are the only things that really matter to me. It's a gorgeous game that is incredibly addicting and charming. If this appeals to you at all, buy it! It's well worth every cent!",

It's a point-and-click adventure, of course, but a very simple one; sometimes the only difficulty that arose was from temporarily looking over an item that needs to be used. I'm not sure if it's even possible to truly fail this game, to be honest. The game is short, simple enough if you pay attention, and doesn't particularly fall prey to the Sierra Logic issues that sometimes come with point-and-click games (Sierra games were infamous in particular for occasionally having puzzles with solutions that were so absurd, they didn't make sense). If you're looking for a complex puzzle game or something involving some combat, then you should look elsewhere.  I recommend this game mostly on the merit of the story, music, and art style. If you've ever played Double Fine games before (Psychonauts comes to mind), then you'll have an idea of what sort of tone this game's story has. I enjoyed the characters and settings, short as everything was, and I'm glad I played it. I wish there had been more to do at least in some of the interactions, but considering this is part 1 of a 2-part game, I'm not going to hold it against the game.  What this review basically comes down to is if you can like a game mostly for the story and style, then this may be good to look into. If you want a challenging sort of gameplay experience, though?

            "review_text": "You'll either hate it or love it - as such, it's a game about duality and how seemingly unrelated paths through crazy circumstances lead to one point.  While I was not a backer for the original Kickstarter campaign (I didn't start backing games on that site until last year), I did follow their journey through the DoubleFine Adventure via epsidoes released every so often on YouTube, and let me tell you - it's a whole other experience watching a game being made, and THEN playing it. In short: it was an intimate experience, and I have much better understanding as a gamer about how the other side of the coin operates.  I played Broken Age all the way through in one sitting - due to the anticipation from fans, I felt it was most appropriate to play it that way since serveral people complained about the 'broken' experience where they whizzed through Act 1, then waited, waited, waited, got impatient, then brute-forced Act 2. If your experience was like that, I'm sorry you feel hatred towards this game, but your particular experience casued your particular reaction. The game, while it may feel unevenly paced, is still an enjoyable game in what many modern gamers consider to be 'A dying genre'. Adventure games are here to stay, as long as people play them, classics, remakes, or modern ones, it makes no difference.  The art direction is great, the music is excellent, the animation (while not Disney calibur), fits the artwork appropriately and tolerable. The mechanics are as-expected for a Point-and-Click adventure, along with controller support (if that's your thing). The story is interesting enough to keep you moving ahead, even if some puzzles are frustrating until you look up hints or draw a diagram on a post-it or two (like I did for that Hexpals wiring puzzle) - it only makes you more satisfied once you finish. Depending on your first playthrough, you may or may not want to do it again to snag all of the achievements (for you Perfectionists/Completionists/Achievement Hunters out there).  Overall, if you love the magic of Double Fine games, if you love Adventure games, if you like games that try to do something different and pray somebody will appreciate it, play this game. Whether you come to love it or hate it, at least acknowledge the money, the hard work, and most of all, the love that Tim Schafer and friends put into the game.  It's worth the experience.",

I haven't touched it before tonight (bought it sometime last year during a sale) and waited patiently for it to be ready for a full-on, one-session playthrough. The question is: Was it worth the wait?  The (spoiler-free) answer to that is: Yes it was, if you have been patient and didn't raise your expectations too high.   Now, something to say right away -  Broken Age  is not the adventure to end all adventures. It has its strengths and weaknesses. But what makes assessing them hard is that they switch around. In Act 1, the story was very strong and somewhat mysterious while the puzzles were mostly fairly easy. In Act 2, the story lost a lot of its pull (in my opinion) but the puzzles became more complex and challenging, some of them just the right amount to be satisfying, some pushing it a little (or well) into the realm of the frustrating.  But I will not blame Double Fine for experimenting with some of the concepts behind puzzles. The fewer developers keep recycling the same concept, content and game over and over, the better, so I can admit I was satisfied with that part of the game even though I eventually had to look up a hint or two.  The story left a somewhat bitter aftertaste, though. It's not that it's bad overall - The presentation is brilliant, the setup stellar (particularly Shay's Act 1 was great) and the cast of experienced and skilled (voice) actors add to it, as do the beatiful soundtrack and catching visuals. And the writing also doesn't leave a lot to be desired: It's witty, but not too over-the-top and just the right amount of educational to be played by all ages. It does, however, suffer from what I would call the 'Mass Effect 3' effect: By the end, it seems like nobody really knew what to do with it, so it was just wrapped up in whatever way they could. It's not as bad as Mass Effect 3 but I found the conclusion unsatisfying and the last few scenes made me wonder where the good writing with its surprises and twists had gone and why I was now watching a B movie.  I know that doesn't sound like a hearty recommendation but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pick it up.  Broken Age  is still a great adventure; it just isn't without faults, just like the story of its development.   Be aware, though, that you are probably only going to get one playthrough of 8-10 hours out of it (maybe another some years later). But during a sale, this is a good pick.",

The characters are interesting though admittedly one-dimensional (just like most point and click adventure games) and the conversations are mostly quite entertaining. I think the voice acting is superb as well, especially with the two main characters and the Computer ('Mom'). The animation and visuals prove that a game does not need super high def SSAO bloom TressFX etc etc to set the atmosphere of a game in the right direction. The overall aesthetic (visuals, music, ambience) elicit zero complaints from me.   Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the gameplay. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I found the item hunting a bit tiring at times. I wish there was a way to speed up conversations, as I generally read much faster than people speak (pressing space will skip the entire conversation, not just the current dialogue with subtitles) and though there are some areas where your character can run, most of the time you walk at a very slow clip. I'm glad that there isn't much hand holding, but when certain areas open up, it can be a bit annoying to walk back and forth between screens looking for an item I missed.   Still, it's not like I did not enjoy the gameplay at all. I think the clever dialogue (and even off hand remarks as I look at items or walk past characters) cracked me up, and that makes a ton of difference in adventure games. I had an idea of where the story was heading at first, but now I'm not so sure. All I know is that Act 2 cannot come soon enough.",

It seems every title I've touched with him behind the director's chair reminds me why I love video games.  Apparently 16 years since his last point-and-click adventure game, Grim Fandango, and the man still knows how to work it. I mean it's not like he wasn't doing anything, with Psychonauts and Brutal Legends druid-plowing themselves into my favorite's list, but point-and-clicks are very different from your normal genre. Practically visual novels; if the story or context doesn't hook you, there's nothing to go back for it aside from meager puzzles.  Luckly Broken Age hooks you from the start with both, and beautiful artwork to boot. Shay and Vella's story is nothing new, something we've seen or read plently times before, but Tim Schafer's spin leaves it refreshing. For example, Shay's situation is entirely understandable, where he puts a mental barrier between him and the 'Computer' who is taking care of him. Although never brought up by Shay or the game itself, it's likely only programmed to take care of him - it isn't true love and concern. Yet all it takes is some lovely voice-work provided by the ever awesome Jennifer Hale and a small story toward Shay, and I can't help but feel sad for 'Computer'. Damn you, Shay, just call her 'Mom' for once.  Contrary to what I'm saying above, the game is light-hearted. Vella's story about sacrificing maidens is not as grim as you'd imagine it to be. No blood or gore, just a small glimpse of a body as it's devoured by a giant species of monster called a Mog. Yet that's part of its charm. Combined with its watercolor artwork and peaceful soundtrack, it's as if I'm reading a children's storybook. Then you eventually come across someone whose name is shortened to Ch't.... heh-heh.  All and all, I am very looking forward to Act 2. Having started Shay's story first, I thought I had an idea of where his story ended when I was nearing the end of Vella's. The end of Act 1 practically told me 'Nope,' punched me in the face, and jumped off a cliff. I'd pay again in order for it to come sooner, but like everyone else, I'll have to wait for the free update... whenever that is.  C'mon, Tim. Don't do this to me, man. I needs it. I needs it now~",

What I didn't like: - There are not much of areas to explore. It felt compact. - While the plot is clevery written, it still does not capture what made classic adventure game stories interesting. There isn't much to get interested in the two main characters (Shay and Vella). We are simply solving their life problems. - Very simplistic point-and-click game. Clicking on an object will automatically trigger whatever the progammer wanted it to be. Sometimes the character would comment on it, sometimes will try to 'activate it' and sometimes will take it. I'd prefer it if it reused the verb technique, like in Curse of Monkey Island (Look at, Use/Pickup, Talk/Eat). - The puzzles at the end of the game were frustrating and confusing.  Verdict: It is a return to classic adventure games alright but I don't see it surpassing my favourite classics (Full Throttle, Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Sam and Max). However, it is still a recommended game for all those who still want Adventure Games. It is better than whatever Telltale is doing with Game of Thrones, that I can tell ya.",

As someone who likes logical consistency there's a lot of the old-style lucas arts, and third party adventure game puzzle farts where there's an incredible logical leap to solve a puzzle even though it doesn't make much sense and it gives off the impression of being simultaneously lazy and genius at the same time. Not recommended. I would give it a 7.5/10 for art style because while it's not well animated the design is intriguing, and 5/10 for the story because there's no consistency, flow, or real story to speak of besides what is presented topically but there are definitely some interesting concepts which are brushed on the surface but never dug into sadly.

For those of you who have been living under a rock for two years, Broken Age (previously known as Double Fine Adventure) was a huge kickstarter success, finishing up with over 3 million in crowd-sourced funds. Being one of the original big Kickstarter projects, there was some worry, but Double Fine pulled through in the most stylish way possible.  The game is split into two parts, which is.... split into another two parts. This is a review of Act 1. Act 2 will be released some time this year, and here's hoping it's as good as this act. In each act there are two tales to play, both incredibly different, but linked in many, many ways. In one, you play as Vella, a girl forced into tradition. In the other you play as Shay, a boy forced to stay in a spaceship his whole life. Both stories are incredibly fun to play.   On your first playthrough you may not notice the similarities between the stories, but if you think about them and put the events together in your mind, you realise how linked these tales are. I can't describe the amazing feeling I had when I discovered these connections. I can't really describe them without completely spoiling the game though.  The gameplay is what you would expect from any adventure game. It's fun, puzzling and satisfying. The only downfall is the sheer simplicity of the puzzles. I only really got stuck on one puzzle and even then it's because I just didn't notice one item amongst the background. However, this is actually a pro for younger gamers, as they will enjoy it without getting frustrated.  The art. Oh man, the art. It's gorgeous. I can say no more, just look at the screenshots.  The music is fantastic as in most Double Fine games. Some great peaceful, ambient tunes to relax you as the gears in your head grind.  The story is obviously great, with some excellent writing. The biggest caveat in adventure games for me is feeling bored as lines and lines of text go on and on. In this game though, I was always interested, clicking on every dialogue option available. The AAA voice acting helps a lot too. Before you ask, yes, Jennifer Hale is in it.  Overall, Broken Age is a must-buy. Generally I don't preorder or buy games at launch, I just wait for a sale. But this time I did and it was worth every dollar. The length may be an issue, but for me just Act 1 was worth the purchase, but with another act on the way, there's really no reason not to buy this ASAP.   What more can I say? Brilliant art, music, puzzle design, writing, voice acting.... It all helps to make this a great, great game. Do yourself a favour and pick this up. You won't regret it.",

Honestly I was surprised by Jack Black in what had to be his tamest performance yet. The first time I heard his character speak I was honestly put in mind of the character Arthur from the Journeyman project games, a character whom I love. I eventually realized it was Jack Black and for once, I didn't groan. Well done. The characters are diverse in temperament there was something similarly off about most of them. Not to ruin the story but a person who obstinately remains calm in the midst of mind wrenching horror is one of the scariest things I can think of. The banality of horror is truly chilling. Not to say this is a horror game, ho no! But keep in mind this is Tim Schaefer. He don't make games what don't have twisted sentiments. Gameplay was your standard Point und Klick Adventurwerks we all grew up on, but the inclusion of the drag and drop rather than clicks to use items really threw me for a while. I am very much used to the 'classic' controls-- ok the 'Non-textual input classic' controls-- I see you over there hipster gamer with your second-hand copy of Zork. Shut up before you attract a grue. I guess this was decided because they felt it more fit with The Tablet Set who are more used to drag and drop. The story is difficult to describe without spoiling it. Suffice to say it's great. I highly recommend it and I eagerly await its sequel.  A+",

There are points of the game where I snickered at the jokes or found somethings ironic to a point of being funny, but nothing really got me excited to play this. The puzzles didn't feel very challenging and the characters and jokes almost made me feel as though I was playing through a family film.  The music, voice-overs, and art are astounding; so, if you're into highproduction adventure games, this game is for you. I bought it because of Tim Schafer and to be quite honest, there's so much character that comes out this game, it was too hard to say no.   Perhaps I'll look at it again once the second chapter comes out, in hopes that the ending of the game becomes more 'serious'.",

I'll get the cons out of the way first: -The game suffers from one of my pet peeves in point and click games, the character 'magically' knows which items it can or can't interact with and which items will save a purpouse later on. if you can click on something and pick it up, your character's not gonna dare part with it until it eventually needs to use it for something. -There is a part in the second half of the game where the two characters need to perform actions based on the other characters' knowledge, even though there is no interaction between them. You can write this off as them acting on instinct or guessing, but... It probably could've been written better.  Pros: -Y'know, I could honestly care less about this game's gameplay faults because at it's core, it's a story. You're here for the plot, for the characters, and for the worldbuilding. And it excels at those. It's a truly good story, which is occasionaly paused when you hit a puzzle that you have a hard time solving. -There are also stuff I liked about the gameplay, but as I said, this game should be played mostly for the story it tells and the world it takes place in.",

The voice acting is top-notch, and the story (as far as I have experienced in Act 1) is riveting as you move from place to place, even room to room.  One minor flaw is that the puzzles aren't as challenging as I would have liked. Saying that, they are aiming to bring this genre to a wider audience and for that I can not really fault them.  I for one can't wait for Act 2. I highly recommend this title, even at full price.",

I have played other adventure titles, like the Telltale games, and Ron Gilbert's recent release THE CAVE, yet this is my first real taste of Tim Schafer's distinct style. So with that being said please understand my expectations may differ from those who have played the vaunted Lucas titles, and have an affinity for that type of gameplay. For me though, this game was just a delight. Starting with the basics, the visuals in this game are unlike anything I have seen in a game. The use of these warm, wholesome colors, and these weird and off-kilter shapes and designs creates a distinct and wholly unique visual vocabulary, that just grabs you from second one, and never lets you go. And the way Tim Schafer's dialogue compliments that visual design is just spot-on. Really irreverent and dry humor gives way to some hilarious and unforeseen non-sequiturs that just lend itself so nicely to the feeling of familiarity and at the same time, mystery of this world. The music and voice-acting are also huge strengths. Everyone is really on-point with their line readings, and all the actors seem perfectly cast, and organic to the universe. The music drifts, almost like the wind, in the background of the game. Providing an eerie, almost ethereal quality to the game. But it can turn on a dime, and become the bombastic and self-important score of a summer blockbuster, which helps to highlight some of the more intense and larger-than-life moments. Now, all of this stuff combined would be enough for me to recommend it to anyone, but it is the gameplay that really puts this one into the stratosphere for me. The puzzle design, while sometimes subject to archaic tropes of the genre, is generally fantastic. The character inventory never gets so out-of-hand that I was banging my head on the wall for a solution, but not so easy that I was able to just breeze through it. The real process of solving was more reliant on your knowledge of each screen in a given area, and all the interactables in each screen. Limiting inventory allows you to focus more on the environment and less on the interactions of items you have in your possession. The puzzles difficulty was definitely ramped up in the second act, and sometimes there were ways to solve a puzzle that I felt weren't telegraphed in a way that made them readily apparent. But I was able to overlook those, as most of the puzzles were pretty self-evident, and required a little more than a modicum of thought to solve. Overall, I found this game to be one of my more cherished gaming experiences in recent memory. There were so few obvious flaws, and so few sour notes that I would be remiss if I did not recommend it to anyone who has even a tertiary interest in graphic adventure games. A nice, succinct, and gloriously original experience from the people at Double Fine. Great work!",

            "review_text": "Broken Age mixes a wonderful story of two perfect strangers chosen to fulfill a great destiny with beautiful hand-painted aesthetics to create one of the best graphic adventures of all time.  Divided in two acts (one which came out February 2014, the other April 2015) you control both characters in different environments, having the ability to switch between them at any given time. Sometimes, the actions from one affect the other, which makes some of the puzzles hard and compelling.  The story itself is amazing, one the best I've ever seen. Combining sci-fi with fantasy, finally creating one of the best atmospheres you could imagine for this kind of game.  Totally recommended.  ___________________________________  Original review Posted: 20 Feb, 2014 @ 7:38pm  'Broken Age's only flaw is being episodic. Well, not even a flaw. I mean, I just want to play the rest of it NOW! Hand painted graphics, wonderful performance, perfect gameplay, compelling story, and top-notch voice acting. What else do you want in a videogame?  A prime example of how Double Fine excels at videogame making, and how a really good graphic adventure is done. I can't wait for the rest of it to get released!  If you like having cliffhangers and enjoy the wait, you should get it now, if not then wait for the rest of the episodes and then get it. It's a superb graphic adventure, and a magnificent piece of art in every sense, in graphics, story, screenwriting, voice acting and gameplay mechanics.'",

Nothing says 'evil' like social Darwinism!   Broken Age is Tim Schafer's Kickstarter success, a point-and-click experience that allows the player to switch between two young protagonists. Vella from Sugarbunting is a plucky young girl who has been chosen for The Maiden's Feast, which is a ritualized virgin sacrifice to a monster named Mog Chothra that supposedly keeps the creature from raining destruction down on the town. Shae, a young dude, is trapped in a juvenile routine on a spaceship at the overprotective behest of MOM, and yearns for anything resembling real adventure.   Needless to say, Vella doesn't take her impending sacrifice lying down, and Shae goes out of his way to find some real action. Without getting too far into spoiler territory, this derails the long-standing ritual and reveals that both of their roles served a far different purpose than they originally believed, and that those responsible for their respective scenarios are the true antagonist(s).   All of this is experienced in the typical point-and-click fashion as you wander about, picking up various objects and discerning how exactly they can help you overcome your current roadblock. Sometimes the answer is obvious, occasionally it's unclear, and in some cases you have to switch between the characters to find the solutions you need, but the game rarely leaves the player grasping at straws for the solution, especially since making mistakes will at times reveal a hint for figuring out the right move.   Basically, it's a good story and a fun game to experience for a few hours. It may not outrank Psychonauts on my Tim Schafer game list, but it's definitely among the better works of Double Fine.",

A story first above all else; above crazy graphics, above gameplay, and even above music, etc. A story that lets you become a part of it.  There are so many games these days that seem to forget that you should always start with that good story first, with fully realized worlds and the characters that inhabit them. And the games that do realize what should come first, usually turn out to be amazing works of art; games that draw you in and never let go, and have a lasting impression. And Broken Age is an excellent example of this. The story is at the heart of the experience and you can feel it.  And even though this game might seem very simplistic in nature (given its gameplay style), it truly is just as satisfying to play as it would be to play a huge, multi-million dollar, RPG production made by a first-party studio by hundreds of people. But I think that's what makes this game so special: that it can be as great as it is even though it was made by just a handful of dedicated people who truly care about what they’re creating and why they’re creating it.  Double Fine has shown that you can have an exciting adventure that whisks you away to worlds full of challenges, laughter, and even emotionally-engaging moments, in the form of a point-and-click adventure that’s very accessible and easy to pick up and play. And the impact you feel at the end of Act 1 is an immensive one, that really gets you thinking. It was surprising to find out how much I cared about what happened to the two main characters and how they impacted the worlds around them.  I would definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a great story, even if the gameplay style isn’t normally what they might be in to. You just might be surprised with how much you’ll enjoy it.  I absolutely cannot wait until Act II! I cannot wait to go back into Shay's and Vella's worlds to finally get some answers to some burning questions!

            "review_text": "--- DISCLAIMER: This review is written by someone who, obviously, was a backer to the project. As well, it must be noted that only the first half of the game is playable.---  After a long wait, the game that truly kickstarted the Kickstarter games craze is out - well, half of it, for now. I liked it.  While it certainly has a more streamlined approach to point-and-click gaming, Broken Age does have the charm that reminded me of that golden age of graphical adventure games, back in the 90s. The character design is delicously original, the storyline starts slow but develops deeper themes of alienation and absence of control over one's own life, the storybook-style visuals are evocative and beautiful, the orchestral music is simply stellar, and most of the cast does a magnificent job of breathing life into their characters - with a special mention going to Jennifer Hale as 'Mother'.  Inventory management is stripped to the bare essentials, and there is no use of verbs or actions - think Telltale Games, not early 90s Sierra or LucasArts. But this stripped-down design does not turn the game into a simple QTE-fest. At its heart, it is still an adventure game, with all the backtracking, item-hunting, and puzzle-solving that is involved. Besides, most adventure games of old may have had multiple verbs and actions available, but most items and interactable objects in the games were usually a one-way thing: if you didn't select the exact right verb or the exact right item, you simply couldn't do anything with said item. Thus, freed from useless time-wasting devices, the game can concentrate on its storyline. And while the first part, so far, may seem short, let's remember that you could finish classic adventure games like Monkey Island 2 in less than two hours.  Some will nevertheless be disappointed, but after nearly two years of development, there wasn't much that Tim and his gang could have done to satisfy the tallest expectations from the hordes hungry for a Double Fine Adventure. But make no mistake, Broken Age, so far, is a gem.",

Additionally there are sadly no new twists on the point &amp; click genre so the whole game feels very 'safe'. But don't get me wrong this doesn't make the game bad or anything.

The game has a deeper goal than simply making you laugh, so it toned down the humor Do expect Broken Age to tell you a story instead of stumping you on puzzles. Puzzles are easy, but that serve to make the story and the exploration more enjoyable.  If you go without theses assumptions, you will discover a charming game, in a wonderful world, that is begging for you to explore it more. It's a story more than a game, and I love it for that.

I just finished playing a game and I was thinking of which one to try next, so I picked this game, because it looked like it would be nice and short.   When I started playing it, it was almost nothing that I expected, the only exception being the graphics. For the first few minutes the absurdity and childishness of both of the protagonists decor was quite deterring, but after learning of the background it became quite atmospheric and fitting. The decor only helped to further the air of being plunged into the insanity that the other characters created.  As the game progresses more and more twists intrigue you to continue further in the game and to find out more. The puzzles can be quite tedious in some parts, but they can easily be conquered with a guide or some hints from the internet, if you don't feel like completing them yourself.   This game was for quite a long time in the making, but the end product is worth the wait and now that it is finished the long wait is merely the past. I would also suggest that you don't wait through the credits unless you either backed the kickstarter or you find usernames amusing.  Broken Age is a great game that if you ever get the chance or ever become intrigued by it, you should buy and play it, it's worth the money and the time.",

The style is captivating. Easy on the eyes and detailed where it needs to be. The animations were fantastic. They really brought the chatacters to life, as did the voice work. Every character felt real, which is an impressive feat compared to what some bigger games have done. You can tell that Double Fine devoted a lot of time to each character to make each one feel like a person, and I love every line of dialogue you can get out of them.   HOWEVER, as much fun as I had with Broken Age, there is a HUGE caviat I have to put forward. As a $15 Backer of the project, I most certainly am happy with what I paid and what I got, knowing full well that there's more to come. $22.49, in my opinion, is much too steep a price at this stage. I finished Act 1 in under four hours. While it was fun and extremely well executed, I would be extremely disapointed paying that much for this game in its current state.   So while a fantastic work, I personally don't believe that the current price is justified. I'd say wait for a sale, or wait for Act 2. I would not pay $22.49 for what I just played. It was a fun adventure with great atmosphere and a neat story, but I can't recommend it now for this price unless you REALLY enjoy the genre.

If anyone has played any Hidden Object or Puzzle adventure games you can understand how frustrating and rewarding it could be at times. During parts of Broken Age there weren't many items to look for and that's when it was more of like an interactive story. As for the characters, the voice acting from a star lineup was incredible and I couldn't find one character I didn't like.

            "review_text": " Disclaimer: This review is going to consider only Act 1 of the game. This does not, however, regard the game's price, as Act 2 isn't included yet, but will be released soon for free.  Many people are complaining about the length of the game compared to its price at the moment, and as such are not recommending the game. I don't think that's fair, because the first half of the game is about four hours and 30 minutes long, so I'm expecting at least 8-9 hours of gameplay once Act 2 is released. (End Disclaimer)  Broken Age is a game with two co-existing stories that are set in   seemingly   seperate worlds. One story follows Vella, a girl from the bakery town of Sugar Bunting who has been selected to be sacrificed to a monster known as Mog Chothra as part of the town's 'maiden feast'- which is apparently a great honor- and ultimately chooses to escape the event in search of a way to kill the beast. The other story centers on Shay, a boy who is alone on a sentient spaceship that takes care of him, and more importantly, keeps him safe. Shay, however, is bored of the childish, mundane routine that the ship puts him through every day to keep him entertained, and discovers that the ship's AI has been lying to him, which sets him on a quest to take control of the ship himself.  Broken Age plays as a point-and-click adventure game; in most situations, you click areas you want to move to or investigate, ask questions from NPCs to figure out what to do or where to go, solve puzzles, collect items, use items to solve more puzzles, and most importantly, discover the world and immerse yourself in the story of the world. The game allows you to transition from Vella's and Shay's stories at any time via. the Inventory Window, so if you get stuck on a puzzle in one world, you can switch to the other for a while so you can continue playing the game without getting super frustrated. There are many ways to use this system to fit your playing preferences; you can switch the stories regularly, you can switch the stories when you get stuck on a character, or you can just play through one character at a time as you wish.  Overall, the game feels pretty good- that is, the game flows for me. If I click an area farther away, the characters will run to the target, whereas if I click an area closer to me, the characters will walk. The camera-work feels right for the most part, however sometimes the inventory will pop up if I move the cursor too close to the bottom left of the screen, especially when a place I want to click is located near that location. Cutscenes are generally done through a close-up view of the characters as they speak, and the animations during the cutscenes are fun and captivating. I'm never terribly confused as to what an item in my inventory does, as clicking on them without dragging them on anything gives me a decent description of the item. Sometimes, dragging certain items towards certain characters results in a fun(ny) interaction between the player character and the respective other characters. Generally, anything that is clickable that is not a walkable path presents useful or amusing information / dialogue about the objects when clicked. NPCs never feel totally boring to listen to, and if you are a faster reader than the voice acting (and happen to have subtitles on), you can skip any cutscenes by hitting space once or twice.   The illustration style is quirky, painterly, and well-done. It's also sometimes surreal, but there's nothing remarkably too creepy or unsettling generally found in surrealist paintings; if that's kind of your thing, you'll probably disagree with me on its surreality. As mentioned early, the characters are animated in a way that is fun and captivating, and it's fun to watch the characters move, even with their idle animations. The visual effects really make everything come together, from background objects rotating to in-game LED screens flashing words, to puffs of clouds kicking up as a chracter walks, they really help background elements feel more real and connected the characters that inhabbit the spaces.  The music is beautiful. (If you grab the soundtrack, I highly suggest listening to Vella and Shay's theme songs all the way through.) Overall, it really makes the atmosphere of the game come alive, especially with the cutscenes with songs that are scored into the game, or the ones that don't feature a lot (or any) interaction with the game itself, which sets up a nice cinematic feeling that, in my opinion, adds to the game rather than take away from it.  Some of the things I noted people complain about are the difficulty of the puzzles and the linearity of choices as you go through the game. While I recognize that the difficulty of the puzzles is low, and generally not super-challenging, I feel that for the sake of being only the first half the game, it definitely is better for those gamers who are not common adventure game players to ease into the logic of the game puzzles. Plus, I thought they were hard enough for most people to not realize immediately how to solve several of the puzzles, especially when the options are not immediately or obvious or sometimes overlooked for feeling they are a tad ridiculous. (In my experience, the more difficult puzzles took me much longer to figure out in comparison to the ones that were intentionally much easier. Additionally, I have to mention that not a lot of people realize the solution to one of the first puzzles in one of the stories until it's almost directly stated in the dialogue.)  In response to the linearity of choices as you go through the game, I feel like if you weren't given some sort of goal to work towards as you get through the game, many of the players would spend a lot of time in the game getting next to nothing done. I don't say this as if a game is meant to be beaten, but for a game heavily focused on the stories of two characters, it's not as if the fate of these characters are ultimately determined by what the player does in the game, but more by the story. To make my point clear; the reason some puzzles are presented to you at certain times if for the sake of story progression. You would be totally stuck if you didn't know what to at times. If the problem is less so linearity due to story progression and more the lack of extra things to do, well.... I don't think you realize this, but even this amount of content was super-expensive to make, and you wouldn't realize this if you hadn't been watching the Double Fine Adventure documentary (or, for that matter, have been interested in the games industry besides as a consumer in the first place).  It's not like I don't have any problems with the game at all; some important objects you need for puzzles blend into the background, or are looked over in the first few times you pass the area they're contained in. Some jokes fall flat, which is fine for the most part I suppose, because otherwise the dialogue is amazing for all reasons. As mentioned earlier, sometimes the camera placement results in clickable locations being located in the bottom-left corner of the screen, so the inventory likes to pop up and you'll wind up clicking an item instead of the intended location.  As mentioned earlier, this review doesn't take into account the amount of time you can play compared to it's price in it's current state. Also as mentioned, the game plays for about four hours and 30 minutes total, with about 2 hours and 15 minutes per character for a more experienced adventure gamer. If the rest of the game was canceled right now, I wouldn't suggest purchasing the game.   (This is less so for the length of the game in it's current state, but the fact that it ends at such a HUGE cliffhanger.)   However, Act 2 is being added for free soon, so I think the money's worth it.  I'm running out of characters; all-in-all, 9.5 / 10 from me, can't wait for Act 2. :)",

So it's been the bones of a year and a half since act one and the fundamentals are still great, the artwork and voice work are still on point, but after all that time I was hoping for more content.  The puzzles are relatively easy, there's a little bit of the 'combine this with that' mechanic, and after the half way mark there is a distinct element of needing to jump between stories to solve puzzles which was nice, but story wise doesn't make much sense, aside from their 'having a connection'. There is also this one puzzle specifically that was just annoying. It's obvious and you will do it a dozen times without it working to the point that it will actually take away from the game, but that's just the type of game it is.  The story promises a lot, and it really seems like it's going to payoff until the end where it just doesn't satisfy.   The game was fine, it entertained but I wanted so much more from the game than it delivered.  So yeah, nothing is broken, it's very pretty, the puzzles are relatively easy (a couple of notable exceptions aside) and the story after starting strong turns out to be nothing to write home about, if you want it wait for a sale.",

It's hilarious, somber, beautiful, always brilliant and never boring. It has characters that feel real and honest despite their children's storybook inspired looks, moments that can gut you with their sudden intensity and dark undertones, and - to be truly blunt - just one helluva finale (I am underselling this. It is... staggering). On the (only) downside: it's puzzles are either eye-rollingly easy or maddeningly vague, but the drive to see what hilarious dialogue tree will emerge from which bizarre character next is the carrot on the end of the stick here. To sum up: giant monsters, overprotective AI, sap-barfing trees, a cult in the sky, and a talking spoon whose one mission is to be stuck in your mouth. You really should just go play it already.",

I haven't play an adventure game in more than a decade, so I came to Broken Age without the nostalgia people have for Monkey Island or Grim Fandango.   But within ten minutes I was in. The art style is gorgeous, the story is compelling, and the twist at the end of Act I was fantastic.   The puzzles in Act II were beyond my frustration tolerance for an enjoyable experience and if it were a different game I would have put it down. But the story and the art style completely got it's hooks into me that I had to finish it, even though it meant leaning on a walkthrough from time to time. It is a great accomplishment for the studio that was further enriched by the documentary.

I do agree that it doesn't quite have the brilliant feel of games such as Grim Fandango, but up until the middle, it holds its own quite well.  Act 1 was quite fun to play through. While the puzzles were easy, I feel that they were more assets to the storytelling rather than a major drawing point, and I loved the twist at the end. Each story was completely independant from the other, so if you really wanted to you could, say, finish Vella's side before even starting Shay's (a feature missing from Act 2). Another point in favor of Act 1 is that it was funny - in the very least enough to provoke a smile.  Ok, despite what I said earlier, Act 2 was a bit hit-and-miss, at least partially because of the episodic nature of the game which ended up breaking the flow of the story. The puzzles - especially the first one of Vella's side - had me clicking back and forth, wishing there was more varied dialouge as the same few lines repeated again and again and again. The story isn't [i ]bad, [/i] per se - it is not as good as Act 1's, but for me the revelation that    the sun was a person    somewhat ruined my enjoyment as it felt almost completely out of the blue and I still don't really understand why    she acted like a computer for however many years of Shay's life, or how she keeps her hair so... poofy. So, so poofy.     My advice would be that if this game is on sale, get it. Play it up to the end of Act 1, and if you play on, close the game and pretend Act 2 wasn't a thing.  If you've already played Act 2, replay Act 1 and pretend Act 2 wasn't a thing. I love this game, honestly, and I'm a massive fan of Double Fine and I mean no offence to them, but can we deny Act 2's existance for the good of everyone who might want to play this game, the devs... and probably ourselves?",

That is actually one of the most frustrating moment for me in gaming. (If not the most!) It ended so awkwardly that you might shout: What the heck just happened!? (If not worst...)  Pros: Awesome Arts, Characters, Conversation and Story (especially in ACT 1 , and these are mostly the things you want in a point and click adventure game in my opinion.) Cons: Lazy implemented puzzle in late game AND Extremely Bad Ending(which is the most important thing in this genre in my opinion)  If you can make up a good ending for youself and ignore what the game showed to you, go ahead and play it.

Puzzles are mid ground, seems like they are warming you in, some easy and it mainly feels they do not want to frustrate the player and just keep things at a steady pace and the enjoyment flowing. (something that has plagued video games for years) Finding a middle ground for people's skills is a hard one, you can appreciate if you are looking to mass market your game then they did this just right. Bottom line - they set out to make a modern take on the adventure genre, they've done that and it works. People got what they paid for with a secound act to come, most adventure games take less time to complete.  Do people feel they deserved more? Apparently so, but games are expensive to make and as the kickstarter money pile grew in number, so in turn did the scope of the game in question. I think it was always made clear this is what we were going to get and I for one am happy. The writing is just fantastic and I would recommend this in a heartbeat, so here I am doing just that.",

I had seen the trailers of course but they just don't do playing this game on a nice big screen any justice. It really goes to show what we lost the moment somewhere in the early 2000s when we had convinced ourselves that 2D graphics were outdated and had to be confined to flash games, low-bugdet indie productions and side-scrollers. I really think the visuals of this game are ground-breaking. Breaking new ground also means that the graphics aren't perfect. You will occasionally still see pixels at certain zoom levels, a problem that just does not exist in this form for 3D games or games that don't zoom.  Music and voice acting are also great. Elijah Wood is not just a big name to sell more copies, he's just genuinely great for the role and incredibly nuanced. It's fun just listening to his voice.  There are a lot of interesting characters and I found the storylines compelling and quite surprising.  The thing that's criticized the most is the linearity and puzzle difficulty. Well, is this game as complex as Day of the Tentacle or does its world feel as grand as that of Monkey Island? No, surely not. If that's what you're looking for then you should at least wait for Act 2 to come out. Act 1 is meant to be a warm-up for Act 2 but we'll of course have to wait and see how this turns out. I can't say any of these criticisms occured to me personally while playing. I had hoped for more character interaction but the two plots are very much separated throughout Act 1. I quickly forgot that while playing though but I do still hope that we will see more DotT style interaction between the main characters in Act 2.  So in summary, if you're after some serious brain teasing, you'll have to find it somewhere else. If you can enjoy a good story, beautifully told in every way and garnished with some puzzles along the way to keep you invested, then this is definitely a game for you.",

It's a shame the game has lost the old school days of Point and Click games where you'd have multiple verb options to try and solve puzzles, opting more for a touch device optimized 'rub this on that' interface but I can't blame them as we live in an age where quicker, easier to solve puzzles to quickly do while on the bus are in demand now.

They are both struggling with their surroundings, trying to step out of the 'fate' that has been woven for them. The end of the episode was an interesting twist that left me wanting for more. I can't wait to see what happens to our protagonists, and what the consequences of their actions will turn out to be.   ",

The game felt really polished and relatively well-designed, with only some minor annoyances.  But the second act completely negated all the good from the first. It felt poorly designed, poorly executed, and like they just rushed it to market rather than properly designing the puzzles or worrying about the story.   Rather than explaining any of the things I was excited to find out, the second half just introduced major plot holes that were then either entirely ignored or quite poorly explained. And, most damning for a game, the gameplay and puzzles were increasingly frustrating, not fun, and arbitrarily difficult to figure out. Random and entirely unconnected things needed to be done in a certain order; there were things I needed to do that the character would in no way have knowledge about; and the puzzles were so poorly explained that I sometimes couldn't even figure out what the problem was that I was trying to solve (meaning that I had no hope of solving it).  The only way I could finish act 2 was by following a detailed walkthrough -- something I usually try to avoid -- and even with the walkthrough to guide me, one of the final puzzles was so poorly designed that it took me over an hour just to figure out how the puzzle even worked. Guessing correctly at the solution didn't ease my frustration since it's a puzzle that needs to be solved in different ways several times.   I would generally recommend the first half, but I would definitively NOT recommend the second half. Stay away! It was not worth the frustration. This game has so much promise -- I really wanted to like it! -- but was too poorly designed and executed to me to recommend it.",

So when I finally got to play through it, I was satisfied, but probably not to the level the game should have reached. So let's clear this out right away, Broken Age is seperated into three acts. The first two acts are full length and take about four hours each to go through on your first run - especially if you're like me and love to interact with absolutely everything. The final act is about half an hour but can take longer if you don't write things down and take pictures.   Broken Age's first act brings forth a large variety of assets both in characters and environments and 85 to 90% of them are reused for the second act. This doesn't matter much now since both acts are fully finished and included, though it could have been disappointing (and probably was) for players who originally purchased this game and waited for the second act to be released about a year later. Here's the thing though, even though a lot of assets are reused for the second act, I consider the second act to be a considerable improvement over the first.   Act one is gorgeous and is full of jaw dropping environments, there's still a number of them in act two but this number drops substancially. However, it's more of an entree to a dinner and dessert effect rather than two equally amazing dishes. It looks amazing, but in some ways lacks the sort of writing that Double Fine games usually pack. The plot's pretty predictable, there's minimal interaction with inventory items among characters, and there are only a few lines for each character interaction. Which is a shame given how (as usual) the characters are unique and organic. Act two's writing is much sharper and manages to make the plot a little less predictable (though sadly the big shocking changes hit hardest at the beginning and fizzle out afterwards) while giving a whole lot more lines to the rest of the cast. On top of that, act two's puzzles are actually puzzling given how embarassingly straightforward act one had been. But they're far from perfect. As I mentioned earlier, without pictures some of the later half's puzzles are just frustrating and time consuming rather than actual puzzles. I can't say why without spoiling, but it's really pesky when one mistake can cost three or four minutes of backtracking and fiddling around.  That said, Broken Age is a wonderful and long adventure game that's a joy from start to... well... the end's a little shaky, so let's say around the end. But despite all of these wonderful things, it's never going to live up to that hype it created and that's something that will follow it around for a number of years. Still, that shouldn't stop you from picking up this game at full price if you enjoy a good adventure or have ten hours or so to kill.",
