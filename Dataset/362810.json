            "review_text": "Fighties appears to be the first game developed by PillowPigGames. What a solid first development.  Let me start by saying the screenshots dont do it justice. The graphics, once in a game, are surprisingly smooth and polished.  Character design is excellent. Each character has wholly unique abilities and play style, which is an achievement rarely reached with such a large cast of characters. This is the major selling point for me. Each character you unlock will have genuinely unique skillsets/stats that will require a completely different strategy in game.  Many recent 2-D platform based competitive arena games dont add many new concepts, this is not the case with fighties. Combat is original and thoughtful, and they have not fallen into the trap of lazilly knocking off the abilities of other characters to complete their lineup.  The price, when compared to similar games, is incredibly generous considering the content. Honestly this game blows away other games with the same price. The price could be doubled, or possibly even trippled and still be reasonable.",

            "review_text": "Its a great fun fighting game to meele with friends.  So, maybe there is no real online gameplay (since no people seem to be online anymore) but local 4 player is great and IMO is better than Towerfall Ascension since there is great variability in the characters  And single player arcade is a challenge, you got easy, normal and hard, the difference? You face more enemies and more bosses (from 1 on easy to 3 on hard) as difficulty increases, also previous bosses HP increase, and let me tell you, both arcade modes (there is two version, each with their own 3 bosses) are HARD, depending on the character you are facing the boss it might be nearly impossible.  The hard boss on arcade 2 is a complete nut buster, The challenge is quite on par with most AAA figthing games and you will need to master all the movements mechanics and skills of your character to succeed.  There is one complain about this game, some characters are clearly stronger and easier to use and others frustratingly hard to use or have a not-so-useful skill. Specially on arcade or survival you will notice how some characters are too frustrating to use compared to others that do insta-kills or have better range.  Overall a great fighting experience with a lot of content",

The game isn't difficult to get a basic understanding of and it's a great game to play with friends I had no issues with the game other than 2 major things. First I had issues with it's netcode the online multiplayer seems to bug out response time with friends. Secondly the game's Bosses tended to feel boring as it was rinse and repeat with the combat. Other than those two factors this game is a solid pick up and easy to fall in love with i'd give this game a 9/10.",

Although:  - You really need to get rid of/nerf the mime guy, he's extremely over powered. - The controls screen got annoying when i edit one control, i have to edit the rest of the controls. Also you can't edit the back button (c). - I don't know how your supposed to figure out the bubble girls ability. - Try to balance out the abilities - Maybe make it so special abilities don't instantly kill a character but take a large amount of health off.  Overall this game has huge potential, you could even add a adventure part of the game (much like Castle Crashers). I can't wait to see what this game got for the future :)",

The game offers quite a variety of characters to play as, each with their own play style 'speed,range,close combat, specials...etc (some are great for arcade mode while others are better for multiplayer).  Most all of the characters can be unlocked in 'the crane game'  (it would be nice to have other ways of obtaining them 'eg. play 25 battles/ or/ beat the game with 3 characters on any mode'  The items in game at the moment feel a bit bland as most of them are basicly buffs rather than items (item wise it boils down to 2 real items a shield and a 1UP. would love to see some work here)  There is a nifty level creator, very simple to use and great for those that love to make their own arenas to challenge their friends in  As 'fisher-price' as it gets in terms of controls  If you enjoy a fun lil brawler with hours and hours of challenging and replayable goodness, add this wonderful game to your collection for $5 ",

There are quite a bit of different characters, and none of the ones I've unlocked so far are copies of another, they're all original. For the most part all the fighters are evenly balanced, with only one or two marginally stronger than another. From what I can tell, the devs of this game are still up-and-at'em, so I'm sure this will get fixed very soon. Whether you're fighting against A.I. to unlock the next character or beating up your friends, you're sure to get enjoyment out of this game. Plus, it's only $4.99!

This game is quiet enjoyable especially with friends with fast and slick controls and fun gameplay. But I have a few problems with the game, first of all the music is quiet terrible, the music sounds like something out of the NES bootlegs you could buy in China, I myself found that the music can be changed by replacing the .ogg files in the files, I changed it to the Scott Pilgrim OST which I think fits more, my second problem is the items, they have your basic buffs such as speed, power, health and debuffs also, but the way they are presented are a little confusing, they have the textures of stuffed animals that change colour, I don't know if the other colour varients have something different about them but I havent been able to figure it out, Its difficult to understand what item does what without playing before such as Giraffe = 1UP? Sometimes I ran into the items getting debufs on my speed making some fights impossible to do (Especially the boss fights) My Final problem was the over balance and under balance of certain characters, some characters feel way too strong such as the Mime character that can spawn a copy of himself that throws cards that insta-kill and this is quiet tricky to counter, and other characters such as the one who can climb walls feels to weak to do anything. I think this game has some good potential and is well worth a look, its a really good game for £3.99 and these where my only concerns that I thought should be addressed.",

            "review_text": "  PS. A friend owned the game so shared library is nice :) The art style of Fighties was great but the game feels really underdeveloped. Playing by yourself is also a major flaw as when you play arcade mode or survival mode you can easily get killed immediately and once you respawn.  Arcade mode is often unfair as from what I mentioned earlier also has you fight two of the CPU at once and they can range from really easy or unfair. The bosses are also difficult as most other characters as you will get killed immediately and results you restarting from the beginning  As for character variety you can only get new ones by beating the bosses in arcade mode which are really underpowered compared to fighting them as a boss and the crane game which is pretty annoying to find  Overall dont play this game if you want to have an easy time playing the game",
