            "review_text": " **Note: I love games like Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Gone Home, if you do not like these games, you will probably not like this one**   The first thing I noticed about the game was how freaking beautiful it is. The last thing I noticed was also how beautiful it is. The game is just a joy to look at the entire time, I wanted to take a screenshot every time I turned a corner (and often times I did) just because of how captivating each bit of environment was in the game. Whether it was the stark blasts of white light leaking through windows or it was the shocking amount of wallpaper peeling off the walls, everything is built with such detail and is the obvious result of a lot of effort from the developer. Environments are spectacular, and so are the bits and bobs of info and story you will find in them. I would go into the story more, but I would rather not spoil it, part of what makes this game worth playing is discovering the story for yourself, so I will let you do that.  But before you do enter the halls of 'Homesick' I must warn you that if you are not a fan of games like 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' or 'Gone Home', this is not for you. Most of the game consists of simple puzzles that are solved with either very logical solutions or kind of out of the blue. But there is one paticular section towards the end of the game where the game gets the balance between mind numbingly simple and oddly aloof right, and it finally feels like you are doing something fantastic that also makes sense.  The game has flaws, specifically the 'game' part of 'Homesick', but it gets so much stuff right. 'Homesick' is a tour through a meticulously built set of rooms that have this oppresive sadness to them but I always had to turn the next corner. Play 'Homesick' if you want to see a game made with a lot of heart and double the talent.",

It's a touching and atmospheric game filled with challenging puzzles and nightmares (it's not a scary game at the least). Barrett and Morgan (the game's developers) have really poured their all into this one, showing us that the industry still has room for games like this, when we all thought they were dead.   Pros/Cons stuff:  Pros: -Challenging puzzles -Super atmospheric, graphics are A++ -Great story line -Great soundtrack  Cons:  -Challenging puzzles with little to no explanation on how to solve  That's literally it on cons.

This is a wonderful example of storytelling without dialogue. I can tell you that you'll get lost in the scenery much too often! I find myself taking screenshots for personal wallpapers.  As for the story, you're wondering around trying to figure out what happened to this institution you've been supposedly staying in. What kind of institution it is, however, is the question. You can get ideas of where you are through pictures you find in cabinets or reading documents. It really is a mystery up until the end, because they give you just enough information to give you ideas, but not enough until the end to know for sure.  The puzzles are quite challenging, but very rewarding. I wouldn't say they're very difficult, but they definitely do make you go 'Aha!' multiple times!  Overall, this game makes you feel good all throughout the experience. It's not very long, but the bitter-sweet story is worth a play or two. I'd say playing through two or three times will give you the full experience due to so much reading material (in which you have to learn how to read in the game, so backtracking is a big part).  I totally recommend this game to any Gone Home fans or fans of similar games. The developers are some of the nicest people I've ever spoken to, and they deserve every penny!",

It puts you in the shoes of a man waking one day in a derelict building after what can only be assumed to have been some kind of destructive event. Explanations are light at first, as you must decypher the code used to read the notes, letters and newspaper clippings found in the area. It's a slow, pensive and (for the most part) peaceful journey to a bitter-sweet ending.",

If you're not a fan of games that involve walking and problem solving, then this game is not for you.   I did get stuck a few times and had to search for help on how to find the answer, but I guess if I had tried slighter harder I may have found them myself.   As you go around the game, you notice that everything is written in a mysterious code, however the tools to figure out the code are found at the end of the game. The game has an amazing story told through this mysterious code and so I would recommend going back over the places you have been if you want to know the story, after you have figured out the tools to decode the messages. The story is heart broken and could easily be seen as evidence as to why we need to act for the future, and not just rely on traditional energy sources like coal and gas.   The game is something that you can play as many times as you want, but you gain no benefit from doing so, as long as you find everything in your first run. However it was amazing and I will definetly play it again at some point.   Would I recommend this? Yes.  Should you buy this? If you like walking, exploration, puzzle games then yes, I would highly recommend it.",

The whole environment will not tell, but really show you the story behind it and also leave some room for own interpretations. And hopefully it also might make you think about stuff around you a little different.   The puzzles are neither too hard nor boring and very, very enjoyable. Even if you can finish it really quick, depending on how good you are with logic puzzles, it is more than worth the price. I have rather spend the amount Homesick asks for a short but enjoyable game than spend my money on a game twice as long I will not enjoy half as much.   If you love puzzle games and want to explore a small but creative and detail rich world and story, please support the devs and buy it, you will not regret it.",

While exploring you will uncover puzzles that are more logical than illogical, areas that have nearly photorealistic lighting and textures, and a story that will touch you. More than the player's story its the smaller stories covered in the game that are touching, and in some cases heartbreaking.   To uncover the full story I would highly suggest solving all the puzzles, and while there isn't much help online this is a good thing. Once I got the back story of the aparment residents it all fell into a place, and it ended up being a touching exploration of lives past.  Homesick is a game that needs to be experienced by gamers who are jaded, like most games that are coming out that get labeled 'walking simulators' because there are things in these games that need to be seen and felt. While we have games that are AAA coming and going there are indie games like this... They spent hours and months working on this title that while short is full of heart and love to a story, to a fully realized world that is self contained, and great message.  I know this is a kind of random review but its difficult to review it without spoiling it.",

You wander from room to room, searching for clues to the mystery of where everyone went, what happened, and who you are. Both the graphics and musical score are stunning and work together to convey the sadness of old, forgotten and abandoned places.  The puzzles required to advance further in the building are well balanced, neither too simple nor too obnoxiously difficult. The pace of the game isn't rushed with combat or platformer-esque puzzles, instead you're free to meander and take in all the ambience (and Homesick has it by the bucket-load).   The biggest drawback in the game would be the length: my playthrough took just over two hours to complete. Also, while the contrasting daytime/nightmare mechanism was well executed, I felt it could have been used to greater effect.   In closing, Homesick was an incredibly enjoyable 2 hour distraction from reality. Lucky Pause did an impeccable job and I look forward to their next title(s).",

Don't get the wrong idea...it's still a great game with an amazing atmosphere. I simply think 10 euros would have been better a price for this game.

However, the game is extremely short, arbitrarily cryptic at some points, and can be painfully tedious and slow. The story and ending leave much to be desired as well.   Feels more like a proof-of-concept more than anything, I would certianly like to see something like this that's more fleshed out and more refined. As it stands I wouldn't really consider it fun game to play.",

The main aspect of the game is the atmosphere and trying to figure out what actually happened rather than just going through the game. At a certain point in the game you will be able to change the signs to letters and be able to go back and read the various notes and books. This is what adds depth to the game.  If you're looking for a puzzle game, this isn't for you. This is a purely atmospheric game with a hidden story. You actually have to care enough to read the notes.  In conclution: If you still want to try it out, wait for a sale. It's not worth the full prize.",
