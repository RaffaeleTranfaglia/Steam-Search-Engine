            "review_text": "So... where to start with this game.  If you don't already know, The Lost City of Malathedra is a point and click adventure game that, personally, reminds me a lot of the old Monkey Island games. It was originally released in 2008, so don't expect particularly fantastic graphics. Considering that, they're ok for the time. Sound effects are nothing to write home about, but they blend well enough with the game. The music? Oh good lord, the music is absolutely brilliant and I wish I could buy an OST for this game.  The story has a lot of potential, but I honestly feel like it could've been expanded upon without making the game drag on too much. I don't want to risk spoiling anything, but there's quite a few area's in the story where a little bit more love would've gone a long way. As for the puzzles, most of them can be done by simply making sure you talk to everyone, check everything and use a little logic. There was only one puzzle that gave me a few problems, so I had to look up a walkthrough to get past it.  My one, major criticism is that I managed to finish the game + prologue in 2 hours. I think that's a little short for the retail price, but if it happens to pop up on offer, I think it's well-worth grabbing! The game should run on pretty much any system from 2007 onwards, which makes it suitable for laptop gamers but I would highly recommend using an external mouse.",
