    "description": "In this chibi-style* strategy role-playing game you'll amass an army of game-referencing allies, fight on trap-laden maps, and beef up Lily Rank for crazy damage. But look out for status ailments or you might be (literal) tofu! You ain't seen the Neptunia characters like this before!",

            "review_text": "I'll start with the cons, as they're pretty short and minor.  Cons: - NO NEPGEAR (Or any of the other CPU Candidates) - 30 FPS Lock (Not that big a deal since it's a strategy game, but still a slight negative for me) - Sound issues; the music does not loop well so it'll just restart abruptly in the middle of basically anything - Due to its chibi-style, in-game graphics are rather weak. Charming, but could've been a lot better. And like all other Neptunia games, assets are recycled hard. - Not sure if it's just me, but for some reason I don't get achievement notifications until I exited out of the game and got a bunch at once. - Slighty annoying controls; they're pretty standard, but some things are just a little annoying and I'll detail them a little more below.  Problems I have with control scheme (using an xbox 360 controller, I don't know about keyboard controls):    During the battle setup, you can only go through enemy units based on a list. Can't freely move around and check stuff yourself.    Buff/debuff information not readily available; need to press B on a character to see it    The left analog stick is used to control the camera (as are the LB and RB buttons for 90 degree intervals), and the right stick is used to control the zoom. This would've been much nicer having LB/RB control zoom, and right stick control camera.    While the game will tell you, this is nice to know earlier: You can slightly affect the path your unit takes by changing its orientation before moving (X on gamepad)   That's all I find wrong with the game.  Pros: + Gameplay is fun (like a weaker fire emblem, sorry that's the only other grid-based strategy game I've played so it's the only comparison I can make). Mechanics are all explained when necessary and are not difficult to understand and remember. + Incentive to buy stuff from the shop with the 'Noire's Room' simulation thing. Since the game is Noire focused, the global 'EVENT!' things from the previous games are all focused around Noire now. + The characters so far are fun and cute. The CPUs have the same personality as their other games so no surprises there. + They have replayable missions with rewards that change from the first time you beat them, giving you a reason to do it again (and a way to grind up any characters who may have lagged behind) + Same charm and humor as the other games.  I would recommend the game. It's a lot better than the other spin off on steam, Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. That said, do remember that this is a strategy game. It may not be to your liking. If that's the case, remember you can refund it within a week if your playtime is under 2 hours.  And since some of you might be confused by the DLC, it's all pretty much just OP items, not necessary at all. The only exceptions are: 'Ultimate Event Full Unlock', which unlocks all gallery items (I'm like 80% sure you can unlock them all in-game anyway, this is just a shortcut), and the four bonus characters: Tiara from Fairy Fencer, IF and Compa from the main games, and Sting, who is just a DLC-original character for this game (I looked it up to verify). I would consider those 4 characters to be the only DLC worth getting, don't bother with any of the gear packs.",

            "review_text": "As much as it pains me, as a Hyperdimension Neptunia fan, owning all the Nep games on steam, the beggining of this game alone made me lose all interest in playing it through. At least I was able to finish Re;Birth 2. The reason for this is a personal preference, at for other people this might be no problem, so unless you share the feeling you might actually like this game.  Basically, it's the 'Player' thing. One thing is having to play as a protagonist character with a defined personality and behavior. You might agree more or less with the character, but it's someone else, in the end. But not in here. Noire is kind of the protagonist, sure, but 'your character' is there. A faceless, voiceless character names 'Player', who is male, and represents you. And whenever he talks it means he's putting words in your mouth. And I don't like the words he puts in my mouth.  The Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise's cast is composed by 99% female characters. Buuuuut you get to be represented as a male one. Why? Obviously for the simDate effect. Forced to have a generic male simDate character as your avatar in the game to appeal to the target audience of the game, I guess.  In my opinion, to make it more like a Neptunia game and not just a Nep-themed simDate, I'd have placed another female character who drops videogame references like everyone else. It'd make one feel more inmersed withing the setting if one's character is simmilar to the rest.  Anyway, as I said first, this is a personal preference, and other players might not be bothered at all by this, but it does bother me a lot. I guess this will be the only Nep game I won't finish.",

            "review_text": "Advance Wars is a good strategy game because there's a wide assortment of units with unique relationships that interact like a massive game of rock, paper, scissors.   This is not a good turn based strategy game because the differences in your units are superficial, the differences in your enemiy units are nearly nonexistant, and when they are unique it's impossible to predict what color magic I'm supposed to tickle them with, let alone remember which character has the right magic for tickling.  Copy paste maps, pointless chests, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t match timers don't do this game any favors either. Another spinoff that pales in comparison to the exquisite quality of the original series, this time with a bunch of side characters that will never be reused.",
