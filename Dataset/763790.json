    "description": "TrainerVR is a unique physics-based VR train construction game. In TrainerVR you can create from simple tracks to an elaborate rail network, just like the wooden piece game, but to the infinity and beyond. If you liked building with your own bare hands, youâ€™ll feel the same in our limitless VR world.",
