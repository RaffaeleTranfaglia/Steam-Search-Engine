            "review_text": "Ah the X Series. I haven't heard anything good about rebirth the latest installment to the series but this review isnt about that. X3: Reunion Was the game that turned me on to the whole series. In fact just thinking about it now is making me want to sink even more hours into a title i have already sank more than what would commonly be called healthy gaming. Once you get past the steep learning curve and learn how to fly and fight and trade effectively, this game suddenly turns into how you would want to live in a future that affords you your own space oddesy. Space suddenly turns into your own playground and you become immersed in a universe that is fully dynamic.   With that said i think this title, X3 Terran conflict and X3 Albion Prelude were accidental. Terran conflict takes place after the events of this title, and adds a Major graphics overhaul. And prelude again expands on the story of Terran conflict as well as this title adding features and interfaces that were touched on in this title but done poorly. It is pretty evident the beauty of this game and the other X3 titles is the immersion of the struggle you are put through to learn, and adapt to the changes that happen around you all while getting the sense of achievement from overcoming and growing from the experiences you encounter.   What these games lack is a sense of person however. You sort of create a character or take on a storyline however you rarely interact as that character. You never really see the character and the universe usually refers to you as pilot. In Reunion, the main story you play as julian brennan. working along side Elena Kho. Trying to find your place in the universe. There is an extensive storyline and it all seems to fit very well all things considered. The other characters however offer a backstory as to why you start out where you do, and how the other races react to you in the beginning. Ultimately it defines how difficult the game is in the beginning to get started. Once you get on a roll however and you grow all plots start and play out no matter who you play as with the exception of Julian's plot. his has a little more frosting so to speak. Otherwise its all essentially the same. Reunion is also of the three X3 games that has a main character. Terran Conflict and Prelude do not feature main plot character who playing as change the dialogue or offer any additional content.   Pros: Dynamic Universe - Everything you do or not do effects the universe in some way. Rich plots - The back story to each of the plots are very compelling and their rewards give a strong sense of achievement Diverse spacecraft - Each ship has its own classification as well as strength and weaknesses. Even some that are unique and rare.  Races - Each race is unique in its own way and their ships fit the typical role the races engage in. Fleets - You can build, or buy your own fleet and wage war against anything within the universe, ofcourse doing so will have consquences such as you may end up destroying something you want later. The good news is there is one race you can attack and murder with extreme prejudice and not have to worry about losing a future trading station.   Cons: Voice acting - Its there but at the time this game was released other studios did it better.  Races - While each race is unique there is nothing unique among their individuals. Humans however occasionally have diversity among males and females but you will be hard pressed telling a male or female split, paranid or teladi.  No planetary exploration. The planets in each system are just there to look pretty it seems.  No station exploration. Each station you only dock at and interact with through the ship.   From what i understand Rebirth attempted at affording planetary and staion exploration however at the cost of starship diversity. Further more these features were not done well and as such losing the ability to fly and construct a diverse fleet was too great of a sacrifice against bland cookie cutter stations.",

            "review_text": "Ok, first off, I have never played any of the X series until now. X3: Reunion is amazing beyond beleif. Yes, the learning curve might be too difficult for some, but for others, this is amazing. The open world universe is amazing, AND it runs 40-70 fps on my NETBOOK. My INTEGRATED CELERON GRAPHICS NETBOOK! But, this game NEEDS a tutorial! And a quicksave feature. I would recommend this to all my friends, and I recommend it to all of you! Here is a pro/ con list: Pros:  +Amazing open world +Combat is great +Story line, while predicatable, is actually decent +Good trading system  Cons: -No tutorial -NO AUTOPAUSE WHEN PRESSING ESC!!! -NO WORKSHOPE SUPPORT. With this, people could create their own GALAXIES, and upload them for other people to play!!!  All in all, GET IT NOW!",

            "review_text": "This game is what it promises - a Sandbox. you can do many things here, be a trader, a hired gun, a pirate hunter or hero of the universe. you can build stations, manufacturing complexes, wage war with the empires, and with help of the mod even take them over completely. you can own sectors and much more. If you want freedom and reactive economy - this is a game for you.  It has its downsides as well however. For one, be prepared to sink in a lot of time into it. and i mean 100+ hours. the game moves slow, and if you pick a regular start youll spend your first couple real life days scrapping the bottom for cash. The unbalanced missions and bad UI does not help much here, however once you start to get bigger, have regional traders hired, start building stations you can devote yourself to more fun stuff - exterminating enemy systems.  Overall the game is pretty good, but it is by far not perfect. if you want to have basically same game, but more refined, your better off playing X3: Terran Conflict",

It makes the game almost unplayable. There is no quest log, instead you have to dig down inside the messages to find out what you are supposed to do. Of course, with no tutorial or manual, you have no idea what the keys are so that takes time. Pretty much the whole game is like that. Very disappointing. I'm a huge fan of freelancer and all the X games feel like they could be a sequel, but right now I just can't recommend.",

You can fly ships, trade, raid solar systems, shoot, capture other ships, use frigates, freight transporters, capital ships, do missions. Keep in mind that this is certainly a quick-save game which doesn't have quick-save functionality. There is a slight chance you will crash trying to dock (using auto-pilot), there is a chance you will crash into a M2-class ship coming out of warp gate. There is a chance you will turn into flying wreckage by trying to claim other ship. Those bugs make it extremely autistic, cryptic and annoying (at times) but still fun and very addictive. Number of possibilities, ways to earn credits, recognition and ships is just beyond my comprehension. This game takes about 5 hours to get the basics and I'm not even joking.",

But the gameplay set up is so counter intuitive and less than he as escorting have to go throught the warp gate BEFORE me otherwise they get left in the old system and won't follow.  Its a shame, I see how this could be great, but you spend more time ALT+TABBING to figure out controls than actually playing.  If you do get it; default command 'J' is a huge time saver, it basically speeds up time so that when you have to travel across the star system it only takes 2 min, instead of 10 min (I wish I was kidding.) But there is no overdrive or afterburner (to start at least.)",

Be a beef merchant, the galaxy needs more beef, or a miner, or build a factory. Factory! Factory!! Factory!!! Factory!!!! Fight alien invaders and terraforming robots gone awry. Start your own faction and commit horrible acts of genocide or wage legitimate war on board your capital ship. Anything and everything is possible in the X3, which provides beautiful scenes, a tremendous universe to play in, and over a hundred (probably) fully customizable ships to pilot. You may want a joystick, which is something I haven't said in at least 5 years.  Play this game while eating kielbasa for the optimal effect.",

            "review_text": "Clocking about 7 hours of play time yesterday starting from scratch I found X3: Reunion to have quite a steep learning curve. I had chosen the Normal/storyline-on difficulty.   Maybe I'm getting too old (42!) to remember countless hours in my youth trying to figure out how to handle misjumps in 'Elite', battles in 'Wing Commander: Privateer' and similar games 'Frontier' etc. but I had expected it to be a piece of cake to swoop in and save the day in this one...  Man was I wrong!  This game puts you in battle from minute 1! I was still trying to figure out the viewscreen, icons, menus... let alone how to throttle up/down when the bogies came at me. Concentrating at battle at hand everything less important had to wait (unimportant like: do I have different types of guns on this boat, how do I target enemies, fire missiles...).   Finally came the part where I took control of turret guns and I could 'relax' a little and let the action just happen.  It was not until the 'track the Marauder' mission that I got some spare time to investigate the menus and found information about the ship, keybindings for this and that. I had to visit a few game wikis to figure out why I could not repair the hull of my ship... I simply did not understand the pricetag was too high for my wallets contents. On my to do list is still to read the manual - this is very unlike the trend in modern games where you learn throughthe first couple of missions.    Why am I even playing this game? The answer is simple: pure nostalgia! The games from my youth mentioned earlier had me spellbound then. Around the end of last millenium a demo for 'X: beyond the frontier' came out with references to the same games I loved. I think it was only one ot two short storydriven missions... but the trading system was also revealed and I was hooked.  The best thing, as I remember that demo, was a lot of speach. And it was in german! Now, my german was nowhere near fluent but I could understand quite a lot. And what I did not understand only build up the sense of mystery and being in an alien world. It was perfect! So of couse I bought the game when it came out... and played quite a bit before I realised that some of the spell of the demo had vanished. And in that realisation it came to me that I had been playing the game in english... I was missing the mystery of a german speeking world. Now I may remember wrong, but the game disk did not include german language files so it was not until much later that I found that it could be downloaded through some patches... tried it, but by then I was way too deep into the game to make the switch permanent... the spell had gone.  When I started playing X3 this all came back to me when I was examined the different goods to trade. The voice said 'Teladianium' and I was back in the german world. Something about this word has so much of the german language in it.  Enough flashbacking!  The future: I expect to spend yet countless hours in the X3 universe, with both 'Albion Prelude' and 'Terran Conlict' in my steam library I predict I will not run out of missions in a while. The though of building a trading empire, setting up my own Ore mines, programming flight patterns... everything that was not possible in the first game 'X: beyond the frontier'... I wanna do!  I recommend this game to anyone with a passion for space opera storylines, open sandbox worlds, and vast options for customising your role. Of course based on only 7 hours of play time :-)",
