But you can't either be in the cockpit and look around or control the ship using regular control. It's just a crappy minigame that will make your neck hurt.",

            "review_text": "Not sure why so many negative reviews. This game is an absolute BLAST to play on the Oculus Rift. Just make sure you put the sensitivity settings all the way to max so you can easily steer your ship with a slight nod or tilt of your head. Not doing so will make the ship too hard to control. Once you nail the controls down the game an INCREDIBLE feeling of speed and immersion never before seen in other games. I feel it is absolutely worth the asking price.",
