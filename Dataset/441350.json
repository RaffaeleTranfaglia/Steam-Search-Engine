            "review_text": "This is a great reboot of a classic game. it's a bit easier than the classic game, which i'm really greatful for as the old game was damn near impossible when I was younger and is still 'nintendo hard' to this day, but you can later unlock 'classic mode' complete with classic music and sound effects that actually mimics the classic game quite well. so it cartors to both new player and fans of the classic game as well! It's a fairly short game but there are plenty of unlocks to crack open for those completionists out there, so it makes for decent replayability.  I definitely recommend this to fans of challenging 2D platform shooters and fans of the original game itself. It definitely lives up to the classic game and doesn't disapoint.",
