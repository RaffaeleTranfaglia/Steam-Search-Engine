            "review_text": "When I saw a different art style, a different tone, and heard different voice styles I was not bothered. What they did with these changes is what let me down. When I played through the past three games, they each had a flowing and organic theme to them. One that kids could relate to and it felt like an experience and achievement. There was great care taken into the details, voice work, the style. Even the musical placement. I did not, however, get the same feeling from this game. It felt like a game that was constructed by a paint by numbers manual. A song goes here, a puzzle goes there, hey this voice is silly- throw it here. I'm not angry...Just very disappointed. I looked forward to playing another sequel of the little boy named Pajama Sam. The one who 'Always helps those in need'. Their heart wasn't in the creation of this game, and mine wasn't in it when I tried to play it.",

Let me tell you, I should have read the reviews. This game is ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. I thought the re-dub of Spy Fox in Dry Cereal was terrible. Not only is this the worst voice acted HE game I've ever played (And I played them all, sans this one), its also the worst designed. The world is absolute rubbish, and not just because it happens in the land of garbage. After coming from the food world of Pajama Sam 3: You are what you eat from your head to your feet, which was brilliantly made, this feels like it should have been the prototype before the first Putt Putt and Fatty Bear games. I now know why I missed this game as a child, it should have never existed.",

            "review_text": "Game was dull, compared to the others,  Wasn't very good, voice for sam changed to a higher female like pitch (the hell?) Animation was a bit buggy and jumpy, and the intro takes a bit too long than it should for these games. Gameplay wise, well some of the puzzles weren't very clear of how to solve them and lots of back tracking compared to the other games of the series, let alone H.E. games themselves.  I bought this game with the H.E. complete pack so saving $70 was still worth it as the other games are still fun, but if plan to buy this individually, don't.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.",

I always liked Pajama Sam and his adventures but this game feels blend and unfinished. The voice acting isn't all that great. I heard that they changed the voice actor of Pajama Sam but that doesn't really matter to me because i played the previous ones in Dutch language.  I have to mention the music which is really catchy and good.  I really enjoyed the music in this game and some of the characters. All in all this game isn't as good as it's predecessors but it isn't a bad game either. At some times it feels unfinished and sloppy but i like the references to the other games in the series.",
