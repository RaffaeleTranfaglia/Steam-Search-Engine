You play as a toy car that travels through different rooms, each barred by a locked door. Interacting with different object and creatures inhabiting the rooms is the only way to progress. Some of the puzzles can be tricky, and the game is short, but seeing every bizarre room is worth your time.

Each level centres around finding a small box, using it to open a door, and getting your little toy train character through the door. Playing levels mainly goes like this: 'Ah what a pretty place! Let me just poke some things and see what they do.' 'Heehee that's adorable. &lt;3' 'Okay let's do the puzzle.' 'I don't understand the puzzle!' 'Ah okay that's how you do it. Let's poke some more things!' 'I've poked everything there is to poke. Onwards!'  If you like colourful, fairly simplistic puzzles and enjoy playing with your environment, then you might like this game. It really benefits from not being too fussed about finishing the level in record time or whatever, but being more interested in looking around and enjoying yourself, while incidentally progressing from level to level.",
