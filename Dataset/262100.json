            "review_text": "If you were a fan of King Arthur’s Gold then I have some delightful news to share with you – if you weren’t already aware. Transhuman Design are back with their second Steam game. This time the indie geniuses have put their mind to a multiplayer intended action game that features a sweet singleplayer mode for those who can’t get into a multiplayer game. To date Steamified have featured several multiplayer (including local multiplayer only) games that have been pretty much presumed dead on arrival for a lack of a competent singleplayer mode. I’d like those developers to cast a watchful eye over this game and study it. You can create a game that is fully intended to be played as a multiplayer game – which I believe Trench Run is – and have a successful and well implemented singleplayer mode. It may not save your game entirely but it will give those who gave you their hard earned cash the ability to play your game and not immediately utilize Steam’s refund system.  The fact of the matter is that I have yet to get into a local or online multiplayer game of Trench Run. This could have annoyed the hell out of me. I could have screamed blue murder at the developer but they implemented one hell of a singleplayer mode that makes me think that the game is a worthy purchase even if you never end up playing the fully realized multiplayer game. Yes, I’d love to get a game but I haven’t had any luck yet. That’s okay because I play on the Australian servers and usually at weird times. I’m certain that I will get into a game at some point. I can try to play on other servers but as is generally the case with region specific servers I fear that the lag would make the game unplayable for me and that I would be at such a disadvantage as to not make the game a particularly enjoyable experience. This is not on the hands of the developers but a simple reality given the quality of Australia’s Internet and the distance data must travel.  The lobby is one of the best for any online game I have ever seen. I love the fact that there is quite a bit to do in this mode while you wait for other players to come on board unless you want to get straight to the action and play the single player mode which is, I believe, the same as games with real players but where you play against bots so that you can get into games quicker. The bots aren’t just a pathetic challenge either as their AI has been programmed very well. Other players, who I hope to play with at some point, have argued that their AI is much better than a lot of the players that they’ve had actual matches with so I have to give kudos to the devs on a job well done.  The pixel graphics are fantastic but that was one of the trademarks of King Arthur’s Gold so it is a continuation of what we have come to expect from the devs. I love the choice of music as it really meshes with the gameplay that I have experienced thus far and it makes for a fantastic touch to the lobby.  Just as I was about to quit my session another player came on and we were able to have a game with bots. Thanks to ‘Iron Raccoon’. The game was fun and very similar to the normal bot games but Iron Racoon ended up winning the game and doing very well.  Unfortunately the game currently lacks achievements and trading cards so I hope that they are added in the future.",

            "review_text": "I really want to like this game. Its visuals have a charme that is appealing to me, but:  (at first, but this is a one time negative: Fullscreen does not run with Windows 10 without deactivating 'High DPI Mode'. Once you fixed that, it's fine.)  - The game's menu is not controllable without a keyboard: Want to play in your livingroom? Always have to connect your keyboard - Controllers are buggy. We always had one controller controling two players at the same time. Making this not playable with 4 players. - The game's controlscheme consists of 2 buttons + a joystick. While this is not necessarily bad, I feel that lots of opportunities are missed here. - 0 configuration offered: Always play until 8 points. That's it. We couldn't even disable bots.  Sorry. I loved King Arthur's Gold and even though I knew this would be simpler, it did not deserve the blind trust I had in the studio.",

            "review_text": "The developers sent me an E-Mail about this game (since I bought KAG) I expected this to be similar to KAG, but it's very much just a party game, with none of the depth of KAG. It's actually very shallow, and no one seems to play it online. And I honestly feel a bit cheated heh! But I don't mind giving these guys my money, seeing as how they brought me so much joy with KAG. I will however give this a negative review as I didn't find this game very fun at all.",

            "review_text": "A truly enjoyable game, this. It's actually really quite fun sometimes, with the 'no death' rule, because you still get affected by others' attacks in (rather unpredictable) ways, and of course you only need one medkit to get back up and fighting. This can lead to situations such as getting hit by a grenade whilst 'downed' that sends you flying off of one side of the map only to appear on the other side (another nice feature) and land on a health crate, conveniently right in range of an enemy. You of course kill said enemy, leading to plenty of laughs from the both of you! Of course, this works so much better when you're playing with friends, but since the community is small right now (few days after launch), you can make friends easily.  Of course there's also the little mentioned feature of getting absoultely WASTED - in game. Get drunk as all hell and then try shooting straight you damn sniper, you, I'll bet you can't fricken do it twice! You might not have much luck with your demolitions missiles, either...  Honestly, my only 'issue' is the lack of appeal to the Medic class in Run games. In case you're unaware, Trench Run has the 'Skirmish' mode, and the 'Run' mode. Skirmish is a 4 player gamemode where you simply shoot the hell out of each other in small, screen-sized maps, it's essentially just a 1v1v1v1 deathmatch, and any class except Medic is available to use. Run, however, is a 10 player gamemode with larger maps, and it's based on cooperation. It's a 5v5 where you either wipe out the other team, or you reach their 'spawn' side before they reach yours. The Medic is available here but there's not much appeal to it. Your primary action is blocking with a shield, and your secondary is throwing out ammo to allies, and you passively heal downed allies. Not much fun if you want to blow people up.",

            "review_text": "I was a big fan of King Arthur's Gold, which is what brought me to this game. Overall I feel this game is pretty disappointing. The core game itself is pretty shallow. There are two game modes. One is FFA, and one is Team Battle mode. The games last on average between 2-5 minutes. This game is very fast-paced. You will spend an equal time waiting between matches as you will playing them.  The game tries to redeem itself with a lobby area. Here you can buy things with coins (earned from winning games) such as beer, wine, clothes, pets. This part of the game feels pretty tacked on, and is unrelated to the main part of the game. There are not very many people online right now, and filling up games is very difficult. The game seems to be using the exact same engine as KAG, which makes the experience feel more like a cheap reskin than a full new game.  I felt the core game to be pretty uninteresting, and you can see the majority of gameplay in about 20 minutes. This game definitely feels like an Early Access game, and I was suprised it wasn't one. I hope the developers can turn it around, because at the moment I feel that purchasing this game is not worth the price.",

            "review_text": "Pros/Cons list here: Pros: -Good server joining along with stable servers. -Fun and chaotic gameplay with a lean towards casual gaming but can be taken seriously. -Friendly community and devs. -Bots can take the place of people that aren't there so you don't need full games to have fun. -Great for couch parties due to its fun and chaotic gameplay. Cons: -Needs more than the current 2 gamemodes(4 player Free For All, and a RUN gamemode where 2 platoons of 5 unique classes try to get to the other side of the map or kill the other team) -low player count, but I think that will be fixed as this game gains popularity. -It's been quite a while since I bought this and very little progress has been made, the game still feels unfinished with shallow gameplay. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Overall, I wouldn't recommend it in its current state",
