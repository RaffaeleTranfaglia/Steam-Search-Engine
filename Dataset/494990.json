            "review_text": "I may be 'too angry to space'...but I'm also too overjoyed at the enjoyment I'm having with this game to give it a less-than-stellar review! One of my favorite platformers already...even after a bit over an hour of playtime. The trailer alludes to the fun you can have, and even where it mentions how you can use one hand to play, and one to enjoy a beverage of choice...lol. So far I think it good advice to shoot first when coming into a level or a new entrance to a different part of a level...it sure can't hurt...and it's proven in a short time that it's a lot of fun to play...even if there's a rage-quit or two...and already I can tell that there's replay value as well. There is the homage to games of old...both with graphics/gameplay and some difficulty-spikes here and there, but I'm sure enjoying this game in the here and now. Very happy with the decision to buy this game!! Easily recommend, especially if the trailer looks good to you.",
