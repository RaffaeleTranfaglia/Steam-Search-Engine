            "review_text": "Foul Play.  Let me tell you here and now, there's nothing foul about this title. In fact, it strenghtens my love for indie developers more than big publishers, developers, whatever. Devolver does it again. After Shadow Warrior being recommended by quite a few people and Serious Sam 3, which despite its flaws did provide me with quite some good entertainment, I got my hands on Foul Play.  What I love about indie games is the fact that from time to time you get a game that may look like something familiar but then it throws a twist and after just a few minutes of game time you realize that there's nothing quite like it. On with the first impression shall we?  Gameplay wise, despite it obviously being built with a controller in mind, keyboard works quite well. The controls are responsive and you really don't feel at a loss. That being said I don't doubt it's better with a controller.  The game is presented as a standard side-scrolling brawler with combos, unlockables, skills, perks in the form of charms and so on. Nothing special about that you would think but you would be wrong.  The art style is what sets it apart from any other game out there. The whole story unravels on stage. And no, I'm not kidding. You and your partner, the game featuring 2 player coop, are actors reenacting a story from a journal that you get to unlock page by page as the story progresses. As such, you always see the spectators, sometimes with a special request, the background scenery being changed and from time to time you catch the actors off-guard or even the janitor at his best.  The point of each performance is to get the highest score by getting big combos, doing the above-mentioned special requests and of course by not getting hit. What's more interesting is the fact that you can't die. All you have to worry about is the quality of your performance, trying to fill the always present meter and amaze the crowd allowing you to do even more impressive stunts as a reward. I hate to finish in a negative manner but I do have some cons to point out. First off, the graphics settings are not there. That I didn't find too bad but, the game doesn't feature 16:10 resolutions. The second and last con would be the fact that the game being created with a controller in mind, all the instructions for let's say combos and controls are only pointed out for the controller even if you are using a keyboard. It's not big of a deal since the game uses 10-12 keys including WASD but a con is a con.  At the end of this, the verdict would be a 9/10 the above mentioned not being able to affect my experience with the game so far in a such a manner that it fails to provide what you would expect from it. My advice? If you're into old-school sidescrolling brawlers bought into the 21st century this is a must. You could do far worse with 14.99,you could get Call of Duty: Ghosts...",

We played it for 40 min or so and we had to go to sleep.  We never played again until this day, but we never stopped making jokes related to the game and we never forgot about this awesome game. This game poped up to our minds every now and then but we didn't continue to play it, we just played it again after 2 whole YEARS not playing it, not only we remembered the story line, we had fun. We will never forget this game, it changed our lives.  So you ask me if I recommend this game, I do, I do.  Thank you developers, thank you...",

''Life is a theatre'' should be one of this game's catchphrases - that's the twist that really wins it for me.  If you don't have the right computer to play it on, there is no worry! The game is also available on the X360 marketplace, which is the reason the game has XBOX controller support. The first time I played this game, I realised I did not have an XBOX controller reciever - but then I realized you can keybind your keyboard to play! Overall I love this game and recommend it TO ANYONE. 10.1/10  No exclamation marks were harmed in the making of this post.  ",

They tend to be repetitive and quickly boring, but Foul Play builds on the genre and manages to avoid most of the things the annoy me with other titles. It's theatrical structure is a perfect options that allows for a lot of different monsters, settings and situations. The writing is full of humour and wits. The game avoids the too obvious 'save the princess' goal, which is a very good point.  The other thing I like about that theatrical structure is that it allows for a choice of gaming length depending on the time you have. Only a few minutes to play? Play an act and move on to other things. Wanna go for longer sessions? Do a full play in one run and you're good to go.  Overall a nice game, great universe and graphic style, good gameplay with some twists in the genre. Clearly worth its price anytime, an absolute best buy when on sale. Go get it!",

It's very hard to fail a level because there are no health bars per se. The move list is not as extensive as in other games, the focus of Foul Play however is not to dispatch enemies as fast as possible but to keep your combo going. The rather limited moves you have serve that purpose well.  Two other minor annoyances for me were the menu structure (if you unlocked a new move during online play, you would have to go back all the way to the main menu - thus terminating your online game - to check what exactly you unlocked) and the fact that the game assumes you have a 360 gamepad. You can use your keyboard for it and it playes well with it, but all the tooltips etc. will only show the corresponding 360 pad key, not your keyboard key. Also you can not bind attacks to your mouse, so you ca not play WASD to move + mouse to attack like you can in many other games.  If you can look besides those things, you will find Foul Play to be a very fun co-op experience.",

            "review_text": "So after checking the game and playing it completely,I think I can give a fair review of this game. First of all, what you should expect when you play Foul Play:  You should like beat-em-ups with 2d sprites and all the cons that come with it (bad lineup,more 'That should have hit'-moments). You should like the general idea of a game having a theatre-like feeling. However, you should not expect a hard game when playing. Elaboration on why later on.  Story: You control Sebastian Dashforth,who combined with his assistant Scampwick Steerpipe is presenting his life as a daemonologist on stage, re-enacting the main events of Dashforth's last 20 years. Not fearing to go into hand-on-hand combat he and Scampwick are fighting themselves through an lost city of egypt, cursed villages, underwater cities and a london in control of a cult.Fairly generous with the humor and honest (though you may not thank him for it) he will keep you interested to keep playing for a while.  Gameplay: You got six buttons that are important for playing, a weak,but fast attack,a stronger, slower attack which can bring enemies into the air or down from it, a jump, a button for improved abilities (which you learn at a higher level),a Showstopper ability granting you double the combo and double the audience approval when you activate it for a certain amount of time, a dodge and a block. The block is the most important of them,since you automatically counter blocked attacks from weaker enemies, letting you combo into them and from them. The enemies attacks have a clear indicator and you have a longer time to block or dodge an attack. You can play with someone else in Co-op and the only downside is that you have a combined health bar but seperated combo meters. You even get some upsides like a combo bonus if you activate showstopper at the same time. Enemies differ from higher health and exclusive gimmicks, like binding you if they hit on mummys.At the end of a level,you can get a charm if you did the challenges and a diary page if you collected enough stars.  Additional Pros: -Replay value to 100% the game and to experiment on different gamestyles -Unique Storyconcept and interesting Characters -Soundtrack available with the game for no additional cost -Attention to detail  Additional Cons: -Low Playtime(any% about 3 hours, 100% 14 hours) -Bugs like enemies thrown up into the air won't come down that easily at some points -No Wiki -No active lobby community,so no random multiplayer   All in all it is worth playing, and if you are a fan of unique concepts,than this game should be yours!",

            "review_text": "Buy? Maybe.  -=TL;DR=- Foul Play is a very simple side-scrolling beat 'em up that plays much like Castle Crashers, in the vein of a stage play as acted by the players. Gameplay is focused on performing well by maintaining combos, avoiding hits and completing level based challenges, instead of survival and managing lives/continues/respawns. It's a clever take on the genre that makes for a somewhat interesting experience, but in spite of the description's 'rewards performance over pummeling' the gameplay does get fairly repetitive and it's easy to loose interest after a few levels.  -=Presentation=- Foul Play is easily comparable to Castle Crashers due to it's art style and simplistic combat - it looks and almost plays quite like a Flash game even though the game doesn't seem to be in Flash. Animation is fluid like Castle Crashers, but certainly won't win any awards. The old British comedy will probably put off some players, not because it's bad, but it's a style of comedy that won't make alot of people laugh. I never felt that any of the jokes were bad or purile, nor did it put me off at all, but I didn't laugh. The game is cartoonish, attacks have that 'PISH! POW' as expected and enemies eyes turn into 'X's' when they 'die' (in which humorously, the enemy actors will be pulled off screen or sneak off screen'. Backgrounds gradually fall in the back, as if the props were being managed by an amateur. The director is often seen in the background even on the scene itself, as if he not aware how fast the play is moving. They're all nice touches. The soundtrack fits the theme very well and I do like the menu music, though it's nothing spectacular, it's just good and fits the game well. The game plays at 60FPS, though, doesn't reach my 2560x1080 resolution  -=Gameplay=- The way to win is the complete the level without dropping the 'Mood-o'meter' low, which is the visual metric of how well you are performing. You maintain and grow this meter by performing big combos, maintaining those combos, reversing attacks, avoid being hit and activating a 'special' that doubles your combo count output. The gameplay is very forgiving: Combos allow a good 2-3 seconds after you last hit for you to continue hitting enemies (making managing the screenspace key), reversable attacks have a near infinite window for you to counter them and if you can't block it, you can easily dodge a good bit out of the way. Staying alive is extra easy and I'm honestly not sure you can die unless you simply don't perform well enough for the meter - you can usually spam a few attacks here and there to keep yourself in the game. There is still a challenge of keeping your combo going, as you can lose it from being hit or not keeping enemies near you to attack, and the game offer various combo, attack and time challenges. This style of gameplay makes the game potentially more valuable for the completionist.  Combat does get a little boring fairly soon. While Foul Play gives the player new moves at a very reasonable pace, it's generally most effective to mash the attack button and/or spam reversals, as enemies constantly attack. There are moments where it's definitely handy to dodge whether to avoid damage or make it to an enemy fast enough to keep a combo going. Some moves are fun, like the Stunning Piledriver or multi-hit air attack, but the gameplay is very repetitive as you constantly slap enemies with your cane and throw them around with the same two slam attacks. There's a second uppercut style attack, but there is really no reason to use it as air combos aren't awarded more than normal combos and doing so can knock enemies out of your range, causing you to lose a combo.  The game offers Local and Online co-op, though, finding a game seems impossible - I've only seen 0 games in the server browser and that was even when I played the game shortly after it came out. You will likely have to find somebody in the community hub or elsewhere to play with.   -=Conclusion=- Foul Play offers a unique and lightly fun experience, allowing players to challenge themselves by completing goals, versus beating up and staying alive. The combat becomes dull fairly quickly and after a while, I became disinterested in finishing the game, even though I was halfway finish and trying judiciously to get this off my backlog. For most players, the $15 price point may be a bit too high for the repetitive gameplay, lack of online players, and potentially non-entertaining comedy. The price seems fair for somebody who would really enjoy this game and expect to beat all the challenges, as that is the arguably the best part of this game - seeing if you can complete them on a game that is very easy, though providing some challenges that might feel just slightly out of reach. This surely isn't a must-buy and you would be missing out on the performance based gameplay, though it's nothing revolutionary. However, the game is certainly not bad and there are many worse games you could buy, but you may feel the lack of value shortly after playing.",

            "review_text": "Foul play is a wonderful game following the adventures of Daemon hunter Baron Dashforth, and his assistant, Scampwick.  It plays a lot lot like Castle Crashers, but mixes it up, and instead of health, you have a mechanic called the mood meter, the more you score hits and combos, the higher it rises, the more of a chance of survival you have. The graphics are more smooth than Castle Crashers, but still retains the same charm, with all the characters and enemies big enough so that you can see them, but that also sometimes makes it hard to know if you are in the same layer as the enemy. The bosses are both challenging and rewarding, each with their own special attacks. The story is very well thought out, with Scarmpwick acting as a great source of comic relief. The presentation of the game is wonderful, I couldn't find one glitch or error with the game. The music fits well, and perfectly suits the seriousness of some situations.

            "review_text": "Updated review: I'm a little further into Foul Play with two acts under my belt, but I'm loving it.  The first thing I thought upon playing was that Double Dragon, Final Fight, and the Batman: Arkham series had an awesome little spunky lovechild. It's a side-scrolling beat 'em up with cute graphics, a funny plot, and simple-yet-pleasing mechanics.  You play an intrepid British adventurer and demon hunter and his scamp of a sidekick. Gameplay focuses on parrying enemy attacks, situational awareness, and making magnificient combos. As you advance through the retelling of Baron Dashforth's exploits, trials, and tribulations the scenery morphs at lightning speed to set each scene - the game is a play upon an everchanging stage. The graphical style is reminiscient of Castle Crashers with a dash of Alien Hominid thrown towards enemy designs.  Developed and published by Devolver Games, the same studio that published Hotline Miami, Foul Play brings more addicting albeit different strategic violence into the fold with a more chipper and humorous take on plot and design.  The only downside comes from the combat mechanics getting a little bit stale - it is a beat 'em up, after all. However, some of the repetitiveness is alleviated by the introduction of new combo moves and charms as you progress further into the game and complete various performance goals for each act. Charms unlock abilities such as combo multipliers, lengtheners, and more exotic buffs and aids.  I'd recommend this game with two tips for enjoyment: 1.) Play with a friend - it makes it much more fun. 2.) Play in half-hour to hour stretches - avoid burning out on the mechanics",

The tediousness comes in when you're getting a combo and an enemy randomly moves a pixel too far, and the combo drops from about 1 second of inactivity. Pretty irritating. The last of the game's issues that I noticed are that it thinks that 'difficult' means spamming even more enemies. Perhaps I treasure difficulty too much in games, but I think you should actually be able to die in a fighting game. The mechanic of pleasing the crowd is cute, but it also acts as your health bar in a way—which would be fine if you didn't have a near-constant free super-please steroid.  It'd be nice if there was more variety of enemies and gameplay in the acts. In what I played, it was very repetetive.  The game is 1-dimensional and its not even a good one.",

            "review_text": "The cutesy cartoon graphics of Foul Play didn't do anything for me, but I'm sure it really appeals to children. The sinister occult theme of the game is wildly inappropriate for them. At one point, the main character chants a demonic spell and opens a portal to hell. It's like a retelling of the life of lunatic sociopath Aleister Crowley, in cartoon beat'em up form aimed at children. Foul, indeed. The actual game play kind of reminds me of a 2D Devil May Cry. Points are scored by stringing together long combos. At one point when the ability to reverse enemy attacks and throw them is unlocked, the game can be beaten by just continuous throwing one enemy at the rest of them until they're all dead. Until then, though, the game was seriously cramping my hand. This is a hardcore button-mashing game. The combat was kind of fun once better moves were unlocked. Other games have done this type of game play much better and didn't have the terrible story to go with it.",
