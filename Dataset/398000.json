            "review_text": "Don't be fooled by my lack of hours; I used to play this game for what seems to me like hundreds of hours and you can't believe how happy I was to see that it's finally available on Steam. This is pretty much my favourite PC game of all time. The graphics may seem outdated to some but I still think they're appealing. The characters are quirky and fun and the story is great: You play Twinsen, the hero of the planetoid Twinsun (which has two suns - clever, huh?) who defeated the evil Dr. FunFrock in the first game. Everything seems fine and dandy until the weather suddenly gets worse, your friend gets badly injured and even aliens land on your homeworld, so you better go grab your magic ball and tunic and prepare yourself for some more adventures. You don't necessarily have to play the first game to completely understand this one - you'll get everything important by interacting with books, signs and busts - but it certainly helps to get into the right mood. You may find the controls a little awkward at first, since it doesn't control like recent games. Forget about WASD. Anyway, I don't think this should be a problem, since it's pretty easy to get the hang onto the controls.  I highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "LBA2 is a hugely adorable 3D action-adventury type game. I played it before the first one (which you shouldn't get on Steam by the way, since it's a horrible port of a mobile version of the game with keyboard controls literally cut out), but I now find the first one way too hard and frustrating to play. It seems like LBA2 addressed the problems of the first one, adding a save-anytime system, variable camera, and enemies that don't constantly stunlock you. The music is great, the graphics are great, the animations adorable. Figuring out what you're supposed to do and where to go is needlessly difficult at times, but it doesn't bring the game down.",

After 2 weeks in which i tried to find the name of the game only remembering you start on an island and that there's a magic school. Anyway, the game, like many of that time, is linear but fun to play and it made me remember the time i used to hotkey quick save in order to use it after almost every single step :))...",

            "review_text": "This was the first game I've originally owned when I was just 9 years old, so I cannot  be completely objective. I still have the original disc in my collection and complete the game again every few years. At the time it set the standards for me when it came to adventure games. Despite all its faults, like the tank controls that makes precision platforming a pain to the sometimes awkward voice acting I can only speak highly of this game.  Remember, it was 1997 when this came out. Compared to that era the game had such elements that Some of the features of this game are now outdated but most became industry standard later, but back when this came out, it was something rarely seen.  There a lot of games from the 90's that get a lot of attention nowadays from YouTube personalities and nostalgia reviews, however this game gets barely mentioned. It should be up there with some of the most discussed games from the era, and it should be getting a lot more attention. That is one reason I decided to write this little big review. At this point in time, this game is one of the most underrated classics. I hope that that will change in the future and it will get more coverage and the attention it deserves.   pros: - Open World, free roaming. - Fully voice-acted. - Gorgeous graphics, blending software rendered 3D with 2D in an isometric view. (for its time) - Improved on every aspect of its predecessor, as a good sequel should.  - Simple but engaging story. - Imaginative, colorful and varied environments and designs. - One of the best soundtracks.  - Unique (again, for its time) game mechanics with the 'mood' system, having a state for Normal/Sporty/Aggressive and Discreet to use them in various situations.   cons: - Linear story, therefore it has little replay value unless you're trying to speedrun it or trying to find glitches, and hidden suff/Easter eggs.  - Clunky tank controls. - Weird, static camera controls. - Easily breakable using in game exploits.",

            "review_text": "One of the first computer games I ever played. Playing it now brought back great feelings of nostalgia and memories of playing through it at 9 years old with my brother. Everything about this game is quirky and wonderful; the characters, the voice acting, sounds, locations, the gameplay and combat system, you have 'moods' that you switch between. Controlling Twinsen feels clunky at first, but it's different and fun to get the hang of, I assigned Q and E to switch betwen Normal and Sporty modes more easily. I always looked forward to the videos which have a cool visual/animation style and the soundtrack is magnificent.  So glad I revisited this and reminded myself of the ending which is a really satisfying conclusion and a great ending sequence. If you played this in the past then I highly recommend you get it here, it hasn't lost its magic.",
