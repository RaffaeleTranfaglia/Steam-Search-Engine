            "review_text": "Despite some of the negative reviews, I decided to try this game because it was free and I have been looking for a game like this for a long time. After playing for 3 hours, I am still enjoying it and plan on playing it a lot longer.  At first, I couldn't figure out how to steer. I went into the options and there was a setting to turn the steering wheel on.  The graphics are nice at 1080p with all the effects turned on. I really like the open world and different missions you can partake in to capture ships, smuggle goods, steal cargo, etc.  There are a LOT of ships you can fight against, capture, or buy. Every ship has a tree with upgrades, and you can purchase these upgrades at a port. Such upgrades include adding guns to the bow or stern, strengthening the hull, or improving the sales. Even your character can be upgraded once you gain enough experience points. You can also start your own pirate town and build buildings to manufacture goods to trade, store goods that you've acquired, or generate money.  The maps required to unlock parts of the map cost in game gold, but to unlock the buildings required to generate currency at your pirate town does cost real money. It's very inexpensive anyway, and I think I only paid a few bucks for the full experience. I haven't, nor do I plan, to purchase gold or ships with real money.  This game is not pay to win, because if you spend real money on the largest 'best' ships, your in game gold income will not support crews that large for long. It's best to stay with smaller ships with smaller crews until you build up your income.  I haven't tried the multiplayer part yet, so no review there.  The music gets really repetitive, so I've keep it turned off. I wish there were more animations on the world map. I wish the crew on the ships were animated.  Overall, If you really like games about ships, pirates, smugglers, merchants, etc. definitely give this one a try.  I give it a 4/5",

            "review_text": "This game was a pleasant surprise to me. I had thought it would have been pay-to-win multyplayer, or some cheepskate buy-the-ending title, but on the contrary, I now have something to bide my empty time.  I will say this. It is not the hardest game in the world. The worst thing that happened to me was being stuck in a cutter (small military ship) that was decently fast and had a few good cannons. I managed to sink two enemy pirates at one point with the stern cannons I bought. Of course, anything larger than a ketch chasing you, you'd best hightale it out of there. Eventually, I saved for a carrak, a shipping vessle with a good cannon load. I could then fight off brigantines and the inexperienced brig captain, but it wasn't easy, and I ran in to a lot of them. When my experience really took off was when I bought and upgraded a corvett, an excelent ship. It's faster than nearly everything out there, decently strong with a good cannon load, it can carry almost as much as a carrak when the hold is upgraded and I could go toe-to-toe with anything less powerful than a Man-o'-War. 1st and 2nd rates are still above me atm. Overall, I've had an exciting time outrunning enemy corvetts and sinking pirate frigates, taking their flags and using them to patch my sails. Currently, I play a corvett decked to the nines, a pretty skilled captain, and a pet wookie named Steve. The game's progression is a good pace for me and you'll hardly ever run out of things to do. Currently, i'm trying to find a poorly defended port so I can capture a man-o'-war or something.  With that, and the consideration the game is free, I have no issues with recomending this if you have some extra time on your hands. It's fun, decently paced, and it'll give you a few good stories to tell.  Happy hunting~!!",

The game is a RPG, you take on a roll as a Captain of Pirates who can learn a number of skills such as: Boarding, Repairing, Smuggling, Ship-to-ship combat and trading. There is PVP, PVE and Open World Elements in the game but the Thing that Annoys me most about this game is the fact that you have to buy maps with in game currency which means that you will have to be saving up 300 gold pieces to buy another map that opens up a new area in the Caribbean.",

            "review_text": "I found this by mistake while I was looking for a game on my tablet. I downloaded it, but I did not really pay much attention to it, since i get these games as a pass time, not to actually put hours of play in them.   When though I found out I do not need internet to play this and that it's single player mode is actually single offline player mode.. I just got so hooked! I was hunched over my tablet for all the day, until I got tired. Mind you, tired as in fatigue and not of playing this.  All of you first have to keep in mind this is a mobile game. It has an arcadish feel and of course can get repetitive. But honestly I can't recall any sandboxish pirate game as good as this at least of the last decade. It is kind of sad for me to say this and what comes in the top is actually an android game.   The in-app purchases are not needed in any way, at least as long as its about enjoying the game fully. The only thing I would buy is to remove the ads (PC version does not have them), buy the extra buildings for your towns (Pile o Houses) that unlock three extra buildings (Honestly they are not THAT great or needed) and Base Forts, for the extra town protection. But still, I do not feel you need these to play the game, but they would compliment it nicely. I guess the pack that unlocks extra ports will be nice too? I do not feel there are too little ports, but I guess I would not mind more~ 5 euro are not that much for a game that makes me feel it has a replay value personally. Time will show what I will buy.  Even if the game gives an arcade feeling, you can attack merchant or military ships, get ambushed by pirates, board and capture ships, attack and capture ports (if you do not mind defending them), trade, smuggle, transport people, protect convoys, upgrade your ships, upgrade your ports, have your own fleet (up to 4 ships), level up your character and learn new skills, raise your reputation with nations for better prices, bla bla bla bla.   You get a nice story line and also the way the game slowly unlocks more of the more and better ships, makes you slowly enjoy the game, rather than rush you to the end of it. I believe the worst in-app buy must be the one that unlocks the whole map.. what's the point? It will just shorten the game!   If this keeps up and I will get more hooked, I feel I am going to buy that 4 euro 1st-Rate ship.. Have to resist.. it is just a 3D shape covered in colorful pixels.. a really awesome looking one.. argh. Sadly I will probably not get it though, at least if I am getting it right. There are ways to actually lose the ability to have the ships you buy? If what I read is true, then thanks, but no thanks. If there is a way to keep getting it back, then I think I am going to sin and get it.  Everyone should download and play it!",

            "review_text": "According to Steam, I played The Pirate: Caribbean Hunt for 19 hours. I was attracted by the 'free too play' option, and hoped it would be a good casual game I could play in downtime, with a multiplayer benefit. The game has great potential, but its business model of nickel-and-diming players all along the way just turns me way off.   The graphics are pretty, good atmosphere, and the game is easy to jump into. I followed the plan, built upo my little base, gained some good skills, and did a fairly good job, mostly trading, and picking on the hapless Danes. Unfortunately, after about ten hours, I began to be pestered incessantly by the Pirate Confederation, who continually plagued me, with superior forces, forcing me to use hit-and-run sail attacks, followed by time-sucking fleeing tactics, staying ahead of their ships during long haul escapes, where I stayed half-a-knot better speed than my pursuers.  I felt like I had no choice, but I actually did: I could have dragged out my credit card, and for about $35, equipped my pirate with the finest base, ships, and superman type skills, to rise through the ranks, defeating anything in my way, using my personal financial might to help my pirate win, even right in the heat of battle! Except of course, other players who spent a little more money than me.  It's a version of Deus Ex Machina, except here, it's Deus Ex Mastercard. And that's just not fun.",

            "review_text": "Overall: The content on offer isn't exactly polished, but on the basis that it works and it's free I'd say it passes the mark needed for a recommendation, or at least a try on your part.  Pros: Quite a lot of vessels to choose from, ranging from basically a fishing boat with a butt cannon to the well-known man-o-wars and first-rates.  Larger vessels feel like a heavy behemoth, with weight behind their turning. Conversely, smaller ones are sufficiently agile that good use of wind and sails allow experienced players to overcome better-armed AI opponents (but then again, of course you are going to captain a first-rate, so who cares).  You can ram a vessel to death (with a ship upgrade). Ramming is always fun.  Cons Early-game finance is quite a mess. Trading feels unviable in early game without the associated perks and reputation bonuses (at least I cannot make it work). On the other hand, picking the corsair perk is an absolute must (allows players to board), as boarding allows you to capture a vessel (and its cargo) intact, thus more loot, while expending less in repairs and ammo refill.  Mission rewards are unbalanced. Escort missions' reward is only based on the size of the escort, not the distance needed to travel, making them a waste of time. On the other hand, smuggling missions are hopelessly broken, offering a massive reward for little to no effort involved.  Mission failure states are far too strict. A passenger mission to a neignbouring port not allowing middle stops is understandable, but the same cannot be said about the same mission with a destination halfway across the bloody map, thematically or otherwise. The same problem exists in siege missions, where it makes no sense that players are not allowed to stop by a port nearby the target for resupplies. The fact that this hidden failure state is not explicitly stated is quite aggravating.  Gathering blueprints from shipwrecks is not a very well thought out mechanic. For the time needed to complete an entire blueprint the player could capture said vessel thrice over in the open world. It's really more of a novelty than a viable option.  The UI isn't the most user-friendly, requiring quite some time to get used to. Somewhat related is the controls for the treasure hunts. If there is a help button I've missed it.  Others There are in-game purchases with real life money. I have yet to feel like the game is skewed towards forcing you to spend real life money at the time of writing, but a heads up for those who care about this sort of thing nonetheless.  Suggestions Besides fixing the cons, giving us the ability to design and fly custom pirate flags would be nice.",

That's not to say The Pirate is a bad game, in fact it is suprisingly half-decent for a Free 2 Play game.   Unlike most F2P games it doesn't ram the in game purchases down your throat and it is playable without having to spend a penny...mostly. The graphics are decent and the naval engagements can be quite tense and enjoyable.   The biggest downsides are the ugly UI, the clunky unintuitive controls and the non-existant AI of your own ships.  With a few tweeks this could be a great game but as it is, you might get a few hours of enjoyment from it, especially if you are craving abit of high seas piracy.  I only recommend The Pirate if you are looking for a distraction for a couple of hours.",

            "review_text": "I enjoy playing the game. But I would suggest some improvements to the UI, add a back button to menu's, put the keys things are assigned to underneath the icons, and add a higher res pack for the UI. Tutorial needs to explain things better, and it needs to be a little longer, as well as point out key features, like the blue arrows hovering on the water is the direction the wind is blowing, or pointing out things in the UI. I would suggest a newer and more common control scheme, like right click pan instead of left click. A double tap feature, you click somewhere on the ocean twice, a part with-in your view range, and the ship auto sails there. Another feature I would like to see is a spyglass feature, someone on top the mast spots a ship and tells you what they see. Also, if the game has an offline option, at least have the tutorial show you how to go online. I could think of a lot more I would like to say, but it’s time for me to go.",
