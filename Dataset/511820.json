            "review_text": "  Le Havre: The Inland Port is the video game adaptation of the board game of the same name. The game is what you would expect out of a video game adaptation of a board game. If you don't like board games you won't like the game but if you do you should enjoy the game quite a bit.   Basically Le Havre: The Inland Port is a medium strategy board game where you play against another player to score the most victory points. You acquire resources and money which you use to buy buildings. These buildings give you victory points at the end of the game and can be used during the game to get you additional resources.   Le Havre: The Inland Port is a game that takes a while to fully understand but is quite easy to play once you understand what you are doing. The game has a lot of strategy as you try to maximize your own points while limiting your opponent's opportunities to score points. The part of the game that I found most interesting was the resource management mechanics which are quite different than you see in a lot of board games.  As far as its' implementation of the board game, I think the game does a good job. I have never played the board game version but the video game is easy to navigate and works well. The game does a good job teaching you how to play the game. The computer AI is a little hit or miss with the lower levels being way too easy but the higher levels do provide some challenge.   If you like moderately difficult board games and the idea behind the game interests you, I think you will get quite a bit of enjoyment out of Le Havre: The Inland Port.
