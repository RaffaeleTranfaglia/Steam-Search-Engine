            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I played all of Matt's games and was a big fan of Bullet Heaven 1.   Bullet Heaven 2 is an incredibly pretty Bullet Hell game full of content, and it comes packed with features to adjust the difficulty for any player. But at the end of the day, it is still a Bullet Hell game. If you don't derive any enjoyment from moving your tiny hitbox (it's one pixel) through intricate patterns of near-death, then this will game will quickly wear thin for you. If on the other hand you have even a passing interest in this genre or SHMUPs of any kind, you will definitely enjoy this game.  Gameplay: Many others have listed the numbers, but there are a crap ton of stages with 3 difficulty levels, and each world has two bosses as well as a random survival level. The game's characters all have minor differences and 3 subweapons each, with no two subweapons being exactly the same. You will definitely find something that suits your playstyle in this bunch. There are optional cheats and handicaps to tweak the difficulty both ways, but nothing in the way of permanent upgrades like in BH1. This game is more 'pure' than that; your character does not improve over time, only your skill does. The high scores are heavily influenced by difficulty, meaning that the only way to compete for top scores on the leaderboards is to git gud at Heavenly difficulty. This provides a nice incentive for players to get better, while in no way locking out casual players from completing the game on Normal.  Controls: Responsive but not without caveats. The Mouse and Keyboard setup is clearly most ideal, as mouse movement gives you a huge advantage in precision. It also supports controllers including properly analog stick control, which when combined with other features can yield enough precision to even beat Heavenly difficulty without resorting to mouse. There is a 'focus' button to slow down your character while held, but you can invert this option to always move slowly and use the button to gain a sprint mode. Highly recommended as the setup for controller, but redundant for mouse since you can just move the mouse less. Unfortunately, you can't remap or rebind almost any of these control options.  Graphics: Overly cutesy with soft lines and pleasant, but obviously flash, animation. The character art is something I'm used to and is true to Matt's usual style. It's a huge step up from BH1 though. Conversely, the bullets themselves look highly professional and the boss patterns match up to anything else on the market. The game has performance issues for some people, but playing in windowed mode instead of fullscreen seems to fix most FPS issues.  Soundtrack: Unbelievable, 11/10. Halyconic Falcon X (Phyrnna) is the composer and is even a playable character this time around. You get the entire OST FOR FREE when you buy the game, and can listen to any song in-game in the gallery. The SFX are mostly decent. Some are really good, but some of the enemy shot SFX are kinda grating and annoying to me. Fortunately the options let you turn off these sounds (among other things) if you so desire.  Finally, this game has some sort of mysterious power to be HIGHLY addicting. I get that way with new games a lot, but everyone I personally know who owns this game, has a really hard time putting it down.",

            "review_text": "TLDR this game is great, get it. Long version:  Bullet Heaven 2 is a pretty amazing (or, well, at least SLIGHTLY amazing) danmaku game that accounts for both newbies to the genre and veterans. The game is built around bite-sized stages that can be replayed at will, so getting a game over never means you lose progress, and it's the perfect thing to pick up when you want to have fun for 15 minutes... but with almost a hundred of them, you still get a lot of bang for the buck! The harder difficulty settings give you a real challenge, and get so hard I've not managed to clear stage 1-1 on the hardest difficulty yet despite years of casually fiddling with danmakus.  The game also has some nice customization options to let you tailor your experience for your taste... money dropped by enemies can be used to unlock cheats to make the game easier, handicaps to make it harder, and lots of customization options like alternate weapons and characters; each has slightly different play style and switching up characters or weapons to suit the stage you're going to play has a big impact on your experience. You can play co-op with up to 3 friends for an easier or harder time depending on how well you coordinate your attacks, too.  The game doesn't punish you for using cheats and playing it safe, but it rewards you for playing well. Each stage has 3 extra-difficult optional bonus waves accessed if you get enough Perfects on the normal waves, which offer huge score boosts and extra cash for the unlockables; you can unlock hidden bosses and stages in each world, and all the game's achievements also rewards you with a substantial amount of unlockables cash giving you an incentive to achieve them. There's also a bunch of achievements awarded for very silly or stupid-to-attempt things encouraging you to take the game less serious and try things outside your comfort zone, and before you know it, it'll become second nature.  Bullet Heaven 2 combines the best parts of Jamestown's co-op and Touhou's tight bullet pattern design with a small pinch of roguelike elements, and it's pretty unique in the amount of polish and quality it has, but the best parts of it is how accessible it is. You'll probably only play in short, intense bursts, but it feels like you've had fun for hours.",

            "review_text": "This game is meant for fans of the Epic Battle Fantasy series or fans of the genre in general. As long as you like the 'shmup' genre, you'll most likely like this game. I don't want to write extensively about this game, but here are some of the best features:    Customizable difficulty—Casual, normal, heavenly; cheats and handicaps. Extremely easy to extremely difficult (unless you happen to be a master of bullet hell)   Good hours to price—Enough content to be  easily worth the money. Ten dollars for a well-made game that can entertain for hours, depending on how fast you play through the game.   Satisfying and aggravating—As a heavenly-mode player, I want a challenge. I always get this challenge, and the game consistently kicks my ♥♥♥. This amps up the elation that comes with beating a tough level or boss.   Achievement system—Earn achievements by playing, winning, and meeting requirements. Feels good, and you get a cool badge. Also, scoring and high scores are very well done. Different leaderboards for each difficulty, cheats and handicaps to modify multiplier, and earning points through perfect performance or risky maneuvering.   Kupo707—Matt Roszak is one of the coolest game developers around. You could play this game for   free[/b] on Kongregate or something, but if you like the series or him in general, donate by buying this game. You get bonus content not available in the free version (stupidly difficult bosses and cool characters). Leave a donation for this glorious gamer!  Conclusion? It's worth it. Try it out for free on the browser, or just buy this game and refund it if you can't get into it. Also, it comes with free wallpaper. Check the files!    ",

It's a game series I've grown to love, and I enjoy them immensely. The humour is funny, the characters have set personalities, and they make fun of RPG games while being excellent RPG games themselves. What more could you want? Main outline of this game is shoot the enemies and don't get shot back. Undertale and this game's predecessor are the only real bullet hell games I have played. This one punishes you, but makes the punishing fun. TL;DR: Get this game; it's fun, it sounds awesome and I want to be friends with the developer.",
