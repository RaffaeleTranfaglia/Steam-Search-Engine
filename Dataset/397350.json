Want a quick skirmish on a small map? Can do. Want a long fight over continents and countries? It can do that too. The graphics are dated but they do an excellent job of letting you know if your facing a knight, maceman archer or crossbowman. At the price offered, Its a steal of a value for something that absorbed many of my nights growing up.",

            "review_text": "A truly excellent game for its time, and still quite entertaining even today. Lords of the Realm 2 is a game that revolves around attempting to take over a region, which is split into a number of counties. Each county provides your effort with resources such as food, lumber, money, and men.  The computer AI is remarkably good considering the age of the game. It can accomplish many intelligent context based tasks. For example if the computer sees it does not have the manpower to hold an endangered county, it will wreck what it can and transport away all the resources so that they do not fall into enemy hands. In combat (which is done RTS style) it can organize a cohesive attack when it has the advantage of numbers, or attempt to turtle behind cover when it is at a disadvantage. The computer can organize small expendable raiding parties designed to burn your crop fields and cripple your economy, and knows to press the advantage if it spots a lightly defended territory. Overall it cannot match a human player, but it greatly lowers the need for computer advantages still used today by many games to artificially inflate difficulty.  Computer controlled Lords have personalities and voice actors assigned to them for flavor, and although the voice acting is generally terrible, I must admit that it makes the game more enjoyable to have The Knight insult me in his exaggeratedly arrogant tone, or The Baron politely inform me of his intent to annex my territory.  The UI is easy to understand, and a marked step up from LotR 1. There are tooltips and help topics; a brand new player will have no trouble diving right. There are even auto saves, which was not a given at the time! Very convenient!  LotR 2 is fast and fun, a truly great game for its time. If you never played it, and are a fan of strategy, it's certainly worth a look!",

            "review_text": "Lords of the Realm II is a classic game that I spent countless hours playing upon the games initial release. In my opinion this is an improvement over LOTR. The graphics and interface are friendlier and the combat is much better. On the flipside, the economy has been watered down, making it far less interesting and challenging than the original.  The overall objective of this game is to ♥♥♥♥, pillage, and conquer the neutral as well as the enemy controlled counties of the map. Each map varies in the number of counties such as 4 or 6, for example. In order to meet the objective, one must build up an economy, raise troops, and go out and conquer the surrounding lands. All the while, the AI is doing the same.   As noted the economy is much easier to handle in this game. For example, agriculture has two options, grain and cows. However, there is also the buying and selling of iron, stone, and wood as well as varies weapons that the prudent seller/manufactuer may make money on.   On the upside the combat part of the game is much improved however, with the ability to position and move your troops much more fluidly, so you can try to outflank the enemy, or bottleneck the enemy in defensive terrain (ideally with melee troops defending a bridge while your archers and crossbows rain death on them).   Please note that you van also build a castle for your county-counties. They range from a motte and bailey to a full stone castle with defenses such as burning oil. Its always nice to have your castle seiged just to kill the enemy with arrows and burning oil.   I wholeheartly recommend this game to anyone who played it intially and to anyone who likes strategy games. The graphics aren't in anyway as fantastic as COH but the game is fun and will frustrate you (in a good way) and make you laugh in a sadistic way.",

Lords 2 and its siege expansion are primarily Turn-based strategy games with the option to control combat as real-time strategy. The game plays like a simplified combination of Civilization and Total War, and despite this simplicity, I still find that the game surprises me.  I have yet to play another game with a built in 'Send an Insult' function.   - Iconic and eternally enjoyable audio, strategic and (modestly) challenging gameplay.  - The CG video sequences are markedly aged by today's standards, but what would one expect of production from 1996?  - Other graphical assets have a 'tired' appearance as well, but failing an HD remake, its all passable.  Overall 4.5 of 5",

Support did not really help so I'm stuck with a game that i love and own in 2 different formats but can't play. Bummer! So for those reasons i don't recommend getting it unless you know that it will work on your machine.",
