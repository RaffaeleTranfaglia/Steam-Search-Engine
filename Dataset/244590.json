            "review_text": " 'Great game to play competitive. It has quite a learning curve but the (small) community is really active and has great support for new players if you stick around on the teamspeak. The community even hosts tournaments twice a year where you can win sweet prizes! I've put a lot of hours into this, it's no casual game, but if you get into it it's really tons of fun.' ~~IcyDwarf   'If you like fast-paced action but are tired of first person shooters in which one shot is enough to kill you, you'll probably like this game. And if you like parkour and ball games, you'll like it even more. Even the tower defense fans will love this game!' ~~ProtoQuantum  Epigenesis presents a promising take on the next few hundred years: no grim future centered entirely on war, no post-apocalyptic earth where Darwinian human instinct has taken over; instead, humanity created the most popular sport in history, some strange hybrid of Basketball, Soccer, and Unreal Tournament. It's also an interesting case for why 'e-sports' doesn't necessarily have to conjure up images of multiplayer battle arenas and first-person shooters, but that more traditional (albeit fictional) sports can exist in that space alongside the likes of Dota 2 and Counter-Strike. I really like what Epigenesis represents: it's an innovative take on traditional sports that still provides the adrenaline rush of something like Quake or Unreal Tournament, in a well-produced package that you rarely see in games fresh out of Steam's Early Access.   'In Epigenesis, two teams face off in an attempt to plant a ball inside an enemy's goal more times in ten minutes than the opposition across a platformed ravine. The arenas aesthetically resemble something out of Tron but play like something out of Quake. Each player is given a non-lethal laser with two modes: rail (an instant, focused beam which pushes enemies back a small amount) and shot (a mode which fires a missile-like projectile which travels slowly but produces an explosion that pushes back enemies a lot). The gun is a key part of both offense and defense -- pushing an enemy back and causing them to fall off a ledge or preventing them from landing on one in the first place spells instant death, producing a 5-second respawn timer. In addition, hitting an enemy who's in the air with your melee attack sends them straight downward, and if they fail to land on a platform? Splat.  In order to score a goal, a player has to pick up the ball from the middle of the arena, take it to the enemy goal, and toss it in. It's simple, but when presented with power-ups like 'smokescreen' (which creates a cloud of smoke over a large area for a few seconds), along with arena-based hazards (like the desert maps' Twister, which pulls players it catches high up into the air), it gets complex and interesting. Upon scoring, a player is given a seed, which they can plant on one of the unoccupied platforms, which in turn spawns a plant, a kind of 'turret' which produces effects ranging from firing projectiles which slow enemies, to creating a shield in which players can hide. In addition, each plant provides the entire team with a buff to either jump height or speed. Each player also has a gauntlet called a 'meth-glove,' whose use is two-fold: the first, called 'methylation,' allows a player to power up a plant; the other, called 'demethylation,' allows them to cause an enemy's plant to wither and eventually become inactive. It's here where the strategy of Epigenesis starts to shine: its rules are deceptively easy to learn, but when other humans are thrown into the mix, their collective strategies coalesce into something truly spectacular.' ~~Tamriilin   I can not say anything that has not been already said except for this THE COMMUNITY IS NOT DEAD! While there is a small player base there are full games every Saturday and Sunday not to mention the Tournaments! Please buy this game I promise as the head of the community that you will love this game! ",

            "review_text": "Highly recommended. Genuinely not enough players to do this game justice. This is one of the most exciting, satisfying, and downright fun games I've played in my many many years as a gamer. If I were asked to describe it, it's basically space Quidditch if you were to throw in a splash of Unreal Tournament and Tribes: Ascend.  The object is to take control of the ball placed in the center of the field and get it into the opposing team's goal, which then rewards you with a seed that you can plant on a platform adjacent to either your own goal, or a platform on which you've already planted a seed, which will then give a stat buff of your choosing to your entire team (Speed, Jump height, etc) and will also create a plant with abilities such as shielding or energy turrets which are activated (or deactivated by the enemy) using your meth (methylation) glove. The game is won either by the team with the most goals when the timer runs out, or by the first team to plant a seed on the opposing team's goal.  Among the tools you have to accomplish these objectives are: - An energy blaster, which has a short travel time and can knock opponents or the ball around, messing up their trajectories or assisting passes to teammates. - A hitscan beam shot with a slower rate of fire and reduced repulsive capability. - Various powerups scattered across certain platforms in the playing field, such as Boost (gives you a big push in the direction you're aiming), Grapple (sends a grappling hook in the direction of your crosshair, which pulls you in that direction), and Push (generates a small explosion around you, pushing away other players. I'm unsure of the official name), among others.  I VERY much recommend this game, as a gamer and as a critic. It's something relatively innovative in the way it implements the features and mechanics it uses, isn't very hard to get into after a few rounds, and is simply a LOT of fun, plus it's very cheap for the entertainment value, plus it runs at very high and wonderfully smooth framerates on most modern machines, and can be turned down to run just fine even on some older ones so more people can enjoy what this game has to offer. As well, it's non-violent, so parents who are mindful of what their kids play, or just don't like violence will be happy to know that the game doesn't have a health or damage system, deaths, or blood, just pure clean fun.  I'd give it a 9/10  TL;DR - You won't regret buying this game.",

I have noticed, however, that the AI tends to take a very linear path EVERY TIME and there is no variety in the movement whatsoever, so calling the opponent and AI seems a bit too generous.  The graphics are okay, but they aren't spectacular.   This game isn't the best compared to most other football-like games, but it's still worth a go if you like feeling superior against an AI that seems like it's been programmed by a 5 year old who thinks he's entitles but you're just like 'ha, no' and push him down because the TV remote is yours and he goes off crying to your mum with them fake tears and your mum patronises him and you're just there like 'oh, what a wonderful life'.
