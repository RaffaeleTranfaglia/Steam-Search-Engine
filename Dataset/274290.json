You start a chapter from zero  +/- The best way to Play is in my opinion Original Light in order to mix both hardship and forgiveness +/- The game almost does not explain a thing, which can make it confusing  +A mix of the 'Point n' Click harsh puzzles' and 'Super Meat Boy mentality' ( Fail and repeat until you make it.) +Truly intense sequences, especially the second chapter is nerve wracking to the point of panic +Great writing and well created characters. Somehow I love Irving's torture speech +Challenging and complex +A beast easy to understand (bah, depends on you), but hard to dominate +Achievements that are worthy of the best +A nice looking aesthetic and pixel art style, wonderful OST and nice environments  Recommended .Be ready for an exhausting experience that will test your might ",

            "review_text": "I'd like to start by saying I've never been a fan of purposefully difficult games. Difficulty for difficulty's sake may appeal to a certain minority of people, but it's intensely off-putting for everyone else. It's even more off-putting when you're made to feel bad for not enjoying the difficulty, or even insulted for it. There's a strange difficulty superiority complex in some gaming circles that I can't quite get my head around, and it leads to some games pitching themselves firmly in Camp Difficult and making a big song and dance about how punishing they are, like it's a badge of honour.  Prior to the update last year, Gods Will Be Watching firmly fell into this camp. On the 'original' difficulty, there are random events and unpredictable difficulty spikes that come out of nowhere, ruining any progress you've made in the puzzle so far and forcing you to restart. The usual response to any complaints about this is that they're explained by the end of the story (which they are... kind of), but this doesn't alter the fact that they make playing the game an endurance test rather than anything resembling fun. Go Camp Difficult!   Post-update, however, it's now possible to play the game in a way that feels (mostly) fair, and it's a completely different experience. Stripped of all the rage-inducing random events, the real game can actually finally come out... and I can honestly say I've not really played anything like it. It looks like a point-and-click adventure game, but doesn't play anything like one. Each chapter consists of a chunk of (pretty decent) story exposition followed by a very complex puzzle, usually involving resource and team management across multiple different variables that need to be balanced at all times to prevent catastrophic failure. And you  will  fail. Even on 'easy' mode, you'll most likely have to repeat each chapter a couple of times at least. The difference between doing this on the original and easy difficulties is that on original, you'll have to repeat chapters multiple times because the game randomly fails you over and over, whereas on easy, you only have to repeat the chapters because you've made a mistake or because you've not fully understood a mechanic of the puzzle. This seems like a fair challenge. The puzzles are hard, but not insurmountable, and without the element of randomness it's possible to complete each puzzle through good old logic and planning rather than through sheer perseverance.   I'm really belabouring this point because the game still tries to make you feel bad for playing on anything but 'original', like you aren't experiencing the 'true' game, and I suspect many people feel pressured into playing it on original and just give up in frustration. I don't think I could disagree with the developers more about this. The random elements ruin an otherwise brilliant game, and without them the game really shines through.   In summary:  play it , but don't play it on the original difficulty, unless you're feeling particularly masochistic.",

            "review_text": "Gods Will Be Watching is a philosophical, sci-fi, dramatic, point &amp; click, pixelated gem of a game. It is all about decision making and consequences. You'll be put under extreme situations and must use your wits to overcome challenges that feel like certain death. Control yourself and your crew, keep the pace and never give up hope... and you may survive.  It saddens me that GWBW has been receiving mixed reviews, basically due to it's difficulty, although I can't say I don't understand it. Most point &amp; click games are relaxing and gives you all the time in the world to solve it's puzzles. This one doesn't... at least not in the original difficulty level (there are 5 levels, original being the hardest). But if you think failing a few times won't make you ragequit and write hateful reviews about it, give it a try and you may love it!  9 / 10",

            "review_text": "(placeholder for a longer, more comprehensive review)  Very different, unique game. Not for all (or even most) tastes. I'll start this review off with a series of cautions.  The biggest difficulty with Gods Will Be Watching is it is going to appeal to a very small audience. GWBW is a game where you aren't the all-conquering hero, where people will die through your actions, and where your only satisfaction will come from doing the best you can in the circumstances you draw. In other words, it's a lot like life, and asks deeper questions about why we game or what we expect to take away from a gaming experience, not to mention the 'heroic' avatars we play over and over in games that are so much ego food. GWBW has much more in common with your typical Jason Rohrer game than it does the average indie, let alone AAA title.  Furthermore, do not be fooled by anyone calling this a ' point-and-click adventure game'... it has almost nothing to do with that genre. This is a turn-based strategy game with very strict rules, although utterly unlike any other one out there in the minimalism of its style, substance, and execution.  GWBW itself consists of seven different scenarios, ranging from a hostage crisis, to enduring torture, to wilderness survival, and so on. This is not a 'happy game'. The scenarios are harrowing, to say the least, and many players are going to struggle with a game where they not only don't get to win, but can only hope to minimize loss.  The goal is simply to get through each scenario in any way the player can, with consequences that you can live with. This sets up a rapidly shifting moral boundary, as necessity will rapidly come to outweigh morality.  The game boils down to effectively managing all of the variables in these scenarios while trying to keep any of them from falling into a fail-state... which they inevitably will. The scenarios themselves, however--unlike the one-offs of a time/resource management game or a 'quest' game like Oregon Trail--are complex and intertwined. The player will not only need to work to understand those relationships, but also to recognize cues when the situation is tipping too far in any of multiple directions, and to plan and react accordingly.  This means, to pick one example: -understanding what will cause a hostage's emotional state to improve/deteroriate -monitoring the visual cues that indicate that hostage's emotional state -planning in advance how to control/manipulate that hostage's emotional state -having contingencies ready (in mind) if external circumstances interfere with that plan -making hard decisions when all of this breaks down due to flawed planning or bad luck  To some players, the small element of luck/bad luck will be an exhiliarting thrill--an element that twists the story and changes possibilities, taking away control (similar to the great roguelikes) in order to generate emergent story. To others, taht same luck/bad luck will lead to exasperation or a feelign of malicious unfairness, and frequent reloads (especialy if they obsess about 'perfecting' each level). Buyer beware.  The most succinct thing I can say about this game to help you choose to buy it or not to buy it is: this game IS the choices you make. It's not about the story, or mastering each scenario, or working your way to a pay-off at the end (again, be warned, the ending is going to ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of you if you're looking for validation there). It is about making choices without knowing if the choice you made is 'right' or 'wrong'.  The soundtrack and pixel art are bar none some of the best of the genre, and much of the dialogue is engaging (when it doesn't fall into tropes) and the debates about the ending will undoubtedly keep the Steam message boards raging for a long time.   Ignore them, play the free Ludum Dare version of the game, and form your own judgment. If you like that, give GWBW a try. It goes well with a nice glass of Chianti and any dog-eared copy of Sartre or Nietzsche.",

            "review_text": "Gods will be watching is a pretty novel hybrid between an adventure and strategy game.  Essentially the gameplay puts you into a tough situation, where you have to deal several pressing concerns by giving out orders to your companions, which may bring you closer to resolution but may also result in their death. It's a game of tough decisions. Ultimately it is possible to save everyone but it will often require practice, planning and a bit of luck to pull off. Speaking of luck, the game has a degree of RNG that ensures that you are never certain that everything will go according to plan, however you are usually given tools to avoid risking too much as well. This is however still something that can put people off, so the developer was kind enough to add a 'puzzle mode' which reduces the effect of RNG. The game is still however pretty difficult, expect to fail a few times till you get through it. The game does come with an 'easy' mode that makes the challenges noticeably easier to overcome, but there's a reason the developer states that the game should be played on normal and I also feel it ruins the experience to go 'puzzle mode' or 'easy mode'.  In the end I recommend it provided you're not put off by the difficulty, particularly if making tough decisions is your thing.",

            "review_text": "Gods Will Be Watching is a story-driven, situation management game, that leads the player through a series of consecutive scenarios involving the game's central cast of characters. The player will make decisions that will result in a variety of outcomes: the loss of characters, the altering of the story, advancement or failure. It's actually more a mathematical exercise than anything in that it's pure crisis management. Each decision you make will maintain or improve certain aspects of the scenario while others decline (ex. using actions to go hunting for food may provide meals, at the expense of preparing camp for the night to fend off wolves or to make a fire to stay warm), and the player must manage each of them to the best of their ability in order to keep everyone alive.   Gods Will Be Watching gets a thumbs up from me just because it's something different and it executes its idea well, though is basically just a mathematical exercise with story laced into it.

I just completed my first playthrough. I chose 'Puzzle' (the harder of the two puzzle modes). The Puzzle modes remove the randomness that some players complained about. I felt very satisfied on solving each level and knew how/why I failed when I did (most missions I failed at least 2-3 times first). Be sure to read the conversation tips on each level before starting. There is a learning curve to climb, which is necessary for having fun because of the challenge.  ...unless you're just there for the novelty. And why would you be? There are plenty of flashy, story heavy games if that's what you want. If you want to explore and get a story, it's not your game.  Try the demo first. Personally I thought the game was great. There are several well-tuned and original puzzles to solve, smartly tugging on your emotions because (pixel) lives are in the balance. Took me about 8 hours to play through them blind the first time.

The game features point and click gameplay where your goal of each chapter is to usually survive under harsh conditions with limited resources. It's all about efficient time and resource management, with hazards and dangers thrown in to cause hiccups in your plans. An enjoyment of micro-management is somewhat key, which can discourage some players. The game puts a focus on making hard decisions such as sacrificing lives for the sake of others (i.e. cannibalism of friends and hostage control and such). However, you are never 'penalized' for decisions and losses made in the game, which has upset people in the past, you may see sacrificed characters in later chapters.   The reasons for this are actually story-based, which is slyly explained in the later chapters. It's just far from obvious.   It's up to the player to gauge their satisfation with their performance if they believed certain sacrifices weren't necessary.  The story invokes sci-fi and   time-travel   themes that really get your noggin pondering. I was certainly a bit bewildered and amazed my first playthrough.  Oh also, the music and art (in-game and unlockable) is amazing. Ch. 3 is practically my favorite in every way. I still replay it here and there.",

            "review_text": "So a lot of people have been giving this game some negative reviews for various reasons ranging from `Too hard` to `Bad story` to `Nothing you do matters` etc. Most of these reviews are in my opinion just people complaining without having enough information so how about this; I will go through the Most Useful complaints and most common complaints and comment on them.  `The game is not focused on story/Has a bad story`  This I can say is probably being said by those who aren`t really into reading dialogue. Not trying to insult them and I am sure there are many exceptions, but as someone who has completed the game I can safely say that the story is very very good, not going to spoil it though.  `Game is unfairly diffcult/ No checkpoints/ Unfair RNG` The game is hard, very hard. It involves a lot of thinking through your moves and planning ahead. One slip up could cost you the round. I wouldn`t however call it unfair. Every failure is your own fault, YOU took an unneccesary risk, YOU didn`t prioritize, even with the presence of an RNG everything is your fault. The game lays out all the mechanics of the puzzle from the beginning and if you pay attention you will know exactly how things work from the moment the puzzle starts. You will probably miss something admittedly, your (probably) human, and there are some things you will just have to test to confirm your suspicions on a mechanic. Concerning the RNG you will probably be fine as long as you don`t try your luck to much. 60% is a magical number separating success and failure in my experience. Having played numerous X-Com originals and remakes I can say that the RNG is fair enough. No checkpoints? Play one of the puzzles and you will realise how much that would break the game. It removes all suspense and worry about your choices.  Well this review is getting a bit long I will try and wrap it up quickly.  `Choice doesn`t matter/Dead characters magically reappear` Every choice you make influences something. Though as in every game with choice there are only so many ways it can end seeing someone die then come back is, creepy. You may say 'Well that is dumb that someone who dies comes back, that mean there are no concequences!' I can understand that on the surface this seems dumb and when I heard this for the first time I was concerned on the quality of game if it did this. Then my team was decimated on chapter 4. Only a few of us survived, then I saw them at the briefing at the beginning of the next chapter and they were... warped. Quote from the main character 'Why do I feel like they already died. I need a vacation' Things start to make more sense as to why people die but `live` as you go on.   So I think that is a good place to stop concerning what I thought were some of the most supported damning ideas about this game. I would so much call this a review as a mass response to real reviews. I think this game is awesome though I can understand it not being for everyone, I suggest looking at someone playing Chapter One to get a feel for what the game really is before putting money down. Chapter One doesn`t have a TON of story so it shouldn`t spoil much. Northern Lion`s first episode on this game represents it well and he fails so it won`t tell you how to complete the puzzle. I reccomend starting there unless you know of someone else to watch.  Questions? Concerns? Complaints about this not actually being a review and me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blind fanboy? Comment on it. I am new to presenting ideas like this or reviewing in general so I could use the feedback.",

            "review_text": "The Metacritic score for this game is extremely misleading and may cause some users to miss out on what is perhaps the most visceral game I have played this year.  Learning to appreciate Gods Will Be Watching means overcoming some barriers. The first such barrier will inevitably be the graphics. For someone such as myself who was raised on sprite based games this retro graphic style is part of the allure but I know for others (such as my child) the gut reaction is 'the graphics of that game suck!' What you, the skeptical buyer needs to understand is that the graphics of this game are an aestetic and artistic choice. Yes, this game could easily have been created utilizing modern 3d graphics and it probably would have still been fun. The graphic style complements the entire game themetic: do more with less. The entire game you struggle to do as much as you can with extremely limited resources. This theme can be read as the theme of the game in general, the game designers endeavoured to accomplish as much as they could with as little as possible. We will return to this argument later.  Related to this first barrier is the second obstacle the player must overcome: one of the most steep and unforgiving learning curves of any game I have played in perhaps a decade. In a way this difficulty is appropriating the difficulty of older sprite based games before the invention of quicksaves and quickloads. Not all of the complaints of the difficulty are without merit though. I found the pacing of this difficulty somewhat random. Instead of starting off difficult and ending up super difficult, near impossible levels are followed by relative walks-in-the-parks. I think some better planning in this regard by the developers could have lead to a better recepection of the game. That said, I think the difficulty of the game, like the sprite-based graphics is an artistic choice. Ostensibly it is a love-letter to mind-blowingly difficult rogue-like games of yesteryear. It is important to understand though that the difficulty of the game is supposed to be a mirror of the morally difficult situations you find yourself in in each level. The threat of making a bad decision is made more visceral when you understand that you may be very close to having wasted nearly an hour of your time for nothing.  If, you are willing to perservere past these barriers, an extremely rich and rewarding experience awaits. The game draws inspiration from such varied sources as Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, the film Edge of Tomorrow, The Dark Tower series, as well as the entire encyclopedia of Science-Fiction tropes. The two things this game does better than many others out there is tension and meta-gaming comentary.  I'll try to keep this spoiler free but I must give kudos to the developers for showing how flat sprites can build tension. In one level a torturer decides which device he is going to use that day. His blocky sprite hands moves slowly from potential weapon to potential weapon and though you cannot really make out anything, you can envision it. Even the way he slowly takes a sprite based drag from his sprite based cigarette builds a whole much greater than its constituent parts. Ultimately, this game wags a shaming finger at AAA games who have access to million dollar CGI video and high end 3d graphics but who produce products empty and soul-less.  As I mentioned before this game seems to be speaking not only to its industry but to those who consume it. The main characters name is 'Burden' connoting not only his in-game responsibility but also how he functions as a work-horse for you, the player. The character of Burden slowly becomes aware that there is something awry in his decision making process and that problem is *you*, the player. The titular 'watching gods' are not some fictional deities, but you, the player meddling and interferring in the gaming world. The game asks the player to not be a detached meddling god but to invest in the characters emotionally. The game provides a compelling world (via excellent sound, story, and yes, graphics) and asks you to simply try.  And based upon the metacritic score, many players seem unwilling to do so. They would rather quickload up their quicksave and blow the heads off of people wearing turbans and then teabag them with special American flag boxers they purchased as a DLC. The developers of this game have recognized a sort of illness in this industry and like Burden and his cohorts have attempted to make a remedy for it. Ultimately, the choice of whether to take that cure (and purchase this game) is yours.  Choose wisely.",

Pros: •Very atmospheric and beautiful pixel art, a good example is the desert/canyon level. •You go to a variety of places, doing a variety of tasks. No two levels are similar. •Choices for easier difficulties, though discouraged. They even added a choice to remove all random elements, in response to complaints. •When they say difficult decisions they mean it, they hold up on that part. •Shows a neat little graph-like thing of all the decisions you made, and what percent of other players made those decisions.  Important Notes: •The game does not save to the steam cloud; I played half the game when I stayed at my cousin's house for the week, and when I got home none of it was uploaded. This may have changed, if its important to you, look a little more into it. •The game occasionally makes you take out a pen and a sheet of paper, which in my opinion made it a little more interesting, but some may not like that. •The second level is a level about choosing how you receive torture. This level is one of the hardest, and truly affected me for about half an hour after each session of trying to beat it. Very dark stuff.  Cons: •If a crew member dies in one mission, they magically reappear in the next. I understand why, but they could have come up with some stupid excuse other than just *BAM* he's back and was never gone. •Can get somewhat tedious, often you get into a cycle of doing the same exact things. •Crashed once for me, erased some of my progress.  6/10: For all that it is and however hard it tried, wasn't as gripping as some other games. It does supply what it advertises.",

It's an experiment into making the player uncomfortable and trying to mirror what it would be like to go through these situations, in a much similar fashion to a game like Papers, Please. It falls often, but it's notable how hard it tries. Sometimes the intention is bright enough to make it something you have to play and then think about to understand. It isn't a 'fun' game, it's actually quite a stressful game, to the point where at times I simply wanted to stop playing, but I believe this sensation is exactly what the developers wanted to convey when they made the game, and even recommend playing it in all it's intense difficult glory. It's a strange game, but if, and only if, something that's more experimental and out of your comfort zone sounds like something interesting to you, by all means, it's worth a shot.

It's difficult, but the best way I can say this game, is that I have a 'Love Hate' relationship with it. I've played very little of it, but every minute i definitely enjoyed. Its a puzzle solver. A very brutal one. Essentially, your tasked to do some absurd task which you will only make by the skin of your teeth, after several failures. I also believe i see right through to the concept, or the build, of the game. Really, your pushing yourself to play the engrueling tasks for more story. So far, the little sliver I've already seen, makes me want to see more, Which is exactly what they want. They've done well with the intrigue aspect atleast.  The problem for me is, I'm not to big on the super hard, perfection run, type, when it comes to games. I don't mind them, but I really love story focused games. That's my problem. I don't really wish to play the game so much, just want to see the story. Also, the graphics are fairly funky, and when people walk, it looks like they have tentacles for legs.  I have had a bit of a masochist laugh moment, which i thought was fairly funny, however, this paragraph will contain spoilers, so skip it if you don't want any. At the second chapter, i think. The one where you get totured. I was at the scene, where the sgt was on the wall getting stretched. I ♥♥♥♥ed around abit, one thing led to another, and then he kinda just, Popped and ripped in half. Holy ♥♥♥♥ I didn't expect that. But then, I noticed that the soldier is yelling at him, hoping he'd respond, While his friend, was dead, in two pieces, while the soldier was watching. Yeah, abit wierd. Also that's what stopped me from playing the game. Because I failed, I had to replay a solid 10 minutes of gameplay. Right from the beginning of the second chapter. damn thats brutal.  So, since I have very little time on this game, I don't particularly have much to say. But I don't think that there much more i need to see to justify this game, other than the story, which I shouldn't spoil anyway. It's a brutal point and click. It's dark, gory and very clever. I do think for anyone who likes super evil games, may like this, since this is a little brutal, a little story and a lot of death. Have Fun!  6.5/10",

The game feels so rewarding after you finished it and outweights the frustration you get when you failed in a chapter a lot. I won't tell anymore about this game because I want to avoid spoilers but if you got a high tolerance limit and you are sure that you will clear all 7 chapters it is worth a buy.

I feel that maybe people were offput, thinking it a similar game to Superbrothers' Sword and Sworcery (another phenomenal game I highly recommend), but it is not a simple game like that was; you must manage everything on screen, or failure WILL occur. Once again, I feel this is actually a strong plus, going in the vein that your choices ultimately culminate, for ill or good. Another thing I can see rubbing people the wrong way is that the game gives you zero insight into what to do. It does not tell you what to do with hostages, how they're doing, etc. You have to watch their demeanor, their way of speaking and tone of voice, etc. Once again, this is not an easy game by any means, but It does make you think if you are making the correct decisions, and whether you could have done something different. Granted, I have only passed the first chapter as of this writing (after changing it to easy, admittedly), but so far I am eager to see what else happens.",

What it sets out to do is present a series of resource-management challenges that encourage thinking and - in a pinch - creativity.

Your success in this game will be earned, my friend, or you won't get to taste it at all. Believe me, though, success in this game tastes delicious. Delicious.  Rewards for advancing through the levels include experiencing more of the very-well-done story, pieces of concept art, and alternate music for the stages. I found (and am still finding) that just seeing what happens next is reason enough to keep driving forward. Feeling like an absolute boss when clearing a stage helps as well.  There are some parts within the scenarios where choosing the wisest course of action comes with a percentage of success. In all cases but one, this percentage can be boosted up to 100 before being used, if one is playing well enough. One fibbly gripe I have with the game is the one situation I've encountered where you can't perfectly ensure success (there is a 1 in 7 chance of failure at best), and I was unlucky twice in a row. Pretty mean trick there, but honestly, playing the level 12 times instead of 10 or 11 isn't the end of the world.  Engaging story, a mighty fine soundtrack, and the game is very pretty - these things add to the fantastic feeling of accomplishment when you beat something, and the interesting story rounds out a fun, unique video game.

Even the newest negative review looks like the person played it a long time ago - maybe prior to the Mercy Update? - and didn't write the review until now, for whatever reason.

WHY, GOD! WHYEEE?!!' mode all the way to 'Okay, so if I do something obviously stupid I may need to redo this section once more and/or my 27lb cat landed on my keyboard and chose 'Down' at that crucial moment-part, 'Damnit!'' mode. Actually the latter mode is the one I first tried this game on - because I was scurred by all the prior naysay reviewers BUT still didn't want to play the easiest mode. There is actually a mode that is called like 'cinematic' mode or something of the sort that is supposed to be basically you + the game = interactive story time.

It has a variety of challenge levels. It's not expensive. A small team handcrafted this game. If that sounds cool - TRY IT! Worst case scenario: You will be doing your part to support indie game-making. Best case scenario: You will really enjoy this little game.   Bottom line: If you like indies, and the video/screenshot previews look interesting to you, then what have you got to lose? $5-10? I'm sure you have done far worse at least 8,372 times already.",

            "review_text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this game mostly for the gameplay, which is largely about picking up on visual cues and making good use of the data the game provides in each of the seven or so scenarios. A lot of people call this a 'survival' game but to me it's much more of a puzzle/strategy title. In any case, if you're a fan of deduction and solving logical problems, you'll probably end up enjoying it. The themes are pretty dark and the narrative dialogue between the characters is often plodding and cumbersone (especially when you end up playing through the same parts of the game repeatedly trying to solve the puzzles) but overall I like what this game does and how it does it. Some may find the violence and trial-and-error gameplay elements off-putting but they both fit the story being told and serve to give the player some interesting choices and consequences to face. I paid $2.50 for the game during a Steam sale and it was definitely worth that much. Id've even been happy paying $5 for it but the normal $10 price is a bit too high for what the game is in my opinion.",

            "review_text": "I generally despise games that are so harsh that you have to play it over and over and over and over. But with this game, the 'unforgiving' nature of it is actually pretty great. Why? It's done *correctly*, unlike most games. Most 'unforgiving' games just make you die, repeat, die repeat, with nothing new to show for it. They think the challenge is in 'barely making it' when all they are doing is driving away all the people who enjoy progression more than repetition and/or regression.  For this game, its brutal nature is all a part of the experience, and as such, it's a part of the fun. When you fail a chapter, sure... you have to start from the very beginning of that chapter. However, the dialog is not always the exact same every time, nor are the specifcs of certain scenarios. It's similar to the recent GTA games, where dialog changes slightly when restarting a mission. For the most part, the 'major'/'skeletal' aspects of things stay the same. But see, the fun lies within trying to see what will and what won't work in the minor aspects of a chapter.  Without spoiling anything, yes, there are moments based more in chance than in smarts, but again, in the right mindset, that's what makes it fun. Not only are these moments few and far between (in my experiences so far), but they are precisely what make these moments so tense, so much more risky. I can't really say more about that specific part without spoiling it, but let's just say that if you had a checkpoint right before it, it wouldn't have nearly as much intensity as it has without one. And the genius thing about it in this game's formula, is that it directly affects your decision making process, and in some instances, those decisions have lasting impact.  Think of each chapter as a very long, individual, 'floating' point &amp; click puzzle. I use the term 'floating' because it's not a straight up puzzle. It has a puzzle-like strategy to it, in that you must remember what does and doesn't work in certain parts of the chapters, but you also have the freedom to go about it in various ways.  The difference is that not everything is exactly the same in each playthrough of a chapter. Mostly just minor things, but those changes keep things feeling fresh and unpredictable -- and therefore, more intense. Again, hard to explain without spoiling anything, but like I said before, if you had save points before all of the tough stuff, you'd just fail/reload/fail/reload/fail/reload until you got it, and then you'd just blaze right through the game. And those moments wouldn't feel nearly as intense. If all you want is story, that's cool, and I could see why that is all you want. It even let's you choose that path if that's what you prefer, by choosing the 'original-light' mode at the start.  Anyway, to reiterate, I usually hate games that are 'rinse/repeat/rinse/repeat'y like this... so if you are like that too, just trust me. I think you'd really like this game if you got in the right mindset, first :)",

The thing is, somehow, i raged because it was too hard, i had trouble passing the first level and i passed it because there was a glitch, the second one was kind of easy and then i got stuck in the third level for too long. This game is a pain when it comes to challenge because it's so damn ridiculous to handle all the people all the time at once ! This is all about gestion, you got a crew, you got a thing to do, you got to survive, no matter what. And this part is tricky, because you can sacrifice others to move on, but it can also stop you in your next mission. Its so hard because you always have to check everything and even by doing that, some actions will end up provoquing the things you try so damn hard to avoid. A stupid hostage that you have been talking to 3 times in a row so he calms down only that another one jumps on you. But, theres a but, the game is magnificent in some ways. First of all, its a MacPixel like graphism, without the scatology ideas, you're not here to play around, the story is serious and dont think you can just kill everybody because you feel like it, otherwise you'll just end up stuck. The world of thisgame is very axed on the Science fiction, and i love this kind of game, it was really a nice game on that matter. Finaly the story will put you on the line to choose, between your humanity and freedom, and thats nice.

Now, this game has major, considerable flaws:     The choices in the game  don't  matter. If you kill a friendly character, he/she comes back alive in the next chapter because else you wouldn't progress in the game (even though they're 'dead.')    The tasks ordered to do are very tedious, and sometimes boring. Most chapters are basically management of other characters and if you fail, you restart all over again.    This game is pure PRD (Pseudo-Random Distribution.) You can fail genuinely because of percentages. If you're a gambler Original mode is for you, but not even Puzzle mode saves you sometimes from the PRD it has, so... Good luck!    'Puzzles' are not hard (and hence, the game is not long.) They're just insanely difficult (and relies in luck to do so,) and made up so you need to restart and pray to the gods the PRD is merciful the next time you repeat. The worst offender is Chapter 5.   I'm aware this game was supposed to be very hard from start to finish, and I did enjoy the challenge, it was just tedious to do it over and over again. The chapters are really not worth retrying for the extra stuff and you lose your emotional link with the characters very quick after doing it again and again (and after figuring out they 'revive' in the next chapters), and even though this game is reviewed and seen by some other people that it's a 'adventure' game, it is not. It is a point-and-click management resource game at its best.  However, there's also a good share of what I liked about the game, and some of them were said earlier.    It has a very good atmosphere with great music and backgrounds along with neat sound effects.    The pixel graphics are done here splendidly and I genuinely enjoyed the cutscenes.    Chapters like the 2nd, the 6th and the 7th were really good. I will let you figure out why (or not.)    The story, even though short, it's pretty neat.    The gore is also really good here for a pixel game.    It has a lot of difficulty settings suited for your liking. Don't want to play the game? Play Narrative mode. Do you find the challenge hard? Play Original Light. However, Puzzle Mode doesn't remove all the PRD...   Even though there's a lot of good things about the game, the bad things overwhelm the good ones, and it's not a game I would recommend.

For example: First Scenario has you managing hostages: keep them too relax or nervous and they will try to escape or attack your team Maganing a hack: you have to keep a security bar at the highest or risk a system shutdown while trying to get a hack boost bar at it highest. Keeping a swat team away from the doors of the office your team is barricaded in. Your team might panic and you will need to calm them down  If you fail, lose all hostages, swat team attacks, you get attacked and die or your team panic, you will restart the whole scenario. And everytime you restart the scenario you will be having the same conversation with the hostages, the swat and your team. Plus the scenarios can have random factors in it, kicking a hostage might make the other 3 nervous in this playthrough.... or not. It gets repetitive and stale pretty fast.  Gets so stale that when you get the stat screen, showing the % of what other did in that scenario, you really dont much care since you did whatever it took to get out of that level and just move on with the story.

What you are promised/expecting:  A point-and-click adventure game, filled with moral dilemmas, something that will make you 'feel bad' - as PC Gamer says in the little blurb given on Steam. This sounds fun, it sounds like a game that has a solid story, and very interesting psychological/ethical questions accompanying it.   What you get:  Perhaps the only quote that is really accurate is 'There's no good or evil, just decisions, with only you and the gods as a judge to your actions.' While this quote was probably meant to make the reader think 'I'll be in such dire situations that any action can be justified!' What it comes to mean is that the game is a monotonous disaster, and none of your choices are really evil or good, by the end of the game you're going through the motions. The game is comprised of several ball-breaking puzzles, and there is certainly some incentive to make moral decisions at first. However, it quickly becomes clear that there are very few options, by the end you don't care if you're shooting the civilian, or calming them, it's whatever you have to do to get to the next level. Why? Because you've seen all of this dialogue and these situations over and over again. The game is at its worst when you are killed half a dozen times, and you have to read through the same dialogue time and time again.    I myself played through one level, and part of the second. The dialogue wasn't particularly engaging, and the story was a bit dull. The dialogue sometimes feels very bland, or immature. The characters are not very believable, and having people tell you game mechanics in character destroys any immersion. I've had a hard time picking this game up again, and it'll probably sit unplayed in my library. One of the biggest disappointments I've come across in a long time.",

What I've seen of the story gets a 9, what I've played gets a 4. I'm not even mad.",

A cool point click adventure that payed respects to the old school art and stylization with some more of the complexity of the newer adventure titles (multiple endings, persistent consiquences, etc) however this game plays like Space Ace's evil twin.....   The entire game is about making decisions in a certain order with no CLUE as to what order would be best. On top of that you must pick the correct order in a certain time limit OR restart the whole level again. Playing Simon BLIND would be less difficult and 3x more enjoyable then this game.....  Avoid unless excessively masochistic....",

What annoyed me is that the role of randomness is tremendous. The puzzles and tasks you are presented with are rather simple, and it is quite easy to figure out how to solve them. However the game is made insanely 'difficult' because of the conditions you need to meet, and this difficulty is established through rolling the dice, often making the experience extremely frustrating and unfair.  Also, each level is independent of each other, meaning even if a vital character dies in an earlier episode, he or she will return as if nothing happened. Overall the player has little control over what happens in the total story.  6/10 I'm not going to say this game is downright bad, but may dissapoint you depending on what you expect.",

            "review_text": "Unbelievably tedious and boring.  I have to admit, the atmosphere of this game is spot on. It does a good job of making you feel like you're under pressure and like every choice matters.  Unfortunately, that wears off after your first attempt at a level.  In Gods Will Be Watching, you're put into all kinds of bad situations, such as a hostage situation where you'll have to control all of the hostages and hack into a system to steal information while keeping the authorities at bay. You get all kinds of moral dilemmas, like your crewmembers breaking down mid-mission, forcing you to try and stabilize them emotionally, to hostages becoming panicked and making a suicidal dash for the door.  The only problem is the game's difficulty and repetitiveness. The game prides itself on being unforgivable and difficult, but that becomes the biggest flaw. Every time you fail, you'll have to start over from the very beginning, even if that reverts 10 minutes of progress. Every single time you die, you'll be forced to play the same part again, which will take another 5 or 10 minutes.  You've already gone through this situation before, though. The emotion and tension has worn off, so now it's just you clicking buttons and hoping that the game looks favorably upon you. And if you press the wrong button? Why, say goodbye to the last 10 minutes of progress you made. A hostage is freaking out while the authorities are getting closer? Well, there's no split-second moral decisions to be made now. You already know exactly what buttons to press in order to solve this dilemma, and any emotion or atmosphere the game tries to immerse you with is gone, because you know that you'll be going through this exact same situation again in about 10 minutes, after the RNG decides that you've ♥♥♥♥ed up.  Seriously, this game has an interesting atmosphere and story already, but I couldn't be bothered to finish it. Even on the easiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficulty, it's just so mind-numbingly boring. I'd like to experience the story, but I'm hardly gonna pay attention to it when I'm bored out of my mind. It's essentially a meter-management simulator with a good story thrown around it. It's like a conversation with another character in a game. You speak with them and decide what you want to say, but if you say the wrong thing, you're forced back to the beginning. After that, you're just going through the same conversation you've already heard. You already know what to say up until the point when you ♥♥♥♥ed up, so now you're just waiting for the dialogue to finish so you can try again.  In summary: Gameplay is solid enough, atmosphere is pretty good. Lack of saves and extreme difficulty lead to extremely tedious repetitiveness, which makes the game pretty much unbearable for me.  I wanted to like this game, but no. Definitely not recommended.  Oh, yeah. I should also add that the game runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥. It somehow uses more RAM than next-gen triple A games. I find that the framerate dropped constantly and there was a load of stuttering, even though it's just a little bit of pixel art. And then alt-tabbing. It took me about five minutes to recover after I alt-tabbed from this game and put my PC to sleep. Not well optimized at all.",
