            "review_text": "Light version of the MotorStorm games (PlayStation). Other similar games: Fuel, Pure, MX vs. ATV, ATV Offroad Fury, FlatOut, Dirt.  The good: - Good/OK graphics, sound and music. - Smooth and arcadish racing with good UI and no sluggish handling. - No irritating learning curve or deep intro/menu/loading. Only good racing. - SP, split screen and MP with great maps and different modes. - A lot of different cars with each their different handling. - Car tuning. - Steam achievements. - Some replay value: just for the fun of it, or for trying to get gold medals.  The bad: - Maps and overall racing could have been more immersive like fx. MotorStorm Apocalypse. - Car damage could have been better. - Car tuning is very simple. - Dead MP. - Replay value is not huge. - No Steam trading cards.  If you are lucky like me, you'll get it on sale or in a bundle.  The review is written considering paying full price for the game,  and not taking into account the MP is dead.  Recommended. 7,5/10.",

            "review_text": "This is a great game. It captures the essence of the original Insane, and I would say it improves in every way.  Pros: • Diversity in game modes. • Good car handling. • Enough vehicles to suit your driving style. • 'Shiny' graphics • Good difficulty • A genuine good, solid game • Local split-screen.  Cons: • Some of the game modes may cause aggravation further into the game, but not unfairly. Practice makes perfect. • Sometimes it seems like it's impossible to catch up to the lead car, but again, the more you play, the better you get. • Even though there are a selection of cars, you may only find yourself using 4 or so different ones to be in to win. • Multiplayer appears dead.  I think a reasonable playthrough could be done in just over 10 hours. I spent a twice that getting 100% in career and unlocking more cars, so 15hrs is possible without overstaying too much.  Highly recommended, and it's on sale atm on another site. (You can't beat this for $1)",

The maps offer a vast and open world with stunning visuals. Not only can you do classic off-roading, but other game modes like Greed and Capture the Flag. What's really great about this is that each of these gamemodes work for each and every map, so you don't have to worry about compatibility. The UI and multiplayer system is very responsive and I have had no further problems with the game. More fun with friends.",

            "review_text": "It is a competent racing game. The graphics are pretty good and it controls well, and sounds are good. However it just does not hold a torch to a far superior game like Dirt 3 or Grid 2. It is tied with Shoot Many Robots for having the most mind bendingly generic awful rock music that makes me want to tear my ears off and throw them in a piranha tank, but I suppose that can be fixed at my own disposal by turning off in-game music (which hopefully it allows) and playing my own tunes in Windows media player. The worst complaint I have about the game is that even if you run a perfect race you usually still only finish first ahead of the second place car by a few seconds or less.  If you want the best off-road racing game, buy Dirt 3. If you want the best track racing game, buy Grid 2 or NFS Shift. Still, this game is definitely fun and I only paid a dollar for it on sale and that was a steal for a game that is a 7/10,",

Unfortunately only supports xBox control pad and keyboard, if you don't have an xBox control pad split-screen mutliplayer is locked out.

It looks awesome at HD resolutions and delivers the fantastic gameplay we all remember from the first game. This has a few new game modes the original didn't have which adds to the gameplay a fair bit. A good mix of vehicles and upgrades also. Works great with the controller with the default configuration being ideal.  My only complaint is not being able to find anyone online with the multiplayer option. Very confused there aren't tons of people playing this online as the type of gameplay modes this game has lend themselves perfectly to a ton of multiplayer fun. The single player game is awesome though and will keep you occupied for a good length of time, with you also coming back for more time and time again due to it being a great racing game.  Highly recommended if the multiplayer online isn't overly important to you.",
