            "review_text": "Just a short review, which I have to write, so I can recommend this game (and I will post the same review at Avernum 4, 5 and 6 pages).  After finishing the second Avernum trilogy (4, 5 and 6) I can honestly say, this was one of the most rewarding roleplaying experience I had in a long time. I played a lot of rpg titles, from classics like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima 7 and Infinity Engine games to newest games like Skyrim, Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and although Avernum does not have fancy graphics, I still think this series is one of the best rpgs ever.  Avernum has great setting and story, great playability, decent length (about 100 hours) and many sidequests and secrets. Leveling up system is balanced and nowadays almost forgotten turn-based combat is a welcomed change from flashy action oriented battle systems. An old-school rpg which proves, that doesn't need 'ultra high detailed' graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. Highly recommended.",
