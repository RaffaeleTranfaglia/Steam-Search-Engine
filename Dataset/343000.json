I loved this game back when I got it on a CD from a bargain bin and thought it would be nice to have it on my Steam library. A big mistake. There is no Steam support for this game whatsoever. DO NOT BUY. No. Don't do it. It is not worth it. I do not know if the original CD would still work though, I might have to check that out. But Steam version is just broken beyond repair.",
