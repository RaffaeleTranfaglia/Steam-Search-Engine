The bad part is that’s all it is, references there is no substance no engaging story no real narrative or characters you care about.  The first 30 minutes of the game is a brutal slog of uninspired writing and weak character building, comparatively to other Telltale titles. The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales From The Borderlands, and Game of Thrones are all vastly superior in the quality of characters, writing, and player engagement.  To expand on characters here is a list...   The Pig   The Fat Guy   The Girl   The Cool Girl   The Tunnel Snakes   The Nice Tunnel Snake   Lee Everett  The characters are bland and are given no real distinct or likable traits, making them unmemorable (see list) and near pointless to the story other than bouncing dialog off of.  I purchased this game assuming that it would have the same quality that Telltale always delivers, but it did not. I have refunded my copy and a copy I gifted to a friend (On his request because its controls were broken). Hopefully this is not a sign that all future Telltale titles will become uninspired cash grabs but only time will tell.",

I've gotten word that he already labors in a mine, getting the black lung. Started a family all his own. Never returns my calls.

Is great if you want a story, but outcome is very restricted whether you mess up or not. I like the game, however the choices lack depth and allow you to go through with random choices, without much punishment. For a game based on choices, I honestly feel disrespected as I consider myself a smart person, although I am treated as if I am not able to intellectually handle a concept based game.    5 USD an episode with a startup game cost of an additional 20 USD is just not worth it to me.    Upon further review, my knowledge of the price of the game was based on speculation and lack of research. The price is reasonable at 5 USD an episode flat. my review of everything else however doesn't change",

            "review_text": "I don't see why everyone is complaining so much about the DLC?  Yes - I understand that you paid for the core game itself but think about the way the episodes work. TellTale usually makes each episode of their game worth $5. Now judging from the price of the main game - It's $25. 5 chapters (episodes).   The DLC is $15 - 3 chapters (episodes)!  So by some of the bad reviews saying that it's like paying money then paying more just to see the rest of a movie, you're basically saying that buying Finding Nemo is good, but it's squeezing more money by making Finding Dory? It just doesn't make sense!  $5 per game chapter is just how TellTaleGames has worked with their current titles. Now let's observe Call of duty - And NO not the current time era in which it's ruined by it's futurism... but when it was good. Like um.. - Call of Duty Black Ops 1. They had DLCs for it's zombies storyline, and no one. And I mean NO ONE complained about that. Why complain to pay some extra money for a game DLC that adds onto a storyline.   Before I end this review, let's take a look at why people rate this product as bad if they dislike that you have to PAY for the DLC? If this product here is recommended then yes - Recommend it! Don't stop yourself from doing that if you 'Love' the game then hate the DLC. That's just obscure and it disappoints me!",

As I played the game, I was enticed with its story.  Many emotions were even evoked as I played it. Now revisiting the game expecting to have a great time playing another episode is crushed. Why should I have to spend another $15 to a game that I had already purchased? Some people may beg to say that it is because that is how DLC works. The people who say this aren't wrong. DLC is supposed to add to the game, and giving three more episodes is indeed doing so. My problem is that Episode Five lead up to this DLC, presenting a cliffhanger that I need to BUY to experience. This was a bad part on Telltale games. It's just as bad as the clickbait that the alleged Youtubers in the game use. (Take that last sentence lightly, no offense to the Youtubers that are in the game. Congratulations for being the select few that made it.)  In short, If anyone reading this review plans on buying this game, I would recommend waiting until it becomes a Box Set, or a finished product where you will get the whole game for a fixed price.",

I am a Minecraft fan so the concept and trailers were appealing to me, and I picked it up on sale figuring it would be a decent buy.  The game is not at all what I was expecting. Interaction is minimal, I would hardly even call it a game. There's no skill involved, other than pressing arrow keys at correct times when it flashes on your screen. Most of the choices for the player come in the form of dialogue options, but none seem to have much of an impact on the game. The only significant story impacting choice I've found is choosing which hero to rescue at the end of Chapter 1. When you actually get to control your character's movement, its rather pointless, as there's only one path to go on 90% of the time anyways. The combat in the game is extremely dull, The game feels a bit short too, took me 5 hours for a playthrough of the current four episodes.   If this is what all Telltale games are like, then to each their own, but personally, I'd recommend just watching someone else do a playthrough if you want to see the story rather than spending your own money on it.",

I launch the game and ' Purchase the Episode 6 '. Ok, buying DLC when the story IS NOT EVEN COMPLETE. And I see the price. 15 bucks EACH episode. Uh, ok you know what ? Go reduce your prices and then jump from the mount Lesquin. The fanboys / fangirls will say 'thEr iZ YTB In diS EPisOd' , yes but they had to think before to pay them to be in this game and now they want to recover this money by making an expensive cost of the episodes. I've already spent 25 euro and then, if I want the complete story, I have to spent 45 euros more ? I don't have 70 euros to spend like that. This ridiculous.

I did not know what to expect but I could see good potential in the concept. Unfortunately it became a terrible disappointment pretty much from the first minute.  The plots are stupid, the conversations are boring. Overall the complexity of the story can make anyone above the age of 10 do self-harm after a couple of minutes. The whole flow of the game (interactive movie?) is painfully slow.  On the rare occasions when your character gets some freedom to act and not just talk crap you realise that the controls are horrible and the world is very linear. Otherwise it's just all talking and selecting your response in a timely manner. The later kills whatever immersion you may (not) have as you need to focus on picking your answer before the time is up, while the others are still talking. Speaking of which, dialog choices detemine the storyline and add dynamism to the gameplay. I can see how that could work, pity I can't force myself to replay the choices just to get a slightly different dumb version of the dialogs.  Not sure what's the intention with this product. It's not a good game as there's pretty much nothing to do in it. Action scenes require the pressing/smashing of one of the 5 control keys within given time. Not that too much action would be required, it's more about not missing those random moments - which again breaks immersion. Fights look awkward and unrealistic even in the standards of Minecraft.  It's not a good movie cause the lack of real plots and twists, at least ones that would get the attention of a 5th-grader or higher. Dialogs are poor and cheesy and everything's happening very slow. Could be al-right for kids, but the age range who could enjoy it the most may require parental guidance during some scenes.  It does not have stunning visuals... hey, it's Minecraft at its basics after all. And it does not have stunning acting either...  Overall it's some good money wasted with regrets in hindsight.",

The storyline is a bit more lighthearted than that of The Walking Dead games, too, but that's to be expected, since it's obviously a game about Minecraft. Again, this does in no way mean the story isn't compelling, since there are still interesting choices to be made and interesting characters to be met, but if you're someone who's looking for something dark and grim, this game might not be for you. The five episodes this game consists of (so far) are roughly of average length from what I can tell; at least it doesn't feel like the storyline is rushed at any given point, which is good.   In short:  Typical TellTale game, only a bit more lighthearted, though it still manages to have an intriguing storyline.

Telltale completly left out everything non-linear and because of this I rate this game:  3/5 for story 0/5 for gameplay 1/5 for graphics  Don't get me wrong the idea is good, many games have succeeded using movie aspects to build a great game but the execution of actual gameplay must be present, and Telltale games failed to provide even a sliver of imersion into the game.",

I have watched my son play and he enjoys it very much.  Left-handers and Europeans beware. The keys cannot be remapped. They use WASD keys for movement and cannot be changed. There are other workarounds, such as downloading third-party apps to remap your keys (if you willing to go that extra step).  I would give this game a high rating, if I could play it. However, I feel that the design of the program could have easily included left-handers, Europeans, and others with disabilities. I feel that this is a software developers oversight and for me makes the game unplayable. So in rating this game, I am factoring in how much I enjoy playing.

It is probably more of a children's game than a dark, gritty tale of darkness and grittiness, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a bland, overly-heartwarming pile of cute little bunny rabbits and the Power of Friendship. There are dark moments, even the deaths of a major character or two, as well as a couple of jokes only older players are likely to understand.  The gameplay is pretty simple, more like an interactive film than most games. I should point out that it's not at all like playing Minecraft. You can't freely place and break blocks, nor do much in the way of actual mining and crafting. Occasional quick-time events keep the player on their toes; these are pretty challenging, but you can generally try again if you fail something important.  The game has plenty of feminism, too; competent women who wear sensible clothes and take an active role in fighting the antagonists are everywhere. Gameplay is completely unaffected by the player character's sex and skin colour.  That's not to say the game is without flaws. Gameplay sometimes consists of a long string of cutscenes, which, if you prefer a fast-paced action game, will likely bore you to tears. The choices you make don't have that big an effect on how the story pans out; there is definitely some effect, but however you play the game, the same overarching events are guaranteed to happen. Also, way the characters are animated can be a little uncanny.  All in all, Minecraft: Story Mode is a pretty good story game. It's not necessarily a brilliant, challenging action-adventure game, nor is it Telltale Games' finest work, nor is it like playing a Minecraft adventure map. Still, if you like the lore of Minecraft and have a decent sense of humour, you'll probably enjoy it.",

It wasnt too bad, but wasn't too special. You just basically an underdog, and your trying to win a competition. As first, due to choices you make, you can either win or lose, but due to certain events that happen later, it seems like it doesn't matter. I sometimes have problems with the audio slowing down to where it cuts off the characters dialouge before if finishes, and thats in both episodes thus far.  Episode 2 was bad. It was rushed out, and was even surprised it came out very early. I played it, and it seemed to take off into some sort of inrelevant tanget between the two heros bickering at each other, for what reasons I dont know. The ending to the episode is worse, because even though the villian knows he's doing wrong, he's just screwing around with the main protagionists to the point of hair tearing, banging against the wall madness.  Overall, I give it a No for technical difficulties and rushed out cashing in. Telltale's got 3 episodes left to change my mind about the game. I play regular minecraft on and off, so I'm not a fanboy or a devilish hater, just a neutral observer. And right now, this game ain't looking good.

In this game, it's not exactly Minecraft, where you can explore and build forevermore. That's great. I didn't sign up for a discount Minecraft. In this game, you watch the other characters interact and talk with you while you select what you want to say. At other times, you move around in a certain area, getting to select the people you wish to talk to, what ou want to interact with, or have to solve some semi-complicated puzzles. (Puzzles aren't that diffucult, but aren't so easy that you get bored with them) You have multiple quick-time event during the chat sessions in the 'story-mode' of the game, though the game gives you time to do them if you're caught off-guard and if you fail, sometimes you dont' die, other time you do but are only taken back a little so you don't have to restart upon death. (You don't really even die, it's like you went back in time)  Characters: *Places spoiler tag*  These characters are amazing. Here's the main group: Jesse, Lukas, Reuben (Formerly), Ivor (Tag-along), Petra, Axel, and Olivia. Lukas is just so likeable and lovable, it pains me in a jerk run to insult him because he tries to deny the fact you're being a jerk. Reuben the pig was an adorable little piggy that was yours and everything! Ivor was played as the villian in the beginning, but his motivs were revealed and now I don't want him gone. Petra is a warrior with a heart of gold or something. Axel is really strong and funny, and it's enjoyable to have him aroun.d. Olivia is Jesse's supportive friend though Jesse does often have to help her with inner problems. The people in this game seem so much like real people in personality, I stopped seeing them as digital images and when some of them died it hurt.  Overveiw:   This game has gotten complaints it's not a telltale game. Well, sorry, kid, but I wasn't looking for one in the first place! This is the only TellTale game I own, and my life isn't over or anything. I have Minecraft, if I wanna play it, I'll go there. This isn't a beg for money, it's something I'd always invest in for more. The Minecraft tag drew my attention, and research made me realize this was something more than Minecraft. It is truly Minecraft: Story Mode. A gamemode.  Episode reveiws:  1. Episode one did a good job introducing the conflict, getting your characters, and getting you attached to them.  2. This was less than amazing, but more than good. It ddi what it needed, but felt dragging and slow, with no action. However, I do find this episode worth going through and it's good enough for me to be fine for this.  3. This is my favorite episode. Awesome intro music, my favorite Lukas and Jesse moment, and SO much action i feel like this episode robbed the second of it's action!  4. Least favorite right here. It did the worst thing in video game history, and even though the problem is solved here, I find that what the episode did was too much for me to enjoy it. First time playing might be hard, but after a bit you find the will to plow through it.  5. This was a good episode! We go on another adventure as heroes, and find ourselves spiraling on an adventure we didn't expect! When we think it's all over... we get falcon punched by reality....  6. Youtubers. Nuff' said. I was so biased I couldn't accuse anybody. Accuse? I hear you call blindly. Ahhh yes, a crime has been commited! Somebody has been.... well... I'll let you find out. Then, it's off to who knows where on our new quest, for home.  7. This episode took 'scary' to a whole new level. Yes, even scarier than a murder. It plays with your emotions and puts you on guilt 24/7 the entire time. What's worse is that TellTale decides to throw everything they have at you in the final battle.",

A few more praises for this game is the music and the intros to every episode very awesome and very exciting. Now I won't say anything bad but the graphics aren't really good well, cause it's a mine craft game so yeah.  So the negatives first of all the major problem is that it kinda strays away from the concept of the actual mine craft game making it its on entirely different universe to the normal mine craft universe, this can be really unsettling for those who play mine craft and what it to be... Well... mine craft. The walking controls get a little bit confusing when your camera is on an angle and becomes very hard to control your movement.

None of the 'puzzles' required more than a second's thought and the amount of input from the player is minimal. The best thing about this game is seeing all the interesting architechture. I was glad to see that so far, there aren't nearly as many dialogue traps that are present in other Telltale games, such as characters acting irrationally after picking an innocent enough response (Walking Dead is super guilty of this). It does seem a little kid friendly, which is another departure from Telltale's usual works. I cannot honestly reccomend this game as it is right now for $25.

In fact, it is the complete opposite of Minecraft - rather than providing an open world for exploration, it is essentially a railroad of cutscenes that invites the 'player' to make an occasional click, with virtually no room for choice or deviation. I've played Telltale's Walking Dead games before, so I probably should have seen this coming, but even those games offered far more in terms of interaction. Patton Oswalt's voice acting is probably the best feature, but that's not saying much. I definitely get the vibe that this game is for children, so it may just be that I'm so far outside of the target audience (22 years old) that I wasn't meant to enjoy it.",

Familiar music, great storytelling and the ability to customize your character somewhat. I really enjoyed it overall. The Steam Summer Sale made this a great bargain.Outside of that I think what you pay for 5 episodes is too expensive.   So to recap, you can purchase the base game and get a completed story. It has good writing and an enjoyable pace. Episodes 6+ are another story. This is no different than the other types of games in this genre. If you've played these types of games before, you're well aware of the pay-per-model but also know that if you wait, you can pretty much get the base game plus extra scenarios for a pretty good price during any sale.  10/10 - Would play again",

Like Magnus had a problem that needs us. -Audio and Video bugs are sometimes annoying, can't even hear what they say   Great game by Telltale. 7/10 would pick Magnus' armour again",

This is a very kid-friendly title, which could have been expected. There really isn't much available in this game for adult players, in fact quite the opposite. In several places I found myself staring at the screen going, 'That doesn't happen in Minecraft'.  As a kid-friendly title you'll also find yourself actually doing very little in the way of 'playing' the game. Most of the time when you actually get to do something it's very linear. For example, exploring an outside area that uses invisible walls to keep you following the path through it. So you hold 'W' to walk through the area, and wait for the next part of the story to kick in. Either that or it'll give you a couple things to click on as an illusion that you're actually doing something. It was the same with 'crafting'. Your character would walk up to the crafting table through a story video and to 'toss you a bone' you got to place the items on the table to craft a bow, or arrows, or sword.  So yes, this is definately a 'story' game. My only disapointment with it is the fact that the game is less of a game and more of a story. There is very little activity for you to do aside from choosing dialogue (which really doesn't affect the main story in any way) and pressing a key once in a while. In actuality they probably could have completely removed any user interaction, making this just a video, and you'd still end up with the same gaming experience.  If you want a minecraft-based story that's more story than game, this is a pretty good title to get. If you're looking for an actual minecraft gaming experience with an RPG aspect to it, this isn't the game you want.",

However, your choices, as always, make a very big impact on the story. You can play through the first episode numerous times and come out with seemingly endless different story changes.

I am starting to see actions from the first chapter and their effects on this chapter. I chose to go find Magnus and that was a fun sequence, and I wonder how finding Elegaard would have been so I think I will do another playthrough just for that. There are more fun things in this that I always enjoyed doing in regular Minecraft, like throwing eggs to make baby chickens.  Only one major thing for the bad part of this chapter. Sound. I noticed a lot of lip syncing issues and people who were talking would get cut off for the next cutscene or action sequence.   Still a lot of fun.  10/10 would F-bomb again.",

That’s just not right. Yet again, how else is Telltale Games going to make money?   With that being said the game is still fun to play. The only thing that I would have to say about the actual gameplay which I found very annoying was the lack of control that I had over Jesse (the main character). I felt like the character was majorly controlled by the computer, and that there were only a small number of moments where I actually got to control him.   Overall, I would give this game a 7/10 for stunning graphics, and a good story. On the other hand, it lost points with me because of the extra money for the DLC, The lack of control, and oh Ya, one more thing…..The mouth movement did not match up at all to the actual voices.

The game is well made however, the animations are good in almost all parts of the story and the voice acting is great. Your choices in the game do matter bearing in mind some people have been saying it doesn't. They matter, but, more in the short term, not the long term, as the story will continue to how it wants to.  Overall though I think if you are happy to just look through clichés, it's worth playing. Granted there were a lot of cutscenes, but personally, I liked watching more than I did interacting. Perhaps if there was more interaction it would have been the other way around.   Even though I didn't think it would, the game was quite emotional in some parts and you get attached to the characters, For god's sake, I'm an 18 year old guy and I haven't played the base game Minecraft in a long while now but I was getting emotional about a pig...  Whatever age you are I say just give it a try, I didn't think I would enjoy it, and as much as I hate clichés and generic storylines I enjoyed it and the story much more than I intended to.  ---  After playing Episode 5 however, and then finding out I have to pay another £11 to access the next three episodes is pretty ridiculous considering I already paid £19 for the game. I won't be playing through it any more, Telltale Games, you've let me down.",

That's why I rate the game a 9/10",

            "review_text": "How do I start... Well, Minecraft Story Mode is a Telltale game, so if you've ever heard of other games of that type then you know what you're getting into. If not, let me clue you in. In Telltale games (at least, from the two that I've played), the big thing is that your dialogue choices cause different things to happen later in the game. Did you punch this guy? Well, later (episodes later) you can apologize when you realize his reasons. Did you come up with a secret handshake? Three episodes later it's time to use it.  There are also some walking around sections (quite a few, actually), and some quick time event sections (which for some reason don't upset me in these games, even though in 'normal' games quick time events annoy me. Maybe because it's actually a common game mechanic in these games? I dunno)  In this game, you control the main character of Jesse as they do many things such as: Enter a building contest with their friends Chase after their pig friend into the woods Go to a back alley deal of a skull Break someone's precious machine Rummage through the guy from the deal's stuff cause he ripped you off Save a friend who got stuck in a box when the other guy came back Watch as a creature strong enough to destroy the world is made right in front of your eyes Run away very, very, very fast And that's just part of Episode 1.  I will say, when I heard about this game being announced, I actually avoided it for a while. I was worried it was just going to be a garbage cash-in on the Minecraft name, but this was also before I understood what kind of story they were going for and what a Telltale game was.  While yes, it is probably more aimed at a younger audience (because lots of kids play Minecraft), I actually really liked it. The story was interesting to me, I liked the characters (though being honest, I wish Axel had a different scream audio clip, and I wish Olivia's lines had a bit more emotion in them, but that's personal preference), and the gameplay was fun. The different dialogue options give a reason for replayability if you like the game in the first place, and the fact that we're getting at least three more episodes (and I hope there might be more after that, because I really do like these characters) would bring me back even if I wanted to stick with just one playthrough.",

I just love the fact that you make and create and even EXPLORE your own world and story! You decide what you want to do and say. I think the best bit about this game is like in Minecraft, you explore and do what you want to do! I know 22,99 euro is alot, but I really think it was worth it :) Oh, and it can be sad at some times but, it can also be fun! Thank you guys for making this epic game, and alos to those who are reading this post :D!",

If you like playing Minecraft because it's Minecraft, and expect Minecraft from this Minecraft spinoff game, don't play this Minecraft spinoff game. Seriously, if you expect a game similar to Minecraft from this, don't buy it. Actually, if you expect a game at all, don't buy this game. It's more of a movie. Actually, play in a theater and pay people to watch it. And make your office a box.  TL;DR cutscenes and quicktime events the game, nothing like minecraft, i didn't like it.",

The storyline is unique to minecraft, in which you will see a lot of inside jokes and scenarios only seen in minecraft games. The addition of the extra 3 episodes in my opinion is well worth any extra fund and only add to the fun and makes you feel more in tune with the story. The characters are well developed and aren't just killed off like they do in other telltale games. However, the best thing about this game is your trusty sidekick, Rubert.  Overall, great game with over a dozen hours for a single playthrough and is worth the money.",

            "review_text": "With this game, I was teetering on the edge of a positive review. The game is not neccessarily bad, it just has a couple of flaws.  The main flaw with the game is that the story is not all that good. Well, at least for the first four episodes. Took me ages to play through them as I was not gripped at all. Hell, I stopped midway through the fourth episode because I was just bored. I didn't pick the game up again for months.  You can think of the first four episodes as a single story. The fifth and final episode of the game is 'self-contained', although it does lead into the season pass. This is where the strength of the story is. It is in those self-contained stories. Fast moving episodes that don't have 'boring' plotlines weighing them down. If they had made the whole of Minecraft Story Mode like this, it would have been one of the best games I had played.  The problem is you can't get the final 3 episodes without buying the season pass. This is why I am giving the game a negative review. In its 'raw' form it is not all that good. It pains me to say it, but it is not.  In summary:  The base game is not recommended UNLESS you purchase it with the season pass and get those extra three episodes. This makes the game absolutely fabulous, even if you have to slog through those first four episodes to get there.",
