    "description": "The walk home from school today is going to be a lot spookier than usual… Your sleepy neighborhood’s been overrun by monsters! Werewolves prowl the woods, Gnomes roam underfoot, and scarecrows walk at midnight. But these aren’t ordinary monsters—they’re R.L.",

            "review_text": "I still remember late night reading my first Goosebumps book which was Monster Blood. From cover to cover in one go. My favorite books were Haunted Mask and Say Cheese and Die, looking forward to hearing which ones you loved. I haven't read them all though, but I can safely say this game is full of references and even some original cover art retouches. The game is a reminiscence from a childhood, both fun in its cartoonish dialogue and scary when it comes to showing off its hidden nook dwellers and whatever scares people. I had to stop playing, because it's morning already and I really want to chill my bones after dark with no lights on! The point and click aspect is well-done so far, with only real complaint is lack of screen resolutions in settings, so you don't have to play with black bars up and down the screen.",

            "review_text": "To get a view of my point and click mystery-solving skills, you should probably know I have to play Nancy Drew games projected on a TV in a whole group of people so that we don't get too frustrated. This qualifier is there so that when I say, 'well, I'm currently stuck, and despite acquiring a ton of items I have little clue where they go yet,' you can see whether that's somehow true for you.   That said, I'm really, really enjoying this. Yes, part of it is the 'Goosebumps Nostalgia'--but unlike when I rewatch the TV series or films now, and find myself semi-bored and unable to deal with the poor quality, this game holds up. (So far at least.) Art and graphic style is pleasing but also doesn't take you out of the feel of Goosebumps. I've run into plenty of identifiable objects/mysteries so far (though haven't solved or used a bunch of them... yet!). But if you're not familiar with them, I don't think you really lose much either. Anything you would is usually just a 'welp, that's a death' scenario where the start over can correct your error.   The enjoyment of the game definitely comes from the game itself, not just its throw backs, and so far I am having a blast.",

            "review_text": "Pretty good fun, with some decently challenging puzzles and plenty of fan service. Keeps the tone of the books well, and doesn't feel like too much of a movie tie-in. Completed the whole thing in just under four hours, which seems fair enough given its audience and the kind of game it is.",

Some puzzles seem a bit criptic but you could argue just like the books 'Give Yourself Goosebumps' you need to think outside the box from time to time to solve spesific puzzles.",

            "review_text": "I liked this game a lot. It was really fun, it had the right atmosphere, and it referances the books rather often. Someone who grew up reading the books or those who enjoy point and click adventure games will probably enjoy this game a lot due to the game's feel. A few problems I have however are: It's too short of a game, some of the puzzles are rather cryptic and you wouldn't know the solution unless you think critically about it for a while, It's lack luster story (I have not yet seen the acompanying movie, so I don't know what context it gives this game), and finally it's price tag. This game is not worth $20. If it ever goes on sale for $12 or less I would advise checking it out. I had fun during the 5 hours of gameplay, but a lot of it was wandering around, picking up seemingly useless items, and stumbling onto puzzles taking a while to solve. With that in mind, I'd give this game a 7/10. Good, especially if you know the franchise, but not great.",
