            "review_text": "Shadow Puppeteer is a fantastic game that's meant for a great co-op experience. I first completed the game on Wii U on my own and was that a challenge. Plenty of anger moments especially towards boss scenes haha. Got the chance to play with a friend and it makes the game so much easier. The game is single player is really a bonus to players who dare to complete it on their own as it is not easy. The game is stunning to look at and the music is fantastic from start to finish. I wish there was more games like this on any console. There is also plenty of Orbs to be collected which will unlock brilliant artwork and songs to listen to on the menu. If I was to quickly review this, I would give it an 8.5/85% rating. A massive congrats to Sarepta Studio on their PC and Wii U debut and hope they continue to make more great, co-op games for everyone to enjoy. Support the 'smaller' indie companies that help shape the industry today! :)",

            "review_text": "It's a nice idea for a co-op video game but not very well executed. In my opinion Shadow Puppeteer should be advertised as a 'co-op only' video game as the controlling of both the kid and his shadow in the single player mode is essentially the same as controlling at the same time two different characters in any kind of game. In essence in many sections it's extremely frustrating to try and coordinate movements and jumpings in several sections where there is a need for quick reaction.   Other than that, unfortunately, the game is filled with several bugs, frame-rate issues and an overall quality that shows a game that didn't received much polish. Furthermore controlling the kid (in 3d space in comparison with the shadow) is problematic because of certain camera angles that makes it difficult to know the depth of field when jumping leading to some really frustrating platform sections.  There are some cool puzzles throughout the game and fun to be had by playing co-op but in general it's a game that needed much more time to be truly complete and functioning.",

            "review_text": "It's a funny game and you really need to be smart with puzzling. The graphics are good but some levels where very difficult and I had to try it over and over again for 100 times. If you like a puzzling challange then I'd reccomend you'd grab this game but if you're not a good thinker and want to play quick then I wouldn't reccomend it.  The price compared to the game itself is normal.",
