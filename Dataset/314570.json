            "review_text": "The Sun at Night is worth playing for the story alone. The world and characters are nicely done. The alternative history setting is great. Other parts of the game are not so wonderful though. Art is all over the place: the propaganda posters and most of the environment art is great, while characters, monsters and character portraits leave much to be desired. As do animation, combat, platforming, enemy AI and bosses. But! Despite of the flaws I really enjoyed the game. Levels are enormous and for the most part are really fun to explore. Laika is adorable and character customization system is surprisingly good. I wish the devs would go full metroidvania with this though and tie exploration to various upgrades of Laika's suit. I shall definitely be looking forward for the sequel.",
