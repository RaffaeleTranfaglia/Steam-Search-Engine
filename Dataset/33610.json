            "review_text": " 'A hand was going to come out of the water and catch the sword? Get real, George!' - Nico Collard   From year 2003, the third instalment of the series,  Broken Sword 3 - the Sleeping Dragon  makes a radical change of presentation by carrying our beloved protagonists to 3D! Yup, it's the start of the millennium and 3D adventure games are big at the time. Knights Templar, Slavic assassins, medieval conspiracies and much more for us to enjoy in 3D this time. Expectedly, this change comes with a whole new set of game mechanics too. Not to worry though! The setting, the environment and the tone of the game are trademark George &amp; Nico quality, alright!  Following the events of the previous game, George goes back to his life as a patent lawyer and finds himself flying to the Congo to meet a scientist who claims that his machine can produce limitless energy. However, the plane crashes during a storm and George barely saves his hide. He takes a walk to meet the scientist, and yet again, finds himself in a conspiracy involving - wait for it - Templars! Meanwhile, Nico, still working for her paper, is called to interview a hacker who claims that he cracked Voynich manuscript and warns hectically about an 'end of the world' scenario. Going to meet the guy, Nico finds him dead - of course - and gets attacked by the assassin who was impersonating her! As sure as the careful hands of fate would deem so, they again get together to solve the mystery, save the world and beat some Templar ♥♥♥ while doing so.  In this adventure to come, we will meet new faces and encounter some familiar ones from previous games, going on another adventure that would rally us around the globe. That's one thing that I love about Broken Sword games. You get to visit countless different locations with different cultures and get introduced to anecdotes from their local lore. Yet, somehow, all those seemingly irrelevant details come together to paint a bigger picture. Its Indiana Jones meets Dan Brown every time. Humor is spot on also, this time relying on both folklore narrative and sexual innuendo a bit more than usual. One other thing is that we are capable of observing George and Nico's relationship growth based on their mutual history, growing inner jokes and references to previous games. Both George and Nico are just as you remember them: a lovable, smart ♥♥♥ Yankee with a law degree and an ambitious, pretty reporter with a sharp tongue.  Let's get to the obvious change then, shall we? Our good old 2D P&amp;C environment is no more. Now we have 3D cartoon renderings of our beloved characters and there is no 'clicking' on the literal sense. Yup, mouse is pretty much useless in this instalment. All interactions are controlled from the keyboard, including item selection and movement - which is kinda okay. What would be a real drag is cameras. They change into pretty obscure point of views without warning, and it can become hellishly nasty if you are on a chasing scene. Oh, yes, we are also introduced with QTEs - quick time events - in this game. There will come some cinematic sequences in which you'll be asked to respond in a timely fashion by hitting the right button. Cute, huh? There aren't as many puzzles compared to previous games though, but the ones that we encounter are satisfying enough. Another newly introduced element is Sokoban games - a.k.a. box pushing puzzles. The game is riddled with them. They all are pretty easy, but mostly time consuming. You won't miss them when you finish the game.  All things aside,  Broken Sword 3 - the Sleeping Dragon  is a neat little adventure game, even though it is slightly subpar in means of mechanics and brain scratching compared to previous titles. Its worthy of an experience for the jokes, the story and character interactions to begin with. Go ahead, play the game. You know you want to. It's George and Nico, and they are at another incredible adventure. It cannot be bad anyhow.

Parts of the story were good, and the addition of the crate puzzles and some QTEs did not bother me much, but the ending is so bad it makes you wonder what were they thinking - it almost feels like they rushed it and just went along with whatever they could come up with at the last minute. Nevertheless, it is still somewhat decent if you like this genre.",

The controls are not very smooth, and some wanna-be designer though that moving crates around was so much fun they should be added everywhere throughout the game. The puzzles are there but not as interesting as the earlier games.  Here is the caveat: If you have enjoyed Broken Sword 1 &amp; 2, get this one just to get more George &amp; Nico. I mean you already know you're going to buy the series, why waste your time with reviews?",

Unfortunately the controls for part 3 have been changed, making it very uncomfortable to play. Controls with keyboard and/or mouse are clumsy and I have not managed to apply the 360 controller pad, no idea if it's even supported.  Do not buy this if you are looking for a traditional point &amp; click adventure.",

That said and forgiven, this is a great game with adequate high-quality story and constantly changing dynamics. Can be a bit annoying from time to time, but all in all positive things overthrow the negatives by a great margine.",
