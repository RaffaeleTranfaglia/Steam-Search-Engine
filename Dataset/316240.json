            "review_text": "  Originally bought as a joke by my friends, I decided to download the game and give it a try for the laughs. What I found was nothing short of astonishing. The games runs at a beautiful 4FPS. The graphics blew me away with the light rays touching gracing my eyes like the glory of God himself. My truck clipped and became stuck on everything, just like real life.When I finally arrived at the woodmill to begin my day of work, I found thie gameplay to pump my adrenaline in a way that I haven't felt since the glory days of PS2 gaming.I watched as the simple gameplay produced the most beautiful tree cutting animations I have ever seen. I've cut trees down before, but nothing this astounding.  This game is simply a must play. Don't look at the price, because it doesn't matter, because it is worth it.  10/10 Best game.",

The physics are from 2001, tree cutting is automated (you just drive to a spot and press Right Click when it tells you).  Let me save you some money and don't buy it :)",
