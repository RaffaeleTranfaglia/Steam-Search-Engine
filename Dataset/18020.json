Same main characters with some new attacks and weapon modifications but the main thing is seeing the story continue to unfold! This game has a bit more profanity than the first one but beyond that still a lot of fun to play this combination point-and-click and RPG adventure.",

Sadly, as the protagonist you are still without a place to call home. First a giant robot, then a truck. What next. You finally find a place and it gets burned down to the ground. As the anger dwells inside you the more powerful you and your hoe become!.   As you complete this episode, one thought continually crosses your mind, whats the plan, where am I going to sleep tonight.  Worth playing in my opinion. Just be sure to play through Episode 1 before picking up Episode 2. As your quest to find a bed to sleep on and shelter to keep you warm continue,  Cya next time in Ep 3.",

It wasn't until the first fight that I started to not want to play anymore. It wasn't the fight sceen and it wasn't the action. That is where they started cussing. The action started with the S word and then the F word got put in a couple of times. I would love to go through the game without those words. So unfortunaly I cannot recommend this. If there were a way to turn that off, it would be fantastic!",
