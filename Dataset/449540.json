I got some SALTS (Smile A Little Then Stop) and if you're like me, then you have to put at least 1 hour per $1 spent. I spent $0.80 and I almost feel let down.

I'm talking 1800s cartoon depictions. Straight-up looks like yellowface. Ignorant, borderline racist jokes as achievments. They have an achievment called 'geisha facial' when geisha are... not Chinese. New York is depicted in a modern setting where people wear suits and drive taxis but in Bejing everyone is wearing ancient costumes, bamboo hats, the old guys all have fu-man-chu, and people are pulling around hay carts.   I get it, not all games have to be 'PC' but this really bummed me out. Wanted to play a fun game where I throw poop on people. Was not expecting racism and orientalism in a game based on such a silly, absurd concept. Very disappointing. If you're not bothered by that kind of stuff, go ahead and purchase it. You'll probably have a good time.",

            "review_text": " There's Poop in My Soup  is rough around the edges and could use some polish, but it has enough charm and humor to be worth the 89 cents I paid for it.  This is basically a sort of space-invaders meets physics chaos type of game. You stand on top of buildings and drop poop on unsuspecting passersby. That might sound like it could get dull, and the game does have a lifespan, but there's a surprising amount to be discovered. There is a huge amount of different trick shots and animations to discover. Certain characters react to the poop differently and you can bounce the poop off of awnings. If you poop on a certain number of people, you unlock little perks, such as more people walking around, or alternate poop weapons. As you only have a finite number of poops per session, you have to replay the level a few times to unlock things. The alternate poop weapons are pretty powerful and allow you to really begin upping your score, but they sacrifice accuracy, so specific outcomes might be harder to predict. Even though you unlock things through the number of people you poop on, the true goal is to get the highest score you can. The fact that you have to replay the levels to achieve the number of people pooped on does lengthen the game, but it does make the early stages a bit slow, and the game truly hits its stride when you've got the maximum people walking around. That said, it is important to start slowly so you can learn each area, so it's not too bad of a progression.  The game's biggest asset is its charm. The graphical style is cute and hilarious. I love the weird, springy-haired guy who drops the poop, and the random citizens are equally memorable. I love the sound it makes when you poop. The visual style on the menus is clean and slick looking. The ragdoll physics add to the chaos in so many ways that even the developer might not have foreseen. One time I pooped on a guy and he ran out into the street and got hit by a car, only to have his body flung over the buildings. There were several moments where I had genuine, gut laughter from either the physics, the animations, or some secret thing that the game snuck into a level. It's crude stuff, but the game never feels mean-spirited and it lets you in on the joke. On that level, I definitely reccomend this game for its entertainment value.  The game's biggest failings are in its technical merits. The framerate is choppy and the game feels a bit unoptimized. My PC can max out most games at 60fps, so I should have no problem running a game like this. It does seem to smooth out after playing for a few rounds, but there's no reason for a game like this to lag. The other big issue is that there is not controller support. You have to aim with WASD and this feels a bit too clunky and imprecise to always get the exact shot I'm going for. Most of the time it's not too much of an issue, but it does hold the game back a bit. In a game like this where movement is part of the challenge, it would probably be too easy if you could aim with the mouse, but I think analogue stick movement would be the perfect middleground. I also think the camera on the New York level might benefit from being pulled out a bit, as when you try to aim into the extreme foreground, you can't see where you're actually aiming. The China level does rectify this however.   There's Poop in My Soup  isn't perfect, but for 89 cents it is a funny and charming way to kill a few minutes. The game's biggest issues seem like they could easily be solved with a patch or two, and I hope the developer will keep working on this. It has issues, but I like it.",

            "review_text": "People need to calm down. Yes the dialogue only has 4 options, but 90% of all dialogue in the other Fallout games had 3 to 4 options. The dialogue is my biggest complaint, but It's not that big a of a deal in retrospect. My other complaint is that quests often have 1 ending, I would love to choose from several endings but I do not expect this for every quest.  The Game is beautiful, it's got a great feel to it and I love the way the world is set up. The dirt may be a boring brown but you find that the Post/Pre-War buildings have a nice color scheme and It makes the game that much more nice looking. As for people who are underwhelmed by the map, C'mon? If you want to be underwhelmed look at New Vegas. The City was an empty pile with 50% of the buildings being unenterable. It had a total of 6 nice looking buildings, That was it!  The Power Armor makes you feel like an absolute BEAST! I don't mind that they gave me a Minigun and Power Armor in the first 20 mins of the game because the Armor is in bad shape to start with (and after killing a Death Claw it's in worse shape) and after killing everything in that mission I only had 21 shots left on the gun. I droped it because who wants to carry around a useless (and heavy) weapon. The people who are questioning the use of Power Armor in the first 20 mins should take into consideration that it's a way of giving you an incentive to find, craft, and customize your own set(s). In Fallout New Vegas I never bothered with Power Armor because I already had some cool cowboy stuff, and it didn't do that much for me anyways. Not to mention that it looked pretty bad too.   I don't mind the Perk system because they were always the best part about leveling up anyways. I like looking at all the options that are placed before me and planning out my character before I even hit level 5. For this reason alone, I do not agree with the people claiming that 'Fallout 4 is not an RPG' off of the grounds that dialogue choice is limited. You get to make your character look the way you want, fight the way you want, join the factions you want, and so on. You get to create a character who is individual to you, just because he/she can't say exactly what you want to say doesn't mean that the game is not an RPG.   Now that I'm done defending the game from common criticism lets talk about what the game did exceptionally well at. The game has amazing sound design, I'll be walking along and all of a sudden I'll hear far off shots. The fact that I can tell what guns are being used, how many people are shooting at eachother and how far off they are from me speaks valumes for the game's sounds. This skill comes in handy more times then you might think.  Another thing That I like is the looting system. The game feels so much more seemless now that I don't have to look through body after body to find nothing useful. Instead I am given a nice UI that tells me exactly whats is available to loot. I can also choose to go into a more indepth UI if I want to.  Character/Enemy design looks and feels great. Ghouls look and act far more 'feral'. Mole rats have a nice little add on with the ability to go underground and pop out at you. Your Dog now has the ability to pin people down so you can shoot them (Team work is actually a thing now!) and I am overall impressed with how far they came from the 'Run at the enemy and block your friend' companions from Fallout and the Elderscrolls games alike.   Finnally, You can have lasting change in a Fallout game. The fact that you can build your own settlment, is the largest change in a Fallout game since the destruction of Megaton. It adds just as much content as being able to say something new, and I like the change. The next related topic is the crafting system, which is extensive. Build what you want were you want. it's a great feeling and I love it.  Cons:  - 'I wanna say something else!' - 'Put the gun, on your back!' (Gun randomly appears when you have to use it) - Lack of Quest endings choices - Repetative Quests (Like some Skyrim Quests)  Pros: - Looks Great - Sounds Great - (Seemless) Feels great! - SOOO much crafting - Lasting impression on the world!  This Game IS an RPG, and it stands strong on it's own. I like it! :)",
