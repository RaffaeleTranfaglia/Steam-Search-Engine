            "review_text": "Ok so this is getting very negative review which I think are not entirely justified. I'll adrress a couple of points.  1) Yes, it's perhaps a bit shorter than average - but not teribely short. On the other hand, there's at least some replay possibility as various choices you make result is a somehow different play (not always a given in this kind of interactive fiction). You'll not get all scenes/events in a one playthrough.  2) The setting is more exotic than usual but I think that's a plus. I prefer it much more than a typical cliche fantasy. You can easliy pick up the meaning of setting-specific words from the context.  3) Choices of gender or patron deity do influence gameplay in some way rather than being merely cosmetic. Cool.",

Playing a word based game was a suprise to me (although, I did do ZORK et al as a kid... yeah, I am older).  I am very impressed with the amount of love put into this game and the interpretation of MAR Barker's world.  This game is probably not as well recomended for non-EPT fans. However, for those of us who grew up with the RPG of the Petal Throne, this is golden entertainment.  Kudos.",
