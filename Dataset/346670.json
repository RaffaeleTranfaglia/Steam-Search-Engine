We've been able to recieve latest entries of the diary and it's truly shocking! The employee claims that the destruction was caused by a video game. We always knew video games are evil and now it looks like we're having an actual evidence on our hands. The following text is taken straight from the diary:   'Day 724. Our system is ready to test Sky Battles. We've been reported that it might be the game we're looking for - a Unity game that doesn't suck. If they're wrong, the outcome is unpredictable. We've been feeding our machine with bad games for far too long. We'd better take a break, but there's not much time left, we're doing it for 2 years already...   Day 725. Today's the test day. I'm scared. My colleagues look fine, but I know they wish to leave this place as soon as possible. Well, it might work this time. I hope they didn't lie to us...   Day 729. By the time we've loaded the game into our machine everyone already knew that something's wrong, but we had an official order. Once we booted the game up into the machine, it caused a massive overload - system didn't expect the game to be THAT bad. Noone ever thought it's even possible, so there was no special defense for this case. It wasn't your generic Unity game, whoever made it had a purpose to break our machine. They succeeded. But the damage caused is beyond the limits, I'm not sure they'll be able to save us. In case we're dead, whoever will find these messages, DESTROY THE GAME IT'S DANGEROUS!'   'At least 50 countries including USA, Germany, Russia and Australia already claimed they're banning the game mentioned in the diary. From now on, if the officials will found a copy of this game on your storages, you'll most likely to be accused in terrorism and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Several countries including North Korea as well as some terrorist organisantons already threatened the outer world that they use this game against any other state that won't accept their claims. At this moment it is not clear whether any state is going to ban Unity - the engine used to build this video game, but the chances are that the thing is real, since the discussions are forced in the UN counsil.   Stay tuned to the Rotten News, the most rotten news in the world!'     nothing above this spoiler is true. Except the quality of the game.       and ain't my story better? sure it is, whichever story is better than no story.  ",
