In this game, I liked it a lot of characters and a great story . We provide a large selection of how to start the game and for anyone to play . Gameplay on game is very good and you will be able to quickly learn ingame. Now my estimation: + Gameplay + Story + Price in steam market + steam cards + fun , timekiller |||||| - for me bad graphic - no achievements - music And now all estimation 6/10 I reccomend to all this game , if you like play 2d and timekiller games.
