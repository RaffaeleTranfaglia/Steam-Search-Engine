            "review_text": "(1/5 star) Really shallow gameplay. If you liked Timberman, then you'd like this. Just timing up/down to keep the water platforms connected. I got bored after 5 minutes. Just no incentive to keep going other than to beat your best score. I would have much preferred if it had some jumps, air time, or let you see a few waves ahead to plan your moves (like tree limbs in timberman), or something to add some thrill. Or perhaps only having to match up with higher waves to the right, and let him shoot off a wave if higher. But he just crashes if your wave (platform) is higher than the next. Seems like some more depth could have been added. Just way too boring to me. Timberland was actually slightly more engaging, and had a more active online multiplayer (at this time).",

I love the characters and stages.The multiplayer is great too, although some kind of rank/tier 'badge' would be cool instead of the typical rank ladder number. I also feel the game could benefit from having double star weekend or different special events to keep the game refreshing and lively. Otherwise this game is pretty solid and really enjoyable.",

Nothing really wrong with the game, apart from the obvious repetitiveness and grinding. massive difficulty spike in the 60s, resulting in me never getting past that. meh. give it a miss. There is nothing WRONG with the game as such, but in my opinion, if a game is made for iOS, then it should stay on iOS",
