            "review_text": "Feels and plays just like a mobile game.  It's not terrible per say, but it feels like an attempt to give proper combat to the Plants vs Zombies formula and while it might work on mobile, it just comes across as slow and unsatisfying on PC. It's nice that the game has an interesting twist, but it means that any strategic play you had in PvZ is swaped with just spamming of flower weapons, which got tiresome very quickly.  Maybe worth it for die hard tower defense fans, but otherwise not worth buying.",

            "review_text": "It's a funny casual game that feels like a cross bitween Plants VS Zombies and Angry Birds, but then cheaper. Zombies come in to steal the seeds , you use your plants to shoot, squash or cannonball them, to stop them from eating your precious seeds. The plants you use are different for every 'world' you play in, each world has 3 different plants which you have to unlock. All plants are upgradable with the coins that you get after or during every level.   All in all I would say it's a funny, casual game that I'd rate with a score of 7/10. ",
