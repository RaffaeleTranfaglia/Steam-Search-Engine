            "review_text": "Orcs Must Die 2 is a tower defense type game in which you play one of two characters (male/female) in order to top the Orcish hoard from getting to their destination (of which there are sometimes multiple points to protect.) To assist you there are numerous upgrades for your character, minions, and traps that are unlocked as you progress. You get an action bar where you can put a set number of these things and then start the level. Using some of these things (like minions and traps) costs coins. Coins are independent of each level (they don't carry over so don't be shy about spending them.) You get more as the level progresses and there are other items you can unlock that increase coin drops.   For me, survival mode was the most fun. Still haven't made it to wave 30 of any level yet though (it's hard!) Essentially it's progressively harder and harder waves until you're finally overwhelmed (or make it to that legendary 30th level.)   The fun factor is through the roof on this one and I highly recommend picking it up!",

The co-op mode is even funnier of course, since you can use a lot of creativity with a friend to complete the levels. Could use a larger amount of levels, though, without the need for DLC, that is. Still, a pretty good game.",

            "review_text": "Orcs must Die 2 is the sequel that fans of the first game (which I also recommend that you play first) were waiting for. It keeps all of the fun aspects of the previous game while adding plenty of new things as well as addressing the criticisms of the original, the largest of which was lack of multiplayer. The game now has full Co-Op, as well as a new character in the form of the Sorceress. The game adds new levels new enemies, and an arsenal of new weapons and traps to massacre the hordes of orcs with, all while keeping the theme of the original, including the FANTASTIC soundtrack. I would say this feels more like an expansion pack than a sequel, but then you also have to take into account that both this game and the original were very cheap in price on release, and both have been on sale countless times since then. A great deal of fun, and if you like the idea of slaughtering huge hordes of orcs with hilarious trap combinations, you NEED to buy this game.",
