            "review_text": "It sort of reminds me of the old NES game Zippy Race. Pretty straight-forward where you try to get to finish line while dodging obstacles before your 'hope' (fuel) runs out, so you need to determine to either drive slower so you can dodge easier, or put the pedal to the metal and dodge like crazy to hit the finish line faster. Later levels essentially turn into one big Bullet Hell dodge-fest where you need to strategically plan to use your special attacks to wipe out the enemies on the screen. The price point is on the mark, it's nothing above and beyond an NES game of this nature, or a really oldschool 80's arcade would offer, and not something I'd expect people to invest much time into, more of a 'pick up and play to waste 10 minutes here and there' sort of game.",
