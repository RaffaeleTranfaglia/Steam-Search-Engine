Someone else may see it as a space combat simulator. The point is you can really play this game the way you want. Many people are scared of the scale this game seems to be but as long as you start with baby steps its really alright. You don't have to be a grand adventurer exploring the entire universe battling enemy capital ships with a fleet of your own. In fact you could play without even leaving your sector if you wished to as you learn the game. I believe that everyone should at least have a go at this game even though it is a bit older.",

The depth of the X-Universe in terms of exploring is incomparable to any other game I know and it's part of what makes this game so awesome. The background story is also really really deep, with several books out there adding to the universe.  It does have some bugs and boring things (which game doesn't?), but someone who's willing to spend time on this game will eventually learn where he belongs in this universe, and there you can (mostly) avoid those bugs and boring missions. That being said, I have never had any all too big problems with bugs, and the insane depth this game offers makes up for all hardship along the way.  It's a game I can only recommend to try out, though be warned, the true gems of this game won't show up until a few hundred hours of playing.",

After playing FTL for a bit i decided to give it another go.   Its a very immersive sandbox game with alot of things to do. You can captain a huge capital ship and blow pirates and other factions to bits, or you can build stations and run the universe with your economy like a true capitalist. There are missions to do which can vary from blowing some guy up to building a station or even being a taxi.   The universe is fairly large with around 240+ sectors so theres alot to explore. Diffrent sectors belong to diffrent factions with have their own ships (I like argons ships) You can buy their ships once you have enough reputation with them. There can also be pirates which can be annoying early game but trust me. Its satisfying to assult their pirate base with 3 captial ships as revenge.   It can take a while to get into this game as it did with me, i just had to sit down and use google every time i needed help. The community is great for tutorials and guides as they can help you out with pretty much any questions you have about this game.   10/10 Autopilot crashed me into a station.",

Once you learn how to make money (and get your ships upgraded to do automatic trading, you can then focus on building your fleet of ships, to trade, explore, build, and conquer.  But this game, as I said, is not easy. When flying, your auto-pilot can collide you into an asteroid, or a space station, or another ship. You only can fly so fast, so auto-pilot is a must. But you still must be there to take control should you need to dodge something.   If you don't upgrade your ships with the most powerful lasers, missles, and have proper shields, and you get into a fight. Expect to be destroyed. You can only save your game when docked in a station, but you can buy SALVAGE INSURANCE to save any where.   It's a graphically pleasing game and the music is mellow. Play this for the journey and the attempted realism.",

However, if you're somebody that doesn't have the patience to learn practically everything by yourself, I would stray away. I took on the infamous 'learning curve' this game has and I'm glad I did. I didn't think learning a game could actually frustrate me, but when I did learn, I started to have a lot of fun. There are very few space sandbox games that let you have this amount of control.  What little of a tutorial this game has makes up for it in variety and content. You can approach success in space by trading or by working for the military. You'll start out with a small spacecraft with hardly any weaponry or cargo space and are set in a galaxy with many avenues of approach. Your only obstacle is your ambition. 6 hours later of learning and I now have 3 trading ships in my fleet, including two extra large tankers which I use to transport energy cells from solar power facilities to space stations that need them. Almost every sector without a solar power facility needs these cells to operate and is a quick way to gain a fortune to expand your fleet and your success in being a merchant.  As mentioned earlier, you can also progress by working for the military or being a mercenary. The game starts you out with very little direction for this, but eventually you will find there is plenty of work to be done in the form of stations and military outposts looking for people to hire. Completing these jobs will earn you recoignition for your status as well as credits to spend on your ship or fleet.  In the end you don't have to do any of this, you are free to explore where ever you like as far as you like, attack anybody you want, trade with anybody you want, settle with any species you want. And I'm promised that's not the end of it. I'm very excited to really dig into this game on a day I don't have to work, I look forward to the expansions of everyones space empire, should they choose to purchase this game.",

X3 is a game that will worm its way into the hearts of those who enjoy the RPG mechanic of starting out small and building yourself up. No green slimes will be slain, though. In this game you'll be starting out in a modest little space fighter or freighter and working your way into power and prosperity through combat, trade, or a mix of the two (salvaging gear from the strife of others).   While combat was fun, and shouldn't dissapoint anyone coming from the Freespace school of gaming, I found trading and fleet management to be the most enjoyable and challenging parts of the game. X3's logistics, economy, and trading mechanics are as complex as they are fun, and a wonderful reward for those willing to brave the learning curve.",

The depth to this game is amazing, and it will require some actual planning and strategy to build wealth and power.  On the downside, starting as a new play is very intimidating. There is very little in-game explanation of anything, and you have to learn a TON by trial and error. On the upside, X3TC has a rich community and tons of resources in their forum. I've spent a surprising amount of time outside of the game researching and planning what I'm going to buy and build.  Great game, and you'll get a lot for your money, but you'll have to enjoy games with a long arc which require a lot of strategic planning - so it won't be for everyone.",

So I have just downloaded X3 AP as it is a later game and better graphics and maybe slightly better game play. All said Terran Conflict is a massive game and the hours I put in so far have apart from a few frustrating steep leaning curves been enjoyable and different from the genres I have played before.",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game... but not for everyone.  I would recommend this game to any fan of the space-sim genre (who has a LOT of time on their hands and is willing to learn) BUT... buyer beware, there are some major flaws (I will ellaborate) and it is almost a necessity to mod the game to make it accessible and playable.  There is a MASSIVE learning curve (anyone who says otherwise is talking *&amp;%$), I am about 200 hours into my first playthrough and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of what you can actually do in this game. Any game with an instruction manual that is over 100 pages long is going to require some serious patience. I even found EvE-Online more accessible than X3TC. Some people will find these to be plus points but for those who want a game they can just pick up and play... buy something else. Don't listen to anyone who compares this to Freelancer (Freelance was much more of an arcade game), if you enjoyed Freelancer there is no guarantee you will enjoy this game.   First I will list what I though were the good points :  -Graphics are pretty good for a game of its age.  -Reasonable sound with great music. -A HUGE universe to explore. -A plethora of different ships, space stations, weapons, ship equipment, etc. (the vast majority of which the player can own themselves). -A bustling trade universe with many resources and end products which the player can trade in. -Great sandbox feel to the game, you could play for hundreds of hours and build a huge trade empire or combat fleet without ever touching on a 'Plot' mission. -A very helpful and dedicated fan base who are more than willing to help out new players (dont think i have ever seen the word 'noob' on any forum/thread), there is a huge resource of info about the game on various websites/youtube and there is a large modding/scripting community.   Now the not-so-good :  -The game interface can be pretty cryptic and is not very intuitive at all. It took me a long time to figure it out (in fact I still dont think I have it figured out fully). A lot of the fans of the X series will praise the interface but I think they are comparing to previous X games (which must have had a truly aweful interface). -The AI can be pretty dumb, flying ships into stations or something simmilar. However i think this has been mostly sorted out in the later versions of the game. -Missions directives can sometimes be quite confusing and it is easilly possible for a player to accept a mission that they are vastly under-equiped for, which is just poor game design IMO. -Some of the plot mission requirements are absolutely insane and from what I have read, many players opt to mod the game to lower the requirements (because they really are that rediculous, requiring the player to amass huge amounts of resources) which feels a bit like cheating to me. But remember, you don't HAVE to do the plot (sandbox). -Very little in the way of in-game tutorials leaving the player to figure out most of it on their own. I for one, dont mind having to sift through the manual or read the wiki to figure stuff out, but for some this will be a deal-breaker. -The need to mod the game.... you really do have to. The vanilla game is sadly lacking in certain areas and without some of the mods the vanilla game feels like a beta. -The NPC voices are incredibly anoying!!!  In conclusion this is a game with huge potential so long as you are willing to put in hundreds of hours of gameplay (its like having a second job!!). It can be very rewarding and incredibly frustrating at the same time. The interface can be very irritating at times but if you can get to grips with it, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had. If you are looking at buying this game I would highly recommend having a look at the available mods and what they do BEFORE you start playing, because some of the mods require you to restart the game from the beginning before they will take effect.  A vast, deep game with huge potential so long as you are willing to put in the time and can get past the steep learning curve.",

Graphics are top notch, however, capital ship explosions could have been improved, they mostly just play a large 2D explosion animation, and then the ship disappears, no debris, nothing.

Fleet control is poor, so much so that you would really rather simply pilot your own ship and do most of the fighting yourself (this is not Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire). The method of organizing fleets is clunky and stale and trying to get a fleet through a gate will end in heavy casualties crashing into each other. Physics is also a problem.

The plot missions will take even more time. If after all this, you still want a good space simulator with the ability to craft your own empire then this game is for you. Just don't expect a fleshed out fleet control simulator.",

The combat is boring and very finicky, and if bounty hunting your kills have a high chance of being stolen by a random passerby which make everything but a trader orientated start ridiculously hard.  Some of the positives are the freedom it gives you, even if it is a bit much for a beginner. The variety is also a nice touch, many different ships from different civilizations. Being able to just trade, just bounty hunt, or be an imperialist are all right there. Much like a single-player EvE but without the overly aggresive die hards playing it.

You have to go several menus deep to do most things, and I find myself spending most of my time repeating the same series of clicks over and over again. Maybe there is a better way to do it, but the game gives you no help in finding out what that might be.  I watched several videos, and read tutorials online before playing, and even then I was expecting a steep learning curve. Which is fine. That's not the issue, the issue is the poor design of the game. The game gives you the option to trade lots of different goods, but in reality you can only trade energy cells and ore at the start. The others never vary enough in price to make them worth trading. The 'dynamic' trade system results in the AI traders contently supplying factories with everything they need so the price never changes. The result is far from dynamic. I found my greatest goal in the game was to get an automated trader so I wouldn't have to do the mind numbing, and painfully slow trading myself. You know something is wrong when the goal of playing a game is to make it so you don't have to play the game. Another guide I read said you can build cash with missions. So I tried that. Except when you start out you can't do most missions. My slow trading ship can't do the trade missions fast enough. My discover can't haul enough, or fight well enough. A lot of missions require special equipment. So you fly around to 5 sectors looking for 1 mission you can actually do, then make a few thousand or tens of thousands or credits. I don't mind low rewards starting off, or hard to complete missions. The thing that gets me is having to tediously check 10-20 missions before you can find 1 you like. And it's not like you can fly into a sector and access all of the missions available in an quick, easy way either, no just get ready to mindlessly click through more menus.  Even with all of that, the game has potential, and I can see where it could be fun once you get the hang of it. But if you don't have hours and hours to sink into a game, and a lot of patients to slog through the learning curve, you're going to get frustrated with this game. Maybe once you're an expert the game is fun enough that you can ignore the poor deign, but I can't.",

It had an open world, trading aspect, dogfight, construction and an interesting plot. It buried into my mind as one of these games that kept one coming back.  Several years later we got X3, which brought back memories and made me glee with expectations. Unfortunately I was deeply disappointed.  One would expect that after so much time the series would improve significantly and draw some of the best solutions from other successful games. This here has not happened. It seems the game have stopped mentally in early 2000 but went on graphically to current gen. The world is VAST, gigantically OPEN, enormously FREE, pleasingly NEAT, and you are free to do as You please, in every aspect of this word. But before You do, there is a discouraging amount of things You first need to learn.  One would expect to learn some basics of trading, exploring, upgrading, before even trying to comprehend the advanced forms of play. This here does not happen. What You're introduced to, is bare basics of ship control, and that's all. Looking at key configuration I had the feeling that someone outsourced tutorials to a player that had the game for 30 minutes. You're just thrown into the universe and be like 'oh, You're here, follow me into this sector we've got some bad guys to kill'. That's just an insignificant fraction of what the game has in store.  X3 has almost nothing to offer in terms of introducing You into the world, apart from opening cinematic, and because of that it is unenjoyable from the beginning. You ask what's later? I don't know - I've been disappointed by game design to the point that I didn't want to find out. And believe me, I tried two times already in span of 2 years.  There are other games worth Your time in terms of space exploration, trading, fights and empire building. Games like EVE, Freespace, Freelancer...  IF You have time - take it at Your own risk.

I heard someone say on a forum something like 'The game is long, not slow'. That of course is wrong. Skyrim is long. This game IS SLOW. The game like many other space games fail on one simple thing; Travel time. Due to this, you spend about 90% of your time traveling from destination X to Y to Z. And in this game it does little to take away that factor. You may as well be watching a screen saver.   You cannot save the game until you are docked. Which only reduces yet again the pace of the game. If you dont save your game, you littlerly have to start again if/when you die. This means, yes, more traveling and doing the same ♥♥♥♥ you just did an hour ago. (Oh and docking aint fun in this game, there is no 'click and dock' you have to either wait for the slow ♥♥♥♥ autopilot or manually dock yourself)  The game is not vast despite what you might hear. You go from sector to sector via warp gates. It's just a load of instances linked together. Oh and you cannot interact with planets in any way. They are just background art.  The controls, camera and UI are very basic. Giving commands to your other ships is executed poorly. You can give limited quick commands when targeting other ships (Or rather I should say command) which is attack. Thats it. The autopilot is also buggy, a lot of the time it will just throw you about makiing you puke from motion sickness.  Some other things that don't make much sense: its cheaper to buy a new ship than to repair the one you have (And yes ships cost A LOT). Misions are completely randomized meaning that you wont be able to do like 90% of them near the start of your game. They are also unremarkable from what I've seen; 'Do this and get credits' everytime.  Glad I tried this game on free weakend.

'1...' 'Jump drive activated...' 'Jumping.'  Yes, there's a way to skip past that, but that's when I realized the X games were made by a bunch of sadists.",

            "review_text": "'Mission timer, 12 minutes, rating: Easy' Distance between each gate? 5 minutes, 3 gates to jump. Mission, impossible.   This was every starting mission I found so far, everything is impossible to do just based on time needed to make the jumps.   'Mission timer, no time limit, rating: easy' The ship I have to destroy blows me out of the sky and I didn't even dent it's shields.   'Mission timer, no time limit, rating: easy' Escourt mission, goes well enough, lose 60% haul during it, but I make it to the end. Both the big ships I'm escourting with dock, 2 more enemies spawn, they don't help me fight and the station wont let me dock, Get destroyed.  For having so much to do, this game sure does feel empty and slogging.  If you're not a space sim expert, stay away.  Played over 4 hours, 0 missions completed, every one either took too much time to complete and was failed, or it was rated easy and ended up being too hard to complete.   Just a note here as well. This is obviously a niche game, so a lot of people of course will enjoy it and have fun. I myself am a veteran EVE online player, so I really do like space sim type games. I just feel like this one was improperly polished and lacks a lot of interface and functions that would of made it easier to get into for new players.  If you're an X series vet, you'll have a much different experience than someone new to it. But if you are new to it, don't jump into it with this game unless you watch some tutorials.",

In the beginning of the game it was mostly good in buying items &amp; upgrades, however, once I depleted the supply, they never seemed to be restocked. Anyway, just my 2-cents",
