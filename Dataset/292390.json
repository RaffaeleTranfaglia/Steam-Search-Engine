    "description": "Forged in the Beginning and protected by the Seven Seals, there lies a place where thought and creation intertwine. The center for all realms of existence, it is the balancing force between good and evil, man and spirit. A focal point for all energies, and the one element that has kept the consuming nature of darkness at bay... Until now.",

            "review_text": " Before playing RTFM! (Read The Frakking Manual)   There are no hand-holding tutorials in this game, it expected you to read the manual before diving in or referencing it when you didn't know how to preform an action.  Manual is in Steam Folder so read it before you play.  Don't let my Steam time fool you, I actually bought this game when it was new (And on 4 CD's if I remember correctly, I think I still have them somewhere). I have played this game from beginning to end multiple times and for its time, it was an amazing game. It hasn't aged the best and could do with a remastering that's for sure, but it still has all the classic difficulty and random scary moments (which now seem a bit tame) which gave it the charm I fell in love with.  Pros:  - Excellent story - Wonderful Puzzles - The mix of Point &amp; Click and FPS is a refreshing change - Challenging without being impossible - Does not hold your hand (you can spend hours trying to figure out a simple puzzle because you missed an item earlier in the level, which is wonderful!) - Those FMV sequences are wonderful despite the aged quality  Cons:  - Controls cannot be remapped in game - Mouse is super wonky (it was designed around ball mice, so optical mice go nuts on it, lower your dpi if possible) - The resolution is pretty bad - Sound levels aren't normalized and can sometimes be a bit much on headphones.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a classic game with some excellent story and a very unique feel. I will probably finish this game again. However, one thing everyone should do is remap their keys (you'll have to find the .ini for it), as the default keyset is pretty bad (though old school players will fall into it pretty quick). For a game that's almost two decades old, it hasn't lost its charm, even if the graphics are dated.",

            "review_text": "Realms of the Haunting is the seamless blend of horror, point-and-click, and FPS.  Realms of the Haunting also happens to be a near-flawless masterpiece that represents everything a game of its time could be, and so, so much more. AI is clunky, controls are stiff, music is sub-par, but still it not only succeeds, but passes with flying colors as a game wholly unlike any other. It's atmospherically excellent, surprisingly being genuinely chilling and sometimes downright frightening despite its obvious age. The gameplay itself is fairly standard — proceed throughout the corridors, shoot, solve puzzles, and generally explore the wonderful environments to further the story. Oddly enough, the story is very engrossing in its overall simplicity but also its complexity, which somehow both describe it perfectly despite being antonyms. Even with its cons, there is something so bizarrely charming and alluring about it, and it delivered one of the best experiences I have ever had in gaming.  There is a palpable amount of love, care, and attention put into this game, and it shines through in every moment. Realms of the Haunting is a flawed masterpiece, and a criminally underrated gem.  Edit: I have re-written my review as I was unsatisfied with how I had written it previously.",

I would rank it up there with Wolfenstien, Doom, Half life etc. In alot of ways it was 10 years ahead of its time. It was weird, challenging, puzzling, and immersive. I don't know if I would ever play it though again, and it might be too dated even for me, but it gets special credit for being one of the few that cemented what will probably be a lifelong interest in PC games and RPG's.",

It's a horror puzzle solving game at its best with an interesting story and twist ending. Even when the game starts you get chills down your spine with the monster eye opening. The only bad thing is the controls were not updated to allow mouse look around. It is wasd to move and arrow keys to look and then use mouse to search which takes some getting used to. Get over the controls and the dated graphics and its a fantastic game",

            "review_text": "I will admit to being a little biased here, as this is the fourth time I've bought this game - I bought the original UK version, the US version, the GOG download, and now again here on Steam. Why? Because I really, really like it.  Graphically, the game hasn't aged well, unfortunately. It came along at this time when everybody was transitioning from sprite-based 3D games to polygon-based 3D games, and rather than develop a new engine, the creators chose to use the revamped engine from their own game 'Normality'. Possibly the game was already in development when Quake came out and it would have cost too much to start again. It's still fairly pretty though, except for the low-resolution textures.  Sonically, the game is amazing. On the whole the voice acting is very good (David Learner, yeah!) except for a couple of overly-hammy moments, but the sound effects are where the game shines. The rolling thunder in and around the house, the whispered voices in the Tower, the sloshing of water and crunching of rats as you pass over them all add tremendously to the effect.  Gameplay wise, the game was quite innovative for the time. The developers themselves say in the making-of video they didn't want to just do 'Doom [with] some cruddy logic', and what you have here is more of a point-and-click adventure game done from a first-person perspective, with some gunplay. For some reason people say this game is hard and you don't get enough healing potions, but I never had that problem. Maybe I've just played it too much. The controls may also be a pain for you if you're used to WASD with mouse, but I'd just come from playing Duke Nukem 3D and so found them quite intuitive.  The story of the game is it's highlight, though. What seems like a straight forward 'investigate a strange house' plot quickly expands into something that covers the Knights Templar, the Book of Revelations, and a madman's plot to incarnate Satan in physical form. Yes. Whilst some of the plot is told via cut-scenes, a lot of the backstory is gleaned from scrolls, books and letters found around the place, so they can be missed.  I highly recommend this game, although do perfectly understand those who think it hasn't aged well. And I'll admit the last couple of chapters where they throw in some puzzles that have nothing to do with the plot can be frustrating, but there's always walkthroughs for that....",
