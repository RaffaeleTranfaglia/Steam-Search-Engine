            "review_text": "This is quite plainly a, by definition, half-♥♥♥♥♥ PlayStation1 Emulator; so weak is the port that the on-screen indicators are PSX icons and annoying to navigate. It offers no audio or visual improvements at all, running at a painfully dated VGA resolution (320x240x256c). It doesn't even seem to run at 60-fps on a desktop gaming tower. You don't even get the benefit of a copy of 'Vegas' on CD and, for that matter, a way to play another CD in-line.  Do yourself a favor: find a copy of the PlayStation CD-ROM, get an accelerated PSX emulator (some of them are free) or even just a used PS1. Honestly! This class of shovelware is overpriced at a dollar..",
