            "review_text": "NOTICE: I have not played the Rising Tides expansion. It seems pretty cool, but my review is more focused towards vanilla Beyond Earth.   It took a lot of DLC and updates to make Civ V what it is now. It also took huge bundle deals on expansions to make the game worth the cost. I love Civ V, by the way.  I don't hate BE. I just don't think it'll be worth playing until it's more polished and has more content. Even then, I would never recommend buying day 1. Just wait until the expansions are included and everything is on sale. It's essentially the same deal as Civ V was.  'but the company has to get money somehow!'  Yeah, well, make a better product. Make me WANT to buy right away.",

            "review_text": "Addenum: Rising Tide:  Again, I tried to like the expansion but many of the original problems remain.   Improvements:  - diplomacy: is more complex but that doesn't necessarily mean better. Most of the time I don't bother contacting the other leaders but just blindly accept their proposals. At least there's a little more to it now. Still not my cup of tea. There seems to be too many optoins without any of them being overy substantial.   - graphics: the sea is really nice.   Problems:   - wonders: are still horrible. None of them really are wonderful. Their effects are for the most part, minor.   - map: too busy. There's so much on the map it's very often hard to see your units.   - resources: there are too many resources. It's hard to keep track of what does what and why I need one over the other. None of them really seem special. I prefer Civ V's limited number, although they started to throw in more near the end just for the sake of having more which I didn't agree with. BERT could have done much better to have fewer resources but make the effects more substantial (needed for more buildings/units).   - buildings: way, way too many buildings. This woudn't be a bad thing but they have many of the same effects (one will offer 2 health, another will offer 1, another will offer 1 health and 1 science). I'd prefer fewer buildings but with more substantial effects.   Conclusion/short review: I applaud the efforts of the Devs/Firaxis and mainly bought the expansion out of loyalty and a wish to support Firaxis. I was hopeful but it's not the game for me. After 7 hours of play I've deleted the game. I'm now waiting for Civ VI. Certainly, a few of the things from BERT could be incorporated into VI like diplomatic capital which I thought was interesting.     I really tried to like this game but I have to give it a thumbs down.   Short review:   - the game lacks personality. - the leaders are bland. - diplomacy is worse than Civ V - colour palatte/graphics make it hard ot distinguish tiles - buildings are boring and non-descript - wonders are underpowered and unimaginative - there are better games out there (Endless space, endless legend, Gal CIV III (when it comes out).  Don't buy it.   Long review:  Problems:   (1) Leaders: It's certainly been said before, the leaders are boring. They have no personality. They're animations are basically the same as well.   (2) Diplomacy: Civ V's diplomacy was a huge stepdown from Civ IV but what made it passable was the excellent leader animations which made the model tolerable. With BE, you have the exact same diplomacy from V but with bland leaders.  They had a real opportunity to make this game stand out but they decided to add in feature after feature rather than refining what was there. One common complaint regarding Civ V was the diplomacy but it seems the Devs here could really care less. Too bad. Great diplomacy could have rescued this game  (3) Graphics: Certainly the graphics are different than what you see in V but they are ultimately forgetable and very frustrating. The biggest complaint I have is it's impossible to tell what some tiles are without hovering the mouse over them. On some planets you'll have purple tundra which looks very simlar to purple grassland which looks similar to plains. ARRGH.   (4) Too many buildings: I think what ended up happening is when they were making the game the Devs realized you run out of things to do quickly since the game isn't very deep. Hence, they added more buildings to give you something to do with your cities rather than just allocating them to wealth, research, production. The end result is you get building 1 which give 1 health, and building 2 which gives 2 health and 1 science, and building 3 which gives 2 health and 2 science. None of them are interesting or something you'd b-line a tech to get because it will help you. They are all forgetable.   (5) Wonders are horrible: Wonders in every Civ game were something that ultimately could give you a good boost. In BE they are basically slightly more powerful verisons of the normal buildings you'd already build but they cost 5-10 times as much. I don't even remember the names of any of them. Again, they're forgetable.   (6) Victory conditions are too similar: Three of the 5 conditions are pretty much the same: Build special building, then in 30 turns you win the game if you remember to click the buildling every turn (yes, this is a simplification but that's pretty much it). Again, forgetable.   Really the entire game is: forgetable. There are other games I'd try before spending any money on BE. Endless space, despite it's shortcomings really had more charm and gameplay. Endless legend is way better.   If you doubt my review, check out the latest game play stats. Despite getting a huge patch a day ago the number of players hasn't jumped beyond 6200. Civ V, 4 years since release, is still at 35000.   Firaxis dropped a rare bomb here. I truely hope that the Devs who worked on this don't play any significant role in Civ VI.",

            "review_text": "I have been playing Cvilization for almost 25 years already. I was addicted to CIV I as a kid, played CIV II A LOT when I was in college, then Civilization Call to Power which was also pretty good. I did play CIV III a bit, but went quickly on to CIV IV which I played for years and years and years, with all official expansions, and installed and played A LOT of community mods, some of which were absolutely fantastic (thinking of Fall from Heaven II and Caveman2Cosmos and sooooo many others). I played CIV IV Colonization and throughly enjoyed it as well in its relative simplicity.  The Civilization series altogether are the games I played the most in my life. Every new version that would come out was better than the previous, more complex, more accurate, more fun.  Then came this trend of the past few years to simplify games, make them more mobile oriented, more mass consumable by people who play for 20 minutes then buy the next game.  This trend is extremely noticeable in CIV V and also on CIVBE. Even the expansions of these games only bring back concepts that were included in previous versions of CIV, sometimes even on the basic 'vanilla' ones. There is almost nothing new in these two games with few exceptions (like the tech tree in CIVBE, which is still only tiny when compared to CIV IV with Caveman2Cosmos mod)  I bought CIV V Complete and played some hours, then didn't even bother and only tried CIVBE during a free weekend, and I say with my decades of experience with Civilization: go play CIV IV, install all mods, try them. Then you will never even want to look at the newer versions again.  Call me old fashioned... but I do wish Civilization would go back to its roots of being among the most accurate and complex games around. Sid Meier lost it along the way.

I even played that facebook civ, which was surprisingly good (except for the constant puzzles). Yet.. this is the first civilization game for which I have felt compelled to leave a review..  As much as it pains me to say, this Civ release does not merit a full title price tag. In terms of gameplay, Civ:Beyond Earth does in fact feel like a glorified mod of Civ5, and not the best one either. The new sci-fi graphics and sound are very nice and well done. Graphically, the game looks much better than civ 5, even though this may not be apparent in screenshots.. however this is not enough to cover up the fact that the core game underneath it all is quite boring.  Though the affinity and starting condition customizations seem like a huge step forward for the franchise, they actually take away all sense of identity for individual players. The AI civs have been axed even further due to the fact that they have a lot less dialogue and options of interaction. The lack of technological ages and culturally themed buildings also detract from the sense of character that the game has. The overall result of the gameplay changes in Civ Beyond Earth make the game feel like a mad dash towards a specific goal. This is very different from the epic, multi-staged journey that civ fans expect. I found it very hard to become attached to my civ, or to care much about winning, as the game quickly becomes a 'assign production and trade routes, end turn and repeat cycle.' The devs on this game admit to being fans of Endless Space, and the game actually suffers from the same major flaw.. of being extremely well polished, functional, and pretty, but utterly devoid of character.  The flow of the game feels very bland, especially in comparison to the brave new world expansion for civ 5. Being on an alien world provides the game developers with a virtually unlimited number of interesting scenarios to throw at the player, thanks to decades of accumulated fiction that can be drawn upon. Instead, the game presents all of that intrigue in the form of a box of flavor text each time you build a new type of building.   Among some other missed opportunities that are uniquely available to the setting of beyond earth which were missed are.. Under-water or subterranean settlement, more robust and fleshed out space units, natural wonders and catastrophes, sci-fi themed luxury resources.  All in all, this game was a letdown, and quite overrated. Lets hope Civ6 brings a more memorable experience to the table.  EDIT: The AI's aggression needs to be fixed. They are far too passive. I have played 3 games and the only war I have been a part of thus far was one of my own making.   EDIT2: The game lacks a victory summary.. of any kind. What is up with that?? Seriously.",

I have played all the games and even played Civ1 on a emulator on my computer just for the feel of it.  I have never in my life counted down the days for a game release like I did with this one, and I have never been so disapointed in my life before.  -The game is basically a tasteless reskin of Civ5 (yes it is).  -The AI is horrible -The diplomatic characters and diplomacy window are/is tasteless and boring. -The game, characters, civilizations lack a proper background story, to much is left for the imagination.  -Aliens are a moderated form for barbarians (yes they are, just because they get more or less angry at you, dont give them any more personality than barbarians. There is so much more FIraxis could have done with the concept of aliens living on a future planet than this) -The tech map is a cheap rip off from another sci-fi game, It lacks proper icons and pictures like in other CIV games -The indian girl reading lines is annoying and considering that all the lines are made up from future great persons make the game really unpersonal to me.  -The auto function for the workers is heavily bugged. THey end up doing the same actions again and again, miasma blocks roads when they could simply build around. -The trade function on larger games is tedious as you have to chose the same route or new one over and oaver again after a fixed number of turns. There is no function to tell the trade vessel 'stay ont hat route, dont ask me again'.  -It lacks videos and graphics (hell even the first awesome trailer movies are not included in the game!),  -When you build buildings in CIV 5, you see nice small icons/pictures that represent that building, but not in this game, it looks like Firaxis made their outmost best to do less work on this game.  -When you finish the game, it basically pops up a small cheap painting with an indian girl reading two lines (no stats, no videos, no nothing.. wow.. talk about wanting to play again..) -The game should have included the Progenitor race returning and the factions having a battle against them or becoming allies with them (but I bet Firaxis and 2K will launch this as an expansion for the sake of money) -The affinity system gives the game some originality, but it grows old to fast.  -Has no wonder videos or neat graphics, just a simple architect like scetch of each wonder you build.. they could have done so much more visually.. I mean a wonder is a WONDER.. it should really make the player feel that he/she really built something awesome, instead you feel.. I dont know.. disconnected.  Im not saying dont buy and play. Im just saying, dont buy it for the kind of money they want now. Wait for it to go for the cheap, play it a couple of times, then let it rot on the library list. The game is basically an insult to anyone who plays Civ games and should have been an expansion to Civ5 (which it is) and not a single game.   Just saying....",

Not awful, just boring and slow with no real direction for the player to follow.  It's just a reskin of Civ 5 with no real new gameplay at all and nothing to do with Alpha Centauri. Vague and difficult to understand due to odd and poorly explained goals and a tech web that follows no real structure. Only worth it if you've not played Civ 5 or Alpha Centauri as otherwise you'll be let down by what a sideways step this represents for Firaxis games. I'd expect this kind of low effort expandalone sequel from the Call of Duty franchise, not from Sid Meier's team.  Expansions may return the series to a more solid footing but at this price it's simply not worth it for a game that turns into a boring button pressing exercise for the last 200 hundred turns.",

I expected more ART. Building a wonder no longer shows a brilliant art piece, instead it shows a dinky gray-scale model. The fun, intrigue, inspiration, and excitement is gone. Not worth 50$ at all. Once again just like Civ5 the multi-player is even worse, non-stop crashing, and people getting booted from the game. And all this boils down to, a poorly made mod, for a five year old title.

Going to be short, but this version of Civilization requires you to know wtf are you doing, you can't casually walk on a tech tree like in Civ V, you can't let your scout autoexplore, you can't mindlessly ignore the quest system, you can't, you can't, you can't.   The tech web makes it so you have options, but knowing your endgoal is a must in this game so you don't get lost in said web, like I did starting out. 'I guess I'll research genetics, my advisor suggests so' - No, this is wrong, - 'I am researching genetics because else I am getting into negative health within 30 turns' - this is the approach.  Cultural synergy makes you plan ahead, once again, because if you don't take it into account - you play suboptimally and lose.  Quests, Diplomatic capital( abilities and agreements ), orbital management - Civ BE has a lot of systems, many may think more than needed, but when I realised how everything works together, the game started shining for me. I really enjoy the excessive amount of things I need to keep in mind when playing, to play optimally. This feeling when everything you do is done with a far going plan in mind, when everything works, when you adapt your strategy on the fly and everything still goes according to the plan - that is why I launch Civilization BE every once in a while.",

It can be fun without it too, but it depends a lot on your expectations and how much you're ready to spend on a game for hours played. The AI/politics play in this Civ titles is very lukewarm compared to the main series, and while the victory conditions are somewhat less varied due to being mostly tied to the affinity system, they are better designed than in any of the main series games in my opinion. Other than that it's basically Civilization V without any of its gameplay perks like interesting and unique leader abilities, or great design of technology and social policy progression.   The DLC makes Beyond Earth stand out as a full-fledged Civ spin-off with its own unique diplomacy system, quest system (better than both Civ IV random events or Civ V city-state questing) and innovative naval play. If you already own this game or are able to find it with a great discount, I recommend only playing it when you can find the Rising Tide DLC with slightly reduced price tag. The vanilla Beyond Earth is not worth 40€.   tl;dr: Buy Rising Tide if you own this game. Skip if you don't.",

Now that we've got that out of the way, I think your impression of this game might depend largely on your expectations. If you're expecting something revolutionary and different then you might want to wait for this one to go on sale so it's comparably priced to a DLC or an expansion and continue to patiently wait for Civilization VI, which Beyond Earth is not.   If you want a solid 4x game with great graphics, a gorgeous color palette, beautiful map terrain and cool resources, immersive music, an interesting premise, and chock full of sci-fi references, then you'll probably enjoy this. I can't stop playing it, I just want to test out all the new victory types and see what all the units look like after upgrades attached to each of game's the three affinities. Even though much of the game -- from the UI to the AI -- feels familiar, there's enough that's fresh that you have to pay attention to the details. And I keep finding myself pleasantly surprised by the new stuff I discover. And sometimes I find myself familiarly irritated by some of the things that have plagued most incarnations of Civilization games, like repetitive AI that offers insanely lopsided trade 'deals' and then launches an attack a turn after telling you how awesome you are.  I really like the addition of quests to the game, even though sometimes it's difficult or even impossible to complete some of the tasks (also wow fragile explorers). Once you accept that though, the tasks you can do become a nice little addition to the game and a way to earn extra bonuses while you're playing.  On the down side, the end-game tends to drag a bit, and some of the victory conditions have 'false summits' in which you think you are almost there but then find out that you have to have to jump through hoops for another 50 turns in order to actually win.  I wish there were some more statistical and information options for those of us who like to really delve deeply in our strategy games and think things through completely before committing to a path. I also wish there were more incentives to cooperate with the other colonies, like science and economic boosts for signing cooperation agreements. I'd have liked more emphasis on science, perhaps via the ability to enter into research agreements through diplomacy or the ability to trade techs like in earlier Civ games.  Overall, I'd say that the fact that I played the game for over 40 hours in less than a week speaks to its value, at least in my eyes. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun and it definitely has that 'one more turn' factor that makes it a solid addition to the Civ family.",

            "review_text": "Civilization: Beyond Earth will look and feel familiar to Civ V players, but this is not simply a sci-fi remake of Civ V. The game is far more tactical, which will please long-time strategy game players. The alien worlds are gorgeously detailed and provide new challenges to players. The integrated quest system serves to highten your game experience by giving you opportunities to mould your civilisation beyond the endless build, expand, build gameplay of previous Civilization entries, thereby allowing a great deal of customisation. Alien life is complex enough to be pleasing and genuinely terrifying if you don't keep an eye on alien nests.  Diplomatic functions are exactly the same as Civ V's, which is not a surprise given that BE is built on the same engine - there are some expanded functions but nothing inherently noteworthy. Future expansions might play with diplomacy a bit but for now, if you've played Civ V, you know exactly how to run the diplomatic system.  The Virtue system works incredibly well. Gone are the nine policy trees - you now have four, called Virtues, but they are divided into three tiers, and completing each tier gives you significant bonuses. This allows the game to acheive a far more interesting level of complexity than Civ V's policies. You can choose to max out a Virtue tree, or mix it up a bit depending on needs. Each tree is as viable as one another, so gone are the days of maxing Patronage to secure an easy win.  The technology web, so highly touted by Firaxis, is implemented well. Each technology has high strategic value, and Firaxis did well to incorporate Harmony, Supremacy and Purity points throughout the tree. You don't need to research everything, and in fact can research any branch at any time - no need to wait forever for that one technology that will confer that bonus you've wanted since turn one.   There are some slight graphical issues, but those will be fixed in an upcoming patch. Tiles can and will flicker occassionally, which gets annoying, and the only way to fix it is to save and reload the game. It's not a huge deal though - the rest of the game is beautifully polished.  Don't be surprised if this is the AAA game of the year. 10/10.",

I like how you can shape your playstyle and it is reflected in your units/buildings/victory type. However, it really becomes apparent that if you are going to go for a specific victory, you really need to know that right at the start. It doesn't really allow for adaptive gameplay.   Militarily, I find that it also makes the game suffer. The biggest advancements come from seeking a specific affinty right from the get-go. Choosing a research becomes a game of 'Which _____ would be quickest' just to get a (devastatingly good) unit upgrade. Again, you become really locked into what you choose right at the beginning.  Civ 5, I felt, was completely polished by the last expansion; and it's kind of a shame that they didn't apply everything that was learned from that to this addition to the series. Leaving out certain things such as the religion system or U.N. (rather, a setting-specific alternative) seems very short sighted.",

            "review_text": "So I'm 7 hours in and I can already tell you what this game is worth to me. Honestly I really don't want to say this but a lot of those who said that this should be a paid scenario for Civ 5 are 100% correct. This game is essentially just a reskinned civ 5 with a few added gimmicks (tech web doesn't count, all thats changed on that front is its no longer a linear path from left to right) and some minor changes here and there.  So lets begin with my first irk, the factions. Normally in a civ game you'd have all the historical factions from every era like the Romans, French, Vikings etc with their own unique bonuses, units and city layouts. Well that's certainly not the case here with Civ Beyond earth. For example you have the Slavic Federation and the ARC (American Reclamation Corporation), now you'd expect the buildings and units to look like futuristic Russians and Americans right?, well you'd be entirely wrong there. All units are exactly the same with no visual difference (even the special upgraded units are the same for each faction) or stat changes from start to finish, making the experience of choosing a faction completely pointless as they are exactly the same.  What makes this even worse is that during the custom game set up screen you are literally given the faction logo and a paragraph of text to help you decide the faction you want to play as, but seeing as they're all the same anyway there isn't any point in deciding a faction beyond choosing the one with the name that you like.  The only true addition to this game is the affinity system with its three selections to choose from. The latter being Harmony which allows you to acquire alien units, Supremacy which turns you into a robotic cyborg race and Purity which gives the middle finger to everything non human. This is where all the visual changes take place and the higher you go up an affinity the more your faction changes, but that is also pointless as all the factions are the same anyway and will always have the same units as you meaning choosing an affinity is purely a cosmetic choice.  The aliens themselves do add a bit more of a challenge as opposed to the barbarians of old, being more of a mini faction that you have to deal with and will become stronger the more you play. But even they are just as easily dealt with just like the barbarians as you can simply put up force field barriers that repel all aliens, regardless of strength, from as early as turn freakin 50. One of the most reported strongest aliens during the early game stage, the seige worm, was easily dealt with as I simply put up barriers in all of my cities and had them shoot at the worm until it was dead, and all it did was move back and forth trying to get to my units just behind the force field, making what I thought was a terrifying enemy into more of a simple pest that is just as easily swatted away as the barbarians.  Honestly I could go on but right now I'm too tired from all the bland dullness that this game is emanating so I'll just wrap this up with a final verdict. Don't buy this and just stick with Civ 5, wait for mods to come out and for the price to drop before even thinking of buying this. Whilst it's not a game that's on par with horrible games like Big Rigs or Air Control, it's so incredibily dull and bland that you'd be better off playing those games instead, just so you don't end up falling asleep after only 200 turns.   So with all that the final score is: 5/10  Come back in a month or two when all them smart modders make this game worth £30  P.s Might write a full review once I play a bit more (god help me on that one) and post it on youtube so this score isn't final for me.",

AI, diplomacy, city management, unit management and function, among other things, are nearly identical, which would not be so terrible if CIV5’s weak points were not copied to a dot as well (yes, including the broken/cheating AI).  The unit customization we were promised is almost comical. Landscape is repetitive. The different factions are virtually identical to each other. Aliens are boring and pretty much pointless except as hindrance at the beginning of the game before you get better tech. City states are just trade posts now with essentially no function and are 99% irrelevant to the gameplay. They did rework espionage nicely though and the orbital units/layer are nice, but not very varied. They could have done a lot more with it!  UI is not great... They should have taken some cues from games by Amplitude Studios when it comes to that… it doesn’t feel like it belongs in 2014 at all. Also what's up with end game? The screen tells me that I won or lost and I’m back at the main menu. No recap, no score breakdown, no map, no ranking, not even a reason WHY I won or lost...  It is at least relatively stable and free of any major bugs based on my experience. Some small bugs and one crash so far after ~14 hours of play. Others have not had such luck however from what I've read? Having already played games like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Pandora First Contact, Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, Sins of a Solar Empire, and Endless Legend I was really hoping for a lot more (they were not exactly pioneering the genre here), especially with all the hype and promises.  Being a huge fan of the Civilization games and CIV5 I was immensely excited for this game and even pre-purchased it, which I have never done before for any game… and whew! What a letdown. Really tried loving the game, but I just can’t force myself do it. I like it enough, it’s a good start, but it’s entirely unfinished. Would rather just play CIV5 or fire something up by Paradox Interactive. EU4 here I come! BE, sorry, but you were a waste of money. Should have waited for the 75% off sale. It needs the equivalent of what Gods &amp; Kings and Brave New World did to CIV5 ASAP. Never pre-ordering a CIV game again... haha If you haven't bought it yet then just wait for a Steam sale, or similar.",

            "review_text": "Civ:BE is a very similar experience to Civ 5, adding very little to better the series and missing many opportunities. I don't think the game is terrible, but it's definitely sub-par in my opinion. The base game is good, but the current content is underwhelming and bland. I will briefly go over all of the new features and changes to the game that improved the experience, and those that hampered it.  The Good -------------- [Web Tech Tree] Giving players more freedom in their technology choices creates for a much more open experience. The 'late game' technologies are just a few nodes away if a player chooses to go straight (usually not a good idea though). Civ V's linear tech tree was ok, but your options were severely limited and you often ended up with a similiar path each game.  [Espionage] Spying is actually interesting now. Whereas in Civ 5 the espionage system was just a fire and forget kind of system, the new spy system feels much more involved, allowing you to have a lot more control over what you do - from siphoning energy (money) from the enemy capitol or potential overthrowing the city and claiming it for your own. Yes, you can steal cities. I've done so in the past by rushing the technology with the Russian's free tech bonus and it is hilarious.  [Satellites] Not a real complex system, just a nice little addition to the game. Basically you place a stationary unit that affect a grid of tiles under it for X amount of turns.  [Expeditions] Right away your Explorer unit can dig up artifacts from satellites and other things much like an archaeologist from Civ V. This adds a neat extra thing to do early game.  The Bad  -------------- [Technological Progression] The tech tree might have improved its layout, but as a player I felt very detached from the world. I don't even know what I'm researching 90% of the time. What the hell is Alien Ethics? What kind of upgrades can I expect from something like Field Theory or Transcendental Math? Why do I need to research Physics and Engineering? I mean it's so far in the future, shouldn't I already have a really good grasp over those? As I get more and more research, I don't feel any progression. In Civ V it was VERY obvious, as your people went from cavemen to a more civilized and culture people ... but in Beyond Earth it feels so cold and lifeless, nothing I do has any real visual impact on my faction.  [Quests/Decisions] A new system which allows you to make small decisions throughout the game. Do you want +1 Food, or +1 Energy? +5 unit healing or +1 Science and Energy? As well as things like 'Be nice to the bugs, or eradicate them (affects affinities)'. These are soon forgotten and very inconsequential. By the time you reach the end of the game, you'll have more or less forgotten about your choices as they have such an incredibly low impact on the game. This system is good conceptually but was executed in a very boring way.  [Wonders] Unexciting and bland. Even the 'you completed the wonder' message is lame, unlike Civ V where it felt like a huge accomplishment, wonders in BE are just a major let down. There also seems to be a serious lack of variety with them, but maybe that's just me.  [Factions] Not only are the wonders boring in this game, so are the leaders, factions, the sponsors, the affinities. Every aspect of customization is boring as hell. The only thing that separates each faction is a single bonus and a color scheme. All of the choices you make when you start the game (and there aren't many choices, to be honest) are unexciting. Do you want to start with a worker, or a soldier, or maybe you want pioneering for free? Civ 5 offered a couple of unique units/buildings/tile improvements and a few unique abilities that would really set each race apart - but everything feels so samey now. I often forget what faction I picked in Civ BE... that was never the case in Civ 5, where I was constantly reminded of what civilization I chose.  [Religion] No religion? They could have at least added something in its place, like politics or some kind of alien cult-worshiping stuff. Religion was one of my favorite aspects of Civ V and BE feels like it's missing a huge chunk of variety because it's gone.  [City States] Their new version of city states are just a building that you can do a trade route with. Basically the same thing except they don't offer quests.   [Affinities] You level them up linearly from 0 to 13, you occasionally pick some unit upgrades, and there's a few bonuses like 'Aliens won't attack your Explorer' and 'Units take less damage from miasma.' The unique units even feel pretty similar across all 3 affinities. I was really hoping there'd be like an additional social-policy/tech-tree thing to choose how to customize how the affinities affect my faction, but that's not the case. The Affinities don't add much to the experience.  [World Variety] This is one of the most lack-luster elements of the game. There's virtually NO variety for planets in this game. I've played most of the way through 5 games so far and started about a dozen different new maps and I must say every planet looks really similar. I was hoping for some crazy randomization, both visually and mechanically, but instead I got a bunch of boring Earth-like planets. Where's the color? I want some planets with bright, deep color palettes. I want to see worlds with extreme weather like lightning and sandstorms, planets with no oxygen, more variety for wild life. Why is every indigenous alien bug species exactly the same for all worlds? I guess every single planet other than earth is inhabited by a race of mostly-passive gigantic green bugs.  [Neutral Aliens] They do nothing, usually. Even if I attack them every turn for a long time they don't get mad at me (I've played on both Apollo (8) and Gemini (6) difficulty so far). Then there's the siege worm which is just a minor nuisance that is unkillable until much later into the game, kind of like a natural disaster. I don't think it adds anything to my experience, it's just stupid. There's also ZERO variety in aliens, as I've mentioned above in world variety. Everything is a stereotypical 'bug race'.  [Computer's AI] The AI is completely brain-dead. Even on Apollo difficulty, which apparently just makes them cheat, the AI does nothing to thwart my efforts. With just a small army of infantry/rangers/artillery supported by a couple of mid-game units I can wipe out all of the AI with ease. They will ask me 'please I beg of you, give me this resource things aren't going so well', and when I try to accept they angrily decline and say 'I MUST ASK FOR MORE'. That's like I asked you for a cookie, and when you tried to say 'Sure' I was insulted that you were offering me only a cookie and not milk also. The only way to make Civ:BE a challenging single player experience is to give yourself a major disadvantage by modding the game or purposely stacking the odds against you.  [Micro-Management] Automation AI is still terrible. It will constantly make bad decisions when prioritizing tiles, so you gotta manually pick each tile yourself if you wanna be effective. What's worse is that the game stops notifying you about a new citizen after the 5th one per city. Why is there no option to turn that back on? Also they've done nothing to add more depth to the game since Civ 5. It's the same old 'allocate citizens to tiles, choose production' route. I was really hoping they'd get more creative with what you can do but maybe they were worried it would confuse new players?  The Ugly -------------- The game will rely on DLC to feel complete.  Since I know the game will be another DLC/Expansion-pack circle-jerk, I cannot with a good conscience recommend this game to anyone but hardcore Civ-Fans. I don't think I wasted my money, but I am definitely disappointed. I'll probably continue to play the game until I'm sick of it, but I just wish they did a better job.  Rating: C",

            "review_text": "Just won my first marathon game! I wanted to play the most alien thing I could so I played on a Fungal world, played for Transcendance, and set aliens to 'high'. I'll compare the game to Civ 5 rather than AC since I think thats more relevant to those claiming it to be DLC-like.  Pros:  -Game runs smoother than Civ5. Even in late game the game loaded turns faster which may be something to consider if that caused you major grievances on less than awesome machines. -No happiness. Several things simply got a 'sci-fi' name from Civ5 counterparts, but happiness being replaced with the health system is a very good thing. Large empires in more difficult settings were kind of a silly thing to do in Civ5 so this really opens the game up more. -Tech tree. Its more complicated than normal research in Civ5 and many of the sub-branches allow you to further your affinity that shape your civ. Its possible to go into mupltiple branches that dont link well early on, or do the opposite and go too far in one branch without getting basics from others that leave you crippled. I think there will be good metagame here. -Starter perks. Unlike Civ5 where you start as some thugs beating rocks together, BE lets you pick your crew types, spaceship type, and supplies you bring with you that lends to a more custom start up appropriate to a sci-fi setting. -Esp and Trade are the same and slightly improved from the Civ5 versions that came in DLC. The spys in BE have far more options here that can really hurt your enemies (I let out a thumper that called Alien Siege Wurms in an enemy city) and the amount of trade routes you have running rivals that of Venice without actually playing a 1 city civ. -Aliens. I started my game with the sensors that locate alien nests, which populate over the largest xeno pools in the game (a resource needed for a heavy Harmony Affinity) so I knew right off if I wanted to re-start the game and where I would first go for my expansions. The alien hordes themselves feel more natural in civ. They basically behave like aggresive animals and I appreciated their AI far more than 'barbarians', even on their most aggresive setting. -Satalite layer. I didnt get too far into satalites as some affinities might with orbital attacks but these really add new options. Some would populate un-modded areas with lux and strategic resources, another pumped down miasma (a toxic gas thats poisons enemies but heals and gives combat bonus' to Harmony civs), and this giant low orbit squid that pooped more miasma and gave combat bonus' to units down below. Its definately a good addition. -Late game. The combat in late game gets really fun. All your units get upgraded for free based on your chosen affinity and by the end all your 'rovers' and 'missile rovers' are hovertanks flying across the ocean. The affinity-based units, and mega-units are a huge deal. 1 turn before my MInd Flower finished I had 2 Evolved Xeno Titans (think GDR *10) wreck my enemies earth gateway while shrugging off all the stuff they were throwing at them the whole time; it was a good ending!  Cons: -NPC identities. The bonus' you get for each civ seem limited. In Civ5 you got more 'things' that defined you. You can definately shape your civ over time the way you want more in BE but by end-game you likely have your main affinity maxed and went on to others and begin to lose your uniqueness. The actual bonus' that are unique to your civ seem so marginal I kinda wonder why they even bothered putting them in. I'd have liked to see more special units/buildings or abilites for each civ that pushed them more in the dirrection of certain affinities. One civ asked me to declare war on another by the name of their leader alone and without being able to open my diplomacy tab I was just left thinking 'who the heck is that?'. Its not like you had the same issue in Civ5 when someone asked you to kill Washington but... I'm sure I'll get used to it. -City States, or outposts as they're called. The game dosnt just found cities; it starts them as an 'outpost' early on that developes into a city (which by itself I think is fine). My issue is these random outposts that pop up, never turn into full cities, and pretty much act like city states with even less options. Beyond a few good trade routes, they seem to be completelly irrelevant. NPC civs attack them without issue from the rest of the world, there is no friendship meter with these people. It seems a step in the wrong dirrection and lots of wasted potential. -No global politics. I know this was added in a DLC, but.. considering how these people are supposed to be futuristic, and instantly connected the moment they pop into the world, I find it wierd that there would be no futuristic council when the story goes: they just left a world that HAD one. AI of NPC civs in BE is slightly better but the global politics and amount of favors we curried from city states made the Civ5 game feel more developed on a global scale.  -No terraforming. I know know, its not AC, and I was honestly too young to even remember much about that game. I do remember the terraforming though which allowing you to + and - land and ocean, and being able to build cities underwater. A 'terraformed' tile improvement is just a really good jungle and you can do some terraforming-type stuff with the new satalites but I was kinda hoping for a little more. Maybe its a limitation with the Civ5 engine, but I still have my fingers crossed some DLC with add this.  All in all I think this is a very good game. I'd give it a 8-8.5 depending on much you &lt;3 sci-fi. I think I'll have quite a few very good playthroughs with the different affinities but I'm not sure I'll get as much playtime from this as Civ5. If that turns you off maybe wait until its a little cheaper but even at full price I still think its worth it. ",

Cons - It's just not as addicting. I can see myself putting around another twenty or so hours into this game. I have over 250 in CIV V and I imagine that will reach 300 hours eventually. - The leaders are not unique and are just aren't interesting. Part of the fun of CIV is playing as historical leaders through history, not random characters who you don't care for. - UI can be confusing at times. - Also, not enough leaders.   I do like the game, I do, but it just isn't as good as other games in the series. I may one day buy the High Tides DLC, but if not I can't see myself interacting with this game for much more than twenty or so hours, which is tiny compared to CIV V.  I would give this game a 6/10, and would say it's worth buying when it's around £10.",

I didn't pay $50 for it either; instead I got it pretty cheap, somewhere around $15 (Indian retail copy). It's worth the money considering what I paid for it. As far as the game is considered, it lost its charm after a few replays. The gameplay does get very monotonous, also, it's the same thing (progression) over and over again.  I can't recommend getting the game in its current state, maybe wait for some DLCs or get this during a sale or both.",

They lack depth, resources and are an in general a nuisance with unchecked faults. [can't declare war on them with a ranged unit to give an example] - the intrigue from spying is interesting, but I ended up with more spies than cities I could place them in. They only let you place a spy in someone's capital and not their other cities.  This game is new so this is an early review and I just needed to vent my frustrations.  I LOVE Civ V and hope they can raise the bar with this series to an equal if not better level.

There just isn't much here to praise even with a generous eye. When the gameplay is decent, that's because it's essentially re-skinned Civilization V. The tech web is really the only innovation that changes Civilization V's core design in some intriguing ways.  Otherwise, this is totally lacking in polish, in meaningful iterations of Civ V's designs, in anything that would give it one-more-turn attractiveness. The factions are dull and uninvolving, which I think explains why the designers were so eager to discourage comparisons between Beyond Earth and Alpha Centauri. The aliens are just pointless nuisances rather than a major, interesting wrinkle in the Civ formula. The game could barely give a ♥♥♥♥ about building Wonders--they get no description and their impact is buried under their incremental bonuses. The interesting endgame units often don't even come into play. The AI is fairly bad, though that's not exactly unique to this installment in the Civ series. The end of the game just sort of happens without fanfare. The whole thing feels amateurish and underimagined, like the job was shoved at some interns.   Civ V was underwhelming at launch too, but this has a much longer way to go before it's any good. I'm not sure that it even can be made good, compared to what was done with Civ V.",

So when i first heard about Beyond earth i was super pumped i unfortanetly bought into the hype and it bit me in the ♥♥♥ so hard. first of all if you want a new inovative civ game you wont be getting it. This 'new' game could honestly be a realy well done mod or hell they probaly could have just made this a big Dlc pack. the factions feal pointless as they offer next to no variation not to mention their are a lack of factions and unit variation in general. also unlike how you could have games of 16 in civ 5 now that number has been limited to 8 because of lack of factions i am guessing? They could have easily given each faction a unique unit and building but instead each faction gets a little wimpy bonus and diffrent color. The actual gameplay is exactly the same to civ 5 only with the new health system that in my opinon is broken and realy limits your empires growth while not even effecting the Ai.    Amitidaly the game has a few redeming factors like the planetery wonders and affinitys and even the difrent world types are real cool. But it need way more variation and content to even be considerd a new game. Even the Native aliens which are cooler than Barbs from civ 5 massivly lack variation and loose relevence after the 2nd age , the ' mighty' siege worm being killed by one tank unit and such.  They even dumbed down the mod buddy and such by removing the world builder which was huge fun for me in the last game. that realy pisses me of since their was no reason to get rid of it and they promised it in the pre release. Over all the game is ok but it dose not deserve to be considerd its own game at all. like i said eaither a good mod or big Dlc. Good for about 25 to 35 hours of fun depending of online freinds wait till its on sale to buy.   Over all its a 6 outa 10 for me and it saddens me to give it that score",

The a.i does almost nothing except makes a few cities even on the highest difficulty.  The civ leaders also lack any real kind of personality and just come off as boring. They have very few lines and practically all non-spoken dialogue is word for word from civ V.  The aesthetic for the tech web and so on is horribly designed. It is very hard to differentiate things or tell if the tech you're researching unlocks a wonder. It's all just boring as hell monochrome.  The aliens would have been a great addition if they actually would attack your cities and destroy improvements, currently they just mill around outside your borders (even without city upgrades that force them two spaces away from your cities) even if you start comitting alien jihad. Sure, they'll actively try to murder your units when you ♥♥♥♥ them off/are within two hexes of a nest, but otherwise they really don't do anything.  Espionage is very fun and worthwhile in this, with you building up intrigue in cities by doing operations with your spies in them, unlocking new operations you can do within them. You also get quit a few spies to conduct these operations with, so if you wanted to focus on that you easily can.  Trade routes are a lot more essential in this than in other civ games, especially since there's no max distance a caravan can travel (just need a clear route) and that you can have two trade routes in each city. The changes to them have made the game much more fast paced, since you will have quite a bit of currency to spend to directly purchase buildings/units.  All in all, I would wait for a sale and/or for the first expansion to come out to round out the game better, it just feels kinda bare gameplay-wise in some areas and has strange mechanics decisions in others (new cities being founded take a few turns before they're fully built and operational being one of them, it isn't annoying or anything, but it doesn't seem to accomplish that much in the long run). Do not believe the hype.  Alternatively, if you have a few friends to play this with, this is probably the best civ to do it with to date, since the games end faster than in other entries in the civ series.

When I bought-no, sorry, preordered-this, I played for a bit, realized I didn't know what I was doing, because of the nowhere-near-as-useful help system in Civ 5, watched the AI build wonders that I didn't know how to build because of the disorganized tech web as well as the fact that a Wonder looks like a normal building, and then played Civ 5. I really wish I waited for other people's reviews and give this one a miss. There's technically 1000 civs, no joke, but only eight sponsors, the things that would be considered actual civs. Eight's a bit of a step down from the full count of 43 with all expansions and DLC with no mods in Civ 5, plus, there's no feeling of dread if you meet a warmonger, no feeling of awesome when you meet that civ that's always your friend, and, since these are future civs, you have no idea what their personality is, especially their preferred affinity, as, it seems, that decides who your friends are. (Although these may not exist as I saw the Asian civ pick Harmony on my first full completion of the game, and Purity the second time, but since there are preferred ideologies in Civ 5, I'm assuming there probably is.) This game isn't terrible, but there are very few things that set it apart from Civ 5, and pretty much all of them have problems of their own. First, there's the tech web, which is a tech tree with less techs and higher science requirements. The tech web has 'branch techs' like Ecology which usually give a couple of buildings, like your average tech from Civ 5. It also has 'leaf techs' which, far more often than not, contain a level up in an Affinity and a bonus to an improvement or a wonder which does much less than one of its Civ 5 equivalents. Then there's the Affinities themselves: Harmony seeks to live in, well, harmony with the aliens and the planet, Supremacy turns your civ and its population into cyborgs, and Purity which does nothing but be human and dismiss everything else as 'false.' These Affinities, as said before, dictates who your friends will be, and it starts fairly close to the start. Even worse, it's quite difficult to change your main affinity, in fact, it's much more difficut than it is to change your ideology in Civ 5. None of the victory paths are familiar except for Domination, but the other ways are...odd. The Contact victory is essentially meeting God, the Emancipation victory turns all the people still on Earth into cyborgs, the Promised Land victory takes everyone from Earth to live on the new planet, and the Trancendence victory effectively makes everyone share a brain with the planet. These are more ridiculous than the Diplomatic victory in Civ 5, because there's just too many people on the planet to have one person rule over them. About the only good thing I can think of that doesn't have a defect somewhere is the Virtues, or Social Policies: Unlike Civ 5, they provide bonuses for adopting multiple policies horizontally as well as vertically. The game certainly is playable-I pretty much only play singleplayer in games in general-and I would go so far as to say it's good, even great if it was the first Civ game I played, but the first Civ game I played was Civ 5, and it's definitely not as good as that. Maybe when expansion packs and DLC come out, it'll be a pretty good game, but for a Civ game, the combination of unanimated character faces, or even the fact that their facial expression changes to anger when hostile/guarded, the slower tech speed, the lack of eras to know how far you've gotten through the game, the lack of unique units for civilizations (Affinity unique units do NOT count), the nerfing of City-States to Stations that give a fraction of what City-States gave you and the general blandness of the game (Civ 5 was a LOT brighter, as in brighter colours, as well as the generally absurd events that can take place during a game of it) leads to me not recommending this game. In the future it may be better, but for now, it is very disappointing, and currently not worth your money.  TL;DR: Read the second-last sentence.",

However, strip that progression away and the game is nothing.

Building some random Sci-Fi garbage like an Xenofuel Plant gives no sense of progression, that trademark civlilization feeling.

The tech tree, for instance, doesn't really *pop* out anything except the affinities. You get to search and hover over everything to figure out where the wonders are.  And on the topic of wonders...why don't many of them build anything at all? They feel very uninspiring and not very wonderful at all. I built 3 or 4 last game and not a single one of them had a building on the landscape.  The aliens are annoying. You go from barbarians that can be turned off or at their worst can be defeated in a 100 turns or so to aliens that are never ending, respawn nests, and harass your units ceaselessly. Or, you can build your tech tree to focus on being friendly and adapting to them. Who cares though? That isn't really very interesting, and again, the lack of anything physical from this (other than alien units) is very bland.  As for the AI, it is downright annoying. Diplomacy is one thing. Being spammed by the competition every single turn with the exact same boring audio and requests is awful. It doesn't take very long for their voices (especially the Asian lady) to grind on your ears like nails on a chalkboard.   Speaking of annoying, the trading is just awful. Every 20 - 30 turns you have to reassign your traders. They should adjust this to only needing interaction if they are attacked, the city is attacked/under siege, or if something changes with your relations with the other faction. If you have 10 - 20 trade convoys or vessels running, you can easily expect to spend 50% of your interactions in the game just managing them.  Oh, another UI problem....the victory types aren't explained. You can hover over most things in the setup of the game and get some information, but the victory types just say Domination (ok, duh), Contact, Promised Land, Emancipation and Transcendence. I had to look them up to figure out what some of them were.  The game **could** be fun, but it really is just a slightly different take on past Civ games with less of a physical presence in the world. Most of the things you do augment what you've already built, not build anything new. It is very common to have the territory and your units looking bland and similar at turn 1 and turn 200.  As it currently stands, I would not recommend this game. Civilization 5 was so well done, has so many mods, and the expansions are actually most of what this game contains. There is no reason to upgrade, and it is arguable that this is not an upgrade at all.",

I'll start with the few good aspects:  -'Customizable' Civs: This is a great feature because it really lets you fine-tune how you want to play in order to win. This customization also leads to unpredictability, allowing more replay value. -Tech Web: The tech web also allows you to customize what you're doing and how you're doing it with it's branching paths and tech 'leaves' to research. Because it's so non-linear, it's harder to tell what other Civs are researching, and that leads to more interesting, varied gameplay. -Aliens: If Barbarians were cannon-fodder, then these are the guys shooting the cannons. Never have you felt so threatened by 'barbarian' units as you have these guys. Naturally they eventually become less and less threatening with advanced combat technologies, although some of the aliens keep their threat kevel high even in the late-game. -Affinity-Specific Units: These are units that can only be unlocked through a combination of the tech web and having enough points in a certain Affinity. These units look cool and are fairly powerful, and create a bit of unit diversity.  Now for the bad. With 200+ hours in Civ 5, starting off post-Gods-and-Kings expansion, I'm no newcomer here, although I've still never been very good at playing but always enjoyed the game nonetheless. Even still, I was able to win on turn 317 on the normal difficulty when I had trouble doing something like that in Civ 5. In fact, it was so easy, I barely even played. I more of just micromanaged my four cities after putting up my anti-alien fence building. Near the end I even just went ahead and started razing my neighbors cities with my ultimate Harmony unit JUST TO BURN TIME UNTIL I WON. No one put up a fight against me, even my neighbor-now-enemy had just a few ranged units, one planted in each of his cities! I also found some of the gameplay changes, like Happiness to Healthiness and lack of some kind of Beyond Earth-equivilent of tourism/religion, made the gameplay feel very dumbed down. The game also felt very bland, as I never really saw any other units besides a standard Marine, Explorer, and Worker robot until I got my special units, and even then only saw them (this is more relating back to the AI seemingly being incredibly incompetent, but still a con nontheless). As well, the color pallette seems to have noticeably darkened, and personally becomes much more boring to look at as a result. All in all, I think Civ: Beyond Earth needs what Civ 5 got; A GnK/BNW expansion that adds more to and fixes the base game. In it's current state, I regret spending $50 for what feels like a polished beta of a game.  Pros: -Custom Civs and the tech web lead to unpredicatable gameplay with better replayability -Alien AI actually feel threatening and pose a challenge for a good portion of the game -Affinity-specific units look cool and are powerful; I was able to 1HKO an enemy outpost being built with my Harmony Ultimate unit. Cons: -Much easier/AI much dumber than Civ 5 -Gameplay changes like Happiness to Healthiness and lack of depth (no tourism/religion or equivilent) make the game feel dumbed down/lacking -Lack of unit diversity; everyone practically has the same units until they start specializing down their Affinity; even then the majority of units are just reskins with some different stats. -Color pallette is much darker; I personally found it to be unattractive after a long session.",

However, the 'hey, screw you, you lose' aspect of the game makes it feel like you just wasted a number of hours playing.   At this point I can't recommend the game.

            "review_text": "At first glance the game does seem drastically different than Civilization 5. There seems to be quite a lot of negative reviews but I personally find it to be a very pleasant addition to the Civilization series. I started playing the civilization games way back when I was in middle school and Civilization 3 had just came out.   Here was my experience of this futuristic take on the civilization series:  At first I had a hard time trying to get focus on the game and understand what was going on. I played very on and off for a few days and stopped playing for about a week. I later resumed playing the game again and took the same approach I did to learning civilization 3. Once I understood the new mechanics and got a handle on the terrain, resources, improvements, and the daunting orbital aspect ( which actually turned out to be very simple to understand and is a fantastic element I have come to enjoy. Especially because you can create resources ;D ) so on and so forth of the intricate elements of the game. Once I played through one game, all the way (win or lose and I actually lost this one though it was close haha I started my first game on Vostok difficulty) I honestly have not been able to stop playing it. A lot of the nuisances that were present in civ 4 and civ 5 such as battling happiness and upgrading military units to compete with higher level ai (these are just a couple).  I really like how the virtues truly give you the ability to customize your sponsor (civilization). When the virtue tree has 2 bonuses branching to a higher tier bonus, you no longer need both of those bonuses to grab that higher tier and only need to pick one.   The way units upgrade is a really cool approach as too. Again, it gives you full customization of your nation. Even when behind you can still put up a fight, albeit a struggle, but it is doable and winnable. It also gives hope to being able to win a game when quite a ways behind. The instant upgrade of all units once the upgrade has been earned (affinity level reached a certain level for a particular unit) is a very nice adaptation. I remember in civ 5 losing games becuase I had no money to upgrade units and continue to fund new units.   Ultimately, I found this game to be very challenging, rewarding, and so many different ways to play the game and enjoy! I highly reccomend this game for someone willing to put in the time it takes to learn a game. Even if you are a civilization veteran, approach this game with some new eyes and it is all the more rewarding. ",

            "review_text": "Hello readers.  At the time of making this, I have had only 6 or so hours of game time. Normally this would be far to little to write accurate review, and you are right!  The first thing I did when I start the game was of course the settings, see how everything is set. First thing I noticed, no 1920x1080 resolution supported in full screen. I got confused, which game in 2014 didn't have it?! I went on the web and found out this is normal for those with a specific refresh rate of a their monitor, I guess this somehow got pets the superb Q/A testing.  Fine, I will play it in windows mode  I looked at the choices I could get, and I noticed that you only have 8 Civs, this was kinda mediocre to me when you compare it to the previous game, and because they aren't the 'known' civ's of the world, it felt very lacking. The bonuses of each civs as well made them far less unique then I thought. But ill just go ahead and pick something.  After 'personalising' my faction ( which with the limited choices you cannot really call it that ) I entered the game!  First thing I noticed, no awesome voice overs of William Morgan Sheppard or Leonard Nimoy. I started, settled, and explored with my unit, already felt a bit CiV 5 but that doesn't have to be bad.  I found something to use my explorer on, started to dig around and then it already started, next turn, next turn and next turn. Not much going on.  I started fiddling with the UI and noticed so much is missing and its all very blend, while in previous civs it all looked quite nice with art and stuff, this game is just made out of bars that anyone can do! The minimap is very annoying coloured, everything is very dark which means you got to suck the player in for that next turn.   Then suddenly other civs joined, landed on the map and I could see where they were, meaning no exploring what so ever to find that other civilization. Played some more, heard my first research completed, no cool pop up, a very average voice over ( sorry.. ) made a new city with a oversized settler, started seeing the other civs units, all the same, as me, no uniqueness. I started looking some more throught the UI, Affinity, Virtues, Researching.  I had a quest popping up asking me for a station to drop near me, I made my choice, it dropped down and well that was it, you can trade with this station but for the rest it does nothing. Imagen a city state without workers and units around it while growing and feeling sort of alive, no here they are just dead buildings. Speaking of quests, at first, I loved em, they do give a bit of lore BUT they the bonus is always very small, in the end, its just picking something you go for or what you need. You quickly just pick and forget.  While I don't mind the Web of researching, its not good and it is very boring, while you see cool artworks from CiV 5, this again feels really cheap. Other civs started to ask for things, when I read what they had to say, it was pure copy paste from CiV 5.. and that is when I started to have enough. And I saw flaw after flaw and flaw. Wonders, I build them, never knowing I actually made one! Why? They aren't 'wonderful' I honestly thought they were just a building! When I started upgrading units, ah a bigger gun! Awesome!...  150 turns in, trade spam became annoying, you can have as low as 2 trade routes on a city.  (as you can tell by my writing I start to become a bit more unforgiving, exactly how I felt during my play session for the first time )  I noticed that sure, affinity will make your units look different in end game, but they will still be exactly the same as any other civ that has it, while I know that in CiV 5, modern age it is the same as well, before that you had a couple of ages feeling relatively unique compared to the rest. Mods made this even better.  As you have noticed I said nothing about the aliens, that's because they have nothing to do with the game, they are there, being annoying but nothing else, even when you kill nest after nest, nothing.   I then gave up on the game, it was just to boring, to tedious and it has no soul, i feels like almost no effort was made into this.  I do have one positive, I have to say, is the music, its beautiful and I am 100% sure, that's the only reason I played it for this long.  I will not recommend this to anyone, not at full price, perhaps at 10 euros max. I will also never recommend this to a CiV Veteran, because he will see this too. As far as it goes for me, this is a MOD, and a bad one at that.",

Presumably, until the first DLC release there are only eight playable civs. However, it does not make a difference as the civs do NOT have unique units. Instead, what units you can build depends on your 'affinity'. As you level up through the enormously complex tech tree, you will gain points towards one of three affinity trees depending on what skills you train- Harmony, Purity or Supremacy. Essentially this means that there are actually only an absolutely pathetic three sets of units possible to build.   Wait until the Christmas specials for this one, folks.  ",

            "review_text": "Firstly, I do not recommend this game until a large amount of issues get cleared up, yet, like Civ5, has plenty of potential ahead.  I would advise for Civ5 fans like myself to hold off another few weeks or perhaps months for a rather large variety of fixes to be brought in.  Perhaps It's best to note some of the obvious faults and cons of the game to give you a more indepth idea of what you could be dealing with:  - Bad wonders; pretty pathetic bonuses after putting in the effort of researching the required tech and a simply bad visual introduction to the wonder once completed.  - Ranged units; melee strengths greatly reduced, averaging around 1:3 ratio to its ranged strength, however, this has obviously been introduced to some substantial increases to ranged units capabilities, but without a melee supporting unit, don't bother taking them outside the city tiles.  -AI / computer players; Don't bother playing any games under Very hard difficulty if you're looking for any kind of challenge. They avoid affinity levels like the plague and bounce around with 1st level units as long as they can. Oh, and they no longer trade resources, just 'favours', which of course can be saved up and used later to sway their minds, but playing beyond 200 turns with a pocket full of favours doesn't get you very far.  - Stations (city states); Low hp, low defence, don't have a ranged attack, don't absorb land, rather poor late game benefits (even at tier 3), they dont call for help, computer players will demand you stop attacking them even when you're the one trading and protecting them!  - Health; The old Civ5 happiness system has been replaced by a health system, which is entirely dependant on buildings which take some time to research and build and rarely benefit you beyond +3 increase. A few late game tile improvements grant you health also, but at rather steep costs. So don't expect to expand your empire beyond 3-4 cities without falling well below the health line.  - Beginning bonuses; plenty of reasonable choice, however scanning for alien nests only works on turn 1, +1 population for capital city is rather poor even on a marathon length game, CIV bonuses are rather poor compared to Civ5 Civ's, but obviously we will need to wait a few months for another 5-10 Civs to be introduced.  - Easy tech; Adopting the Scavenging virtue with the first level purity affinity grants your scouts immunity to alien attacks and are free to roam the world destroying every alien nest in site for a sweet tech bonus, the aliens assult any other unit near nests and rarely end their turn on top of the nest making for easy explorer pickings. This method has bumped myself beyond the AI every game.  There are plenty more issues to touch up on but you start to see a trend affecting almost every element of the game. But I feel that some pros should be listed as well, this is Civ after all!  - Aliens; love them, so much more annoying and stronger than barbarians, with mid-end game units like the siege worm and KRAKEN floating around the world. Making explorers and ships likely to die within a few turns after automation as they blindly stumble into the claws of the local fauna.  - Outposts; Great adaptation to city development, stops those pesky neighbours from landing a city 4 tiles from your capital. easily destroyed, no ranged attack, slow border expansion, great all around.  - Unit evolution; as you gain affinity levels, your units gain strength and unique bonuses! and not to mention a new skin. Instant upgrades for all units is rather unbalanced but this makes for a much more diverse game and interesting wars.  - Tech web; With the choice of rushing to end-game tech or slowly developing every capability, taking away the linear approach has been a fantastic improvement. Of course, being futuristic makes it rather confusing at first, I highly recommend a few minutes reading over potential improvements before selecting what to research next.  - Quests; Needs some work, however its great to have some goals pushing your game play, kill the giant worm! or even free the slaves from far base one! It would be nice to see some foriegn country specific quests encouraging a more violent game.  Well there you have some basics of the game to ponder over, I've met plenty more issues and oddities that need to be worked over in the next few weeks but this game does have great potential just as Civ5 had when it was first released.  I can see that the game has been rushed for release before it's time, but with the next 2 or 3 major updates, this will be worth buying for all the strategy and Civ fans out there.",

            "review_text": "Sid Meier's Civilization has been one of my favorite PC series since I first laid hands on Civilization II. With the more recent release of Civilization V, my love for the franchise was rekindled; the revamped, addictive gameplay model was remarkably difficult to put down. When Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth was announced, I figured developer Firaxis would keep the trend going. Thankfully, that's definitely the case.Beyond Earth, as its name implies, is a sci-fi-tinged take on the Civilization formula. On different alien planets, you establish an outpost that becomes a full-fledged city. The names of the planets matters little; instead, each planet represents different map layouts. Some feature multiple land masses and smaller bodies of water separating the land, while others may have an extremely large land mass surrounded by ocean. There's a decent variety to choose from, along with more advanced types that feature tougher climates and layouts than the standard set. You can also dictate the overall size of the map, allowing for two, four, six, or eight different sponsors on any map.As you might suspect, a sponsor is essentially a nation or faction controlled by you, another player, or the AI. Beyond Earth features a total of eight sponsors. If you're willing to delve into the optional Civilopedia, you get a lot more information on the background of each sponsor and how each relates to real-world cultures. Each sponsor also has a distinct attribute.There are even more options at your disposal when beginning a new single-player game. Aside from picking the size/type of map and sponsor, you also choose a colonist type. You can also choose your spacecraft, which grants additional bonuses, like the ability to see all coasts or see all alien nests on the map despite the standard 'fog' that needs to be lifted via exploring units. Finally, you can choose what cargo to bring on your journey, essentially providing another bonus.Having all of these starting options and choices helps to make each single-player game feel unique, regardless of how many times you play the game. The options aren't uncommon for the Civilization series, but I enjoyed the sci-fi spin. Every bonus or ability provided by cargo, spacecraft, colonists, etc., helps you mold the game to your play style. Any game can be won in a number of ways, so you're pretty much free to explore the victory condition that you'd prefer.Most victory conditions are spread across three different affinities that you can explore: Harmony, Purity and Supremacy. You either choose to live in peace with all forms of life on the planet, wipe out alien species or dominate opposing sponsors. You can devote time to all three affinities or focus on just one. Each affinity 'levels up' as you gain points by completing branches of the Tech Web. This in turn provides you with new technology, units and buildings to further enhance your cities and sponsor.Leveling up your affinities provides special bonuses, often to military, land and sea units once you hit certain milestones. The different affinity bonuses do a solid job of complementing their intended path, but some of the military-focused upgrades get a little generic and repetitive.While the Tech Web is chock-full of various technologies to explore, it's a bit clunky and difficult to navigate. The biggest issue I had was pinpointing the natural progression of the affinity on which I was focusing. It doesn't feel as organized as it should, and for a new player, it is absolutely overwhelming. While Civilization V focused much of its early game on battling against barbarian hordes in order to gain footholds and experience for starting cities and units, Beyond Earth has a slightly slower pace. Barbarians are replaced by alien bugs, which are generally peaceful unless you attack first or get too close to their nests. Instead, many of your early turns in Beyond Earth are going to be focused on exploring. As you roam the map, moving from one hexagonal tile to the next, you'll luck into resource pods, which can provide quick boosts to base resources like energy and science.Once you've mapped out a sizeable portion of the area and have likely run into rival sponsors, you'll want to begin expansion by designating new outposts. Once an outpost is established, it slowly grows as long as it remains healthy. Health essentially replaces the happiness stat of other Civilization titles, but maintaining it doesn't feel nearly as problematic as it did in Civilization V.As cities expand, they occupy more of the surrounding tiles. These tiles can be modified by worker units, which enhance or mine the natural resources. As in other Civilization titles, you can automate a lot of unit functions, but you'll likely want to be hands-on with most of them. Unit speeds are pretty quick, so most turns pass quickly.The only real issue I've had with Beyond Earth is that the opposing AI is remarkably docile. On various difficulty settings, I've had to really work hard to trigger any sort of diplomatic incident. When you encounter new sponsors, they're generally jovial enough to immediately engage in a dialogue with you. You often receive notices to open borders or establish trade.While perfectly playable via local means, with both LAN support and single-machine 'pass the mouse' modes, Beyond Earth also hosts online multiplayer. There don't seem to be many players still using it, as I'd only run into one or two hosted rooms at any time of the day.Passive AI and lackluster online support from the community isn't enough to make Civilization: Beyond Earth a total wash. If you've enjoyed the series over the years, you'll likely spend many hours with this entry as well. It deviates just enough from the excellent Civilization V to be a worthwhile experience, and it offers a different pace than its predecessor, so even though it's not a significant upgrade, it's still pretty remarkable.",

            "review_text": "I got this game out of the Humble Bundle and it ended up in my backlog. I played through a few maps on Quick, with medium difficulty. This is a review out of that, coming in March 2016, with a map pack of DLC but not the expansion pack DLC.  The 'Not Recommended' is on this game as the thought that it is a $30 separate release. You can usually get Civilization 5, Gods and Kings and Brave New World for that on sale. Spend your money on that.  Value: I normally don't put a value review in my reviews, but this game needs an exception. It's simply not worth what has been asked of it. It's a total conversion DLC that was sold as a separate game. It's not a full game, it's a reskin of the Civ 5 engine that was already 3 years old when this game came to market in 2014. In 2016, it's simply tired. It's not worth $30. It's probably worth $15. The price should adjust accordingly, because it is tactically stale at this point, and I have less than 30 hours in the Civ 5 franchise (Civ 5, BNW and BE aggregated).   Plot and Mechanics: 6/10. You play a nation of colonists freshly landed on an alien world, who must survive through turn based strategy to a number of varying victories. Unlike Civ5, the goal here isn't military, it's resource management and city-simulation. You'll need a military, but it is not the best way to win in my experience on PvAI. As a result, the games feel overly long, because there are long periods of downtime where you're not doing anything. The plot is absent. There's literally nothing. The leaders don't have personalities, the planet doesn't have a history, the aliens are basically background pageantry. I'm getting angry with how little was realized out of this while writing my review. Let's move on.  Graphics: 8/10. This game looks amazing, and some of the community mods make it look utterly stunning. I'm giving half credit to the map texturing to the devs, because the textures were their doing. The sandy planets, volcanic fissures, oceans, stations, aliens and soldiers all look freaking cool. I love the motif and the design decisions to differentiate the human colonists based on their colonial decisions rather than their heritages. With that said, there are so many UI problems and readibility problems on the map that I turned to the community to resolve some of them. These are easily resolved issues that could have been fixed at any point in the last two years of this game, but it's still really hard to tell which tiles are unhealthy, which units are in a hex and who owns them. I had to look up online how to access my trade and diplomacy maps because the information isn't adequately presented on one screen (like Civ5's diplo bar). The information interface is a chore, but the quality here is very good even if the usability and presentation is lacking.  Sound: 6/10. The backing tracks are really enjoyable, and addicting. I found myself thumping my head along with the ambience music a few times. The leader vocals are horrible, however, to the point of being an absolute chore to listen to in the game. I am fairly certain a university acting troupe could outperform this script. It's dreadful and drags the entire immersion of the game down. Unit sounds are bloody amazing, however. The action sounds of Marines, CNDRs and even the Siege worm sound epic and crisp. It's clear Firaxis put a lot of work into this part of the game and it shows.  Gameplay: 7/10. I'm going to make a few specific ratings, because this review is a comparison setting BNW Civ5 at 10/10. I'm going to justify to you why this game is seven-tenths as good as Civ5.  The Tech Web (Good): The tech web, which is an utterly unreadable mess of organizational progress, replaces the Tech Tree from Civ 5. It's a good change. Yes. A good change. The progression is much less linear and it fits the motif of this being a post-human civilization made by humans. Every game I've had plays really differently, and there aren't the obvious power spikes of Civ 5. That's a really enjoyable change to the game that was an excellent decision, even if it takes getting used to.  Victory Conditions (Bad): The victory conditions being largely non-military really makes the game lag between turn 100-250. You might have a military, but it's hard to use it, and you won't want to, owing to the amount that all of the AIs will absolutely hate you. Most of the AIs do a peaceful route, and I haven't once been attacked in two separate 300 turn games. That's not Civ, that's Sim City. So what replaced Domination victories? There are 5 separate thematic victories that encourage you to do things like terraform the world, or reconnect with Old Earth. They're thematically cool but really randomly granted. If anyone ever played the Dune Total Conversion mod for Civ 4, they feel just ripped from that mod. Once again, it feels like these are DLC add-ons to a Civ5 that should have provided non-military wins to a military game, but instead we got a new environment that places non-military wins in a non-interactive game.  Alien AI (Good): The aliens really behave like a huge powerful faction. They are neutral towards those that don't bother them and are vicious to those who seek and destroy them. It's a nice change from Barbarians.  Early Game (Disastrous): There is no early game. None. You can't rush anything and swarm an opponent. It's too had to get good production going and too hard to pressure anyone with how utterly crippling health values are. The bonuses from Virtues is too strong to not go for early culture, and as a result you wind up with a very insular and passive early game. This isn't unenjoyable, but it's a disasterous change from Civ 5, because it's just not fun in this game to do these things. Exploration of the map doesn't feel as tactical as it did in Civ 5. You're not looking for early military experience to fuel a great person, because you don't get awarded great people. Wonders are basically non-existent, so there's not really any goals to work toward if you aren't being a warmonger. It ends up really ruining this game after the first few times you play it.  Quests (Mixed): The idea of quests is super cool. You have these quests that let you mold your civ after every time you build a new building for the first time. That's the not-cool part. Each building has a corresponding quest that will fire the same every single game. It's repetitive customization. It would be nice to see more dynamic events that have a mean-time-to-happen implementation instead of triggered events from the construction of buildings. It doesn't seem like you're really doing anything with these quests, just that they're some form of gameplay for the early game.  Replayability; 5/10. I have no interest in playing this game multiplayer. It's an unbalanced mess of a game that I imagine would be really really frustrating playing against another human being. Hell, it's kind of frustrating playing this game against an AI. The question of building wide vs building tall, building economy vs building military, building culture vs building science ... have all been ruined. The economy of tiles is a mess in this game, and resource starts and location typically dictate if this game is even playable. There is no story to complete, and I feel like you can see everything this motif has to offer in maybe 5 games. While there is some replay added by Affinity specializations, this ultimately falls short of the rich environments and synergistic gameplay that Civ5 offers.  Verdict: 5/10. This is an ultmately forgettable title from a developer that has made some really wonderful and enjoyable games throughout the years. What's frustrating about Civilization: Beyond Earth is the abundant potential teeming everywhere in the game. This could have absolutely been an excellent title. However, any brilliance shown is short-lived.",

Civ V obviously also has a broader scope if you consider the techologies and stuff available in each age.  The reason I recommend it however is that I find the pacing in Beyond Earth to be a bit faster and more dynamic. Things start to get interesting a lot a quicker. The early stages of Civ V can be a bit boring. The music is really top notch as well and the graphics are good. The wars can feel pretty dramatic.  It fall short of the greatness of it's spiritual forefather, Alpha Centauri however, which was arguably better than it's counterpart, Civ II. Beyond Earth is certainly not better than Civ 5.  Yet if you are a Civ fan looking for an alternate challenge/scenario, or new to this genre I recommend it as it's very easy to pick up and play. The faster pace does make campaigns quite interesting and if you are new to the genre and like sci-fi I would recommend. Especially if on a promotion! But if you are a Civ 5 fan looking for something better than Civ 5, i'd avoid it.",

            "review_text": "Civilization Beyond Earth is without a doubt an excellent and fun game, sadly most of the reviews are trying to compare it with Civilization 5 + Gods and Kings + Brave New World or Alpha Centauri, but lets remember that expansions and dlcs should be released eventually and the game will become even better and also the game balance will come with time so dont expect a recently released game to be 100% balanced. I really dont get why so many bad reviews, this game definitely doesnt deserve it. Below I will point some pros and cons of the game and stuff that i would like to see on future dlcs/expansions:  --&gt; Pros:  - The new aliens are a nice challenge on the early game, especially Siege Worms because you never know how they will react. - The new Affinity System is great, it gives players an option on how to devote their colony, so do you want your colony to remain pure and follow Old Earth ideologies? Or maybe make cybernetic enhancements on your people and spread chaos and havoc with robotic armies? Or maybe be one with your new planet and domesticate and integrate the alien lifeforms for your own purposes? Well, its your call! - The new map exploration is awesome, with your explorer units you search for Supply Pods which will give you small yields of Science, Culture or Energy and even a free Solar Collector or you can reveal the secrets of Ancient Ruins that will give you boosts on researches or the option for an affinity level or even investigate a crashed space ship which could countain the logs of a failed colonization mission giving you acess to new quests. - The new quest system is very interesting and offers the players many challenges across your games, the quests are generated based on how you are playing the game. Example: Spotting a Siege Worm will activate a quest that involves killing it and the reward will surely pay the effort, or making a trade route with a independent Station may trigger another Station to give you a quest to destroy their rival Station and as a reward they will give you a boost on the yields they provide. There are also quests that involves affinity levels and they will help you to develop you colony based on your actions during those quests. - The new orbital units are a great new feature, it allows you to deploy from Solar Collectors to boost the energy generation of your city to satellites armed with giant lasers that you can use both for defend or attack.  --&gt; Cons  - There are very few sponsors (only 8) so there isnt much diversity on the games, at least they can pick different affinities. - The combat on Civilization Beyond Earth surely need some balancing, cities are much more powerful now and if you want to play Space Atilla early game it will be kinda hard since most units will be melted by the cities defense on the early game so you need to spend a lot of time on making very large armies if you want to conquer cities early on, however later on that is not a problem because the units at around 12 Affinity Level are already very powerful and it takes less than 5 turns if you are well positioned to conquer a capital, based on this the game pratically forces you to go for a domination victory on the late game where everyone else is at around 50%-75% on another victory type. - Trade routes are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered, every city can set 2 trade routes and if you get an auto plant you can get another one so basically its 3 trade routes per city. In my opinion a good number would be a max of 4 Trade Routes per Civilization and you can improve that to maybe 6 or 7 by making wonders, affinity bonus or quest reward. - The wonders on this game provides very weak bonuses, so most times you dont even bother making them because the bonus they grant you aint that great. The ones i usually make are the Ectogenesis Pod and the Gene Vault mainly to aid the city growth on the early game. - All the units are of the same color, ok you can see the colored icon but it would be nice if the units had your sponsor color. - Only 2 naval units, there is a ranged cruiser and a carrier, it would be nice if we could build submarines or a melee naval unit to conquer coastal city using only naval force. - The User Interface is confusing since everything is pretty much of the same color, seeing what is your city producing, on how many turns it will grow or how many turns to finish that beautiful wonder is very confusing and hard to see because everything including the small numbers are of the same color of your sponsor but im sure that can be polished. - The tech tree is nice and gives you freedom to focus on what you want, but it takes some time to get used to it and know what leads to what or what you need to reveal or improve the resources. - Covert Ops are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered.  --&gt; What I would like to see on the future  - A religion system that could work with your choosen affinity - More military units, especially naval ones - More sponsors, i think a number of 16-20 sponsors would give a good diversity to the game - Sponsors should have unique units/buildings. For example the PAC could have a special worker unit that improves tiles a lot faster and have +1 movement since they are focused on production or the ARC could build a special Spying Agency or another build which improves the spying activity. - Different alien types, it would be badass if there were different types of aliens based on the map type or something like that, that would add diversity to the game. - Improved military AI, sometimes the AI takes some very dumb decisions when you are at war with them.  Well, thats my review for Civilization Beyond Earth, Im really enjoying the game and i believe that this game just need some polishing and im sure that with the future dlcs/expansions it will become even better than it already is.  &lt;&lt;UPDATE&gt;&gt;  Its a shame that Beyond Earth didnt receive all the love it really deserved, the expansion did good but the game sure could use of more content, sadly 2k left it to die and now the game barely gets 5k players, but the game is still amazing and u can have as much fun as u would have with civ5 but with an sci fi theme",

I will admit that it's definitely not as replayable as Civ V at the moment, but I feel that when the Rising Tides DLC comes out it will give the game some new aspects that will make it more favorable. EDIT: 10/31/15 Rising tides did make the game more replayable and added some new aspects. However it also screwed up the diplomacy system (which was then updated not too long after). Overall it was a nice improvment with the aquatic cities, hybrid units, and emphasis on exploration. Unfortunately it didn't increase the replayability as much as I would have liked.",

By far the most disappointing thing is diplomacy and the other factions. They all have no personality, beyond the vaguest sketch. (I spy on stuff, I like money, I am an African Villager(!), I am a soldier) They pick affinities (roughly equivalent to ideologies in CIV V, except they give you units too) randomly with no rhyme or reason. Even the diplomacy text is the same as CIV V! 'Our disagreements have become too much to bear', 'What do you think of this deal'. Add a LITTLE personality guys.   It's pointless to even engage with diplomacy because theres nothing to trade! No luxuries, no research agreements, no votes.

The tech blurbs were sensible, the 'memoirs' phase of leadership added great fluff, units were awesomely customizable, the tech tree made sense.  Beyond Earth doesn't make much sense, doesn't really seek to appeal to the user. Building a wonder feels boring. Resources feel somehow both boring and disconnected.

You can level up in any given tech direction, affinity, or culture at will. The only exclusionary forces to how you progress are the minor bonuses you chose to give to your military units. Every other bonus you can get can just be min/maxed by playing the game longer. In the end every empire I create comes out to be the same min/maxed plot-of-land expansion as the one I played before, despite all the options given to you in the beginning.

Yeah, that's right, the text box at the end is the same stock message for every game, with no details concerning who won, or how.

You're able to choose from three different paths that will shape how your civilization plays out and interacts with not just other players but also the environment itself. You really do feel like you're in a strange new planet with some beautiful and strange visuals that make up the planets you're trying to colonize. You have to interact with players and the environment (as stated before) and it adds quite a unique element. The aliens you encounter could be compared to the barbarians of past Civ games, but they act a bit different. You can either kill them off, leave them alone, or tame them, and your actions do have consequences with the aliens and the other factions. All in all, its a great civ game that adds some great new elements, but its not as fleshed out as Civ V is with all its DLC. In time with more updates and DLC this game could be something amazing!",

Its always crashing in multiplayer games, most of the time only max 4 players map working good, but with 1 leaver it could be already a problem... There is too much luck factor in the game. If you get a startplace without aliens and with a neighbour not so far, but also not too close, you won the game if you can play good ofc, but if you get a startplace with 3-4 alien nest, you will never expand, cannt trade, and you already lose at early game, its clear to see. Best tactic is purity with prosperity, all other stuff is only just 'there', but useless if you want the best output from everything. Same goes for waging war. Only melee troops needed, forget rangeds, and the cities are very easy to capture. Also if you make a city, you put 2 trade routes to it, and you have the most expensive troop in your brand new city in max 5 turns, and normally in all other cities 2-5 turns to make the best troops available, BUT there isnt any demographics window, and you just step at your neighbours borders, and we already have -1 player in the game, GREAT. All this happening from turn 75 usually (cause of aliens...), so I have to waste 1,5 hours of game time, to start again a new game. I really wanted to play with this game, since I am a civ 5 freak, but this game needs more patches, and maybe also an expansion pack, until that I cannt recommend it, its a half ready unbalanced game, nothing else.

After what I'd heard about Beyond Earth mechanics, it sounded like the defining characteristics of the game had been passed over. Social Engineering and Prototyping are nowhere to be found, shaping the very continents through terraforming and sea bases are missing.  But now, with a few additional playthroughs behind me, my perspective has changed. Do NOT look at Beyond Earth as an Alpha Centauri remake. Treat it as a stand-alone project.  I have heard this title described as 'Civ 5 in space' and I feel like it's a mildly misguided assessment. The elements that tie Beyond Earth to Civilization V are simply the baseline elements that make a Civilization game. As a veteran of Civilization games since 1991, I can confidently say that Beyond Earth stands as much apart from other releases as any other and you'll enjoy learning the new technology trees, units, buildings, and virtues (similar to the previous game's Social Policies) and bending them to your advantage.  For new players to Sid Meier games, this is a fun 4X title that may overwhelm you with choices at first, but in time you'll come to appreciate them and use them to your benefit. The visual and audio aesthetics of the game are pleasant and smooth, lending a great deal to the atmosphere, though I would say the faction leaders could use more development and variety.  For loyal Civilization fanatics, you may find the new mechanics (especially the technology) fractured and far more open than previous games, but it will become a benefit as you learn your way around the trees. Variety and freedom of optimisation are the name of the game.  To summarise, it's a fantastic game and money well spent. Where Civilization V crash-landed with severe multiplayer issues and coarse gameplay, Beyond Earth arrives with a relatively smooth landing. There are no gamebreaking bugs. Across some fifty hours of gameplay, I have had one crash and it did not repeat. I look forward to the release of expansions sometime in the next year, with any luck, and what they will add to an already well-rounded title.  That said, please remake Alpha Centuari for us, changing as few elements as possible. We beg you.",

On a good side: First of all, I had a lot of fun playing it for first 3 or 4 times. Everything was fresh new, I had to learn a lot and this side of the game is as always very nice for me. Unfortunately once I got those games behind me I find it hard to come back for more.  I love the quests implemented in this game - they really add a lot of depth - you can make different choices each time you play and your civilization will be affected by them - you can shape it to be a bit different.  There are a lot of problems with make this game either boring or annoying to play: - military - auto-upgrading military units sounded like fun at start but then once you start war it's really really annoying. Your enemy's units can at any moment upgrade to a much better unit on the field. There are not that many units overall, which probably could be fine if they were not being upgraded automatically - but with automatic upgrades it feels like you have very limited toolbox to use for war. Also upgrades are way too big between levels, they should be more gradual. You need to get few points of affinity to upgrade a unit again and then it's like major change. So in order to win a war you basically focus just on technologies that raise your affinity for affinity's sake, not for anything that this technology brings to your civilization. - economy - trade is especially annoying, in late game when you have 2 or 3 trade units per city, you constantly have to pick another trade target for them, every single turn. On the other hand trade is very powerful and without it your civilization will be in a disadvantage so you can't just ignore it. - I also hate how this game no longer rewards me for playing. End game? Just one picture, no way to check my progress against other civilization, some pathetic text 'you win' and that's all. When you get a new technology, it's described very poorly and quote that is read to you is usually poor, a bit stupid or non-sense entirely.   If you want to play this game you should probably wait a bit till it gets cheaper on gets some DLC/expansion to fix those issues. Right now I can't really recommend to buy this game at full cost.

I'm going to be up front and say this game is not everyone's cup of tea and, like pretty much every Civilization game before it, it's got room for expansions to build upon. It is a bit unfair to simply dismiss it as a reskinned Civ V, as the more you play, the more you will realize it is it's own game and has it's own quirks.  Ok, so. What the game really has going for it right now... 1. The customization at start, as you can tailor your start to what you are hoping to do in that game. 2. The Afinity and Virtue systems. 3. Adaptable military units, which you can adjust to your playstyle or end goal for each game. 4. The Quest System, whih not only lets you adjust your buildings to suit your needs, but help you create an narative in the game, something that I quite enjoy. 5. The tech web, as it isn't as linear as the tech tree normally seen in a Civ game.  Now, the points where I see room for improvement... 1. The stations. They are pretty ok, but there could be more to them beyond just being something to trade with or blow up. 2. The military units. Yes, this is an area that is both a strength and a weakness in my eyes, as I'd have loved to have seen greater customization and that the choices you made for abilities had an impact on how the unit looked and acted. For example, with the Marine, the first soldier upgrade, a simple touch like having one of the soldiers having a medic pack if you took healing or nastier looking guns if you chose the bonus to attack would have been nice. 3. Active espionage is easily countered, even if you have elite agents at work in the city. Even with ARC's bonus, for example, you can't get more than one or two ranks of intreuge if there is even a green agent engaged in counter-espionage. 4. While the current victory types are solid and fairly balanced, there is no real incentive for players to work together. A diplomatic focused victory is very much needed. 5. It'd be nice to see some backer-specific quests, as it would help make each one feel a little more unique and less like a simple bonus that you chose.  Given how Civ V started out, I have high hopes for Beyond Earth, especially once the team starts rolling out full-blown expansions.",

They often just idle the entire game, while occasionally deploying a poorly organized army at you once, and then begging for your forgiveness while rewarding you with tons of favors and resources. - The aliens don't scale; they're a challenge for 40 turns, and then they are just fodder for the rest of the game. For something to be an integral part of the game, it needs to serve some sort of purpose beyond 'Wefuxurexplorers' for a few turns - The jumps between tech levels are too drastic; a tech 1 unit, fully leveled and with virtue support, has almost no chance of contending with a tech 2 unit; the auto-upgrade immediately happening further rewards players for fast teching, instead of making them strategically utilize their resources on a per-unit basis. - Diplomacy is a complete and utter joke. Literally the worst iteration in the franchise history, I would say. - Randomly appearing trade outposts always take up the best land spots; you have to decide whether you want their bonus, or their location for tiles... and they always spawn in between the best locations, strategically.

Pros: Interesting, new gameplay and design. Beautiful music and landscape. Far more customization than previous games. Addicting as ever. Cons: AI is almost nonexistant, confusing and dull at times, way too easy. 6/10  I've been playing Civilization games for a very long time, I've clocked in over 1000 hours between the past 3 games and I have to say that BE brings this feeling back. However, within its current state of development, it feels as if I'm playing a beta. During my first game, after all of the over civ's arrived to the planet, only 1 talked to me and took interest into what I did. 2 other players I communicated with in game, but the other 2 I never even spoke to, and they never spoke to me. When we look back at Civ 5 for example, communication between other nations was rich and made the game intruiging and felt like your race to victory mattered. On top of this, the AI is extremely passive. I ended up warmongering a nearby nation and I still remained friendly relations with all of the other civs, even the ones that were friends with the nation I destroyed. Mind you, I was playing on Apollo and still I got no feedback or even a sign of concern. One problem I have in particular is how easy I pushed my way to victory. When conquering other civs, I found myself only needing to make an army with 4 or 5 melee units to destroy an entire nations army and their cities. I captured a city with 31 strength in 1 turn with a boat, and 2 melee units. Capturing cities is one thing that needs to be fixed because at the moment, domination victories are laughable. Although this game brings an interesting twist to the series, I find that it is confusing and plain boring at times. Halfway through my first adventure I felt like retiring and going back to cheerful, exotic Civ 5. The city screen layout is loaded with too much information and makes navigating through the different options very confusing. Although the tech tree is one of the finest aspects of the game, I found it very difficult to make my way around it and find out which techs do what. But this is what people expect in a new civ game, correct? It does feel refreshing to learn a brand new civ game, but the layout of the menus and options are so clunky that it makes me not want to put any effort into it. Saying this, the developers did an excellent job at bringing back the civilization feel without changing too much. The soundtrack is heart-warming and really draws you into the mysterious maps and the graphics (although run from the same previous engine) look great within these random generated planets.  This new installment is a very clever twist on the series, and I think the developers wanted to get their feet wet and experiement with the different options that can be brought into the series. In future games, things in BE will be present and things will change, and that's how developers learn from present games in a series. BE is in general an okay game in the series with much potential in the future. Now I understand that others look more positivley towards this game and I don't blame them, it's very refreshing and beautiful. However, with the current AI and the confusing layouts, it is a game that will indeed change in time. I would not recommend buying it at this time for these reasons, but for die hard civilization fans that want to be refreshed, go ahead.",

            "review_text": "This game is fantastic, difficult and challenging with a fairly open ended way to go about everything. Long gone is the linear tech tree which has been replaced by the tech web, giving you choice in the direction you build and focus your empire. But with this comes the downside of spending too much time going with whatever looks neat, and having no progression towards your ultimate victory.  I can honestly see guides popping up on how to rush the right tech to the fastest victory.   Anyway, Gameplay is familiar to those who have played Civ5. The atmospheric layer adds wicked little temporay bonuses to your empire, from solar collects to orbital lasers. Making it neat to play with.  Diplomacy hasn't changed much, its solid with all the bells and whistles and a new Favor system. Ask for tech/trade whatever and offer favors that can be used and redeemed and it seems the AI has a harder time saying no too.  Spying is actually fun now, from defending your territory, stealing tech, money, research and units. Subversion and everything in between.   Speaking of units, the units in this game benefit from their own version of a tech tree. meshed with your affinity(which is chosen through tech and choices you make in the game) tech evolves into hyper futuristic stuff with wicked bonuses. gone is manually upgrading, just keep that research flowing.  Barbarians have evolved into aliens and this adds a whole new dynamic, attack and wipe them out, risks bigger badder alien Xenos coming after you. or tame them, study them, and gain their abilities or outright use them.  I could go on and on about this so ill focus on my own gripe at the moment.   Minus a few bugs(seems the ai likes to remind you constantly of things you did ONCE) because of how the tech web is designed, it feels like the game is much shorter then other Civs, then again, I started playing at 10pm release night all the way till 5am...so maybe not so much xD    I reccomend this game fully.   and to anyone who says its a reskinned Civ 5.

            "review_text": "There are two main issues with this game. Firstly, it's basically DLC for Civ 5. The base game wasn't any good and this new skin doesn't do anything new to impress me. Sure, it reskins a bunch of tiles and units and adds orbitals, with a new tech tree. Yeah, those sound like overarching changes... except when you realize that every DLC for Civ 5 does the same thing. It's Civ 5 in space, and not very compelling at the price of a full game. Steeply discounted, if the only thing you wish you had more of in your Civ 5 was space... sure, go for it. Not my cup of tea but for the right person, absolutely.  The other issue is that this game is to Alpha Centauri what Civ 5 is to the rest of the Civ series: that is, a poor approximation. You'd think after decades of technology and publishing experience Firaxis would be able to improve on a game from the early 90s, but they didn't. I am not saying this with rose-tinted glasses. After playing Beyond Earth, I actaully reinstalled Alpha Centauri to see if my fond memories were an illusion; to see if I was being unfair to this new installment in the Civ franchise.   Nope. Alpha Centauri plays like a dream, even nearly 25 years after the fact. And the sad thing is that Beyond Earth really doesn't do anything new and interesting that Alpha Centauri doesn't already do. In fact, Alpha Centauri is a more full-featured game than Beyond Earth is, ~25 years later. That alone is a huge disappointment.  This review is being made for the base game of Beyond Earth. I've been so disappointed by the Civ franchise's releases since Civ 5 that it has become increasingly unlikely that I'll purchase any of their future games. They had their heyday, and now their output quality has gone the way of a 70-year old street hooker's sexual desirability; it's still on the street corner for a desperate pickup, but it's really not worth any decent prospector's valuable time.",

            "review_text": "With the addition of Rising Tides, I decided that a full update to this review is in order.  With the addition of Rising Tide and several major patches released in the months following it, Civilization Beyond Earth - Rising Tides (BE-RT) is finally deserving of a full, unconditional endorsement. As it stands now, this is unquestionably a superior game to previous Civ's, and more importantly, it is a *different* game.   Comparing to Civ V: While the initial critique of 'Civ V with a sci-fi skin' may have been a justified comment (although a tad harsh) in the early days, it is now completely unjustified. The basic mechanics are essentially the same (map, movement, resources, cities), but that's about it. Everything else is different, and there are some major changes in those differences. With Rising Tides and subsequent patches, BERT is worthy of being called a completely new game, and a completely superior game to the old Civ V. Still lacks some of the things that made Alpha Centauri so awesome, but it has its own strengths, so I won't knock it too badly for that.  My first big warning for new players is regarding unit diversity. If you are used to Civ V where you had hundreds of different units, it will seem like a shock. Instead you'll see a hundred different variations of about a dozen units. And these variations aren't nailed down by faction, either. As you progress through the tech tree, you'll be offered choices as to how to upgrade your units. For the generic set, you will probably have 4-5 upgrade choices over the course of the game, and which options you get to choose from differ depending on your tech choices. Effectively, there's probably at least a hundred different versions of each of the basic units, although probably only about 20 or so that are massivelydifferent. Beyond the basic units, there is a whole slew of specialty units of various kinds, each with their own 3-5 upgrade steps, but as they have specific tech and affinity requirements to unlock, it is quite likely that you won't see even a quarter of the unit types in any one game. Long story short, you may be building the most basic 'soldier' unit right up until the end of the game, but whereas it is a basic militia sort at the beginning, by the end of the game it's a futuristic combat squad with a host of abilities.  Espionage: Forget the old Civ V style spy game, spies are back, they are different, and they are worth paying attention to. Like a lot of things, the basic spy game is similar to Civ V: You put spies in your cities to defend them, or in enemy cities to spy on them. End of similarities. First off, you pick what you want your spies to do. Initially, they can't do much, but as they build up their contacts in the city, they gain access to bigger and better things. You can also keep spies back at HQ to provide some civilization-wide bonuses for you, or send them to the black market to buy or sell strategic resources. Lots of options to fit a wide variety of different strategies.  Pro: - The tech web is awesome. So much more variety and options to diversify gameplay. - Espionage is much improved. Actually interesting now. - The Seeding (Starting setup) is much more varied, and a lot more interesting. - More interesting unit abilities - Oceans are very interesting now. - Every faction has a solid chance at winning every victory type.  Con: - Affinity is everything. If you're going for any victory type other than Contact or time, techs that give affinity progress trump all other considerations. Trumps EVERYTHING.  - Less variety in unit types, hard to tell the difference between different versions of the same unit. And a lot of the units are affinity specific, meaning you need high levels of a particular affinity to get them. So they tend to be rather rare. - The stupid black copyright box that pops up at the start of the game is really annoying. (same as Civ V's) - You can't peg factions anymore. Each civ only has a single bonus that is constant, all the rest of the civ-wide bonuses and traits vary from game to game.   My recommendation? Buy this game! If you like Civ games, and you like sci-fi and the thought of colonizing another world, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. My caveat, however, is to get Rising Tides with it. BE without RT is good, but not awesome. With RT, it is an excellent game. (This whole review is written based on BE with RT. See review below for my old review of it before the expansion). This game isn't Alpha Centauri, and will likely never replace it, but it is the next best thing, and has its own strengths.    Old review (written well before Rising Tides had ever been mentioned, so applies to Vanilla game only) beyond this point:  Overall, a good game. It is a very nice change to go forward into the future instead of trying to rewrite the past. After a first play through it seemed kind of weak and lacking in variety, but there's actually got a reasonable amount of variation in there, especially in starting conditions. If you liked Civ V, chances are you'll like Civ BE, but be forwarned, there's going to be some culture shock, as you won't be faced with hundreds of different units. Instead you'll be dealing with hundreds of different varieties of about a dozen units. If you play this game, give it three or four play throughs. And remember, it is highly likely there is going to be DLC for this. I expect it will get the Civ V treatment. If they respond to community concerns, there's a solid chance this will end up being an excellent game. Not as good as Alpha Centauri, but still a great game.  These pros/cons are comparing to Civ V.  Pro: - The tech web is awesome. So much more variety and options to diversify gameplay. - Espionage is much improved. Actually interesting now. - The Seeding (Starting setup) is much more varied, and a lot more interesting.  Con: - Affinity is everything. If you're going for any victory type other than Contact or time, techs that give affinity progress trump all other considerations. Trumps EVERYTHING.  - Less variety in unit types, hard to tell the difference between different versions of the same unit. And a lot of the units are affinity specific, meaning you need high levels of a particular affinity to get them. So they tend to be rather rare. - The stupid black copyright box that pops up at the start of the game is really annoying. (same as Civ V's)  Recommendation: If you like Civ V or Alpha Centauri, get this game. I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a combo pack when they come out with DLC, though.   Update: With the March 2015 patch they've fixed a lot of the bugs that plagued some of the users, as well as dealing with a bunch of player complaints. The update has deffinitely bumped up the quality of the game a few notches. It also totally rebalanced the Secret Projects. I mean wonders. : ) So if you built a highly effective strategy using them before, you're going to have to relearn them. All in all, the game feels like the emphasis has been shifted out slightly towards a slightly longer game. As in the really good wonders are a bit farther out on the tech web.",

Alright let's start it off - TLDR at the end for you lazy procrastinaros  Tech Web - what is this? Bug it if I know. At first it seems like a really cool way to introduce new mechanics to research to make the gameplay fresh but after a while you notice a couple of things. Why am I researching any of this? What do I have to research anyway? Why can't I research what I want rather than focus on a single thing and religiously sticking to it or getting mowed down by A.I. players?  Buildings/wonders/research - at the tech web, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. There isn't a single moment like there is in Civ V where you're just like : 'WOAH I CAN BUILD THAT IF I RESEARCH THIS AND DO THAT? OMG YES * throws scientists* ' . Buildings and wonders have almost no effect on the visual side of your city , since most wonders are just big boxes and cubes made out of whatever material. It just seems so bland and cluttered and the long research just turns the game into 'Next Turn Simulator'.  Aliens/units - so in this game you can upgrade your units by achieving points in either Harmony , Purity or Supremacy and I have to say that the visual design ( of the player units ) is really cool and it genuienly feels like a reward , especially when your squad of merciless robots takes down a batallion of petty humans. Har har har. HOWEVER the aliens are soooooooooooo bland and most of them feel like rip offs from Mass Effect or 190124 diffirent sci - fi bugs ( seriously? Siege Worms? call BioWare , Thresher Maws are going to have a little talk ). None of them have any soul or variation and they're either annoying because they wreck your entire ♥♥♥♥ up when you're about to attack someone else entirely or they can be dealt with by blowing your nose too loudly. There's no balance or middle ground.  Gameplay - it's the same old thing. 4X blah blah , but this time we have ORBITAL UNITS. YAY. Or not.

            "review_text": "The human species breaking free of its cradle and colonizing other planets has been my ultimate dream for most of my life and still is. I consider 4X to be my favourite genre for no less than 5 years now. Among strategy franchises, Sid Meier's...  anything  has long reigned supreme in my mind. The convergence of these things so dearly important to me, has caused me to approach this title with significant trepidation of a joyous variety. This review concerns the base game with the Exoplanets DLC, but without the Rising Tide expansion.  Let's get the things that are easier to gauge out of the way first. The visuals and sounds are acceptable, but not much more than that. The graphics of the ground have this weird blurriness about them that I find difficult to describe, but it's certainly hard on the eyes. Despite being pretty, they're not very legible in general, making it troublesome to make out some special features of individual tiles, such as Resource Pods or Alien Nests. The rest of the interface is okay, although I couldn't easily find a list of hotkeys anywhere ingame and had to Google it. There is no 'strategic view' (2D hex map), which is an absolute blunder - it was super useful in Civ5. The adequate-but-uninspired trend extends to music. The war music certainly has its moments, but the rest of it is pretty meh. On the technical side of things, I was not able to launch the game using AMD Mantle, despite having a 290X and up-to-date drivers. It's a minor disappointment that I'm willing to chalk up to Matle being retired anyway AFAIK. The most common bug ingame is one where the combat animation gets stuck and two units go at it for 15-20 seconds before some sort of infinite-loop failsafe kicks in. And this happens  a lot . Embarassing.   Alright! Now let me  sell you a bridge  talk about the design. Judging by the Steam score, it seems like the reception of this game wasn't very good. I have not read any other review of it at all, but I imagine the main issue other diehard fans are having is missing features. Yes, they are missing. I love it! It feels like I've won the lottery because all the things that are missing... well, I'm not missing  them . Allow me to explain why less is more, and why I like this title so much.     diplomatic victory - oh... my least favourite victory, even less desirable than cultural. Yeah, I'm totally feeling this loss. NOT.     council / voting on global laws / advanced diplomacy - yeah, this is something that I would've preferred having. But after 'reading into' the lore of Beyond Earth ('BE') deeply enough (maybe too deeply...), I suddenly came up with an explanation. In the original Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri ('AC'), Earth succumbs to the cancer that is humanity - and takes us with it - while the colony ships are still in transit, just like in the movie  Pandorum . So it is understandable then, that the colony leaders feel free in making grand political decisions, because they have no populations or governments left back home that might judge them - morally or legally. Not so here. The Lasercom Satellite and the Promised Land victory tell us that humanity continues to survive on Earth, not just Beyond it. More importantly, they show us that the leaders are likely to feel loyal towards them. And thus, while still open to the more pressing and tactical considerations of war, peace and trade, they are nevertheless unwilling to make huge decisions that might impact the identity of their colonies out of reverence and respect for their sponsors on Earth.     terraforming - a cherished staple of AC, alongside Planet Busters. This is personal preference, but I don't like having it in my 4X. When available, it sends me into an obsessive-compulsive mental tailspin that's more harm than good. Like... have you ever had that kind of Civ2 game where you put a farm on every tile that could be irrigated? If I can lower hills or drain coasts, I'm going to end up with a planet flat as a crepe and covered in farmland. And I don't know why, but it feels disgusting. I much prefer working within the confines, the original shape of the terrain rather than modifying it. Most of the time I roleplay not using these features, but I like it even more if they're not there.     unit design - this is usually present in games that take place on a interstellar scale. Creating units out of components. I abhor this with an intensity much greater than terraforming, though for slightly different reasons. Which I will not list out of concern for the length of this 'review'. Suffice to say, when I earlier mentioned the changes feel like winning the lottery, I mostly meant unit design being gone. Hip hip hurray!     not many units to choose from - there is one melee soldier, one ranged soldier, one plane, one ship etc. And like... two specialized units per affinity? And that's it. You upgrade these, but even then it might feel like there is no variety. I like it. It reflects the way I tend to play, where I pick 2 or 3 units and spam them. It also makes sense from an ingame point of view that a handful of 'core concepts' for various combat roles are refined and built upon over time rather than constantly having to build the newest unit and disband the old ones.   To keep things regretfully balanced, the game also has flaws. Chief among them is the relative weakness of the lore. Yang's quip about God playing dice and the dice being loaded is somehow a contender for my most memorable gaming quote of all time. AC was chock full of stellar writing that made up for how little of it there was with how smart it was. The voice acting was also surprisingly decent. All of this contributed to an unmatched atmosphere, one of the best in the genre... BE feels plastic and hollow by comparison. Cheap. Utterly uninspired. BE has voice actors for each of the colony leaders... why then, does some generic and unpleasant voice read out the flavour text for new technologies and wonders? And why is that text so bland? And why are there no videos for the wonders? It feels like all of AC's atmosphere has vented out into space. BE's writing is passable, from a strictly sci-fi point of view, but I expected more, so much more... Oh, and the whole   Planet has the potential to be sentient and is waking up RITE NAO   angle has been marginalised to a woeful degree. I miss those black screens with nothing but text appearing out of nowhere - their spartan form would somehow drive home the impression that really heavy stuff is going on.  Similarly, the colony leaders and sponsor-states are amalgamations of contemporary, politically correct tripe. The shape of BE's sponsors represents awkwardly wishful thinking; not even the Great Mistake would've been enough to form some of those entities in reality. So here we are, with these arbitrary clumps of nations as factions, whereas AC's factions represented concepts, particular ideals and ways of viewing life - a more correct notion for a far-future society on an entirely different planet, free of Earth's geography. AC's factions had actual flavour, the leaders felt vibrant. BE's leaders are little more than memes.   I don't have much to say about the gameplay because - honestly - I think we're both equally tired of this review by now. It's Civ5 in space and it feels great, because Civ5 felt great. I regret not having fortification tile improvents, or airports, or nukes (of the ordinary variety), or the economic victory from AC, but these are things I can live without.   I'm not sure why I put so much effort or so many words into this thing, as I had no illusions of changing anyone's mind from the start. If you wanted AC dressed up in modern graphics while retaining all of its original features, you're out of luck. If you wanted Civ5 reskinned into a sci-fi setting, you're in luck. I didn't even know I wanted that, but now I sure do.",

The game becomes tedious very quickly, with little in the mid or late game to make things interesting. Victory conditions are unclear and uninteresting, and the game does a very inadequate job of conveying when other players are winning.  For example, I spent 6 hours in my first game, making good progress and dominating my neighbors in all fields when - without any prior indication - I was informed another player had won, and that the game was over. And that was it. To be honest, I don't know what the AI player had even done to beat me, let alone what I could have done to stop it. Thus, six horus of my time had the most underwhelming and frustrating end I've experienced in a game in quite some time.  Additionally, the game itself has a number of foolish errors. When upgrading units, the rotating display of your unit will usually contain at least one other unrelated unit superimposed on top of it, making the entire thing a visual mess. Land trade and sea trade units have nearly identical names, and with no easy-to-recognize icons I found myself wasting time and money producing the wrong units. The game's entire audio directory is placed in a file that steam recognizes as 'soundtrack,' making it nearly impossible to play the game's music from the steam music interface. This is especially disappointing because the game's music, while well-made, hardly ever plays in the course of the game, leaving only silence.  Beyond Earth has small questlines to make gameplay more interesting, but they are not well thought-out nor thoroughly debugged. For instance, one mid-game quest calls for a covert agent to perform a task that 'requires at least level 4 intrigue to complete.' However, a cheap, early building in the game limits intrigue in all cities to a max of level 3 - rendering the questline uncompleteable! Other questlines were very buggy, sometimes informing you of failure even after completion.  All told, Beyond Earth suffers from a lack of effective debugging, game balancing, and play testing. The errors are not buried or obscure - they are readily apparent in matches that were 'standard' in every way! I am very disappointed in the game thus far, and I hope that the game will be repaired, updated, and rebalanced in order to make my money worthwhile.",

Pretend they aren't even there and they just leave you alone. The alien AI is pathetic. If you decide you want to shoot them, they get mad. Ignore them and they ignore you. So stupid. They missed a beautiful opportunity to add a layer of novel complexity to the game. Instead they just put a bunch of silly bugs in the game. On top of that there is a silly bug where if you send your unit into the fog of war and there is another unit there that they can't see, they just attack it! How frigging stupid is that? It's not like that in Civ 5. If there is a unit there, they stop and wait for further orders? But in Beyond Earth, you go to WAR with aliens or another faction if you ACCIDENTALLY CLICK ON THEM. So stupid!   In my first playthrough I fired exactly 0 shots. I never needed to. The map was so big and so full of resources I never needed to lock horns with anyone. I just expanded and out-researched everyone, and that wasn't even my focus. I was planning on fighting. It just never happened. And the tech tree...? I just kind of stumbled around because it was so poorly thought out and confusing. Initially I was going for a Supremacy Affinity, but about half way through I realized I didn't have any Supremacy affinity points, so I went with a different affinity and still dominated. In other words, I needed exactly 0 planning to completely dominate the other factions it was laughable. (And I was playing normal difficulty, mind you).   This game doesn't feel finished. I had weird sounds bugs all throughout the game where the sound would just disappear for a few seconds, which doesn't help immersion.

I haven't figured out what a favor is and why I should trade a material good for one, but maybe I just need to play with it some more. There are no resources affecting health, so if you don't have the tech to build health improving buildings to keep up with your expansion there is no other alternative way to address a negative health number.  Virtues do grant some pretty nice bonuses, but are lacking any sort of context as far as your affinity goes.   Customizing your starting bonuses at the beginning of the game is nice, but a lot of the options are filler and I ended up picking randomly.   The orbital layer maybe useful if there is a specific area you need to boost, but with satillites falling out of the sky every couple of turns I decided to focus of permanent buildings and units instead of diverting resources there.  By the midgame, trade starts to get absolutley ridiculous. Depending on improvements, each city can have 2 or more trade routes and the distance limits to other cities/settlements seem pretty non-existent leading to trade route choice overkill. They really need to either cut down the number of possible routes or have a button to just pick the most profitible one.  The most purplexing part so far are the aliens that have take the place of barbarians. They are randomly hostile toward units. In the begining of the game they will leave you alone for multiple turns and then kill your explorer who you can't effectively guard because they are technically a military unit. This was never an issue in Civ 5 because you would just need to move any unit into a ruin to get the benefit and then run before a barb could catch you. Needing to send out an indefensible unit to camp out for multiple turns is a little baffling.  There is no demographics screen in game as far as I can tell, and on the screens showing info on the economy, military, etc... the information just seemed to be either lacking or complete overload. However, since the AI never attacked me or showed any hint of aggression other than strongly worded language, I didn't end up needing to get into the gritty details.  Get to the end of the game and besides an underwhelming picture and a brief voiceover, there is no recap of the game. No graphs, no maps, no rankings. Just spent hours of your time transcending the bounds of human existence? Well, either keep choosing your trade routes for another 5 hours or go back to the main menu. Yay!  Don't get me wrong, theres nothing here that's beyond redemption and maybe if I spend another 40-50 hours with it I'll come to appreciate what the developers were trying to do here, but do yourself a favor and wait on this one until it gets a price cut or an expansion.",

I gladly sufferd trough the firste release and patches of Civ 5 because it was totally worth exploring this new spin on the civ concept. The weak spots became a funny aspect in our own narratives that we learned to love. I'm talking to you Gandi. With expansions the game became more and more robust and the last 4 years we got to enjoy seing this game grow.   With Civ Beyond Earth we mostly get more of the same but in a different theme, however... it's back to the original dynamic of design flaws. Traderoutes are overpowerd, A.I. is passive and uncharismatic, miasma is hard to see, there are no serious demographics and no real reward or closure if you win. And when you lose... you get nothing, zero, nada. I mean nothing. You've just put 300 turns in that game, created your own universe and then you're just supposed to F off? The faults aren't cute this time. I'm not exited. I'm missing depth. Depth that could have easely been achieved with addapting more old dynamics from CIV 5. To be honest I might have been even more dissapointed if Firaxis did that, my point is: Either keep both feet in CIV 5 and call the piggy by it's name (an expension for civ 5). Or. Make another leap and give us somthing innovative and original that we're willing to explore with you. Take your time for it and don't rush out of production. Are we now tied to 3 years of expansions just to experience CIV 5 in space? I don't think so. Split your group in two if you have to and be fearless damn it.

It was hard to put your finger on when Civ II and Civ III reigned supreme, and has just gotten easier since. The series has gotten more interesting, more beautiful, and overall more user friendly, while still maintaining the basic 'this is Civilization!' aura and mentality of the original. Civ V is appealing enough to bring more people into the world of Civilization, so the next game in the franchise should continue where it left off right?  Beyond Earth feels very Civ - in gameplay, most mechanics etc. There are a few tweaks that I really liked - more Europa Universalis-esque questing system (and bonuses), and a thoroughly aggravating yet more realistic AI system. The problem lies in the visuals and overall feeling of the game. Does anyone remember SimCity Societies? Not a terrible overall game, but most SimCity fanatics that bought it because it was 'next' were thoroughly disappointed. It didn't feel right. Beyond Earth suffers from a similar problem; it is Civ, but it doesn't look as appealing, draw you in quite as much, nor does it give you the sense of accomplishment of destroying France.  So, I recommend it to other Civ'ers to try, but be prepared - it feels like a very unfamiliar step in the wrong direction.",

However I was excited to see the new changes in Beyond Earth, a fresh take on the series from the masters of 4X.  The research tree (or research web) and development of your colonies is non-linear, with no tech being outright better than the other even later in the tree, just different and with different priorities depending on your chosen strategy.  Units also do not become obsolete as the upgrades through your affinity keep them up to par with those unlocked later in the game, again it's not about better or worse, but different.  The big problem with the research web is not in it's function but in how it relays information to you. They obviously tried to go hard for a futuristic aesthetic, but this means that everything is reduced to a simple white icon. It's extremely hard to see if you're unlocking a unit, an ability, a building or a wonder making decisions take a lot longer as you'll have to mouse over every single item. This problem persists in the Civopedia where clicking on a unit does not give you the description and image of the unit, rather you have the description and a giant icon.  In the world the readability is not much better. The miasma which damages your units can sometimes be extremely hard to see, and the difference between tundra, plains, desert and grasslands is miniscule. I don't know what the reason behind this is but it makes it very straining. People with impaired color vision will not have a fun time with that.  The game keeps the old resources of Production, Food, Gold and Happiness even if it renamed Gold to Energy and Happiness to Health, though your rivals will comment on your colonies low health with the same flavor blurb used in Civ 5 to denote low happiness. It feels a bit lazy sometimes.   Is this a bad game? No. Is it a good game? No. But it feels uninspired. Something is missing and it's hard to put your finger on what it is. It's a bit like looking forward to an exciting day trip and hearing it's been postponed until tomorrow. It's not outright terrible but certainly not what you hoped for.  The best part of the game is before the game starts, where you customize your faction. This is a very interesting concept that I hope will be adapted for future games in the series or expanded on in this game.",

The game launched with a profound thud by reviewers and raging anger from fans. And why not? After all this time, after Civ5 and the lessons learned... They managed to make CivBE... Worse! In so many ways.  Besides the (few) factions, we now have civ affinities: Harmony, Purity and Supremacy (for the sake of clarity: Hippies, Racists and Weabos). These change few things, from buildings and unit traits to the way the aliens interact with you. Problem is, in the grand scheme of things, they feel more like skins with a few stat differences. You will eventually get to choose out of 3 different stat sets per upgrade, and more often than not only one is actually useful. In some cases, lady luck will shine upon you and there will be TWO useful sets, but that's about it. Besides this and a few other changes, they all play very similar to one-another. Oh sure, the Hippies can become besties with the aliens, but that's like befriending paint.  Factions will tend to flock to the ones with identical affinities and fight everyone else, which also makes the system seem more like the olden religion system. Gone are specific units. It also doesn't help that some leaders use the same text and audio from the previous title.  The aliens are dumb (big shocker; no really, they seemed smart in the preview videos). They rarely go from the green state (passive), and almost never DARE cross your border (probably think they need visas). You will often witness the 'mighty' Siege Worms pile up on the outskirts, shuffling back and forth as if deciding where to eat.  Your 'intelligent' counter-parts are none the smarter. I only lost a city once in 50+ hours of gameplay, and that's on Very Hard and because i didn't give a f*ck about a stronger neighbour and his requests. The rest of the time they will usually fall behind on techs, make little to no diplomatic efforts and generally being useless, and short-time, friends. At this point in Civ games, I say scrap diplomacy altogether. It's what they seem to aim for anyways.  The new features are nothing memorable either. The 'choose your own path' is just a set of events and choices: one is good, one is bad. Yeah, that's a brainer. A large majority of them are also standard, meaning you will always get them in your playthrough and you will always pick the same option because the other one's useless.  The orbital layer system is also weak. Think you can build or command space-ships to fly by in the orbital layer and bombard cities / drop units in an awesome, futuristic invasion? Well TO BAD. Put this satellite up! They're not all bad, but they have the life-span of soap, meaning you need a new one every 15-20 turns, and some of them take quite a lot to build so just to keep your orbital 'units' running you need to be constantly building them. No, don't think about at least adding a 'repair' ship in orbit. That might be fun.  Perhaps the worst part of it is that it feels stripped down, to make way for DLC. But even then they somehow managed to f*ck it up. There are dozens of people on the forums complaining about how the new (and only) DLC somehow managed to ruin diplomacy more.   Oh no, wait, the worst part is the game has a breaking bug (crash in late-game) and the devs ain't fixing it.  Everything in CivBE's composition makes you think it's a test by Firaxis/2K, who just want to see exactly how much bullsh*t their clients can take. Don't buy this. Don't even think about getting it on a discount.  If a friend gives it to you for free, refuse it and never speak to them again as they are clearly trying to psychologically torture you.",

But I add a couple more words. First of all - it's simple, easy, linear... Many techs, affinities, virtues, building... but... mostly one direction, one path to victory...  Various leaders, but most of them have poor stats except one or two. This makes leaders unbalanced.  Cities - all the same as Civ 5 with different textures. Units - I'm dissapointed. Few units, minor differences between leaders, nothing impressive. Rather like cartoon for kids than something serious. And in my case - all units were upgraded automatically to the latest version whenever I managed new affinity level... Techs - well - good start with less linear tech tree but still - there is a room for improvements, more dependencies, better arrangement. Diplomacy - nothing new. Still the same limited level of diplomacy. For me it doesn't matter a lot but could be more advanced after couple of years since the beginning of Civ 5. Aleins - I'm dissapointed. No inteligence. Just simple barbarians invading units around. No tech exchange, no cooperation, no interaction. Just kill and gain experience for 2 levels... Overall game mechanics - same as Civ 5, just different textures.   I thought in 'future' civilization will be more focused on advanced technologies, more interaction with aliens or alien lifeforms, a bit longer and partitioned tech tree in order to gain benefits from alien planet. Resources, positive, negative events, special actions (agents) are not enough developed to make this game a step forward.  Due to poor AI and some sort of linear action - it's rather step backward...  I like quests, I like hexes, I like range and melee units, wonders, trade. But except quests - there is almost nothing impressive. Orbital units? Ok, they exist. But we can survive and conquer enemies without them...  So in my opinion - game is not worth of more than 5EUR. I paid about 35EUR and I feel like I lost 30EUR.  But ok - let's give this 30EUR to Firaxis and all the intermediate companies. Maybe next version will be more advanced and significantly improved.

The ability to create colonists is buried away in the tech tree (I guess humans don't naturally reproduce in the future), and the health mechanic that replaces last game's happiness index is awful. EVERYTHING reduces health, but there's nothing that can raise a city's health above its population. This would be OK if there weren't also a massive amount of global health decay with no way to counter early to mid-game.  Since Civ IV, it has been hard to really recommend a Civilization game prior to expansions - maybe I shouldn't be shocked that Beyond Earth is lacking balance at present. What I can't excuse, however, is the horrible interface. The entire game (at least for the planet/race combinations I've tried) is cast in a palette of dark blues and browns which reduces the utility of contrast as a visual cue. Text uniformly appears as medium-dark glyphs written on black backgrounds (I have an astigmatism and HATE this - listen up, Steam).

The map is covered with toxic gas with a very slight green hue, but since my race used the green color to map their borders it was nearly impossible to spot the toxic miasma. Selecting a trading caravan highlighted the gas in red but I could not find any other filter to prominently display the miasma. Even just deducing terrain types was a chore, since the tooltip is for some reason anchored to the useless minimap; you must focus on the terrain, then one corner for the tooltip, and finally the opposite corner for your unit's actions.   More than once, I found myself frustrated when a modal dialog popped up with an enemy faction offering diplomatic options. The only choices are to accept or refuse - there is no way to look at the faction's stats, holdings, allies, etc. prior to making the decision. This same lack of consideration typifies the Beyond Earth experience as it now stands. The music is absolutely uninspiring: the same tune that plays during the introductory video periodically plays in the background, but otherwise the soundscape is limited to vague atmospheric tones. Sadly gone are the faction-specific tunes that both play in the background and change as you zoom into a town. Even the completion of world wonders and other milestones is rather underinspiring. There aren't any neat Civ2 style animations or any Leonard Nimoy voice-overs, just a blue-on-blue line drawing with what sounds like a text-to-speech robot voice speaking a few lines. It's hard to overlook the big issues when even the small things are poorly executed.  Aside from the horrid UI and insipid theme, the biggest single issue with the game as it currently stands are affinity points. Basically, Beyond Earth introduces three affinities: harmony, purity, and supremacy. The idea is that your research (using the horribly designed jumble of a tech. tree) will naturally earn rank in various affinities throughout the course of the game. Affinity rank can be exploited with the creation of affinity-specific units and buildings. So far, so good. But, for some foolish reason, almost all of the victory conditions are tied to a specific affinity! This senseless coupling exposes the affinities as an illusion of choice. If a player, for example, strives for a 'promised land' victory, they will need to heavily focus on purity tech. This being the case, why not just integrate the whole purity affinity into the default tech tree and eliminate an unnecessary concept? Looking at the tech tree (piecewise, of course, because you have to zoom so far out to see the big picture that you can't even see individual icons), I have to wonder if this is why it's so unwieldy.   Civ has needed expansions to smooth out the balance and overall game concept for the last few iterations - maybe that will work wonders here, too. A series that has been very slowly refined over multiple decades has no excuse for a poorly designed interface, however, and that's something that I don't think is likely to improve with time. 6/10",

A series that has been very slowly refined over multiple decades has no excuse for a poorly designed interface, however, and that's something that I don't think is likely to improve with time. 6/10",

Negatives (Maybe not as many as positives, but much more important):  - Here's a biggy: only 8 possible civs to choose from, most with abilities that are mediocre at best. After coming from Civ V, its rather pitiful and empty. - World sizes seem somehow small to me. Even in Civ V w/o DLC, the world sizes are very big, and overseas exploration can be very helpful for finding new civs. Not the same in BE. Which leads me to my next point: - You don't discover the other civs on your own; when they land, you meet them and see their capitol. - The total number of different units that you can obtain in a standard game is quite limited. There are so many different units to choose from in vanilla Civ V, unlike this game. - Overseas explotarion provides little to no reward for your efforts.  And of course, -- $50 IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT THIS GAME OFFERS. If you really want to buy this game, wait for it to be on sale or wait for the price to come down to $30 or less.

What it actually does is ensure that anyone who doesn't 'rush' one of the 3 finisher techs (those that give access to Victory Wonders) is almost certainly going to lose.  Warfare is simplified, with there being a massively reduced number of units to choose from, and there are no faction specific unique units any longer. There are also no forts or citadels, making defensive playstyles somewhat less lucrative.   Rising Tide is a good expansion, although I don't think its worth the asking price in any scenario.

This game however leaves a bit to be desired as the complexity of the politics is some where between kill it and smash it. Your governance of the society you're building feels as though you have very few options. AC challenged you with politics and the governance system was incredibly nuanced.   Another comparison I'll make is that it was nearly impossible to win a run in AC in anything less than a few decades (I'm exaggerating but you get the point) where as this game feels like you can win a run in a matter of an hour or two. Even on it's easiest settings, AC could throw curve balls at you that would cripple you where as this game feels too easy even with harder difficulty settings.   All in all it's not a bad game. It's just not a great game. It's not the Alpha Centauri reboot that I had hoped it would be. It's simple, and lacks complexity...a sort of no brainer unlike Alpha Centauri which is a game I've played for over a decade. Looks like it's about time to reinstall it...",

However, I understand that many people may be drawn by the sci-fi/futuristic setting, so maybe they would enjoy this more than I do. Personally, I prefer the more historically-influenced/earth-centric Civ titles.  Also, I played two separate games on 'massive' maps and in both games I was only able to expand 3-4 times (around ~100 turns) before my borders were bumping up against the borders of multiple other civilizations, so I'm not sure if the massive 'terra' maps are much smaller than the massive 'earth' maps in Civ 5, but it definitely feels much more compact, which is something else that was an instant turn off.  That being said, I would still recommend the game, because at it's core it still plays like every other Civilization that has been made.",

Civilization: Beyond Earth is quite an enjoyable experience and fun to play, although it does lack signifigant character. During my time playing, it was interesting learning all the new mechanics, dangers, resources, and the new tech tree.   The tech tree itself could use more detal, as I found myself strugging to figure out what techs lead to what victories, and what I had to do for victories that didn't involve a specific tech to achieve.   The alien life is a great addition and replacement to barbarians with it's variable attitude towards civs. You can be friendly with the wildlife and get along, even use them to your advantage! Or, you can slaughter them and they get increasingly hostile towards your civ. Very interesting dynamic.  Miasma is a very interesting natural hazard that truely restricts movement early-to-mid game. Keeps things interesting, and if you go Unity, you can use it to your defensive advantage.   I will never enjoy this game as I've enjoyed Civilization V, but it's a solid experience that I'd recommend to a newcomer of the series (Right after I recommend Civ V, of course), or to those who are looking for a fairly interesting turn-based strategy.  All that said, the game does lack signifigant character and appears to have much less unit depth and diversity. Of course the units are as diverse as Civ V, save unique units, it appears otherwise due to how little they change. Only four-or-so upgrades for units, rather than watching Swordsman go to Musketeers and Infantry.   It also seems that there's less care put into each faction. As they were started from scratch, I understand it's difficult to come up with interesting civilizations from scratch compared to real-life historical civilizations, but it feels that each Civ is more-or-less interchangable. In Civ V, picking a certain nation may result in higher resource count of a particular kind of resource, or better navy with unique perks, or better culture buildings. In Civ:BE, it's much less diverse.  Tl;dr: Civilization: Beyond Earth is a very enjoyable game and I would give it a 7.5/10 due to it's interesting gameplay, enjoyable experience, but lack of character and diversity. I would recommend you buy it on sale if you already own Civ V, because you'll be getting less content compared to it.",

            "review_text": "Beyond Earth is the PERFECT next step in the Civilization series. At first glimpse, it is very easy to mistake this for just another Civ V with a different skin and two or three new features. But once you've played it extensively, you can really see just how different &amp; awesome BE truly is. My favorite aspect would probably be the loading screens before actually getting to the planet, there are these little text boxes that are supposed to serve as the journal/diary of the leader (you) who is leading the colony to the new planet, which not only lets your imagination wonder for an even funner experieence but also adds just that much more immerson to an already colossally immersive game. Now, of course this title isn't without fault. Most of the claims in the negative reviews are very justified, so please don't take this as a biased review. I do not think BE is a perfect game.   Pros:  Nice, warm graphics that seemlessly flow together to really make the planets you go on a one of a kind place. There are no wonky, choppy textures at all that break immersion like some of the resources in CIV V.  Absolutely phenomenal technology web that not only allows you to create your own personalized strategy to help win games, but also allows that flexibility that lets you drift off into things you haven't tried before without making you go through 50 different techs to get it.   I will say the very best part of Beyond Earth is the modifications for it in the steam workshop. It's only launch week and there are already three pages filled to the brim with exciting mods that, even this early on, truly cater to the advancement of replayability within this title. And this only goes to show that as this game ages, the modding community will become a pinnacle of creativity to make this game even better than it is as of now.  There's a completely redone espionage system, instead of simply assigning a spy to another nations cities and letting him sit there turn after turn, while you just wait for rewards, Beyond Earth makes it so that you may assign specific operations to them, and can do some really amazing late game stuff even going as far as detonating a dirty bomb in another nations capital. But because some of this can be very overpowered, for each operation there is a difficulty level, the higher it is, the higher chacne your agent has to actually fail his assignment. Not only can an agent fail his assignment, but he can also be killed in the process.   The sponsors appearence change as they progress through with their desired affinity, which adds immense amounts of immersion &amp; allows you to easily identify who follow what on the planet.  Cons: The nation bonuses of most of the sponsors are quite useless. There are about 3 main nations or sponsors that really do give good bonuses, which means hardly anyone ever uses the other more underpowered ones. This causes games to become that much more repetitive. I'd really like to play as a different sponsor each time, but this weak bonus system has made it to where it's logically unfound to choose a sponsor with a drastically weaker bonus than the other few.   All of the units look similar to the point that in late game, large scale wars become an eye sore to pick out which units are which. I really do wish the creators would take a note from some of the more known mods on Civilization V, and make it to where each sponsor has specific colors on their units to not only create a sense of differentiation &amp; uniqueness, but also to tether to that ever-present issue in late-game, large scale wars.   Too few sponsors. Even in the short 60 hours I have played on BE, I am starting to become a tad bit bored with seeing the same faces over and over again. Now, this really isn't even an issue at all, because there are countless mods that add sponsors. I only placed this in here, because I'm basing this review on the game itself.   Trade routes can easily become OP if you build a few buildings/wonders &amp; choose certain options in a quest. You could have 3-5 trade route spots in a city all giving you at least 8-10 gold per turn then multiply that by my average of about 7 cities, and boom. I'm set. There's no challenge with that, and it quickly becomes too easy mid-late game. (On easier difficulties)  The tech web. I'm going to place this in both categories, because the bad side to it is that you can EASILY get every single tech the web has to offer wayyy quicker than you should. Having an entire civilization discover new socio-economical, military, cultural and scientific advancements shouldn't be made so easy, in my opinion. Not only is it unrealistic, but it's very immersion breaking.      (I will be updating this review as I play.)",

There is enough complexity with the new resources involved that it is interesting. The way the wonders of this game are used, and that you can lose them without losing a city, is a nice twist.

The map engine is basically the same from Civ. 5, but aside that this is a completely different game, full of new features and definitely worth the price.  My only really bad remark is: the developers did an extremely poor job when developing the 'Brasilia' nation. Brasilia is the capital of Brazil, and we speak Portuguese, but the leader of Brasilia in the game speaks Spanish most of the time, which is rather offensive if you are a brazillian citizen. This is a really ridiculous mistake and I hope the developers fix that soon, but apart that, the game is great.",

Civ 5 was an extremely fun game with almost every game starting out differently, and even though I played against all these civilizations multiple times, I found myself meeting new challenges and having to overcome different obstacles. 'Oh I barely have a standing army after the last war? Here comes Arabia who owns half of the continent. Oh I am 5 techs behind almost everyone else? Let in invest heavily in science. 30 turns later I find myself ahead of everybody. Mongolia is invading within 100 turns? Let me position my troops in this narrow passage and hope for the best' I have a lot of memorable games that I cherish from Civ 5. Which is why I was so excited for Beyond Earth. Not only does it fufill my love of the civ games, but I'm also a fanatic for sci-fi/fantasy games. To be able to build up a civilization.. on a foreign planet? Two birds one stone.. Civ 5 wasnt perfect. Honestly religion was OP and, although, they made new ways of becoming allies with city states it didnt really have any depth to it at all. That, and the fact some civilizations had weak ♥♥♥ passives (ie. China/ America).. But it was all still fun. Not to mention some starting points you get lucky with. 'oh I have cannons at 1000 CE(AD) while you still have long swordsmen? Tough.' So when I finally hop into Beyond Earth, I'm excited... The lack of civilizations was a major turn off but it's fine. I'll just play Space America. I get in.. See the enivronment.. and it's all the same just colored differently. No real innovation.. The tech tree I was excited for was all honestly just bland and stupid. Especially if you are going for a specific way of life (i forgot what it's called ingame) and its getting to the mid-late game. No joke I beat my first campagin in 5 hours. That's all it took. Warfare isnt even fun in this game. I only built up a big army to deter others. I had no intention of using it.. It was ♥♥♥♥ to say the least. In my next game, which i play months later, I build up this huge army early game.. I planned on capturing a few cities from a close neighbor to solidify my hold in the region and pick up some extra resources.. I built 15 troops. Infantry, combat rovers, missle units, rangers what have you... None could make a dent in his weakest city. It's impossible to take a city early game. There is no point in having troops(except for against aliens) in the early game because none of them are going to have anything that will take your cities. Early aggression is pointless so you are forced to hash it out late game, and by then, they probably expanded into 5-10 other cities(in my experience maps are typically narrow and small even when set on huge). In short, there is honestly not a lot of counterplay. Again, warfare is boring. No fun at all. If warfare and diplomacy already dont put you off in the first place the visuals and the environment will. It's a pretty game yeah, but no innovation whatsoever. Such a shame too.

            "review_text": "I had great fun until I got into the late game, where I discovered the game is horribly broken and unfinished. The AI is subtarded, feeble-minded, mentally defective, has cerebral palsy and in most cases is very passive.   I allied with one of the AI Kavithan colonies in a game and Polystralia declared war on them and immediately attacked in one turn. Because I was an ally the game automatically declared war on Polystralia for me before my turn even started, and every single faction in the game including my ally declared me a war monger, which is essentially a PERMANENT debuff that makes diplomacy incredibly difficult, and some times outright impossible. Even after immediately making a peace treaty with the offending nation my alliance with Kavitha was broken and I was on my own for the rest of the game.   Up to that point I had been sending my ally enormous amounts of resources for free and even gifting them cities, and none of this was taken into account. I thought this was just because of the affinities or some random seed of the AI but I tested this in several games and found that this is a feature of the AI regardless of settings and affinities.   I literally spent several days working on one game in particular and after over 500 turns it wasn't even worth continuing. After a week of playing I've seen everything the game has to offer, every game feels exactly the same. The non-domination 'victories' are cheap, if you aren't the victor you won't even know which nation won. It's a token victory with absolutely no depth, no feeling of resolution or that you've actually established a significant colony. All you get is a popup window with smugly written text and a button to return to the game title.   The affinities are meaningless aside from some specific bonus upgrades for military units. At the beginning of the game the AI announces its approval or disapproval of you regarding how you treat the native species of the planet. If you attack the 'aliens' (nonsense term that needs to be changed, since we are the aliens), colonies with the harmony affinity will condemn you with a diplomacy debuff. It gives you a sense of responsibility and the impression of significant depth. But later in the game even AI colonies with maxed out harmony relentlessly attack aliens. You can't ally with alien nests even though you can adapt their species into your colony. Aliens are all the same on all planets (Really!) and there is no evolution that can happen to make them more intelligent and build colonies of their own, actually competing with the humans.  The leaders of colonies will gradually change their aesthetics depending on which affinity they choose, but aside from that they are extremely bland and monotonous. There's also no way to declare them war mongers when they assault each other over frivolous things. There's no reciprocation for being an extremely helpful ally. If your ally asks you to go to war with an aggressor and you accept, your ally will think you are a war monger. Also, during said war if your ally has a border touching the enemy and one of your satelites touches even one of your ally's tiles, even if it is a defensive satellite they will get angry and condemn you for it.  You can't really call this a brand new game, as it is really just a reskin of Civ 5 with a few mods applied (and a significant amount of content removed). There is so much wrong with this game I'm not sure an expansion will help it, but if you want to play it, instead save some money and get Civilization 5, which is a far superior game in every respect. Wait for an expansion for this game and then see if it is worth purchasing. Do not buy this before you try it for yourself.   Firaxis really dropped the ball on this one. For shame.",

If you are lucky there will be other anti-alien tribes you can be friends with; otherwise, you may be much hated for defending yourself against the alien monsters.

The amount of content differentiating this from CiV is not worth paying a full game's price.   Beyond Earth brings a brand new Affinity system which purports to let you change the paradigm of humanity's future evolution, whether it be through genetically manipulating your people closer to their new home, uploading your minds into cybernetic organisms as part of a robotic society, or maintaining your humanity and carving a threatening new world into another Earth. However, the changes only have implications for your military and an exclusive victory condition you'll unlock. It doesn't feel all that much different otherwise, and this disappointment is mirrored in the diplomacy screens with your fellow faction leaders: I wanted to see Daoming show up in a visibly synthetic body as her colony's transition from carbon to silicon completed, but all I got was a few implants, and not even the fun kind. I wanted to see Kavitha undulate her newly acquired mandibles at me as she becomes one with the aliens I've been exterminating, but all I got were blue lines down the side of her face. In the end, it's just not as robust as it could have been.  Really, that statement sums up my feelings about this game: 'Not as '____' as it could have been.'  The story is not as engaging as it could have been. While I can understand how the multiple paths for development toward different kinds of victories mean linear storytelling would have been strained at best, Firaxis misses the mark on the small touches as well. Technology, Affinity, and Wonder blurbs are quotes from the various faction leaders, but instead of having them voice act their own quotes, they're all done by the same ethnic-friendly woman. You WILL get tired of that woman. Even if you let the the quotes ported directly from CiV pass, you're going to end up in bizarre diplomatic situations, like when a rival leader implores you to end bloodshed, and then refuses to negotiate for peace. They may just be poor wording, but it hurts the immersion and reminds you you're not playing against leaders, but AI.  Speaking of AI, winning is not as difficult as it could have been, either. Your rivals have no sense of urgency whatsoever as you plod along toward settling Earth's refugees or contacting an ancient alien race. Because so many of the new victory conditions don't infringe on your diplomatic standing with others, it's trivial to go whole games without making war. Even on higher difficulties, the aliens are a little more threatening and your rivals adept at speeding ahead in the sciences and culture, but they're still frustratingly passive.  Beyond Earth is a fun diversion, but ultimately it is not worth paying a full game's price for a CiV mod, and it is CERTAINLY not a worthy successor to the masterpiece that was Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. Firaxis' expansion packs are known for providing some much-needed love to what usually ends up a bare-bones base game, and they have their work cut out for them this time, but I hope they're rising to the challenge because I WANT to like this game. I just can't. Not right now, not yet. Get it on sale if you're curious, otherwise wait for what's next.",

Where you will find the majority of the atmosphere and wow-factor in this game, is early to mid.. as it is when the aliens and the miasma serve as an ablative set of armor as much as a natural hazard that you have to overcome in some way or another. Figuring out where to take your colony and surviving those first few years is where the game shines and shines brightly.  The tech web can come off as arcane at first, oversight is difficult without extensive experience of where various key features reside.. but as a design idea it is pretty fabulous. Units upgrade in different ways, buildings are customized via the quest system, wonders do not become available at the same time for every player (in fact some wonders might never be accessible to you) and affinities allow for purist or hybridization choices at the late game.  Where's the catch?  Well for one, the late game necessitates that you play the game on a fairly high difficulty, lest the AI proceed to roll over and die without a fight. It is where Civ5 roots starts to show through a fair bit too much for my taste, but it is ameliorated by how you have been able to personally tailor your colony from ground up.. providing you with a unique setup nearly every time,  The victory conditions might be a bit too easy to achieve once your empire has survived to late game, but to be fair I have never truly played Civilization to win.. as much as experience the emergent narrative and international relations that spring forth from it.  Personally I pre-ordered and was not disappointed, and I will get whatever DLC/Expac Firaxis produces for it.. because I want more!",

It's not Alpha Centauri, but definitely just as fun. Plays very differently though, with the tech web being one of the major changes. The quest system is a great way to guide growth toward one of the victory conditions, and the culture/affinity system is of an interesting design but takes some getting used to. Small grievances towards feedback on some of the tooltips, e.g. not all effect of quest choices are explained in the tooltip when you have to choose.   All in all a cool experience, which I heartily recommend to any Civ fan. Definite 9/10.   I am very curious to any DLC this game may get in the future (if any).",

            "review_text": "Sid Meier's Civilization®: Beyond Earth is a great edition to the Civilization series though lacking ingenuity.  Yes, It's true that Beyond Earth is quite similar to Civilization 5 but Beyond Earth adds some very unique and interesting features that where lacking from Civilization 5 and other Civilization games. I'm not going to say that these 'features' justify the price tag that the game comes along with but I think the features are reasonably significant.   The addition on the new 'affinity' system is probably the biggest thing going for Beyond Earth at the moment, if you have no idea what the 'affinity' system is let me explain it a little bit. Inside of Civilization: Beyond Earth there are 3 different affinities, Harmony, Purity and Supremacy. Each affinity has different unique resources, units. Along with these unique resources and units there is also a unique victory condition for each of the affinity.  The game is reasonably balanced but once a civilization gets access to the first unique affinity based unit the balanced heavy falls in their favor until another civilization is able to catch up this creates a big problem especially for new players. The quest based tutorial doesn't provide a lot of guidance in-terms on acquiring affinity. The best way to level up an affinity is through the tech web but for new players who do not have all that much experience or knowledge regarding Civilization: Beyond Earth this provides a real problem.  The biggest fault that the games has at the moment is the artificial intelligence though it seems decent the artificial intelligence likes to make random and often un-intellegence decisions. I'll will make a trade a offer to another civilization and I'll use the 'What will make this work' button and the artificial intelligence will offer me more for less then what I was offering. The artificial intelligence also rarely likes to declare war regardless of the circumstance.  I would give the game a score of 7.8 out of 10, I look forward to seeing what the future brings. I also recommended that user's keep an eye out of the modifications for this game as there are likely to be some very interesting and unique modifications to come in the future.",

Yeah. I know. You look at the unit selection and there's like 20. Thats awful right. NO. PLAY THE F***ING GAME. YOU CAN UPGRADE EACH UNIT TO BE UP TO 10 DIFFERENT UNITS. You want an artillery that is silvery and badass, go Supremacy and you can get an Educator. Want a floating city? No problem. Anything is possible if you actually play the game.  You: This is bascially a mod for Civ V! Let me give you a tip. Take your head out of your ♥♥♥ and look around. Look at sequels to games. Notice anything? They have the same mechanics! That is amazing. Heres the thing, games aren't sequels unless they have some of the same elements. You're complaining that the game that you bought as a new, exciting version of the game you love has elements that you love and still work.  You: The game is unbalanced! Some affinities are better than others, and you dont even want to attack them! *Gasp*! Some things are better at attacking than others? Well golly, this game IS ♥♥♥♥. Doesn't it make so much more sense that the affinities should all be equal and all perfectly balanced at health, production, and warfare? NO IT DOES NOT. If you want everything to be even, I dont know what to tell you. Play COD or something I guess. That is not how a strategy game works. YOU SPECIALIZE IN SOMETHING TO GET BETTER AT THAT THING.   You: The map is boring and stupid and bland Yeah. Okay. ♥♥♥♥ing canyons to the center of the earth and gorgeous mountains shimmering with miasma next to alien wildlife and wilderness. Yeah, that sounds boring. Heres something. Have you ever heard someone complain about the blandness of the map of Civ V? No? That is because it is a planet and not your desktop wallpaper. It is not meant to be beautiful but rather tactical and diverse.  You: This game is terrible without Rising Tide I don't have rising tide and I love it  You: There isnt enough Sponsors Yeah, ok, you got me there.

The larger ones like siege worms and leviathans will remain a concern even at the end of the game. The new quest and virtue systems pretty much guarantee that every game will be slightly different by themselves, add in the the new tech web and the 3 affinities and it will be all but impossible to get a play through identical to one you've done before, without trying specifically to get one. All in all I enjoyed this game far more than Civ V due to the changes they made. I was really disappointed in Civ V and thought the franchise had peaked with IV, but BE gives me some hope 2k learned some valuable lessons.   There are points where 2K did get lazy with things or didn't polish parts as well as they should have, but these are fairly minor issues overall that don't drastically detract from the game experience. The biggest disappointment to me were the lame endings, like Civ V they don't even give you a decent ending cinematic, just a very dull, 'you win' screen and picture. Similarly when you build wonders you get blah screens that look like sketched blueprints.   Overall a very worthy addition to the franchise and more fun than its predecessor.",

I'm not really sure where to start, but I'm just going to say that this addition to the Civ franchise is good, it's fun, it's certainly not bad. Is it a massive leap from the previous title ? No. Does it try to do things differently ? Yes. It feels like civilization, plays like civilization and if you're familiar with it, you will indeed feel comfortable, but it does play differently in different ways, but it's more like a overhaul of numerous features rather than an entire change of the base game.   It's important to note that this is much better than Civ V at launch, Civ V had a pretty bumpy launch and it greatly hurt it, but later on it really good incredibly improved by the expansions. In full honesty, if you haven't tried Civilization and want to give it a go, I'd suggest going for the complete edition of Civ V (Don't go for Vanilla though), if you LOVED Civ V but want to have something new and varied, but still keep what made you like Civ V, CivBE is a good purchase, and especially if you're into the sci-fi and a new home for humanity setting like I am. If you're unsure and want a more varied, greater product like Civ V complete and what that cool theme and sci-fi art direction, wait for expansions, I'm sure they'll guarantee the improvement of this game, but it's important to note that expansions WILL be expensive.  So far though, I'm absolutely loving the game, I fell in love with Civ V but started to move away from it and wanted something fresh, in BE I've very much enjoyed what i've played so far (keeping in mind I haven't played for that long yet and the enjoyability from Civ comes from end game), I think Fireaxis has done many things right and has well thought through what they're going to do with each mechanic and feature. I have no regret buying this product and I'll be looking forward to the hundreds of hours sunken into it as I have with the previous title while I should actually be studying, but c'mon, it's only just one more turn.",

(For the negatives read below).  Using a 30' monitor at x1600, the graphics actually regressed from Civ V. As noted by others, depending on the underlying terrain miasma, hills and other features can be difficult to see. The 'new' interface is less intuitive, feels more clunky, and doesn't scale to the resolution as well either. While they tried to make a more alien 3D landscape, it still came off feeling a bit too flat.   In the grand scheme of things, most of my complaints are all minor or related to the overall polish of the game, but they are detractors that can leave the experience a bit flat and bland - as if something is missing. I understand the minimalistic approach to design, but the information should be readily available without requiring that I go digging in the Civilopedia for better details.

I have played through and won twice on this game and I am hooked! There are so many negative reviews, I actually can’t believe I purchased the game at full price. I am so glad I did because the game has the deep strategy I was looking for. This game has the deep strategy and content I love about the Civilization series without being a clone of the game set in space.    The Civilization series is a masterpiece of gaming content. The original game came out in 1991, there is no question it has to be the most enduring PC based game in history. I have played this game for that long and each version has just gotten better. Each version has also been different. Civ B.E. is no different. I truly enjoy the three tracks you can go by as far as alien culture. The Tech Web is much more engaging than the linear tech tree. The modes of winning have been very fun to explore.   There are three tracks by which you choose your dominant culture for the game. Each one is a combination of a religious devotion, a cultural belief and provides technology boosts. Track one is harmony with the alien planet, track two is a balance of the two and track three is pure earth culture all the way. They become religious in the sense that like Civ 5 you anger, annoy and upset your fellow colonists to the point where it could lead to war. This serves the purpose of a political devotion as well. The nice thing is it is not mutually exclusive you can mix and match as you go so there is a balance there as well. The technology boosts equate into ways to help with the all aspects of the game. This makes for a unique sci fi strategy game that I have not seen before. You get to decide how “Alien” your culture becomes.   The Tech Web is similar to other sci fi strategy games I have played, in that you have a core of technology you start with then branch off in a direction. What makes this even better is that each sub technology does not have to be researched in a linear way. This makes it possible for you to jump around and move in a direction when needed based on what your colonies goals or needs. To the credit of BE it allows you to address specific colony issues. There may be a building that brings easy health and you have a health problem. There may be a military improvement or other reason to keep building on a specific technology track. This is so much better than the tech tree. You have to pick a track culture, economy or military to get to a goal and even through it has branches it is still pretty linear in nature. After two complete play trough’s each game played differently which I truly enjoyed.   The modes of winning are very different which also makes it fun. You are not devoted to one over another and do not need to commit as early as you do in Civ 5. In my second play though I could have easily gone with conquest but I chose Transcendence. Each victory style has a different end point which also makes winning as satisfying as Civ 5. I have completed two victory tracks and look forward to completing more.   If you’re a Civilization series fan you will find the game similar as well as very different. If you have played this series for years as I have, the deeper cultural and artistic touches where not there in the original 1991 game. No doubt this has made the original game a legend. Civ B.E. is worth playing now and it will only get better in the future.",

ANd, in my humble opinion, it is a fine addition to Sid Meier's legacy.  There are a few minor issues, mainly with the UI. Lack of information, or even a simple inclusion of the current date were somewhat disappointing, but the UI was never clunky or difficult to use. It simply would benefit from a few additions, such as demographics. In my experience thus far, the AI could benefit from being a little more aggressive on higher difficulties as well.  Overall, Beyond Earth can be summarized as having options. The tech web is interesting and well-implemented, and it truly feels as though you are exploring possible avenues of human advancement, instead of following the rigid path laid out for us in prior Civs (albeit by necessity). The virtues system offers more real choice than policies, as there are clear benefits for going deep on one category, or broad across several. Effectively, to have a focused but specialized civilization, or a more versatile one.  The amount of choices does mean that each individual aspect lacks the same level of personality and emotive connection when compared to prior Civs, but not only is this an acceptable tradeoff, it is better for the affective feel of the game. The future, and the world, is meant to feel cold and alien, not warm and familiar.  It is a fine game, for fans of the turn based genre. However, don't view it as a sequel to Civ V, but, rather, a new (but similar) game. There is also likely to be more content coming by way of expansions in the future; it pays to remember that Civ V itself was quite low on content prior to the release of G&amp;K and BNW.",

I'm giving it a qualified recommendation based on 22 hours of play, one complete game (a loss that came as a total surprise - more on that later) and one short game to learn the mechanics and the below observations:  I am more than a little underwhelmed by the end game screen. If a grand ending is important to you, you might be well-advised to look elsewhere.  Things seemed to be going OK. No warning that another player was about to meet one of the rather obscure victory conditions (which is perhaps realistic and therefore forgivable, but a bit disappointing) but there were no stats, no peek under the cover after-the-fact and no explanation of any kind what just happened. It just sort of ended and said something like, 'We thought we knew how to win. We were wrong.' It's not the worst ending I've ever seen on a game, just the worst I've ever seen on a Sid Meier game. This really has the feel of something that was left for last and then got short-circuited when corporate accounting forced the dev team to meet a release date. Are any of those people gamers?  Tech tree takes some real pouring over to make the right choices. Use the filters to find the techs you need to focus on. I suspect my loss had a lot to do with going down interesting but time-consuming rabbit holes that didn't lead to a logical ultimate victory condition for my chosen faction to pursue and our particular strengths. I think I'll learn a lot about this in future games, now that I've been punked for 22 hours of my life. I just hope the frustration of the crappy endings and the fact I can't sort out what it was that led to my demise doesn't wear me out before I learn to play the game well.",

People complain about the lack of content but remember, the CiV games love expansions and this game will probably be no different. If you ignore the comparisons between this and CiV 5 and play the game as it's own thing, you will enjoy the game much more. If the game did not have the CiV license I am sure people would be praising the hell out of it but because the CiV games have such a high bar it is very hard for people to be pleased by this game. I personally really enjoy the game for what it is and while it may be lacking compared to CiV 5, the sci-fi approach and new science trees are a welcome edition.  The pros: The affinity system is a great new addition QUESTS!!!! Interesting ways to customize the start of a game Alien AI that acts in interesting ways compared to barbarians New orbital gameplay Mod support Tactical combat A more robust political system compared to previous CiV games Some very cool art-design and very well done cutscenes (cutscenes are rare though)  The cons: Boring maps Sometimes the AI spawns right next to you :( Somtimes aliens spawn right next to you :( Boring factions Small amount of units Lacklustre endings  Even though the cons are significant, I still find that Beyond Earth is a fresh entry in the series and should not be overlooked just because some crazy fanatical CiV fans are all butthurt about the game not being exactly how they wanted it to be. People need to accept change. If CiV players are always complaining about games like Call of Duty or sports games never changing, they should not be complaining about Beyond Earth not satisfying every little thing they wanted.",

First of all, one shall not look at the game as a new civilization game - it's not. You can either look at it as a turn based game, similar to civ, or maybe a bigger DLC. If you can accept this, the game suddenly turns from shallow to rich, and you become able to have proper fun. The game is fun. First it's startling, as you have no idea what that miriad of resources around is about, chaotic, as the research web really is... chaotic :) As you take your time to get into it, you can get to love it - I certainly did.   Then again, only if you look at it as a different game or more like, a dlc to civ5. Even more so thanks to the 'Beyond Earth' button at the tech victory.  So while the game truly lacks the historical resources Civ5 had, it's by no mean bad. You just need to get it for a lower price since let's face it, a DLC shouldn't cost a full game's price, right? If it goes for around 10 euros, I would say it's worth it.",

            "review_text": "Civilization; Beyond Earth is a 4x strategy game by Firaxis studios, which is obvious and apparent.  The game is presented in the Civ V engine, with certain tweaks and alterations. Not having played Civ V myself, I cannot directly compare the games. Notable differences from the previous civilization titles I have played, though, include;  A technology 'web', a series of interconnected technology branches which can be reached with only a single link, as opposed to the traditional Tech Tree's requirements. This means that a broader approach to technology acquisition is encouraged, allowing for a more diverse set of achievements. Beneath each branch, are two or three 'leaf' techs that are slightly more expensive, but more specialised, providing additional bonuses over the branch technology.  Your unit's strength, and the appearance of your colony are decided by the 'Affinity' you develop through gameplay. A choice of three ideologies you can make through your actions and boosted by certain technologies. Each affinity has it's own bonuses and advantages, as well as some unique units with specialised abilities and powerful weapons. This does bring the overall variety of units down, but makes it much easier to compare your relative strengths on the battlefield.  Barbarians are gone, replaced with a new minor faction with it's own AI. Alien lifeforms inhabit your new planet, gaining strength from hostile miasma and generally being a nuisance. While at first glance, they seem to be similar to barbarians, they are not. For startes, you can only gain a certain amount of experience from grinding alien units. You can destroy alien nests, but if misama is allowed to gather above the xenomass that replaces them, then the nests may respawn.  Alien units vary in power and abilities, from rapid moving melee enemies, to the massive Seige Worm, and artillery units. All of them remain dangerous until mid-game, but are easily quelled by focused efforts.  Your colonist no longer immediately spawns a city, now, necessitating protection from your military units against attacks by aliens or other colonies on Planet. This outpost phase makes your development and expansion slower and more methodical, creating a greater investment in time and effort to establish new cities in dangerous locations. This vulnerability is short-lived, as cities feature artillery strike attacks, and defensive missile barrages.  The biggest bugbear I had going into the game was the lack of unit stacking. Only one unit of each type (One military, one civilian) may be stacked on a single hex. Multiple military units require multiple hexes, and civilian workers and colonists can block each other's progress across the map, or stall the creation of roads and rails. This may seem unfortunate, but lends the battles in the game to becoming more about maneouver and tactical positioning, rather than just having the largest stack of units in a square. Defending or attacking a city becomes mch more interesting now that individual units must jockey for space to launch their attacks.  In closing, Beyond Earth is a unique game unto itself within the Civilization series, a worthy addition thanks to it's different take on Civ 4X style strategy. The limited unit variety and streamlined developments make battles more easy to follow and forces easier to compare, and the outpost system makes it more difficult to randomly drop cities in the middle of disputed territories. While lacking the unit customisation of Alpha Centauri, this game is clearly designed around different paradigms and is not a fair comparison against the aforementioned title.  Try it for yourself, and treat it like a new experience, not just another Civ V expansion.",

I started playing with a video card (amd 4870) that is a bit dated. I could play the game but with limitations that were due to the lack of power in the video card. I then bit the bullet and purchased an amd r9-280, huge improvement in video power. Problem was I could not load BE, it would just not load from the Steam screen. After the patch on the 8th I am now able to play the game. Soooo … the patch was very helpful for me. PATCH PROBLEM – As has already been noted, my trade routes do not yield good profits when connecting to other civ's (I play on the lowest lever for now). Thus all my trade routes are connected to my cities. This is a let down. I could maybe see this in the much harder level but not at the lowest level. GENERAL PLAY – My old brain (70) can not keep track of the faction names. Between the name of the faction leaders and the factions I just have a very hard time keeping track of them. Would it be possible to allow us to rename the faction or the leaders? I have built a city within two squares of a mineral and have not been able to purchase and the city will not build out to the mineral for many many turns. I would like to see the ability to purchase land start out very wide at the lower level of play and then contract a bit in the harder levels.

Graphics; The graphics aren't bad, bt they aren't the best, nothing to write home about, but they are better then Civ BE. You won't destroy your computer playing the game if you've bought one in the past 4 or so years.  Sound; where as civ V had an inspirational soundtrack this one is diffrent.  Techweb. The web looks really simple, and its not aligned in any fashion. its not randomized, but you will research the same basic techs, and depending on the resources you have acess to, you'll research diffrent things to use the resources, and to increase the affinity associate with said resources  Age progression; As you expand you gain more acess to more resources, and you will want to expand, in order to gain acess to things like Xeno mass, which you need to make cool things like Kaiju like monsters, but there are mechanics in place to make it possible to be a cultural or technolgical powerhouse with only a handful of cities..... Your units get stronger as you increase you affinities, affinities are increased via quests, and researching tech. It is quite difficult to research everything being that by the time you get around turn 220, people start going an endgame mode where if you don't try to stop them, you'll lose.  War; Cities still need to be taken meele units, like marines or tanks, and you will usally go to war over the rare affinity resources that are uber valubale and useful. A sumpremecist might have expanded into a region with a lot of xenomass, and they don;t want to trade. You want it. You can usally get away a snach in grab on a city that take 30 years if the colony happens to be disconnect from the mainland.  Ai; I guess making an AI thats really good is hard, since most games including this one end up giving the AI cheats. You won't have trouble if you know what your doing.  Diplo; Compared to the Civ 5 ai, the Ai in BE is less warlike, but if you don't trade, or attack their trade partners, there will be little in the way from stopping the Ai from trying to eat you.  Endgame; The endgame is coupled with either someone building an affinity alinged wonder, or the AI making lose alliances, or eventally going to war with people with diffrent affinities then theirs. Eitherway their will be conflict, and it can get pretty cool lategame with gaint monsters fighting people in powerarmor.  Trade; Trade seems great, it can become the powerhouse behinds your Nation most of the time, and it allows other nations to raid trade routes to cripple cities as opposed to occcupying have a country  Factions; Where as in Civ V you played as the Egyptains in the Frozen tundra hunting elphants, i.e. playing with historical figures along a linear technological lines, in beyond earth you don't really play as a faction, but you chose a fictional background that give you a small buff, slightly smaller then in Civ5, but they have a more lasting empact on your choses throught the game as aposed to thematic buffs that may or may not help. In contrast your faction was predetermined in Civ 5, with your goverment being really the only thing that evolved, and in BE your faction evloves based entirely on your surrondings and research and cultural developments. There are no goverment choices.  My rating;8.5 We all know its going to get improved with future expansions, and there really is not use whinning about it. If you don't like it(based on reviews and the demo), wait a year or two for it to go on sale, likely with the expansions, I don't recommen this to science fiction illiterate fans, or history buffs.

            "review_text": "I have very mixed feelings about this game. As a long time fan of the Civ franchise, I want to enjoy it and there are a fair few parts of the game I really like. I also love the rework to the trade system, allowing trade routes to be based off a max number per city instead of a max number over your entire civilization. The outpost into city idea is a nice addition to the game as well, making it far more risky to simply plant new cities without the proper protection.   On the other hand though, there are quite a few things this game is lacking compared to past Civ games. For one, there are no real air units. Sure there are planes but there is only one type of plane that can be upgraded through the affinity tree system. Because of this, you dont have bombers or jets or helicopters. You simply have one type of air unit that spans your entire civilization. They have also removed unit types almost completely, essentially making it so the only types of unit are ranged and melee. Gone are the days of mounted units or armor units. Gone are the days of special units to then counter those units or SAMs or anything of the like. They've removed one time use units as well (missiles) which disappoints me greatly.  All naval units are now ranged (One boat, one carrier) which is another step back I feel. Further more, the 'veterency' system (replaces the leveling system for units) only has one option. You can either upgrade their attack or you can heal them instantly. No more tile tailored soliders or units that move twice as fast. Many of those buffs have are now placed in the affinity upgrade paths but again, these upgrades will span every unit of that type in the civilization that really lessens the combat of the game, I feel.  They have removed great people, replacing most of the benefits associated with them with the new quest system. The quest system in itself is a great addition but I truly do miss the great people of games past. Through the quest system, you can rank up your affinity level, give certain buildings extra stats or even make your trade ships safe from aliens. It is a nice system that allows for some direction within your over-arching plan but it really doesn't make too huge of an impact on your game aside from the building specific ones and tile improvement quests.  Miasma is cool and the whole removal/adding of it based on your affinity can lead to some fun play but this game is a shadow of civ 5, even when that game was a fresh release.  If you like strategy games and you dont have Civ 5, buy that game and it's expansion packs. If you want a dumbed down sci-fi version of Civ 5, by all means, purchase this game. Hopefully through updates and expacs (hopefully less expacs and more updates) they will re-add much of what makes the civ games so much fun.  TL;DR  PROS: -Units all upgrade at once -Health (replaces happiness) has some cool functions -The virtue tree synergy and the tree itself -Bad ♥♥♥ looking units through the affinity trees (Supremecy and Harmony. Not so much Purity) -The miasma mechanic  -Cool aliens replacing barbarians -Quests -Diplomactic AI seems stronger than in other games -Favor system (Diplomacy) -Spying system is stronger than ever  CONS: -No real upgrade for units through leveling them -Very limited amount of units  -Only one air unit (Can upgrade down other paths but you still only get one that spans your playthrough) -No SAM or Anti Air guns -Only ranged naval units -No submarines -No anti-armor/anti-tank units -No Great People -Very few wonders compared to other games -Dumbed down win conditions (The affinity based ones are basically the same, merely requiring different techs to complete each respective one. Flavor text varies, requirements to win do not.)  I want to reccomend this game because I love the Civ franchise. I've been enthralled with it since Civ 3 but each game, they make it simpler and simpler. If you are a hardcore fan of the series, pick this game up and give it a spin. If not, not that I would every advise someone to torrent the game, but torrent it.",

I started playing with a video card (amd 4870) that is a bit dated. I could play the game but with limitations that were due to the lack of power in the video card. I then bit the bullet and purchased an amd r9-280, huge improvement in video power. Problem was I could not load BE, it would just not load from the Steam screen. After the patch on the 8th I am now able to play the game. Soooo … the patch was very helpful for me. PATCH PROBLEM – As has already been noted, my trade routes do not yield good profits when connecting to other civ's (I play on the lowest lever for now). Thus all my trade routes are connected to my cities. This is a let down. I could maybe see this in the much harder level but not at the lowest level. GENERAL PLAY – My old brain (70) can not keep track of the faction names. Between the name of the faction leaders and the factions I just have a very hard time keeping track of them. Would it be possible to allow us to rename the faction or the leaders? I have built a city within two squares of a mineral and have not been able to purchase and the city will not build out to the mineral for many many turns. I would like to see the ability to purchase land start out very wide at the lower level of play and then contract a bit in the harder levels.  I have some other issues with the game but on general I do recommend the game for people of all ages (I don't play shooter games.)",

However, the game perform quite well even on modest gaming machine, which is a tremendous achievement considering the fact that Civilization 5 had some trouble running on the most high-end hardware. I had the pleasure to notice there are indeed some clever references to the old Alpha Centauri game, but only a few good ideas were borrowed, as much of the game feel like playing Civilization 5 with a new plot twist and sci fi units. The maps are gorgeous, the alien species are well designed and the game look and feel like it was built with great attention to even the smallest details, pretty much like Civilization 5. As for the better performance, it is quite understandable since Civ 5 was using a new engine at the time and this engine feel better now that it is implemented wonderfully in Beyond Earth. I sincerely hope the developers will support the game with as much DLCs as they did with Civ 5, as they truly enhance the experience. The game put a heavy focus on science and technology and even diplomacy instead of focusing on building up a military force against your enemies. The experience of developing a mutual cooperation between the other factions while you slowly colonize a planet feel like it's a bit utopian but I've always played Civ to achieve a scientific or cultural victory while using diplomacy, so there's nothing new for me there. The military merely exist to protect your settlement against agressive aliens, but most of them are inoffensive, unless you choose a harder map. The game is a great addition to my strategy extravaganzza and I hope to see more of it in the near future. I recommend this game to everyone who enjoy sci fi strategy, especially those of you who are fans of the likes of Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations or Sword of the Stars.

I still enjoyed playing, would recommend the game and am curious as to what will come in the expansions.   A lot of game mechanics can be taken from Civ V, so that can be the starting points for comparision.  What I liked: The military system is simplified. There are base units which are upgraded throughout the game, rather than a variety of new units. They need to upgrade units are handled automatically which is nice relief.  The Orbital layers is a great little addition to the game.  The affinities provide a good change, and it fits into the game mechanics really well.  The virtues (culture generated buffs), are generall comparable to what you would expect in Civ 5.  Graphics are similar in technical quality to Civ V however the design of the maps are well done and engaging.   What I Didn't: You like the tech web or not. The level of choice is great, which you can either consider great for customisation or a little daunting. However, as with the wonders, all of the techs and wonders are rather 'soulless', they aren't particularly interesting and make the game a little immersive. They aren't really 'relatable', and the bonuses are simply just +something to stats, which are less creative than the Civ V wonders.   City states are gone. This was one of the greatest mechanics of CIV 5, and replaced by 'stations' which are far less engaging.  I personally am a fan of Civ 5's UI (I'm a sucker for good art deco), and just don't prefer the starkness of Civ BE.  There no religion or Great person mechanics, but I will guess these might come along inevitable expansions.",

The fact that the enemy AI doesn't pick fights with you for no reason like in previous games is fantastic.

Here, as long as I play it cool and don't ♥♥♥♥ off the other cities, I do alright for myself, which is a welcome change and option for playstyle.

That is the trade, water travel, and unit types become availble early and it seems to be quicker to approach victory.   It doesn not feel like it has the same length as civ: BNW and lacks some finishing touches. The most significant of these is simply the difficulty in just reading the tech web, wonders don't stand out from units or buildings and it is very easy to miss a significant thing if you aren't looking for it. A mod already exists to colour code this and hopefully this will become incorporated into the game. An inability to protect trading outposts is quite frustrating, they are worthwhile investments but do not pop up in the late game and the AI will quite likely destroy them.  It is still a long game, even if it does not have the obvious time periods of the previous game. The new social policy layout is an improvement. Units have been greatly simplified, which I find enjoyable. The basic types are researchable immediately and undergo improvements as your civilisation progress. There are more advanced auxiliary units to these, and once you know what to research to unlock them, they become interesting additions to late game warfare.   I would recommend this game to my fellow Australians but shortly after release this game was hit the the Australia tax. This meant an increase in price of almost 100% ($50 - $90), for no justifiable reason, beyond corporate greed screwing up the price at the release. It is honestly insulting that there is an additional $40 cost for late(ish) buyers in this region and completely unjustifiable. There is no hard copy to ship out, no anything and to Australians, New Zealanders and others in this region I suggest playing civ 5 until the price drops or just getting $40 of cheap laptops / pcs, installing steam and smashing them all with a hammer.

You cannot go completly wrong with the direction you are developing your civ in (but maybe that is just cause I play with advisors, who knows) and the unit upgrade tree is -compared to 5- very linear which adds to the fact that there are very few units in the game (example: 1 air unit/2 sea units). But what might really hurt the game in the long run is the quests (in particular the building ones) which randomise the game and reduce your ability to plan ahead, something that already caused me to restart one game, cause the fence upgrade just wouldnt come up, but I digress. So why do I recommend the game? It has a really good sci-fi atmosphere complete with references to everything from Alpha Centauri (needle jet) to Starship Troopeers ('the only good bug is a dead bug' achievment), and, as I said in the beginning, its more of Civ5 goodness.",

Pros: More early game decisions that remove a lot of 'next turn' turns. Awesome techweb that allows your people to actually BE different than other factions. The tech is diverse enough to where you can skip the 'useless' tech you didnt want to bumrush what you DID want, and if someone makes a different choice then you then they dont suffer for it-their people just end up developing different strengths instead of exploitable weaknesses. Aliens that are a serious threat to your people. Affinity system lets you play how you want without gimping your military. Continued use of hexagonal grid and no unit stacking means 30 units cant hide and appear out of nowhere to come up your butt. Less unit types offer easy to pick up and easy to counter combat strats that let you focus on having more fun instead of remembering the 100+ different units and all their stats. They also always upgrade even on the go, so youre not holding onto troves of cash to upgrade them or even worse, keeping obselete ones around because you cant.   Cons: Why is the miasma so hard to see? It HURTS ME to stand in it so why does it camoflage to the ground? The end game spirals out of control, one moment youre making buildings and being nice to everyone then you hit affinity level 4 and suddenly youre out to kill everyone. It only gets faster as you continue to get affinity levels like no tomorrow. The game will 'suddenly' end. Bam Promised Land ending, no victory screen no map no stats... just back to the main menu. EVen just hovering over the diplomacy screen will tell you just about EVERYTHING you need to know about someone, how advanced they are what wonders they have how much tech they have how much culture they have... and if you open a deal with them you get an exact amount of science and gold per turn too. There's also little deal making going on, without luxury resources Im not inclined to trade with anyone... if I give you Titanium youll just make Battlesuits with it! Why only 8 players? I loved huge brawls with my friends against the AI but if I bring 4 friends theres only 4 AI left. Speaking of AI, theyre ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They dont even know HOW to use the units they do make and theyre so passive I can literally stack Artillery outside their borders and they wont care. Even without my military, I was able to stage a coup d'etat in one of their capitals, apparently when spies are detected they dont care and wont station them defensively or use anti spy buildings/satellites. Why dont the Aliens get any tougher? For the first 150 turns youre almost completely at their mercy, building a fence to keep the siege worms out and sending military convoys (big ones) out with your colonists to fend off the alien hordes... but after that theyre a joke and your units will kill most of them in one attack. And the ones that dont die in one attack wont care what you do to them.",

Now that i have that out of the way, I bought this game under the pretense that it was linux compatible (because the page on steam clearly says that it is) only to find out that it will not run on a majority of linux machines at all. The few that can run it most likely had to figure out some kind of work around just to get the game to boot. This alone would not be a huge deal except for the fact that when i go to 2K's website for support, the page doesnt even mention linux (or mac for that matter) as a supported OS. So i payed $50 for a game that will not run on my system, and the one bit of 'help' i've found on 2K/firaxix official sites pretty much said 'the Linux community is smart they will finish the port for us.'    so in short i bought a game that i have to finish porting on my own and i payed full retail for what i thought was a working game. This is my experience take it for what you will, the game hasnt even started once for me. ",

            "review_text": "I got Beyond Earth and Rising Tide on a sale, and it is basically Civilization 5 in space. If you have played and enjoyed Civ 5 you will probably feel right at home with most of the game. If you haven't it's your average 4X game where you build cities, build buildings, research technologies, train units, fight wars, and try to ultimately win by completing some goal like conquering the world, building some building, or getting everyone to agree that you're way more awesome than them.  Some differences worth mentioning are, in no particular order are: * The player begins a few turns before the AI opponents, and the opponents drop down a couple of turns after each other. * The game features quests with similar objectives and rewards as the client states in Civ 5, but that only apply to the player. * Technology now forms a web rather than a tree. * The game seemingly at random gives the player a choice between two bonuses. * There is an affinity system which is leveled up by researching key technologies associated with an affinity, or completing quests. Higher levels some times provide some bonuses and&amp;or allow the player to chose to instantly and globally upgrade a unit type to a new improved version. * There are explorers who are weak and slow units that can excavate some tiles for bonuses.  Other than that Beyond Eearth plays a lot like a reskinned version of Civ 5, and I would be ok with that if the AI wasn't so dreadfully dumb.  As in all Civ games the intelligence of the AI doesn't change with increasing difficulty, instead they are given increasingly more resources than the player. In Beyond Earth the AIs are so hopelessly stupid that it is really easy to win on Apollo (Deity) difficulty. Some of the stupid things the AIs will do are: * Refuse to expand (They will rarely go far beyond 4 cities) * Randomly declare wars they have no hope of winning * Not attack after declaring war * Attacking cities with nothing but ranged units who are unable to conquer the city * Throwing a few units at a time into your comparably huge army * Attempting to conquer cities with embarked units  The game would be ok, but nothing revolutionary if the AI problems were fixed, but as it is I only feel like I am bullying small children who have no idea what they are doing as I'm so very very slowly without making any interesting decisions working my way towards whichever win condition I chose. I would recommend that you pick this game up on a nice sale after a big update states that they finally added AI that can play the game. or if you are only going to play it in multiplayer, because I consider the single player game to be horribly broken at the moment.",

Also, I've only put about 2 hours into the game so far so this is more of a first look than a review, but here is my opinion thus far.   So why am I recommending this overpriced, glorified expansion pack? Because personally, I had to force myself to close it down to write this review. There's no Earth-shattering (pun might be intended) changes in the mechanics, but for me that was a plus. You will feel right at home with this game if you are a fan of CIV. The gameplay and the setup are all very similar, while at the same time different enough to make it fun to play. Honestly, It feels like it picks up right from the point of a Science victory in Civ V (hence why I think it feels more like an expansion than a new game). The main gameplay is very familiar. Happiness, gold, culture, etc are all present (albeit in different methods), as well as trade routes, city states, etc etc. Unit upgrades are more in-depth, there seems to be more to explore on the planets, diplomacy has an interesting twist, and the whole alien methology makes you think twice about eliminating them like the barbarians in the 'old' games. So while it initially looks like a re-skinned CIV V, there's enough done to the game to keep it interesting and different, and for me it kept that 'just one more turn' hook that Civ games should have. I haven't had the chance to play it for endless hours on end quite yet, but I've spent more than enough hours on CIV V. So if you like CIV V you should enjoy yourself immensly with Beyond Earth. Although I should add, I've only ever played it with the expansion packs, and the game without the expansion seems less than adequate based upon what I've read.   In the end, I could find myself treating this like the expansion pack I feel it is and opening it up once my 'Earthly' CIV V civilization reaches the end of the tech tree. If you can sacrifice your wallet, Beyond Earth seems to provide a pretty good CIV experience with a twist as long as you know what your money is getting you. In the end, I would recommend it.",

It certainly has some interesting elements, I can grant it that. The backstory/lore is fascinating, aliens aren't always hostile (unlike Civ barbs), and the Affinites can add some intersting gameplay mechanics. There is; however, a rather bizarre design choice of making affinites dependant on certain resources. If you don't have access to certain resources, you, basically, are just forced to miss out on unique buildings/units. I understand the intent behind this idea, but having your starting location/initial resources essentially dictate the playstyle isn't a good thing in my opinion.  The tech tree also suffers from a very poor UI design that can make it confusing for new players to navigate and plan out tech paths. Wonders are very lackluster and very few of them are actually worth the resources to build. Upgrading troops via affinity level could have been interesting if there was a wider variety of choices and/or more visual differences outside of changing colors. The in-game decisions made based off of what you build are possibly the biggest missed opportunity. Each choice made should, in my opinion, have had a positive and negative effect tied to it. Then the choices would actually have weight to them instead of just deciding on which positive outcome you want. The lack of any religious or in-depth diplomacy mechanics also threw me off since the Civ 5 expansions basically made those features such a huge focus. Guess we have to wait for DLC?  If all you want is vanilla Civ 5 in space, then Beyond Earth is exactly that so pick it up. Otherwise, it'd be best to wait a few months for more mods to be created or just wait until the first expansion.",

It seems to have carried into the rest of the game also. I believe the heart of the matter is the overall 'blackness' of the interfaces, unexplored world, and of course the Wonders themselves.  Second, while the Affinity, Upgrade Systems, and the 'Tech Cloud' are brillant in and of themselves, they lack a sense of cohesion that leads to a unity of purpose. Sure there are victory goals, but after playing the game awhile, it didn't really seem to matter what I did with any of these items to achieve either a victory or have a blast dominating a new world.  Lastly, the story line is weak. While this is strictly speaking not important to any of the Civilization games, the opening video built the expectation that there was this connection to Earth and you were going forth to a 'Brave New World' (no pun intended). Once in the game however this connection was mysteriously lost and just as msyteriously you could either regain it, deal with transgenic humans from other colonies, or get to know some off-planet aliens.   I think there is a great game in there somewhere, but it has lost it's attraction for me and has become the digital version of 'shelf-ware'.",

The series have been improving over years, and each new instalment has brought new and better mechanics to the game. 'Beyond Earth' is no exception. The game follows several premisses that come from previous games, like 'cultural borders', 'trade routes', colonization and exploration, approach as a conqueror or as a diplomat, etc, etc. However, it falls short of several key aspects, specially those directly related with the theme (sci-fi and new earth) of the game. 1st aspect: Alien life. You only have two options, either kill every alien of sight or ignore and (hope to) be ignored. There's no taming technology. The only way you can have 'alien' units fighting for you is if you follow the 'Harmony Path'. Why can't a player going for 'Supremacy' choose to 'enslave' all the aliens and use them for work? 2nd aspect: Orbital layer. This adds a new flavour to the game by giving the opportunity to launch satellites in to the planet orbit and receive bonus, however, they are completely redundant. 3rd aspect: Affinities. This is the biggest addition to game mechanics. You can choose one of three paths to 'win' and 'customize' your civilization. This however falls incredibly short. While the skins applied to the cities and units are nice, there's no specific benefit or penalty for choosing a specific path. The only consequence I've notice so far is that by going to much in one direction will cause other Civilizations to be more friendly or distrustful because of it. 4th aspect: Unit upgrades. The only way to get units upgrades is by levelling up you affinity, and the worst part is that you can't choose the unit you're upgrading, the game chooses it for you.  Overall, the game is great I definitely recommend it to any Civilization fan or new comer, although newcomers are likely to better served with Civilization V.",

Lots of needless mouse clicks and repetive use of the menus. Many tasks that you have to do over and over should be done with out moving the mouse from the top of the screen, then back to the bottom. Then to the middle. You are injuring people when you make them do this.  A well thought out game should not have menus that are inconsistant, for example, you cannot end your turn with out completing all the tasks except the spy menu. You can end your turn over and over and still forget to do the tasks in this menu. Also the same buttons should do the same commands in all of the menus, but these are not so.  I understand that the creators put a lot of thought into how the game looks. But think of the tech tree. I can see the techs in one level of focus. What do I do in the other levels? Any real reason to have them there? Think about it.  I would also caution you that if you suffer from any repetitve motion issues that this game is not for you. The poor design will make you suffer if you play the game for long.   Things like putting very small but important information at the top of the screen show lack of insite by the creators of how we use our computers. Anyone out there wear bifocals? Can you imagine looking thru the top of your glasses for the small print? Makes no sense.  Lastly, do I really need to wait 45 seconds for steam to search the world over to see if I have played the game on another computer? You mean I can never click the menu box and say dont bother wasting my 45 seconds every other time I load the game?  Do I really have to say every time that I load the game I understand that online play is not suited for all players? Really, can not you make a disclaimer that says I understand this and have it done with?  I think that the writers of this game are very inexperienced in what we have learned over the years about ergenomics and the ability to do tasks with out needless movements. Like leaving the keyboard to move the mouse over and over and over again.   So even though at the moment I am going on playing for a while longer, I dont recommend this game.",

I have played them all, even CTP, so it's especially hard for me.  When Civ 5 came out I didn't really like it that much because not only was everything frustratingly different, but it also could have used a little more polish on the gameplay. It finally came around though (except for multiplayer) after a year or two of patches and expansions. With Beyond Earth, I don't think that is the case. So far it looks like everything is polished a much as to be expected for a new release, and the game mechanics that I have wrapped my head around so far are very appealing. I also like what was borrowed from Alpha Centauri, which is my favorite Civ of all time.   It's becoming more an more fun as I retrain my brain, so I can see the potential for it to be great. Frustrations and all, I think it's worth paying full price.  ",

            "review_text": "What everyone else has said is true, both the good and the bad. Wait for a sale, the fix-it patch, or the DLC that makes it unique, but if you must have it now, go ahead.   I found my first play through to be ho-hum, which is not at all what you want your first look at a new Civ to be like. But with 500 hours in Civ 5, nothing surprised--at first.   20 hours in a got an appreciation of the complex tech web and began to ferret out useful options. Unlike every other Civ game, here you can get a little of this and a little of that, providing much more of an RPG experience than ever before.   Unlike every Civ before it, you can play right to the end and not be bored silly, even if you won the game 100 turns back.   Pursuing an affinity and upgrading your units is actually fun and so, so much better than the old tech tree with its endless proliferation of miniscule unit upgrades.   End game terraforming and city building keeps you interested as you continue to build your empire.   And yes, you can continue to build your empire. Unlike Civ 5 where 3 to 5 cities was really optimal, you can build on happily here. Unlike the city unrest/happiness of previous versions, health can be successfully managed so that you can still explore and expand well into the end game, something that makes the last 150 turns so much less boring than in the past. To me, this is a big plus.   The resources available are interesting and give interesting perks as you learn new techs. There's nothing static here. Resources are used to build your units and some city buildings. Placement of cities is still key to victory.   No play through is ever going to be exactly like the previous one or even close.   Trade is fun, useful and varied.   So, what's not to like? Plenty, unfortunately.   As others have pointed out, some of the design is just lazy. Here are my top peeves:   1. No alert as to what you just built. What, you forgot how to keep notes? 2. Diplomacy broken (the AI went to war with me at turn 50 and refused to make peace the rest of the game or even discuss it.) Requests are absurd in terms of resources and energy.  3. Bad color choices. Aliens and 3 of Civs have a slightly different shade of green. It is almost impossible to tell them apart. With the entire color palette to work from, this is inexcusable. Overall, I found the game to be dreary to look at, even built up there was nothing eye catching about my cities, no uniqueness or visual interest. 4. No customization of your Civ. You can't rename your Civ or your leader. Leaders are meaningless here.  5. Civs are meaningless. Yes, I'm sure the devs put a lot of time into figuring out what they should be called, but they have absolutely no emotional resonance. Who cares? You choose your civ for the perks, and once you realize what the best one is, you're pretty much done with the civ thing.  6. City names, the same lack of meaning or resonance. The good part is you can rename your cities.  7. There's nothing wonderful about wonders. Yes, they have building projects called wonders, but it is unclear if they really have a tremendous impact on outcome. There is no must-have wonder for a particular victory and no clear indication which are great one-only wonders and which are civ wonders that can be build once by every civ.  8. I was underwhelmed by the orbital frufru. So much so I didn't ever bother with it after my first game. It's impossible to tell what benefit you're deriving from an orbital. And I found ignoring them had no impact on the outcome. The use and placement of them is poorly explained in the Civpedia.  9. And speaking of the Civpedia, what a waste of a space. The most utterly generic blather imaginable. If you don't know how to play, this pile of uninformation is not going to help you.  10. Silly made-up quotes. Sorry, but again, who cares? I turned off the voices and ignored the quotes first thing. No great voice acting and no beautiful reminders of actual great people.   No wonder movies (boo, again) just a grey scale screen when you've build one. Another dreary visual. And yet another dreary visual when you achieve victory. These are missed chances. We deserve an exciting mini-movie when we succeed, but get nothing. Pfft.",

My only lead on it is that the others have played the previous CiV games, but in this case, I have not. So this is coming from someone straight out of the series!  And I really enjoy it so far!  Yes, the game gets really confusing for the first 20-30 minutes of playing. But after a while, you start to get what everything does and it just clicks in. I've been playing this for a good while now to give some opinion on it.   Pros:  +The game itself is VERY pretty. When I saw the opening cutscene for it, I just almost floored. If you hate this game, you can't diss that it's visually appealing. Throughout the game it manages to keep that way as well! +Detailed Actions. What I mean by this is that it gives you a full explanation of what you are doing. Not tutorial wise, but just how everything is set-up and how it will work. +Addicting. Yes, the game is very addicting. I can't seem to get off this thing! I don't know how the CiV series compares to this one, but I'll have you know that this will keep me in my chair for a couple of days if I'm getting deep into a game.  Cons: -Confusing. As I said before, the game will start to make sense after a while. But the tutorial itself isn't really a tutorial. All it does, is point out a few things you should know and just sets you off free to figure out what you are doing. This is a good thing in most games, but it is not for this one.  Opinionated: -+Very slow. This is a game that requires a lot of patience and stragety. If you are not into either one of these, then I suggest you're better off looking for another game.  Overall Review:  I was really surprised when I played CiV:BE. Most of the people that have played the previous installments would disagree when I say that this game is actually really enjoyable to play. If you've played the other CiV games, I might say to pass on it, even though you should give it a shot. But if you were like me, who hasn't played any of those games and is new to this genre in general, then you should give it a try. It might just surprise you and keep you in your seat! ",

However I was very disapointed.   I can't say that the game is bad, its just lacking heart. Civ games ground you in the world providing factions wonders and characters that are relatable. A game set in space, needs to go a step further and build a lore. Make us care. Alpha Centauri did this by providing a backstory (factions at war, living planet, alien guardians) and distinct peronalities for the factions (the religious zelots, the nature loving extremists, the corporation, the warriors) Even a decade later I remember these personalities. This leads games to have emergant stores.  Beyond Earth has no heart, and no lore. People go to space. Build there and fight. Game play is fine. Tech tree is fine. But I came, I build a civ. Built portals and conqured earth. The end. Uninstall. Why would I play again?  I really hope that Fraxis will get its ♥♥♥♥ together and release a second beyond earth, this time with lore. With heart. Heck keep the same mechanics (or incorporate the new ones from Civ 6?). Give us a game that is replayable.",

So after about a day of dealing with all that bs, still unable to play fullscreen, i decided to just play a windowed version of the game which was great for the first 5 minutes or so before i realized that the resolution was cutting off the bottom of the screen which prevented me from confirming trades and many other fuctions vital to the gameplay, i tried to change resolution but it only gives one option.. all that said I've had a terrible experience with the game and won't be purchasing anything else from sid meier in the future",

However each sponsor(Civ) does not recieve its own Units or buildings, instead of some poor bonus. Unless your that trade route sponsor, then the energy will flow.  Starting design is nice, but some are simply not worth taking. Endgame is nice allowing other factions to try a take a last second victory if it is close, but winning is mainly tech driven.  The AI isn't that great ive heard, I met no counters to my rush to win the game at the end of the game even though I beat the snot out of most factions and it said they was 'Guarded'. Setting your workers to AI controlled will let your units die in the miasma, build a massive road to some no-where station on the other side of the planet, causing them to be lost via Aliens, who are very passive and well behaved. They need to be far more aggressive for more longer. Annoying them very early game should result in loss or a very difficult time.When I did finally annoy them, they pretty much died 1 by 1 to a soldier.

There is no variation of different life forms, environment and challenges that are related to different planets. Beyond Earth should carry the title The Second Earth rather than going beyond a single fixed environment.

New tech web is different and that's all the good things I can say about it. You still get techs in roughly same order just instead of strait line you go in circles. What changed from civ5 is that by the end you don't have all tech unlocked (you can still unlock 70%-80%) but that is only because you either won already or stopped caring about tech. The worst thing imo was lack of desire to play 'one more turn' unless you count feeling 'couple more turns and I can finally be done with this'  IMO The problem is not that this is bad game just that civ5 did most things better or maybe it's just that it failed to be fresh and innovative enough not to feel like civ5 mod. I may give it one more chance if any major expansion comes out but as it is now I would rather either go back to civ5 or play Endless Legend.   Pros: * It's civilization in sci-fi setting * It looks great * New tech web... * Units are upgradable  Cons * Civ 5 is better and more complex * Tech web (you still end up grabbing same techs most of the time) * Different affinity units doesn't feel distinctive enough * Flavor texts (building wonder or inventing tech) * Bland and quickly becomes a chore.

It's innevitable to compare Beyond Earth with Alpha Centauri and CIV5, but Firaxis made it happen. My expectations for this game were quite too optimistic when i pre-purchased the game, but it proved to be totaly false.  Some new ideas, even tough are good in perception they are not detailed. I was excited about the new tech tree (or web) but as I found out it's quite short. On the other hand it gives you quite a few options to develop your expedition.   I always liked to expand rapidly at an early point in my CIV days, but this in not really an option since health points are quite difficult to obtain. Especialy if you pic a +growth modifier then this gets quite frustrating.  Building options is a scrolling nightmare at later stages of the game, but having many options makes your colonies output more specified.  I miss the epicness of wonders in CIV. I have completed a game without making a single wonder. A civ in CIV5 is doomed without some wonders, Especially later in game.  Diplomacy is an epic fail. Firaxis had so much time to improve this on someway. Since CIV5, Colonization, CIV5 BTS, CIV5 BNW, they should read what fans are crying out for.  UI is CIV5 cloned, but poorly designed. Too much black, grey in there. The map resources are quite confusing if you don't have the resource overlay/icons on.  Also the game setup really disapointed me. So little options to choose from.  I can understand that we should not compare this to CIV5 (after DLC and expansions) but some parts at least (like diplomacy) should make it up for us. At this point the game is not completed.  Generaly i think i should wait until first DLC and a lower price came out.",

This is taking into account the Rising Tide expansion pack.  On the face of it, this is essentially a re-imagined version of Civ V with a sci-fi veneer. It's not a reskin, there's a lot more to it than that. Most of this is positive - you have a really good selection of futuristic factions and starts to choose from, and even in the base game you have three very interesting 'affinities' to determine the future of humanity (broadly summed up as mutants, cyborgs or just the same way they are, just changing the world instead of themselves).  There's a lot of good I can sum up about this game that I'm sure you can read elsewhere, but the biggest negative is that this game seems to suffer from the same major issue of difficulty sweet spot that all Civ games do, but for some reason this title seems to suffer from it to a much greater degree than any other title in the series. You know the problem - every game is either trivially simple or brutally hard, and worse, in the case of the latter, the game effectively decides you've lost hours before it makes it clear. Deploy a victory condition and all the good stuff above about affinities and culture goes out the window, and the AI's unite in an absurd alliance that makes no sense to make sure you're out of the game. If this doesn't happen, the AIs are so hopeless that it's no challenge. Effectively, the game has no ability to tune it's gameplay - you're either fighting with brass knuckles or a blindfolded opponent.  I'm sure there's a few weirdoes in Firaxis that think wasting hours upon hours is fun but in the real world, no-one has the time to play a game that effectively flips the 'YOU LOSE' button on a random turn dozens of hours in. That just isn't fun, and until now hasn't even been Civilisation.  I can't recommend this game even to people who think it's right up there ally. ",

I really like the affinity system - you aren't locked out of other paths by choosing one ath as such, but it is more expensive to develop secondary affinities. So you can make co-existence with the indigenous life your core belief, while also holding on to the best aspects of Earth culture or having a side dish of Neuromancer.   My major criticism is that SMAC quotes had a lot more personality and great little videos that went with technologies and Secret Projects. How many of us know the words to the Gaian Acolyte's Prayer ? How cool was the Transcendence victory video ! I never wanted to skip those, I watched them time and time again.

            "review_text": "When I saw the announcement for this game, my little 4X heart skipped a beat. Alpha Centauri is one of my favorite games of all time, and this seemed for all intents and purposes to be its spiritual successor. I counted down the days and hours until I could get my hands on what was sure to be a masterwork by Firaxis, eager to get home from work and wake my computer. With breathless anticipation, I fired up the game to find that Firaxis had indeed combined Civilization 5 with Alpha Centauri.   A couple hours in, I realized that after mashing the two together, they had also proceeded to remove the good parts of both.  The basic gameplay mechanics from Civ5 are in play here, and they've been polished up. The Tech Web is very nice in concept- each tech has two sub-techs you can research or skip at your discretion, and you aren't limited to a linear progression- but it ends up falling flat due to a horrible UI. All the little symbols denoting what advantages/advances the tech infers are laid out in plain white and often illegible. One spends most of their time on the tech web hovering the mouse pointer over these little gems to figure out which tech to take next.  Trade routes make a return, and they are a very powerful tool. Unfortunately, they're also very spammy. They have to constantly be manually set every few turns. In the later game when you have a bunch of cities, each with two or more individual trade routes, you can find yourself having to scroll through a list of available routes to find your previous route (rather than having an auto-renew option or putting the previous route up at the top for easy selection) FOR EACH TRADE CARAVAN. I often found myself having to perform this same task 5 or more times each turn, and it eventually became far more nuissance than feature. It really slows an already slow game down to a crawl.  Quests were a nice addition, though they could still use some work. These usually tell little self-contained stories which add a nice flavor and allow for a bit of roleplaying, while others tie into the overall plot. These sometimes involve performing a task like creating a particular building, founding a new colony near a specific resource, performing a particular covert action in a particular city, etc. Rewards for these can be things like energy, free units, free tech, and points towards an affinity. Most often though, quests involve just making an arbitrary decision between two (and ONLY two) choices. The rewards for these vary greatly and will tend to add permanent affects to your game (such as making farms have +1 production for your faction). After a while, I stopped even reading what the text had to say about the supposed situation and just picked whichever choice gave me the benefit I would find most useful.   Unfortunately, the quest system doesn't do context very well. It will sometimes give quests which cannot be completed. For instance, I was tasked with building a bio-fuel plant in my capital city. The problem? That building requires having an improved water with algae bloom tile and the specific city the quest required it to be built at was a full 8 hexes from the nearest water- completely landlocked, making the quest impossible. For the record, it was my starting city, so I didn't have much choice on where to place it.  One of the neater things plays out in the beginning. There are a lot of options to customize your starting condition. You choose a faction (or 'sponsor', rather), choose what kind of colonists you want (laborers gives you a bonus to production, farmers to food, etc.) and a few extra little bits like cargo. The other factions do the same. Now, one would think that this should lead to vast dynamics and a different experience for each game. Sadly, this is the most glaring place where Beyond Earth falls flat on its face. None of these choices have any lasting impact. The seven factions have no individual identities- no strengths or weaknesses of any particular note or goals. There is literally nothing at the core of each which differentiates it from any others. The faction leaders themselves are little more than cardboard stand-ins, completely lacking any personality or ideologies whatsoever. Each one is as bland as the previous and all react to the events in the exact same way. In fact, there are only three ideologies to choose from: Purity, Supremacy, and Harmony. You gain levels in these ideologies through the techs you choose and quest decisions. You can have levels in several, not just one. Even then, these differing 'affinities' only affect diplomacy so much. In more than one playthrough my closest ally had a different affinity.  Your affinity levels also determine your unit upgrades (and some units are specific solely to a faction advancing a particular affinity). When your affinity level goes up, you often get the ability to upgrade a unit to a new type, which makes the unit stronger and gives you a choice between two permanent enhancements. Unlike Civ 5, all of your units of that type magically upgrade to the new type with the new enhancement. No picking and choosing individual unit upgrades here or even having to go to a friendly territory and paying to upgrade. Nope, that ship floating in the middle of the ocean really did spontaneously grow an extra 30 tons of metal, armor, and bigger guns.  Diplomacy and espionage have taken a drastic step back from Civ 5. It's taken a step back from Civ 3, even. Both are terribly rudimentary, and the former has taken a particular hit from the faction leaders' lack of personality, ambition, and goals.  The five different victory conditions are interesting, though two of them make little practical sense. In the supremacy victory, the faction achieves victory by... leaving? In going for a military victory, you win by capturing every faction's starting capital. This option is locked out to you if you ever lose your capital- even if you take it back. In theory, you could conquer every city on the map and not achieve a military victory just because you lost your capital for a single turn. It was dumb in Civ 5, and it's dumb here.  Winning a game feels hollow and pointless as it gives you a small picture in a grey box, and a voice-acted quote before dumping you back to the main menu. When you lose, it doesn't even tell you who won or how. The whole endgame is unsatisfying on a level worse than Mass Effect 3. One could argue that it's the journey which counts, and sometimes it is, but in this case, I would state that one making such an argument probably ingested far too many paint chips at a young age.  The bottom line here is this: Beyond Earth lacks a personality, an identity, and a soul. As much as it pains me as a huge fan of the franchise to say so, I can't recommend this game in its current state.",

            "review_text": "This is my first review here, if you can call it such.   Despite the negative reviews comparing this to Civ V or SMAC, this game taken as a stand alone game is good but not great.  First the good;  The sounds create a great atmosphere and the music is equally good.  I love the idea of aliens roaming around your borders threatening to attack at random. They add another dimension to the game, something that barbarians never did.  The web is a little confusing at first and will take several games to really discover the good strategies. This gives extra reply value in my opinion and is a step up from the left-to-right tech-tree implemented in previous Civ games.  I am loving the additional complexity in espionage, it is much improved over Civ V, the amount of energy you can siphon off of the AI is insane, I managed a whopping 16000 during my marathon game.  The affinity system is a great addition, and to see the leaders appearance change due to their chosen affinity is a nice touch.  Quests are another great addition - although I am wary of how long they will remain appealing. If Firaxis keep adding news ones in with small patches that'd keep them interesting for longer.  The game no longer feels like a rush to get to point C via point A &amp; B. This is a combination of wonders being spread out over different pathways and also - in certain cases - requiring a certain level in an affinity. The AI is less Hitler and more hippy in BE. This is good for someone like me who prefers not to keep spamming troops every game for the inevitable impending attack, and prefers to concentrate on building a Civilization.   The Meh  Leaders are uninspiring and mostly forgettable. Half way through my first game (Marathon) I occasionally found myself clicking on a AI city just to see who the leader of it was.  Aliens, I said early they add an extra dimension to the game, and they do, however, they don't seem to mind me wiping their friends out. The great beasts of the world, the Krakens and the Siege Worms, are well... not that great. Sure if they enter your land a wreck stuff they can cause you problems, but they didn't do that to me, and I could be wrong here, but putting up an ultra sonic fence stops that from happening anyway. Also you unlock a quest question that allows your trade routes to be immune from aliens attacks, same with your explorers. Moreover, when attacking a Kraken or Siege Worm, all they do is go back and forth between two tiles, they made no effort to enter my territory and kill me. So for the very early game they are great, they add a sense of worry to the game, however, shortly after that they are just there, taking up space, being annoying and posing no threat. In summary the aliens are like mosquitos - annoying, but in very rare cases deadly.   Graphics - whilst good they are not great. I don't think the graphics have improved over Civ V but I think they are good enough for a turn-based strategy game. My first game was overly dark and it did take a while for me to adjust to the stylized graphics. Nothing much else to say about them really.  I enjoy the upgrading of units through the affinity system, however, there isn't that much to pick from and the upgrades are uninspiring and feel as if little-to-no thought went into them. 10% defense or 20% attack, that sort of choice.  The Bad  The game is riddled with bugs - I am constantly finding my scouts - who I have automated to explore -stopped for numerous turns or just going between the same two tiles over and over. Many bugs will get ironed out over time, I know that, but there are bugs in this game that were present in Civ V and that is inexcusable.  Trade Units - the game is way too dependent on them -spam them and your fine, until they return then you realise your mistake of spamming them because every turn your redirecting two or three trade convoys to the same place they have been going to since turn X. What I would like to see is a reduction in trade units - 1 or 2 maximum per city - with a decrease in profitable returns but an increase in trade time.   Health - same mechanic as happiness from Civ V - build more than one city and it goes negative - but don't worry it is only a 10% hit to science &amp; culture- at one point I was at -15 health and it still said only minus 10% so something needs to be done here. It feels as if they forgot about happiness - sorry I mean health - until a few days before release, then tacked it on at the last minute.   Victories - Contact especially - way too easy unless you play on a difficulty where the AI gets all the bonuses at the start.  The AI - It seems to me like this has been lifted straight out of Civ V and it wasn't good in that game either. I haven't been attacked as of yet by the other Civs, and have only had a scout, ranger and gunboat killed by aliens so I cannot make a fair evaluation of the combat AI.  As I said earlier the AI is less aggressive, which for me is good me, however, it has a flip side in that the AI is so hippy-like you can pretty much ignore them for the entire game. If like me you played a marathon game on a huge map, 70% of the map will remain empty as there are only 8 Civs in the game.   The game feels as if they have purposely taken out content only to sell it at a later date, but then that was the same story with Civ V and IV. I guess this is how developers make money these days. There is no religion, culture victory has been removed and is only used now to added small bonuses to your civ. Units are lacking in variety.  Tile Improvements - I'm all for more tile improvement options, but in BE there's a lot, really a lot..., and it isn't clear off the bat what some are for. There's no clear indication to what purpose some of them serve. You find yourself wondering if you are not better off replacing them with other improvements such as terraforming. It all just seems a little too messy and confusing at the moment and this is coming from a player who's clocked 100's of hours on Civ V. So I'd imagine a new player to the series would be even more flummoxed than me.   The UI - It is bad - Civ V had a great UI, but in this game it seems they took the best bits out and replaced them with overly confusing bits. Buttons keep popping up in different places, some are very hard to identify and find and others just look like text. It's pretty weak considering Civ V had such an intuitive UI. The map is so small it might as well not even be there. On my darkened play through I could hardly see the map, and playing on a 55' screen 8 feet away makes it even worse.  Summary - I can appreciate the fact that this is a new release and there will be bugs, but as a lot of these bugs were present in Civ V there's no excuse. I can also appreciate that it is a new game and will have expansions, however, I feel that it will follow the same path as Civ V, remove a lot of functions from previous game, then add later as an expansion instead of releasing a proper expansion.  I will jump on the band wagon of 'this is a modded Civ'. As a standalone game it doesn't justify the price tag and if it was added as an expansion to Civ V, Civ V would have instantly become my favourite game of all time, well maybe 2nd favourite behind the original X-COM.  As it is, I feel left with a game that whilst taken out of context is a good game, put it with its brothers and it's too much of the same to be a full retail priced game. I would recomened it to newcomers to the Civ franchise, even to those who had little play time of Civ V or IV. I wouldn't recommend it to those who played Civ V to death and are looking for something different or greatly improved upon from Civ V  I will continue to play and enjoy this game, I find it fun and can ignore most of its shortcomings. But whilst playing I will be wishing it had been made into the expansion of Civ V.  7.5",

First, talking over it with some friends of mine, they mentioned that they didn't like Civ5 as much as Civ:BE simply because they couldn't connect to Civ5 as much (see Ghandi nuking everyone).   Second, one negative review caught my eye... something about 'not being able to build a sprawling empire' until you have researched more technology and other things later on. Going with the tradition of sci-fi thought, among other things, it doesn't make sense if you could make a sprawling at the start on a completely alien planet with rather hostile wildlife or other dangers. Also, something about 'this alien planet looks like earth, wtf.' Well... sorry to burst most people's bubbles... but if humans are going to try and settle a planet, we'd probably look for something close or similar to home. I mean, I don't know about anyone else here, but I'd rather not live on a planet where the oceans are liquid methane...  Hell, forget the first guy and his want for sprawling empires. You wouldn't even get an outpost going on a planet such as that!  Are there flaws with the game? Yes. I'm not going to sugar coat it and say it's perfect (because it's not). But you know what? When Civ5 first came out... it was pretty silly too and it eventually got much better with GnK and BNW.   At the end of the day, you like what you like and you hate what you hate.   I like this and I see future potential.",

I think that this game is not the biggest leap that Firaxis could have took with the Civilization franchise, but it is definatly not the worst.   Reasons why this is not a bad game:  1. Aliens. They give a bit of charm where civ. 5 was lacking. They are not as frustrating as barbarians, and you can choose whether you want to pick a fight with them or not.   2. More customization. Not only can you choose your civ, but you get some unique starting bonuses as well that can be really useful,, not exactly game changing, but a nice detail.  3. Affinity. You can argue with the fact that its fun to send specialized units out onto the battlefeild, to build cities that look alien or technologically advanced. I definately like this addition and I think that playing with people with different advantages and weaknesses than me is more fun than not.  4. The orbital layer. This I enjoy because it give a little more depth to the battlefeild. Not a huge feature, but definately a good addition.  5. The tech web. In civ 5 there was only really one direction, and technology only made you differ from the other civs if they had eclipsed you is reaserch or researched one tech that allowed them to build some wonder before you. With the tech web, you can have a completely different buch of bonuses and unlocks than somone else even if you have the same amount of research.  Of course there are some things that Firaxis needs to improve on/spice up a bit  1. Civs should only be able to have one affinity or gaining pionts in one should remove poins in others. I think this would make the game more realistic and overall would just make more sense. All of the Affinities conflict with one another, so it does not make sense to get units and cities that conflict with them selves.  2. All but one of the victory types (domination) are very similar. You build some thing on the map and than you wait. Pretty boring.  3. The AIs dont go far enough into affinity. Pretty self explanatory.  4. Not nearly enough civs. There are 9 different civs. In a standard game there are 8 civs. I mean, c'mon Firaxis. Maybe people should wait until the first DLC to purchase, so that they get a discount.  But, overall I think the pros outweigh the cons, and most if not all the kinks will get ironed out after a couple of DLCs.",

            "review_text": "This game offers a large number of changes from mainline Civilization games. I am honestly a fan of a lot of them - they offer new and unique takes on systems that Civ V already turned on their head. Some quick ones are:  - Unit types unlock from researching a specific tech, but upgrade instantly based on Affinity progress - which has a lot of consequences for when to build units and when to go to war.  - Different tech paths encourage different ways to use the land around you, offering the player a wide variety of different build strategies for their improvements and ways to use resources.  - Strategic resources are used not just for units, but also for powerful buildings, giving the player a tradeoff choice between great army and great infrastructure.  - New Covert Ops is a fun alternative to Spying, even though it mostly devolves into a Science/Energy boost because the AI is rarely foolish enough to let you flip their cities.  - The tech web supports actually different branching paths of technological development, rather than just prioritizing Iron Working over Pottery for now.  But after playing through a few games, one thing has stuck out for me.   Civilization: Beyond Earth offers five paths to victory - Domination, Contact, and 3 Affinity-aligned paths to victory. Domination aside, the other four victories revolve around building a special wonder that occupies its own tile and then fulfilling some goal related to it completing its progress - essentially they are non-violent victory conditions.  Civilization V, on the other hand, offers four paths to victory: Domination, Diplomacy, Cultural, Space Flight. The Cultural victory evolved in Brave New World to be less solo-oriented and more versus-oriented. Therefore, there are three non-violent paths to victory, compared to Beyond Earth's four. So that seems like a win for Beyond Earth on the 'non-violent' front, right?  Well, not quite - because in Beyond Earth the *only* way to deal with someone else potentially winning the game ... is to go to war with them and destroy their creation. You can't out-pay their allies in order to prevent a Diplomatic victory. You can't boost your culture to incredible height or collect lots of artifacts before they can to prevent their Tourism from overtaking your Culture. The tech web doesn't have enough layers that you can really get ahead in tech to start your wonder before they do. So if they build one of the four game-winning wonders, your only response is war (unless your clock is already ticking, in which case good for you - go up a difficulty level).  So I'm torn a bit on the end game scenarios. But overall this game is solidly enjoyable. It may not have the staying power that Civ V picked up in its expansions, but I must say that I hope to see Beyond Earth continue to get the after-launch care that the mainline Civ game got. In the mean time, keep playing one more turn.",

The start of the game is a really nice inclusion, being able to select your own factions, people and equipment before you leave and that really lets you decide how the game will play from the beginning.   There are a few annoying parts to the game. Like the aliens; they've replaced the barbarians and they won't automatically attack you. However if you do something to ♥♥♥♥ them off or you get too close, or cause they changed their mind, they will go you. Really annoying after they haven't attacked you in the 10 rounds previous. The other thing that's annoying at the moment is measma. If you stand in it, it ticks health off you and if aliens stand in it, it heals them. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get rid of and when you do, everyone else chucks a fit.   If you're a bit civ fan and you're looking for a different twist on the game, then by all means get this when it goes on sale. The current price is a bit much for a bunch of new textures and resources with a different name. If you're unsure, get civ v first, it will give you a good clue as to what the game is like.

This is not a strategy game; it is an extraordinary exercise in nihilism. Throughout the game you will find there is little purpose in your existence beyond its own perpetuation. In this regard, Civilization: Beyond Earth offers an exquisite simulated experience.  If, however, you're looking for a game that offers (among other things):  - challenges and competition - meaingful interaction with human/AI players - interesting strategy options - engaging peacetime and wartime play - a compelling reason to continue playing the game  I encourage you to wait until Firaxis does one of the following: patches, expands or creates an entirely new iteration that offers the kind of engaging and dynamic gameplay currently exhibited by Civilization V: Brave New World. In the meantime--and barring any genuine interest in nihilistic game play--I encourage you to invest your time elsewhere as this game is still riding with its training wheels on.  Now that the general review is over, here are the details on the good, the bad and a (more) thoughtful examination of the game generally:  The good:  - Nice graphics - An interesting take on the traditional 'tech tree' - Affinity structure is a novel idea - Lots of small options that impact long term outcomes - A very exciting concept (this is true, but I'm really reaching here)  The Bad:  - Game play does not encourage much interaction among players - The AI is underdeveloped - Much of the terrain simply looks like Civ 5 in gamma mode - There really isn't much to do during peacetime - Military unit options are few, making tactics uninspired - Human players do not feel particularly challenged - Lacking in substantive competitive pressure - The affinity structure is somewhat obvious, flat, and limiting - Can feel overwhelmed with options that seem unnecessary  - Technology quotations are uninspiring (and techs feel very disjointed) - Wonders are underpowered, also lack the videos many players love from Civ  As I (and my wife) played the game together, we felt the game simply 'drifted' into the future without a clear purpose, driving force or compelling challenges. In this way it felt very bland and, sad as it is to say, boring. Upon reflection, the game seems as if it never made it out of alpha testing. It has great potential to be an incredibly engaging game but misses the mark in its current form by a wide margin.   As an additional note--more to Firaxis than to fans or potential buyers--Firaxis needs to make sure its games are ready for prime time before the initial release. Civilizition 5 only truly came of age via its latest expansion (and quite a bit of money), Brave New World--much to the consternation of fans new and old. Beyond Earth is already off to a much rockier start. With this and other above comments in mind, I don't recommend people purchase this game until Firaxis makes BE a truly compelling game, both generally and as a successor to Alpha Centauri. ",

I lamented this fact vigorously. So vigorously that I was banned from the SMCBE forums for a short time.  Recognizing that the shallow, boring, and uninspired nature of the game had adversely effected my ability to express myself I took a lengthy break from the game and elected to forgo anymore play throughs- this after 40 something hours.  Recently I came back to it, after substantial updates were made to stability and gameplay in the hopes that it would be a better experience. I am happy to say that my hopes were met.  Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is the perfect 4x game...  If you're 10 years old and have never played a decent 4x game before. Minecraft has a better game balance, a more realistic economy, and more interesting mobs and NPCs to interact with.  Avoid SMCBE. It's not a horrible game... it's just not a good, engaging one.

Not enough leaders (and no significant variety in them), the tech web is a good idea, but there are a few techs you ALWAYS research first (hypersonic fences anyone?), the units feel VERY similar until you hit the absolute endgame (200+ turns in) - and that's only from your particular ideology, not from any civilization direction.  It's a game that is starting out on a sound foundation - the similarities to Civ 5 are a good thing, not a bad one. The challenge is that in amongst all of the new worker tile improvements (most of which you never want anyway), the different ideology unique units (which all take some amount of a special resource), and a sprawling tech web that is well executed - it feels like the real variety that is the heart and soul of Civ, the other civs themselves, are brushed away in favor of a pile of weak choices and false variety.  Is the game good? Yes. Will this game keep you for significantly more than 100 hours as it is? Probably not. I look forward to expansions and multiplayer bug fixes!",

Downvote is primarily because this game doesn't differ very much from Civ5. The basic city stats, unit types/abilities, (most) victory conditions, diplomacy and resources have been renamed and re-skinned but are the same as Civ5. This could have been an expansion instead of a new title. The features unique to this game aren't plentiful enough to warrant paying the full price for a brand new game. Also, I was surprised by the lack of any type of single player campaign. You just pick the game parameters and start playing; there are no nation specific quest lines or any type of storyline whatsoever. I imagine that once game plus all the DLCs are on sale as a discounted bundle it will be worth the price, but right now it isn't.  I do like the sci-fi theme, re-branded tech trees and slightly different unit upgrade progressions, but again this could have been accomplished with an expansion pack or game mod. The game has a lot of potential depending on how the DLCs play out. I will continue to play the game as I enjoyed Civ5 and this is just a sci-fi version of it at the moment. But, having played it for about 20 hours I regret not waiting for the DLCs and a discounted price.",

Research is free and therefore more chaotic. Some choices are better than the other and the type of victory you aim to achieve will influence the order of techs you will want to acquire.  You will end up with different affinities anyway, but you'll want to focus on one to secure victory and follow up on quests, that give cinsiderable rewards. You also use said points to upgrade units. So we still don't have a unit creator from Alpha Centauri, but at least we have something.  What was good in Civilization V is good here. Skipping highlists of great Civ V gameplay, It is worth noting, that aliens are everywhere and are a challange up to a mid-tech game, which is a welcome change (barbarians were more annoying than anything in Civ V). The SciFi feel is great and all affinities are satisfying, with victory goals less generic and more fun to achieve. Spies revamp is nice. They are more of a resuorce, that can be incresed mainly through quests, and used to procure energy or tech points (or even whole techs) fron enemies. Later on, you can use them to fire off special actions based on your affinity (combat-oriented mostly, Dirty Bomb that kills people, calling the big Worm alien or destroying improvements around the city).  The bad things from Civ V stayed. Not many of those, but mainly: Weak AI. I spent 11 hour standard game with 6 AIs. Early game they were gimped from arriving later than the player, later on they managed to stay alive and slowly progress, but only at end-game they had more innitiative to actually be seen on the map. They play defensively, not as eager to attack as in Civ V, diplomatic interaction were... Like usually, egoistic on their part. Almost all (if not all) actually didn't like me killing the aliens. I defeated one of the AI that settled too close to me without a loss of a single unit.  Besides that, I can't think of anything bad about the game. It would be cool for more content to arrive soon.  To sum it up, this will be a great game for all Civ V fans and even better than the original for those that enjoyed Alpha Centauri.  I highly approve, to me it's 9+/10 for sure.",

Espionage is much better than before, having been completely reworked into a system where agents cannot access missions above the total 'action limit' in the city, which increases as successful missions occur, decreasing when your enemy places an agent in the same city. Another positive change is the way higher-tier units are accessed-through the non-essential 'leaves' which grant 'affinity' points in the tech web. You could achieve some goals without ever leveling your unit types. Annoyingly, however, the good promotions of the past are ditched in favor of a flat 10% bonus every time the unit levels--the good promotions are now embodied by a choice which affects all units of that type on level up. One thing that was greatly improved, however was the continuing significance of ranged units (which no one built past crossbows unless they had the 'improved range' perk). This is critical in BE because there are fewer unit types and only three factions--you need all the unit diversification you can get. EDIT: There are also unique affinity units which are unlocked at higher affinities (7+) though they are pretty much all land units.  Other changes include the nice visual style (even the harshest critics acknowledge it looks different) and the ability to totally ignore techs in the web--I think it would be difficult to finish with every tech like one could before.  There are some serious issues, however. The AI still regularly demands trade deals (even when they have poor relations and will reject the deal they suggested) and offers only 'favors' (although I guess offering anything in return is a new feature). Furthermore, the 'warmonger' feature is broken--I destroyed one outpost (not a city) and for the rest of the game I was a warmonger to every other player, leading to several 100+ turn cold wars. Speaking of annoying enemy factions, Franco-Iberia seems a bit broken, as they tend to interrupt every turn with a hate message. Wonders are accessed through tech, so it isn't clear why this should be, but it is.  Further weaknesses include the further diminished air and navy (if I see these in an expansion I am going to be extremely mad--this better have been an accidental oversight and not a money-maker); and the unbalanced virtues (only might and growth get points when I play, health is poorly addressed by other trees).  Basically, there are good and bad things about the game. I like it overall and I will keep playing it (hence the positive score), but Firaxis needs to patch up some holes (including missing/absurdly long unit animations and unit image superposition in the 'specialize unit view' window) if they want more than just fans to like the game (7/10).",

Civ 5 mad many years for modders and various other patches and expansions to come out and fix things up and rebalance things. This is the first installment and with that you always have to try and come into it with a fresh mind and not compare this game to Civ 5.   Overall the game is solid, I've found very few gamebreaking issues with it, i think my major qualm with the game is that the Spying aspect is VERY passive and is the only way for you to bomb a city (and you have to follow a certain path to get there.)   Lore wise I really enjoy the Beyond earth setting. They've clearly done a lot of looking into future tech / sci fi concepts and applied them. Genetic modification, holograms, intergreation of technology into biology. Etc Very Ray Kerzwiel.   Overall, I enjoy my time playing this game and it is worth it if you get it for sale. 40.00 was a little steep but that is what i pay for my impatience.",

But overall I have been underwhelmed by the gameplay. I agree that this just seems a like a hastily assembled mod for Civ V.   What I like is the theme and the environment. The game is very vibrant and colorful, the worlds do feel alien.   One of my biggest issues with the game is the technology tree. It is radial instead of linear which is fine in theory, but I find it exceedingly difficult to find the techs I want. It would work well if there were more numerous and better incentives to specialize your tech tree, but just as with Civ you ultimately end up needing to research everything anyway.  Too few civs as well, I expected the same level of diversity as with Civ V but that is not the case. Also I find there is no point in trying to help colonies as they always die or fail by the time you get to them. Even if you manage to help them once, alien worms or bugs always kill them eventually.   Also I find espionage to be a complete waste of time, I have never been able to convert a city to my Civ, even giving myself every advantage possible. I honestly do not think it even works, even though others have reported being able to convert cities. The whole point of inversting in Espionage is to convert enemy cities, but if I can't even do that why waste the turns researching and building spy buildings when I can invest in other strategies.   Diplomacy options are underwhelming, many aspects of the game feel like a step back for the franchise. I expected many of the new concepts in Civ V to be expanded upon with this, but the opposite is true.   No unique units or buildings for Civs, they all feel more or less the same as a result.   Ill wait a couple of years until all the DLC go on sale and give it another try. I have no interest in buying DLC for a game that is designed to fix all the issues the game has. That kind of DLC should be free. Releasing a mediocre at best product and then expecting us to pay to have it fixed is wrong. Especially when there is no guarantee it will solve any of the problems this game has.   I am still kicking myself for paying full price for every Civ V expansion and DLC, when my friend picked up the whole complete edition for $17.",

It might not be fair to compare it to Civ V with all its expansions but it's the one that will inevitably be made and, unfortunately, BE doesn't hold up. All the depth and multiple layers of strategy present in Civ V were greatly diminished here, with the only reall addition in terms of strategic depth being the affinity system, which I personally didn't enjoy since pursuing a certain affinity ties you to a very defined end goal when compared to Civ V's much freer victory types and Ideology system.   A major bugbear for me was the horrifying slog of the early game. The game, even on lower difficulties, throws an obnoxious amount of aliens at you and, although they rarely attack, it's quite discouraging to have your vital early units murdered in one hit by a siege worm. Additonally the mechanic of miasma, a toxic alien goo that initially damages your units, only serves to increase the grindy nature of the early game as you mechanically clear miasma before building an improvement on that tile. It just unnecessarily lengthens the early part of the game and makes for a somewhat dull experience.  I did have some positive thoughts about BE, however. The game runs fantastically on my machine, even better than Civ V (which occasionally dipped just below 60 with large amounts of units onscreen and when loading in the map). It maintains a rock solid framerate at all times and the game has all the options one would expect from a top-notch PC game. I also loved the general aesthetic of the game, the sleek, white human units and settlements only serving to enhance the alien nature of this initially hostile planet with its colourful, vibrant terrain. I also enjoyed the overall theme of human endeavour and scientific progress overcoming vast hardship. Like other Civ games, it's a somewhat celebratory experience that makes you feel good about humanity (until you decide to send in the military units, of course).  Would I recommend this game, based on my admittedly short play time? No. It's a solid foundation for a good game, but not a good game in itself. Just like with previous entries in the series, I suspect this game will be an absolute corker once it receives some expansion content but, until then, I'd leave it alone and spend your money on the vastly superior Civ V with its two main expansions.",

There are positive sides - intelligence system is a bit more interesting then in Civ5 (resembles Civ4 spies actually), the tech web sort of allows different approach (except it mostly means you get all your +1 energy/+1 health/+1 production buildings from different technology and with different name). The quest system would be interesting if there were more then ten quests (not counting 'quests' allowing two mutually exclusive bonuses added to every building in the game).  The are bad sides too and there's a lot of them. It has taken the worst from SMAC (confusing UI, poor grafic presentation, uniformly colored land where you can't tell terrain without checking tooltip, spiritless units) and left out a lot that was fun about it (story, diversity of approach, unit workshop, terraforming).  The result plays as a Civ5 mod (which I expected) stripped down to basic game and even so with a number of features missing (seriously various victory conditions, luxury resources - which in turn leads to diplomacy being utterly meaningless, great people, everything added in datadiscs).  I've kept playing it for a while - to try out different affinities, which turned out to give you differently colored units with different small bonus, built for different resource, but ultimately exactly the same. To try different victories - which means researching different technology, building differently named building and waiting. And waiting. And...  I'm sad to say that it's a dissapointment of the year for me.",

Now there is a tile resource icon that you can turn on for each title but this crowds the map and is not very appealing to stare at. They game also ends abruptly without telling you which civilization won if you lost. There are also no graphs or ranking like what they had in Civ V so you have no idea how you are doing compared to other civs, however they do have the scoring system but you cannot tell who has the most troops, who is making the most per turn, who has the most land, ect. Even the battles and army management is boring. You build things that look cool and have no idea whether they will actually work well against an enemy or not. In Civ V you kinda have a sense that archers do well except in melee, melee troops have more health and tank a bit more, ect, but since everything is so high tech and alien you have no idea what your building. Once I had built several ranged units and none of them seemed to do much damage, however everything seems to work well against cities making them easier to take.

The vanilla version (no doubt there will be loads of DLC and some expansions in the near future) is very streamlined and organized, while still managing to offer many different approaches towards achieving your ultimate goal during a scenario. For somebody, who haven't ever played any Civ game, it might seem confusing at first, but that will pass, trust me; for a veteran, you will hop in straight into a game, being instantly familiar with many features, yet still you do not feel it is just a Civ V rip-off. The wide spectrum of policies and quests allow you to tweak your civilization in more ways than ever before.  As great as the gameplay itself are the visuals. Civ V set the standards high, yet BE has them beaten. A variety of planetary landscape (earthlike or completely alien environment) is soon littered by your domes, biowells, generators etc., which all look futuristic and fit well with the visual theme. Your units and cities change looks based on your affinity, allowing you a little personal touch.  The soundtrack is breathtaking - the 'violin theme' gives me chills, reminding me a lot of the First Contact theme every time I hear it.  There are sone cons, however...  Diplomacy - is exactly the same nonsensical crap as in Civ V. Being on friendly terms with another civ does not mean squat, they attack you randomly, because reasons. Only way how to prepare for backstabbing a-hole AI is to keep a decent standing army of highest technological level possible. Luckily there is no United Nations in the New World and lets pray it will keep that way.  AI could have been smarter I guess. On the higher difficulties, the AI shamelessly cheats, but that is not the problem - the problem is that when attacking, the computer behaves like a moron, just bluntly rushing one of your cities with 4+ mobile units and when he fails, the remainder of his armies wanders aimlessly around where you kill the units one by one. When defending, the AI neglects defensive structures, which is fatal. Unlike in Civ V, the cities do not get upgraded in strength/hp when reaching a new technological era (since there no eras in BE, it would be affinity levels), so it is vital to build up both city strength and hitpoints to withstand a siege or a rush attack.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Summary: Beyond Earth delivers the highest quality among turn-based games. One has to wonder if the coming new content won't spoil such a masterpiece, like Brave New World did for Civ V - the strength of the game is in its simplicity (ok, simplicity is a poor word considering you have zillions of technologies to research, 80 policies to take and a customized choice of an upgrade for each building), while providing you with tons of fun, complex content.  Lets hope that further additions to the game will expand the already rich, beautiful new start for the Mankind.  10/10",

For me this game was a lot simpler than Civ 5 (with all the DLCs) as there really isn't too much to manage outside of buildings/units, affinity/research, orbital units, and covert-ops.  There are problems though, firstly, ony my monitor (144hz) there is still no fix (what are we, a month in?) to play it full screen at 1080p, I have to play windowed mode. WTF. It has crashed on me only once, but that was still infuriating enough, and in general it lacks the polish and detail of Civ 5.   My guess is that the patches/fixes as well as DLCs that give the game more content/meat are on the way, and my advice - wait for that content if you can. If you're into sci-fi and like 4X though then this is still a decent play. Oh, and be prepared to lose a lot of time...",

        {
            "review_text": "To start:  This game is INFERIOR to Civ V:BNW. This is undeniable. Much like Civ V: Vanilla, there is much potential but it isn't particularly well utilized. I consider it above average, but unexceptional at best. For the sake of completeness I will go into greater detail.  The Good: -No complaints on art style. The terrain types and units look great and are differentiable from one another, and really do create the outer space feel. -The Super Units ROCK. Personally I love Angels.  -Aliens do change the early game tremendously. You constantly have to decide whether to fight or avoid them, and they can overwhelm areas if left to their own devices for too long. They generally mind their own business if left alone, but they often inhabit the richest areas and can wreak havoc on your trade, scouting, and expansion.  -Miasma does throw you a big curveball in the early game, and forces you to adjust your settling and trade strategy.  -Satellites are potentially very useful and definitely a game changer. Many of them are dirty cheap, and if you got the tech, there's no reason not to use them. I've definitely used the miasma clearer satellite the most by far. Some can attack, but a well-equiped army will kill them easily, so they certainly aren't a substitute for a military. They are at their best IMO as a supplement to production.  The Bad: -Trade routes are a MESS. You can have up to 3 per city, more for Polystrailia, and they are constant busywork for larger empires. They're functional and useful-vital even-but painful to manage. -There is a A TON of carry-over from Civ V. It's not a complete reskin, but it feels more like a mod than a standalone game. Happiness, Culture, Gold, Science, all directly carry over with little modification. -The Quest system feels really half-baked. It works, and there are rewards, but you could easily ignore it with little consequences. -There is no parallel to nuclear weapons. Let's be serious, nukes were one of the major late game forces in Civ. There is nothing of the such here. -The AI's aren't particularly distinguishable or interesting. Franco-Iberia loves to build wonders, but other than that I haven't seen any trends. No nuke-happy Gandhi, backstabbing Romans, swarming Zulus, or trash-talking Bismark. -Many of the choices are absurdly one-sided. I'd say about 2/3 of decisions you are confronted with have one decision that is overwhelmingly better than the other. -The UI is a bit sloppy.  The In-Betweenies: -The Tech Web. The learning curve is much steeper than a traditional tech tree. If you don't choose carefully, you can throw away a lot of time and science unlocking bonuses for stuff you don't have access to. Study this bad boy carefully if you want to succeed. It does require a greater amount of strategy than a tree, as you can outpace someone significantly in science and still be behind in many regards. -The Spy system is cool, but many of the higher-end abilities are easily avoided and pretty much useless. I've played about 10ish games and have never seen a coup, dirty bomb, siege worm strike, or sabotage. -Affinities: Harmony, Purity, Supremacy. Your affinity is 90% research, the remainder social policies and quests. I was hoping your playstyle had a bit more of an impact (i.e. a warmongering imperialist doesn't come across as very harmonious, does it?) -Some of the 'Unique' units are very unique indeed in their application, but many of them are little more than a varient of the basic Soldier. I don't need more than one soldier varient in an affinity.  Noobie Notes: -Aristocrats are a good noobie colonist. Energy and Health are the two biggest early game downfalls. -Health will almost certainly be your biggest issue in the early game. I'd say try to have 6+ Health before making a new settlement. -Pouring lots of resources into fighting aliens off the bat is almost always a great way to fall behind. Between miasma and aliens being either superior or close to your units, you will lose a lot of production. -Stay away from siege worms and krakens. They aren't your friend. Your units will do little more than tickle them until you are Tier 2 or 3. Use Ultrasonic fences to protect your units until you are in a postion to kill them.   To sum it up, it's not bad, but it may take an expansion or two to be really good. I've certainly had fun with it, but it is disappointing in some regards.",

Gone are the city-states, replaced with stations that are useless after turn 50. Gone is the logically organized technology tree, replaced with simulataneously complex and shallow tech web. Gone is the unit levelling system, replaced with two options: +10% or instant heal. So what was retained? AI bugs, when AI badgers players about a station destoryed 300 turns ago. Illogical computer actions such as declaring a sudden war after 200 turns of alliance while clearly behind in miltary, only to ask for peace and offer a city and all available energy ten turns later. Now, what was added? Great, at a glance, espionage system that upon playthrough turns out to be a simple linear set of assignments. Establish network - syphon energy - steal technology, etc. Miasma that could have been a great gameplay innovation would it no be so unbalanced in favor of harmony affinity. Buggy affinity system that causes AI to attack me for 'forgetting how to be human' at level 18 of purity. Ridiculously over-buffed trade system, allowing for virtually unlimited energy (read: gold). Unbalanced tile improvements (terrascape at 6 maintenance, anyone?). Moronic worker AI (yes! Terrascape everything!). An finally, difficulty levels worthy of a 3 year old. In the end, this game is not worth $50. It is not worth $10. It's an amateur mod hastily put together, along with an admittedly great reskin. I have played every Civilization game to datre, and I am severely disappointed that Firaxis decided to go down the Call of Duty road. Rest In Peace, one of the greatest francises in gaming history. Long live balding budget cutters.",

            "review_text": " My Experience  So, in order to understand why I am not recommending this game, let me take you through my personal experience:  When I first heard of this game, I was very highly skeptical, namely by looking at the art style and how closely everything seemed to resemble Civilization 5. My thoughts were clearly 'no, I'm not getting this.' But, then the release comes out, and to my surprise, it comes with a demo. I play through the demo, have a good time with it for the most part. When my demo time ran out, I decided I saw enough to think I wanted this game.   So, I got the game, played it, and I really did enjoy a lot of the mechanics. I got to the end of the game on the standard difficulty, and I noticed that the endgame was really rough. I did a Promised Land victory and, even when I knew I was gong to win, it drug on and on, having to summon Earthlings and take them to the 'Earthling settlements' one after another.  I beat it, and while I had a good time with my first game, I have had absolutely no temptation to play again. Why?    The game has no soul   In order for a game to be great, it has to have more than just solid gameplay elements: the game has to draw you in and activate your imagination in some way. In past civilization games, the soul mostly came in the form of the actual history of early civilization. We KNOW that Ancient Egypt built the pyramids, but wouldn't it be fun to have them sitting in Washington DC? We know who Ghandi is, and that's why it's funny every time we hear about a rager mad cuz Ghandi went ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mode and started dropping nukes.  This game does not have that same kind of backstory to rely on, so the game has to create it on its own. If you played the demo, you would see a great movie at the beginning that is extremely engaging about humans leaving Earth for another world.   It stops there though. With boring sounding leaders with absolutely no emotion, no character, no distinguishing traits behind them, diplomacy just feels like another screen popping up in your way. Gone are the Alexanders greeting you on their horses, Theadora's lavish dress, and Montazuma's firey cries of blood in the background. No, you deal with the Brasilian empire sounding like the Franco-Iberian empire.  Aside from leaders and story, the interface is also so drab and far less helpful than Civ 5's was. The tech web looks like someone threw a bunch of stuff together with no rhyme or reason. It looks like a disaster and there's nothing intuitive about it. Toward the end of the game, I found myself just clicking random technologies just so I could get on with the game instead of thoroughly reading about what every single thing did. Is that good design? Absolutely not. Additionally, everything's just a monotone gray with only hints of color.  I wouldn't suggest this to an emo kid, because the presentation of this game, when you add it all up, is just downright depressing from the main menu on.   Player versus Planet   Probably the best gameplay element in this game is just your fight to terraform a very rough world with extremely tough alien foes in your way. You have to battle lots of inhospitable terrain, miasma, and maybe a civilization here or there, but since the civilizations are so dull and boring, they essentially feel like the aliens that keep pwning your soldiers when you send them out, except for considerably less challenging.  And, this is why I believe the game did not last for me. Once I beat the game, I didn't feel satisfied conquering civilizations, but rather just felt like I beat a planet full of once-tough aliens that I eventually mowed down with higher technology. It felt like I was conquering a planet, and when I was done, I was bored. That is NOT how a civilization should feel, as you should want to try new things, but although there are some unique gameplay elements, the lack of soul in the game means that, once I beat it, it was done.   What it would take for me to recommend this game   Despite all the bad, there are some great elements of this game. My favorite thing is the affinity system where you essentially use the elements of the planet differently. Purity making the planet look and feel more like Earth. Harmony means making your civilization look more like aliens, and supremacy means using the planet to gather resources. Each one of these affinities completely changes the game and I found it a blast to make an alien world much more green and colorful under my purity victory.   This is why, I think that the game needs to be designed around these systems. Perhaps, instead of this mess of a tech tree, each affinity can have their own tech tree or tech web where you select your affinity from the beginning.    Give this game some soul!   Release more video to represent iconic moments within the game. Draw people in as you did with the intro movie and show where it goes from there. Bring back some of the names that we know and love rather than anonymous Brasilia leader that nobody knows or cares about. Give the civilizations more unique bonuses than '+10 science' or whatever. Make this game look and feel more like an extension of the original series.  I would also like to see moer varied planet types, hazards, and the like. Sorry, but just the Miasma doesn't cover it. People imagine worlds that are extremely hot, extremely cold, where you are literally fighting for your lives in the elements. Cold areas could have population growth stunted until you build a certian structure, you could make workers and such immune to hot temperatures so they can work on volcanoes, or even adapt them to it.   Perhaps these things will come in patches, but until they do, I simply cannot recommend this game. It is a good game, but it's not worth the asking price.",

You start in contact with all the civs and with the ability to get an army to them fairly fast, so games dont last very long. Tech web is very short, most of the wonders just plain suck, and ultimately the winner is whoever farms affinity levels the most. Very few actually unique units, most just being upgrades on existing ones. The quest system is awful, and I cant honestly play with quest victories on because the game will literally only last an hour or two on the bigggest map with them and it just makes the entire game a rush to level up affinity (already a huge problem). The sponsors are very, very, very bland and make little actual difference on the game, a problem intensified by the fact theres only 8 of them. Religion is gone; though it makes sense storyline wise and such, it removes a lot from the game. The gain favors diplomacy option sucks, because no sane human playing for conquest victory (by far the most popular) would accept a trade for a favor because AIs value them differently depending on your relationship, meaning they are an easy way to exploit AIs, considering if you trade them a favor you have no obligation to consider it worth anything, so you get stuff for absolutely nothing (kind of like in Civ v trading someone all your gpt and luxuries for a city then declaring war).   However, there is good; many core problems of Civ V are removed/ changed. Trade is generally better, warfare/ai has improved, and countless small things.   Though I want to liek it, sadly most of its problems are fundemental design flaws with no solution. Honestly, my biggest hope for the game is Firaxis or a clever modder implementing its AI or other improvements into Civ V.",

The units still do basically the same thing as civ units. Orbital units show promise, but are ultimately weak and easily countered by conventional units.  * Diplomacy and the station system is unfinished and imbalanced. Rival AI, for example, can attack the Stations you are trading with and there's virtually nothing you can do about it.  * The end-game is even more flat, uninspired, and anti-climactic as Civ 5. The hardest part about achieving the victory conditions is actually figuring out what you have to do, as the game provides very little clues.  * Certain problems in Civ 5, e.g. the clunky trade routes UI, haven't been fixed and have just been copy-pasted in.

First off, the good sides, this game have potential to be such a great game, it have various aspects that provide both challenge and entertainment, especially for those sci-fi fans, unlike it cousin franchise Civ which chain you with reality and historical time line, the atmosphere of the game change drastically just form the liberation from the historical fact and archeology theories.  The game bring us to a near future fiction world which have so many interesting things to explore, including new world that is entirely new for human being, new tech new cultural policies new kind of living being exclude ourselves, it fascinating and was one of the main reason for my purchase. However, all of that will be gone after a few games.   There are a lot of new systems implemented in Beyond Earth, mostly supplement the alien experience very well and also bring variety to the gameplay from each game, Starting with Affinity system, in my opinion, it was the most interesting system implemented, it gave off such an alien scent and blend in very well in the game atmosphere. In Civ5 other than research order and started nation here will be no difference from each faction they will have similar desire to similar resource but in Beyond Earth, different affinity mean different focus and different advantage that player and AI can hardness out of the geosphere, furthermore different affinity also lead to different 'Victory conditions' that is very interesting indeed. Next is quest system, this is my second favorite one, just like those of Affinity that give you variation in each gameplay, quest system does too. For each quest the player and supposedly AI will be provided with chance to choose different perks, in short term it have a huge impact to how you plan the game ahead but in long term it doesn't matter very much. Last noticeable implemented system is alien aggression; this is my least favorite one. It indicate how much you will be interfere by alien action [mostly worker/explorer got killed], in the early game it does matter but after you pass middle game point alien will be just an “Minor to ignorable concern” even with their strongest kind, it will take you only few shots to eliminate them while it will be nearly impossible for them to kill your units.  To the bad sides, first off, it quite repetitive each game due to not so many leader, predictable and not so dynamic AI, you strategy will mostly stay the same after you have learned some amount of hints and signs for AI pattern, they will mostly ignore wonders and all instead focus and devote for expansion like a plague, to solve that, it always be early aggression. The diplomat system is bland and mostly useless the favor system is useless because the AI tend to refuse to act accord to your demand, trade system is broken [after the 'PATCH' of course], counter intelligence is broken [also due to the 'PATCH'], the quest system is bug but [Mostly] ok.  For now, in my opinion, this game still unstable due to uncertainty of the DEV team so for the time being, Beyond Earth stills an unworthy investment but in future, maybe. I cannot recommend it though.  ",

Add in the new stuff in BE (quests, Affinities - I don't want to spoil it) and you have a game that really makes you as the player feel influential for these people you're leading  And please, don't ever, ever, EVER forget to name your Leader (you), your Civ, and your cities. Otherwise you lose de facto haha.",

At the very least, I consider it better than Civ V was on launch. There's no dramatic changes from the formula, although there are plenty of small details that effect gameplay, such having a tech web instead of a tech tree, or the Affinity system, or making Virtues actually useful. These tweaks have enough of an impact that I'd call C:BE more than a reskinned Civ V, but the solidified, tested mechanics of V's complete edition make a solid launching point for the game itself.  With the changes made in the first major patch, it's clear the Firaxis is working to address issues the community has raised. My biggest gripes with C:BE are less simple to address, however. Firstly, more could be done to differentiate factions and leaders from each other. While I understand the game instead focuses on Affinities, rather than factions, to provide much-needed personality, this leads me to my second point. Much like the modern era in V, Affinities really only come into their own as a source of flavour and personality in the later stages of the game.  As I mentioned, I still consider C:BE to be superior to V on launch, and I'm excited to see what I can be with an expansion or two of the same quality as BNW.",

The best part of the game for me was landing and clearing out some aliens in each playthrough, then exploring the new world as a space pioneer. After that it quickly loses its luster as something that would have been better as an expansion of some kind for Civilization 5, instead of Half-Civ on garbage space Earth with aliens for barbarians. I was hoping it wouldn't be more or less the same as Alpha Centauri, but somehow I found it even less enjoyable. Call me biased, I wasn't into that game.

To be honest the game is pretty broken in a lot of aspects and doesn't have many redeeming factors... Why a recommended? The game does it's job which is to hold your attention. This is evident when you look at all the reviews. All the negative reviews with 200+ hours of gameplay. I feel like this game could become something great if patches and DLC are worked correctly.  Anywhozzle.  Pros: The Barbarian alternatives. (Won't say too much here other than that they definitely improved on the randoms of the game. Almost feels like you're defending against another civilization while holding off the hoards.)  The Story. Most people in the reviews don't seem to give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the games lore but the game transitions small aspects into the gameplay. Just enough to where you can piece together a little of whats happening while building your civilization.  The aggressiveness. I felt like in Civ 5 every other leader was just waiting for a chance to denounce or declare war on some random fellow on the map. In BE the gameplay (single player) seems to be toned down a lot which makes it seem more realistic for what it is. No one seems to declare war on you unless you downright deserve it.  Tech Tree and policies. These I felt were done much better in BE. As opposed to unlocking each previous tier of the trees before being able to move to future tech, like in the previous game, here you can jump around by unlocking certain techs before others. This can allow you to make many different decisions throughout the game and allow much more replayability.   Cons:  Simplistic design. Lots can be improved on here. I feel like I've landed in South America + Aliens on each map I load. Not much variety as to what you can find in the maps. It's about the same as Civ 5 dispite being on distant planets. I was hoping for more cool unique alien related biomes.   Leaders don't seem like leaders. Every leader in the game seems like some random pulled off the street and told 'Here ya go be generic for this game'  Lack of Units. The goodness of the tech tree can be counted against it as well. If you make a few early game mistakes and don't start leveling the right tech up you'll be left with a serious lack of units in the game. I've also noticed in general that you can't build very many military units either. The units you unlock seem to relate to farming, mining, production and such more as opposed to firepower. On one playthrough where I focused on a certain victory type I made it to turn 350 with only 4 available miltary units but something like 15 to 20 random units. Every unit serves it's own purpose and none of them are useless really but I don't feel like so many PvE related units were necessary.  Too much going on. Going from above the massive amount of PvE units make every turn a constant click around. To get to your 2 soldiers you have to go through about 30 unit prompts just bringing random ♥♥♥♥ up while you had them asleep. I found it hard to understand the early game even with the tutorials just due to the massive amount of different dialaog boxes being thrown at me every turn. Seems like building a simple monument comes with 3 yes or no questions and a survay.   All in all not a bad game. Would give it a 6/10 as of now but major potential.",

I enjoyed actualy checking and double checking the web, plotting a path to get were I thought I needed to be, only to find I should have done somthing else. Its very good to have this back in a turn based game.  Seems less of a 'you must follow this path to win' like civ 5, and there are no overly powerful races to pay as, they all seem fairly balanced. Does this make it worse than CIV 5 which has civ's with abilities that are obviously better the rest that are available?  I think all it does is level the playing field.  The small number of units didnt bother me at all, I would have loved to see the unit creator from AC or a wider selection like Civ 5, but all in all, how many units did I use in civ 5? Not all of them thats for sure. Having a limited number to make? I found I had quite a wide choice at the end game, lots of cool Xenos units (Titans FTW).  I think the trade system could do with a bit of work, if they are going to let you have so many routes, an auto repeat option would have been nice.  The espionage system is realy fun, I found the stealing tech option to be a very useful way to procure tech that is at the other end of the web.  The AI could be a little better, I anexed a city then 4 turns later he was thanking me for trading with him, apart from that had a good few scraps with various factions. ",

With that out of the way, there are some fairly clear positive and negative points to be made of the game. The headline feature, the Affinities system, is superbly implemented: even though there are, at its most basic level, three choices, it still feels like you're taking your faction and making it your own, something that CiV's impersonal soldiers never really conveyed.  On the negative side, the shiny new tech web presents, if anything, too much choice. All too often, I find myself paralysed by indecision, something that is happening less as I play more, but still a serious problem the first few times you play. Diplomacy feels very lightweight after Brave New World, and the diplomacy overview is less informative than I'd become accustomed to. And the much-vaunted orbital layer feels underused, with your skies virtually empty for much of the game.  The variety of units in the game swings both ways. There are enough land units to keep things interesting, but only two naval units (a gunboat and an aircraft carrier) and just one aircraft. On water-heavy maps, things get a bit samey, feeling like you're just filling time until the next big land battle. It feels like Firaxis have deliberately left gaps to fill in with an expansion or two further down the line.  And, of course, no matter what it does, Beyond Earth is always going to be living in Alpha Centauri's shadow. The comparisons were inevitable, and Alpha Centauri casts a long, long shadow indeed. Truth told, Beyond Earth doesn't live up to that legacy, but that's because it doesn't try. Beyond Earth is its own thing, just as they've been telling us from day one.  But forget all that.

Its very similar to Civ 5 in almost every way considering gameplay and strategy. Below is a quick summary of the new elements the game offers.   Aliens A lot of people are complaining about the aliens. And I fail to see how they are different from barbarians in the Civ games besides offering some variety, but they are at least interesting and I am excited to see how they evolve in future updates and expansions.   Tech Web  I saw a lot of complaints here as well. I personally like this approach to the tech. I also like how they incorporated elements from some Sci Fi classics, wish there were more, such as taking from Old Man's War and Hyperion would have been really cool. It takes a little bit to see the bigger picture on how to approach tech, and it does need a little work. Assuming it does get a little modification in the future, I love the direction.   Virtues Virtues are solid approach to how to build your civ considering yoyou dont really overtly focus on govt. in this game. Very similar to the social policies in Civ 5. Its difficult to make substanttial progress so far for me though after one playthrough.   Affinities Great start here. Very cool ideas. I love the concept of evolving based off of ideology humans select. I just wish they were more to do with it. Basically there are very few units that differentiate and you still end up building the same stuff anyway. The different affinities dont seem to require you to figure out a new strategy and while visually kind of cool, not impactful.   Other Civs Meh. I like some of the quotes from the ARC lady, but besides that, the others are really bland. Just makes me want to kill them. I hope we see some improvements here soon  Unit upgrade system This is also pretty limited. I feel like you dont get to upgrade too much and Im not that excited about the units I have been seeing. I thought the Death Robot and XCOM units from Civ 5 were a fun addition. Nothing here is very interesting or does anything very spectacular you would expect 800 years into the future.   Overall  I mean come on. Its Civ! This would be a huge acheivement for almost any other studio. Still needs some progress. But Civ 5 just sat on my computer for a year before I could even play it. I can still see myself putting major hours into this exploring the different approaches to building a future civ. But, for this to be an awesome CIv game, Probably needs some work still.

The game itself is very pretty so long as you don't mind the tilt-shift perspective.  On the negative side, the auto-unit-focus is still present and impossible to disable, so the game will wrench you away from whatever you were looking at to whatever it thinks you must witness. There are some graphical glitches, especially enemy unit frames. It is very difficult to tell what each unit actually is and which faction it belongs to (though there are the faction flags above them).  All in all I would say this game more immitates Civ 5 rather than improves on it. It feels like a game inspired by it, not a true successor. I'm sure it'll have lots of DLC to improve upon most of the above for your extra hard-earned dollars.",

It's bland and all your choices feel emotionless and uneventful. - What are all these factions? What am i fighting for? You are never told. ( Surely not survival...since i'm already the best lifeform on the planet after a few turns. ) - no explanations, backgrounds, emotion of feels in this 'bland' game. Where are the movies? The sense of progression, the feeling of victory when you build a gigantic wonder? - Winning gives no feeling of victory. What happens when you win? They never show you.  - It's more suited to competitive multiplay where everything is based on making emotionless strategic moves just to win and defeat your opponent. Nothing else. It lacks SinglePlay gratification and therefore replayability! - You must wait for DLC to have the complete feel.  This games leaves you guessing all the time. It offers no real closure or intelligent gratification apart from a few short tense moments. Do I recommed this game? Yes, it keeps you busy for a while and most of the mechanics are solid and a small bit of fun if you miss strategic/turn based games. But it's nowhere near all the other Civs in completness or gratification!! Be warned and do not trust the high ratings... ",

Alien combat is way unbalanced during the beginning, where there are many units being spawned which are can't be practically killed. A step down from the barbarian system, and not very creative either. Going to wait for some patches and DLC and see what happens. Also, the way the tech tree is connected to the upgrade of your units can make it a bit hard to actually get units and get enough technology to have any sort of advantage.  Has a bit more replay value than Civs 5, where you're basically doing the same thing every game. Rush to get giant death robots and nukes, and once you aquire those and have all of the wonders, nuke the crap out of everything and win the game five different ways. The AI was not improved at all from the previous game. There are still many multiplayer issues as far as connectivity. Basically, it doesn't seem like they modified or improved the actual game engine at all. Still, it's good to see they're trying out new things. Hopefully their next product learns from the mistakes of this one. ",

I don't really feel like I'm playing against them in any real sense of the word. Everyone once-in-a-while, one of the factions might call me up to tell me how silly they think my choices are, but they don't really do anything besides complain about me. In 4 gameplays, including on higher difficultly levels, I have not once had to fight a non-alien. The only wars that were started were by me, and usually ended before I could do any real damage. The AI surrenders their cities in exchange for peace at the drop of a hat.  I was hoping this game would have new challenges compared to Civilization 5, but instead I've been given less of a challenge.  Maybe once this game has some updates and DLCs, it might be worth playing. But I wouldn't pay more than 30$ for what ammounts to basically a watered-down Civ 5.",

The engine seems to be the same as Civilization V and the game is very similar. Hapiness has been replaced by health and gold has been replaced by energy so low hapiness (health) does no longer descrease gold (energy) income which is a nice change. Technology tree is in the form of a net, where nodes have 1-2 leaf technologies (technologies that do no lead to any other technologies). There are multiple paths to upgrade units and already built units auto-upgrade when you select an upgrade. The rest is like in Civilization 5 - trading, spying, diplomacy, zone of control, fighting, building cities. A limit of 3 air units per city is a nice change. And finally, the biggest feature is deploying satellites. These can give bonuses to production/energy/culture/food yield, bonuses to units strength, spread/clean miasma (aka radioactive fog),shoot or even spawn basic/strategic resources.  There are quite a lot of bugs - once any specialist is assigned manually, specialists are no longer assigned automatically - in unit upgrade panel sometimes multiple unit models are displayed together (overlapping) - sometimes air unit attack graphics get screwed up and the unit keeps circling and attacking 5-10 times... it is necessary to play with auto combat enabled - game crashes in later stages where majority of the map is revealed (and that was on a small map...) - sometimes it is not possible to build a building which requires certain resource to be within city borders and upgraded even if it is - often when starting a new game 'next turn' button doesn't work and I have to exit to main menu and start a new game... of course all the setup gets cleared",

For people who have the DLC there is much lacking. Combat is very fast paced all the sudden. What used to take 20+ turns and 10+ upgraded units now takes 3 and a undefended city. Needless to say, you can spend 250+ turns building a city into science and get destroyed in twelve turns from someone who went all commando on your butt. Don't go all science....  AI is a bit more intellegent, but mostly just chaotic. If they feel they are about to get rolled over, they will try to make amends which is nice. But the original..... give me 500 energy plus 5 oil and I'll give you..... a favor. I have yet to find out what a 'favor' does.  I was hoping there was a little more in terms of picking planets. Right now, there is pretty much only one earth like planet and that is it.

This is less than the minimum requirements of a 2.2GHz i3, and the specs explicitly say that the NVIDIA 300 series is unsupported. However—however—Civ:BE runs better than Civ V on my Mac. Maybe this won't always be the case; maybe I will have to finally run Bootcamp at some point, but it works, for me, for now.)

            "review_text": "Yeah I really wouldn't if i were you. If you like sci-fi then you may find more fun than i did but it's just really boring.   So i'll give a brief version here, and i'll try and go more in depth further down. So have you played civ 5? you have good this is just civ 5 with new civs, music, and visuals. It's the same game but somehow drains all the fun that civ 5 has i mean that it's essentially the same thing but small tweaks here and there make it just non enjoyable. it's not Firaxis fault if you look at their track record they almost always make perfect games this is just a hiccup in that great streak. So in short if you own civ5 keep it it's better and if you want to play this buy civ 5 instead or maybe endless space if you're looking for a sci-fi strategy game it's pretty solid.  Now if you're not sold let me go more indepth with what i see as problems rember all people like different things so you may not agree with me i'm just saying what bugs me and i do not mean to be hostile i as stated above love Firaxes.so here we go  First off one of the key pieces of civ 5 is gone right away with the idea itself that is era progression. I haven't played a full game mainly because the game is just boring to me but, i'm pretty sure there are no eras and if there are they only have to be even more future eras. That is one of the best parts of civ 5 that being going from cave men with clubs to full nations with giant death robots growing up as-and with-nations we are familiar with from history. Because of this era progression the game is changing as you advance forward with your technologies and it doesn't get dull for that reason. Where as here in beyond earth you're in the future and that's it so the game isn't changing for the most part. It's like playing civ 5 starting in the modern era.  Another thing that bugs me but this may be a nit pick is the overall layout of the hud it's just not as interesting as civ 5. I have tons of money (energy) coming in but i really don't have the same satisfaction looking at it as i do in civ 5. Again that's a pretty big nit pick but it just really bugs me.  Also like I said the game is civ 5 but things need to be switched around one most noticeably is instead of social policies you instead have a 'virtue tree.' It's almost exactly like an RPG leveling up tree, in fact it reminds me a lot of borderlands level up system. Where you have a couple columns (4 in BE) and the more top virtues you choose the better virtues get unlocked lower down on the tree. This is such a downgrade to the social policies where fully choosing a branch is pretty easy and there are lots of them that you can freely mix and mash.They also have huge impacts all on their own. It's an important decision and is a vital choice to make to the development of your nation the way you want it. these virtues are boring and they feel very unimportant to the development to my colony. For example they usually do things like add sience per citizen or speed up border growth things that are not immediate. In comparison to civ 5 where you adopt a policy that makes citizens happy when troops are in cities and boom immediately you see happiness go up it’s very satisfying and it feel like you're doing something.  Democracy is very strange as well because nations are immediately discovered as they land on the planet there's also this whole idea of trading favors for resources and also you can trade science points. For the most part it’s identical to civ 5 even the exact phrasing is the same in some places. the models look really nice and all but i don’t care about any of the nations and there's not much to tell them apart except their nationality. Which can be argued is the same for civ 5 but theres more charm because they were real historical people.Not only that but in civ 5 they have those cool backgrounds and music. don’t remember about the music it wasn't noticeable if there was a change but there definitely is a lack of background.  One last thing i deffinity want to mention is something that sounds good on paper but after a while it really gets old. That’s the quests yes like endless legend but much less fitting and fun. i’m going to compare this mechanic to endless legend because it’s the only other game i’ve seen it in if you think thats unfair well don’t worry it’s not fun even without that comparison. In endless legend you get quests which is one way to complete the game. the questes are simple but challenging and take a bit of time. Also what makes them fun and unique is that they cycle through so you're not doing the same quests over and over every time you play the game. I say that because that’s what happens in BE the first quest you get is simply step by step how to make a second city. It’s uninventive and pretty pointless, but that’s not my real gripe with the quest system. My real issue is that sometimes the game has you make one of a couple choices to complete a quest or as the quest as a whole. you choose between to improvements with a scenario given like if you should make low grade recycled goods or high grade choosing low increases workers improvment speed but high grade improves health of your colonies. The issue is the game asks you these “quest decisions” waaaay to often and the fun of it wears of i found myself just going to the results and choosing one because i was sick of reading all the scenarios.  Thoughts were about all the issues i personally had with the game, but it’s not bad per say just very boring, and i can see someone liking this game. If the things you found me saying you agreed with or if you were expecting this whole awesome new game after playing civ 5 i’d stear clear.  ",

            "review_text": "It's a good game, though seems underwhelming when compared to Civ 5... but only if you factor in all of Civ 5's DLC. If you compare this to base Civ 5 with no DLC then this is the better game. I think once this game has enough time to grow like it's predecessor then it will end up being an overall better game in the end as well.  I enjoyed the change of scenery, tactics, and playstyle that this game has over the other Civ titles. For one it feels like you are trying to colonize a new world. You are on a hostile planet where everything wants you dead, the miasma surrounding you will kill troops, the aliens will eat your settlements, and the other factions will probably turn on you sooner or later as well. That makes it fun though. Most of the time it feels like the planet itself is your worst enemy rather than the other factions.  Resources play an even bigger role in this game than in previous Civ games. Each of the three alignments need a specific resource to build up their unique units. So rather than planning an alignment at the start it's usually best to adapt to what you have available and go from there. This aspect makes each playthrough feel even more varied even if you play the same faction. The unique units really are impressive too at higher levels like the massive aliens you can breed as harmony, the huge siege platforms and robots you get as supremacy, or the armada of hovertanks that can transverse almost all terrain as a purity player can make for some exciting battles.  The AI is a bit... lacking to say the least, even on higher difficulties. Usually they'll happily sit by and watch as you build an endgame wonder and use it to finish the map. Sometimes they're vindictive jerks who will ignore others doing the same thing and instead focus all their efforts on crushing you despite you having done nothing to really warrant such actions. Of course this isn't much different than the nuclear warlord Ghandi from Civ 5 now is it?  If you enjoy these types of games I'd say go ahead and get it. The sci-fi setting and change in many things does make it feel distinct from Civ 5. If you're still on the fence just wait for a steam sale on the game or something, as it's still worth checking out.",

Then Rising Tide came out, and I was blown away. The complexity of the game increased exponentially. I was impressed by the enriched naval combat system, leashing, and the new diplomatic capitol system. While I still believe a better strategic view would be an advantage, plus a more flexible trading system; I believe this game holds it's own against Civ V as it's own game, and the developers have definitely put a lot of thought and imagination into the new expansion, and I would recommend anyone buy this game and play the crap out of it. The leashing system is a bit broken, I can practically beat anyone with getting the alien remains marvel, and it's OP collossal alien lease, but then my enemies also have the same chance of doing the same.",

I've played the game repeatedly and beat it on all affinities except Purity (in the process). However the game lacks in its replay-ability and it feels sort of hollow after so many rounds of playing. May be so spoilers toward how AI act in this review. Current state is a 7/10, and would buy if on sale.  Early Game: Game is absolutely awesome in the beginning and you feel like you are on uncharted grounds that you must conquer or become one with. The aliens (bugs) in the game are a true threat and very commonly there is always one CIV waging a war against the bugs in the game causing more initial tension in the game promoting some early game warfare with astronaut suits and weaponized rovers between CIVs that adore the bugs and CIVs that want to kill them.  Mid Game: Starts to get boring because all your doing is just hoarding buildings/wonders/victory quests. Diplomacy is not existent at this stage and if you want war just do it and there are little consequences except being condemned (but no one cares about that). What is good are the stations (city-states) were quests ask you to destroy certain stations because of their beliefs/practices or stations just don't like each other and want you to kill either off. The war against the bugs sorta dies in this stage because your units start simply overpowering the aliens and their is no sense of true danger. Unless your fighting siege worms or krakens but it's meh.  Late Game Tensions rise!!! And alliances form, sorta mainly tensions rise... You get these godly über units that are specific to your affinity choice which makes war fun when the two top dogs start slugging it out. The AI is most aggressive at this point and wars sprout everywhere commonly dividing the CIVs into three factions based on the affinities. However the AI have little room for diplomacy no matter what and wars commonly cary on until one or the other is wiped out. The bugs are just pests at this point and get one bagged from the weakest units in an army. Harmony affinity CIVs do little to protect the aliens and the aliens do little to join with Harmony Affinity CIVs effectively getting rid of the purpose of going harmony. Leading to Supremacy and Purity becoming the most war like and best because of their major production buffs. Than victories vary from going back home and helping humanity, killing off humanity and seduce all into supremacy, or becoming one with the planet. Each victory requiring a massive amount of settlers, or war units, or going turtle mode.  CIV AI The CIV AI is real basic and they feel overly predictable. It's few instances were a supposedly friendly AI because of trade actually declares war on you for hostilities toward other CIVs or the Bugs. Therefore the CIV AI feels kinda blah and kinda easy to push around with little consequences.  Diplomacy Nothing like CIV V and this game did horrible on diplomacy IMO.   Aliens or the Bugs Fun at first and mid game but die late game and the bugs don't side with harmony CIVs making them a simply annoyance to all.  Affinity Supremacy: You incorporate chips and metal into your people effectively making them cyborgs but ridding yourself of humanity and being and CIV all about numbers and results but no emotion. Essentially a robot CIV get nasty buffs toward production and science and get cool sounding uber units with the best ranged unit in game. Black and yellow color scheme that looks good. Basically go back home and commit mass extermination of the human race. Most radical and few AI choose this. Will constantly be at war late game.  Purity: Keep humanity pure and keep our culture and heritage alive and save earth if possible. 49er colors and feels the most familiar out of all the affinities. Victory goes back and saves earth. Cool uber units and has production and growth buffs with some culture. War is so so  Harmony:  Best melee units in game and sweet looking über units that rain hell and have the fastest healing rates, especially if there is miasma in game. They get buffs toward health, food, culture, a little to science. Greenish and bluish color schemes. They fall in the middle and choose to abandon earth and become one with their current planet keeping their humanity but embracing the minds of the native aliens and the planet. Kinda turtles it late game",

I much prefer what Civ: 5 has over Civ: BE.  I would NOT buy this game, unless it's less than $10. As this game stands, it feels more like an expansion/remastered edition of Civ: 5.   Go spend your money on a better game, such as Civ: 5 or Civ: 4, both of which I highly recommend.",

I thought 'It's Civ, how could they get it wrong? I've been enjoying them for years.' Oh boy!  I have played 16 hours and I've had enough. I got it on sale and I still feel ripped off. Also it may be worth noting that a good portion of that time was Alt-Tabbed out, looking for solutions/explanations online. Fact is, there are so many things wrong with this game.  * It's just so BLAND, and DULL, and FORGETTABLE! The Civs, the setting, the aliens, the wonders... everything!  * The tutorial has glaring omissions (leading to having to search the net for an explaination as to, for example, why my explorer unit won't enter a city to resupply his expedition module - it was because there is only room in the city for a single unit. Nice if they could have mentioned that in-game).  * In fact, the majority of things seem under-explained, the Affinities system being another good example and that's a core mechanic of the game!  * There is a corrosive fog (Miasma) which is so visually subtle that I have to rely on tooltips to tell me if its there to stop my units being damaged. It's simly not graphically clear enough.  * The local wildlife is seemingly pointless. they generally leave you alone until you start an expedition and then they flatten your unit.  * Also with the wildlife, the AI civs congratulate you for not attacking them... Sorry, I thought these Civs originated from a world that was systematically pillaged of all its natural resources to the point of the human race having to evacuate to have a future! Apparently a side effect of cryosleep is that it forcibly turns you into a conservationist! Sorry but it broke the feel of things for me, especially when the militaristic Brazilian guy started browbeating me for killing the aliens! Yeah, right! I don't remember being made a pariah for exterminating Barbarians...  * But the BIG one for me was that in a game about building your civilisation, you are penalised for actually doing so. The unfathomable Health statistic, which apparently was meant to replace Happiness from earlier games (presumably in the same way Jar Jar Binks was meant to replace Chewbacca) actually punishes you for founding new cities, even if you are specifically looking after your Civs 'Health' needs. I'm sorry... What?! Whilst the penalties are not huge, you are left with the feeling that you are somehow doing something wrong.   This game was borked from the beginning (as far as I can read) and 8-ish months have done nothing to help the situation. Most people seem to advocate waiting for the expansion to 'fix' the game and to make it enjoyable and (frankly) comprehensible. I for one will not be supporting this game any further and would be claiming a refund if one was on offer. After last weeks Batman Arkham Knight disaster, I'm sick to the back teeth of buying games that are not fit for purpose on release and I urge you to boycott too. Vote with your wallet, it's the only way they will listen.  TL,DR : Don't be fooled, it may claim to be a 'Civ' game, but sharing a name is as close as it gets. Don't bother with it, even on a sale.",

Secondly, if you have been playing the Civ games for a long time and win the space victory and then find youself wondering, 'Well that was awesome, but now what?' then this is the game for you.  They have finally gone back to explain to us what happens when the space race happens. When you select your starting faction, you are in essence selecting who won the space victory in the previous Civ game. One of the settings is to have the different factions arrive on different turns. This is genius in my opinion. Even on the harder difficulties, no one achieves the victory condition at the same time.  That being said, this is not really a new game. In my opinion and experience I would call this a 'stand-alone expansion.' What I mean by that is you can play this game having never heard of any of the Civilization games before. It will teach you how to play. But if you have more than 200+ hours on Civ5, you may feel like you waiting a couple years for an expansion.

It definitely is fun and I'm glad I bought it, but it is also woefully underwhelming in exactly some of those new areas where it should have excelled.  The initial customization of your expedition has next to zero impact on how the game plays out. The tech web is difficult to navigate and the placement of improvements on the web seems random at times. The espionage system is neat but most operations take so long to complete that you'll hardly see it.  None of these issues are particularly painful, but they also don't live up to my expectations.  There is, however, one flaw I cannot so easily forgive: The endings.  After playing close to 20 hours and getting ever closer to one of the (nicely varied and well balaned) victory conditions, I was really looking forward to winning my first game. I had chosen 'Contact' - the path to making contact with sentient aliens for the first time. Throughout the game, the narrative of the victory quests is compelling and I was really waiting to see what would happen.  Unfortuately, this and all the other victories are a complete letdown. A text card with an ambiguous, 'will we ever know?'-style message is all that heralds your win.  No cinematic, no resolution. It's almost as if the makers of Beyond Earth did not anticipate that anyone would actually ever want to win it.  This is such a big deal because after staring at those three lines of text for a while, I started to realise that it makes the whole experience leading up to this point feel cheap in retrospect, as if it was not quite worth the effort. I hope that the inevitable DLC will maybe fix this.  So, why did I still recommend the game? Because as long as you know what to expect from your victory, the journey is still great fun. Gameplay is smooth for the most part, combat is satisfying and city management just as you would expect.  It's a solid game, unfortunately just not quite what we all were hoping for.",

It's mostly Civ V in space, but Firaxis made some great changes to it to make this feel like its own game. The new questing system is awesome. You get things ranging from tutorial-like missions to actual story-based stuff. Nothing too crazy in depth, but still pretty cool to see things happen as a result to your actions on a plot-level.   The Affinity system is pretty cool, too. You can choose between three different affinities based on the technology you research. This opens up new units (upgrades), new buildings, and victory conditions that you can only access if you have a high enough level in a given affinity. And this leads us to win conditions. Each condition has a specific affinity attached to it that is required to attain a specific win condition. Not only that, but each one has lore behind it you can read in the quest log that ties into the views of each specific affinity. These range from things like building a gate to bring humans from Earth to the new planet to ones like discovering an alien signal to decrypt.   Overall, if you like the Civilization series and enjoy a SciFi setting, you'll love this game. It's just as addictive as the mainline series with some unique twists and it unshackles itself from history settings to really let Firaxis go in new directions with things like technology. You can have flying units very early on in this game.",

I feel this game is a great start to something bigger through DLC packs etc. Also I enjoy the spying in this version far more than in Civ 5 (which I always turned off). In Beyond Earth spying feels like it takes less time and feels more rewarding. Also the addition of quests and different optional upgrades really makes each play through unique.

All of these things, Beyond Earth does well, even the opening cutscene is wonderfully made. The combat is quick and well calculated, continuing with Civ V's introduction of the before combat analysis, a helpful tool. The factions are diverse and complicated, offering various routes into their good nature, including the additon of favors, which you can gain by giving a faction a certain resource and can be cashed in later, for ample benefit. The game itself is beyond pretty, offering a vibrant and living world, full of danger and opportunity, alien life taking the place of the barbarians of the other games. Beyond Earth also introduces Affinities, or ideological specializations for your civilzation to aspire too. On this note, as you level up in a certain Affinity, upgrades for your basic untis become avaliable, Soldiers become Marines, Rangers become Gunners, and so forth, each Affinity offering different and powerful units the more invested in it you become. The only real drawbacks to the game, are the limited number of factions to play as, though the Steam Workshop is taking care of that right quick, and the taking of cites, as cities have been able to defend themselves since Civ V, but perhaps I just have yet to find the proper formula for the offensive. All in all, Civlization: Beyond Earth, is a refreshing look at the series and a brand new way to play strategy games.",

            "review_text": "Civ BE has potential but falls short of fufilling it. First off , this game is not worth the $50 price tag (I waited for the Steam Sale), but then neither was Civ5. Most reviews i've read compare this game with The 'Complete CIV5' but i'm not going to do that. CIV5 was just as bad (to some people worse) when it started of as Just a Vanilla. I don't think this should be compared with a complete game, Usually firaxis needs two expansion packs (and our money) to figure it out. That being said, I think Firaxis should have known better going into CIVBE. Much of it feels like a reskin of CIV. The Game feels bugged at times, and the tech web (although very creative) can be confusing, theres a search bar, but i have no clue what to search for. Much of the game feels limited, theres only so many ways to play with just 8 civs. The end game still seems to be CIV's Achilles heal. Its just click until contact victory or Trancendece Victory (Seriously firaxis didn't learn it's lesson). Much of the concepts from CIV 5 where recycled and just renamed (i.e. Happiness= Health, Policies= Virtues, Ancient ruins=Resource pods). This game feels like an expansion pack more than anything. As for the positives, the Affinities are an interesting idea, that maybe could be built on. Plus upgrading the units all at once is a big help. The same overall addictive gameplay of CIV exists, that much is true (4 pm became 4 am quickly). There are some new challenges to the game like miasma, which means you have to constantly watch where you send your units. I think what kept me playing was the 'Epic' feeling the soundtrack gave me, (I feel firaxis spent more time on the music than the game). I feel much of the dissapointment came from the Overhype of this game ,and the constant dropping of a certain name (Cough...Alpha Centuri), which I feel was a mistake to compare the two. I've come to realize that Firaxis has a track record taking a while to get their games just right (CIV3- 2 expansionpacks, CIV4 -2 expansion packs ,CIV5-2 expansion packs, and the last spin-off 'Colonization' was a flop), which is why I waited for the Steam Sale. So do I recommended it? I depends on your taste. If your going into the game with high expectations your going to be disappointed. So for those looking for the ultimate CIV experiense, No, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you understand the Firaxis track record then I would, but I'd wait for the steam sale, it won't hurt emotionally like spending $50 would. My recommendation to anyone unsure, is to download the demo first, its only 100 turns, which is enough. If by turn 50 your not captivated, then your not gong to be. I feel a good game has to draw you in and keep you there until the end. CivBE kinda does it in the mid game, but the early and late game suffers. Playing it felt like watching a movie that took forever to get to the good part, Had some great action sequences, then had a terrible ending. I'd Give it a 6/10, it's ok as a Vanilla, but as a complete game it falls short. I think a 'reasonably priced, well done' expansion (Maybe two) could salvage it.",

The one thing that really sets it apart are the quests, which give an almost story-like feel to the game, and lets you both personalize your civ as well as make dull parts more interesting.

Affinities are also 'new', but really just a downgraded (yes downgraded) version of ideologies. The civilization options are exciting for exactly 3 playthroughs, as they don't really stand apart that much. It's not like you're comparing England to the Zulus, with exciting pro's and con's to each civ.  There are multiple ways to win of course, and that can be somewhat interesting, one time each. The maps are not as diverse and the tech tree, while more robust, gives you a oddly small variety of units, making your unit creation very boring.

It also used to be in previous Civs that when playing on the easiest level, it was easy enough to advance technologically above your neighbours. Well, here it's harder. That's partly because of the way the technology web is set up. I found it overly complex.  Played this during the free weekend. I'd be tempted to buy it, but only at a heavy discount. Waiting for 75% off and hopefully they'll have fixed a few things by then.  I guess I'd only recommend it for fans of Civ and for those with a ton of patience.",

So you have the democracy engine from civ 5 or a down graded personality less version of it. 'Lets be friends', then on the same turn they denounce you.  The A.I. isn't great, still haven't fixed naval battles, though having the roaming aliens does make it a bit interesting.   Really just feels a bit soulless. Same game mechanics as Civ 5 with some tweaks, really just feels like a free fan space mod.

I really enjoyed it.  They did keep the Civ 5 feel, which I think is a good move, as all Civ 4 did really was introduce the fact you cannot use mountains, other then that to me it felt a lot like a graphic enhanced Civ 3.  Another thing, I prefer the go your own path tech tree, along with the units that you can upgrade to your style. Only issue is the unit screen is a bit bugged and keeps the unit you first viewed, so you have a vechile with a guys head sticking out, but thats a minor issue tbh.  Aliens, now at first I was a bit like why? I did not think that they would work out tbh, however I find them a refreshin change from the barbs in other Civ games that are just like mindless, well barbarians. The aliens I have come across can be more tactical then other civilisations in the game, that maybe down to chance, but that's still my opinion.  So to end a rant, this game could do with a little touch up, some great DLC, better then the Civ 5 ones please, yes they are good but I still feel a bit let down by them, they only add what should have been there in the first place.  I would give the game 7/10 (room for improvement, still a good play at the end of the day). Will buy when I have the money.",

I decided to wait until the Christmas sale but then am waiting even longer since I bought a few other games and this one wasn't getting positive reviews from hardly anyone. Now I am playing the free weekend. I can say that I am glad I waited. This game is a little slow, lots of turns between things that need doing, especially in the early game. My explorers and soldiers keep getting killed by the little aliens, even on easy. Buildings and units take so long to build that there is so much waiting. (Update: perhaps because of my starting position, there was a lot of tundra and desert around) Click next turn, click next turn, click next turn, click next turn again. Then finally, a new unit or a new tech to decide on! Something to do!  It wants to be a good game and I can see it in there, but I cannot recommend in it's current state. Perhaps future updates or an expansion will help. I'll probably buy at $19.99 because I like the ideas in the game and think that it will be playable with more time investment but I won't buy at $30 or more.  Good: it IS Civ. I can see it in there. the Quest system is cool Trade Spys Unique aliens, tiles and buildings/techs  Not so good: buildings and techs take far too many turns to complete. Many, many turns with nothing to do but click 'End Turn'. Tech and benefits are kind of confusing but with more time I am sure it will get sorted in peoples' minds.

Discovering this new world and all the dangers that lurk on it's atmosphere is rewarding, and following your own doctrine (do you want to morph in with the xenos?

Factions are more intressting and the diplomacy feature plays a major part in this. The user interface has been tweaked and overall is more compfortable. Gameplay is much richer with the new hybrid affinties and the small rework of the victories make the game much more enjoyable. Also noticable are that the quests now work, which was quite pleasent to see.  My favorite part has to be the new map generation, it's mostly the same but now generates resources on water tiles. It's not just great for factions starting on water but provides many more intressting choices where to drop new colonies.   At this point i just got used to the pretty but comlicate graphics, same goes for the tech tree. For a newcomer these will still prove dounting. I'm still a bit on the fence about the Alien faction, while improved it's still not really there. Maybe a good focus for the next expension?  There are also a number of animation and AI bugs, but I'm full confident that these will be patched soon enough.  Don't play BE without Rising Tide, it's a must have.   **Original review**  This game is clearly geared towards the hardcore Civ5 players. The game design is nicely iterated and pretty slick and will please many seasoned players, but by comparison to Civ5 and all of it's expansions does feel bare bone.   Beyond Earth has a great science fiction identity with an alien world and a giant tech web to dig into. However that sense of exploration does wear off and than you're hit with a startling lacking of the game.  - Personality. There just isn't much to identify with. The factions are mostly pretty plain. The Wonders don't capture any awe or add to the fiction. To me, the choices I make what cargo to load on my space ship before planet fall are more important than the people. While the Harmony, Purist and Supremacy affinities do give your play through a bit of visual identity, they do feel very gamey and add little distinction.  - High upkeep. Beyond Earth pops up lots of actions for picking target for your trade units. In a late game you might get this at least every round as trade is a huge source. That's easily 300+ not really necessary actions. On the other hand you have spies an intrigue which are much more powerful than previous games but do add quite a bit to every other turn, again this ends up being a chore.  - Diplomacy. The AI does respond more rational than any previous Civ game to requests but it hardly matters, with even less options than Civ5 you might never even open it in some play through.  - Placid world. The aliens seem foreign and intimidating at first, but they pretty much do nothing unless provoked. It's kind of a forgiving Tid for Tad. The other faction AIs so far have also mostly been peaceful with one lonely, poorly executed sneak attack after 17 hours. Mind you I did play the highest difficulty.  In the end the game has a good science part but is lacking strongly in the fiction department. There is very little material for natural story telling to emerge, all previous Civ games had this in spades, even Alpha Centauri had much more going here.  So I do like the game and I will play it some more in multi player, but at it's current state it kind of hard to recommend. If you haven't played Civ5 yet, get the complete edition. It has much more to offer at a better price. If you're a hardcore civilization player you might still want to get Beyond Earth but be aware that you will have to wait for more expansions to get anything as deep as G&amp;K/BNW.",

            "review_text": "Just plain BAD. I love 3x/4x games. I prefer turn based. I have owned every Civ for the PC. But this is by far the worst.  Where to begin.   1. How about boringly blah landscape. It is supposed to be an alien world, I get that, but tundra, desert, grassland, they all look the same. Yes it didnt look like Earth, but the 'ohhh its an alien world' effect only lasted for mmm 3 turns. The only features that stick out are the unusable mountains, craters, and canyons. YEP, in 2015 we can mine tunnel though, and live in mountains and canyons but NOT in the future. SAD.   2. Technological advancements and buildings that were designed by Dr Seuss. Congratulations! You spent 10 turns developing augmentation and now you get... no silly you dont get to pick from a tree of upgrades to the human body... you get I dont know what. Seriously? You have technology like augmentation that is a dead end. Where are the cybernetically enhanced soldiers? Where are the bionic spies? Ok Fine. Augmentation doesnt actually do anything.  What about the host of other techs that let you build buildings? Dont know. No idea what the clinic looks like, no idea what my city looks like at all. No city zoom, no distiction. Congrats you built another shapeless flugggeringlymenermadeitupsees building. Lets build another.   3. Sluggishly slow and boring warefare. Inevitably each CIv Player has to admit that war is the ultimate objective. Yeah there are other ways to win in civ. But domination is the most fun.   Can anyone tell me why fighter jets in the future have a hard time bombing the next city over? They run out of fuel before they get there!!! That is why. Fighter planes are the WORST unit to build in the game for offensive combat. In Civ 5 bombers are great at lowering the defenses of cities so that my troops canconquer more easily. But in this game somehow the tech has regressed, not only do they get shot down most of the time when you bombe a city but they usually dont even have the capacity to reach your neighbor's cities. What a joke.  Exactly where are the space based OFFENSIVE weapons? None you say... MMMMmmmm its amazing how you can build levitating tanks and clone giant bugs but we cant send fighters or drones into space to attack elsewhere on the planet.   Ground warefare is no better. If I were to name the type of ground warefare in this game I would call it SLOWTSKRIEG. It takes FOREVER for land troops to get from point A to point B. Ok walking troops (because in the future we are energy conscious and our soliders walk and ride bikes to the battle field) I understand have a speed limit of 7mph. Why are levitating tanks limited to 25? Ohh and again, levitating tanks cant go over canyons or mountains but they can go over water. As if the Daleks we afraid of mountains.  Naval warefare.... WOW bad bad bad. Carriers can only carry 1 fighter??? No subs, no battleships, no drone ships, just destroyer things and carriers that both are powered by your grandfather's wheelchair motor.   Missile tech..... What? Never heard of missiles before? But we shoot solar collector satelites into space.... Yes those are on rockets... cant we but a warhead on a rocket and shoot it at our enemies? No? Ohhh okay....   Thats right, there are no missiles in this game. No long range drones, no cruise missiles, no nukes, no missiles that can bomb more than 1 space from my fleet to attack that city and give support that is only 3 tiles in land.   Future tech for weapons sucks!!!  4. No cinematics, no cut scenes, nothing but some annoying chick to read a 15 second passage and a still picture to greet us when we win the game.  HOLY HELL! I just spent hours of my life getting the signal beam up, conquering the last enemy capital, growing a hippie LSD trip flower and that is my reward!!!!!  How about when I meet another civ for the first time, or we settle a disputem, or build a wonder you show us something cool that begs me on to keep playing. So some gamers dont care for the cinematics, give us the option to turn them off then. Dont completely remove them.   Why dont you guys hang it up? Every time you put out another Civ game it gets worse and worse. Either put the time and energy into making it a great game or give the series over to someone who will.",

            "review_text": "I enjoy this game a lot, and I do not understand some of the anger it gets from others. Reading the negative reviews I get the impression that it's biggest sin is that 'it wasn't groundbreaking enough'.  If you played and enjoyed Civ V, you will find a lot familiar in here in a much more streamlined package. Hex grid movement, basic diplomatic communications, and a familiar build system with a more intuitive flow to it's interface. They also have an expanded espionage system from the Brave New World expansion of Civ V, and the Virtues system is a more long term variation of the social policy mechanic.  And why change things too much? If they did, likely the fan base would have even more outrage. In the end it was smart to have this basic and solid entry game to see what people wanted more and less of, then focus continued development into the future DLC. Frankly, that's just the nature of big budget game development these days and Rising Tide is showing that it is likely going to work out well.  What's great: The build system is smooth and leaves very little learning curve, and gone are the requirements for prerequisite buildings to make other buildings available. Combat units will auto upgrade as you advance your Virtues, meaning no tracking through lists seeing who's still stuck in the bronze age when everyone else has machine guns. The alien life forms feel much more intimidating early game than barbarians in Civ V, and mid game can still be a force to consider when making plans.  What needs improvement: Exploration feels like it's going to need continued work, though they will be getting new content in Rising Tide. Diplomacy also will be a welcome overhaul in the DLC, as the offer of 'favors' from other leaders never felt like something I was able to use effectively in my games. There are no 'luxury goods' like in Civ V, which made diplomatic negotiations more interesting in my opinion, but there may be a new consideration in the new diplomacy system. I also feel the Orbital layer of the game is under-utilized, and it seems like more could be done there than just the satellite units in future expansions.  As a sci-fi junkie I highly recommend this game. I'm not a long time Civilization fanatic, but I have respected the series for a long time, so take my opinions as you will.",

            "review_text": "As the first expansion to Sid Meyer’s Civilization Beyond Earth, Rising Tide is not only a great addition to the game, it is an essential addition that completes the experience of colonizing on other planets.  The premise, well… after the initial wave of great colony ships departed Earth – we finally managed to screw things up and Earth is no longer viable as a home planet with resources diminishing quickly – more ships depart for the new found home planet.   New factions arise and take the place of governments and countries. And of course, as a species we aren’t all that good at learning from our mistakes and play nice, we land on the new planet to wage war on the local dominant species (technically we’re the aliens not them) an insect-fish hybrid, and of course ourselves.  The local species are truly a peaceful lot that operate within a hive-mind. They’re actually quite peaceful and won’t attack you until you attack them. If you screw with one though (remember hive-mind?) you’ve basically declared war on the whole family.  In addition to getting along (or not) with the locals, there’s still that tricky bit of maintaining relations with other factions. Each faction’s leader is… how do I put it… very culturally distinct and iconic (I tried…) and has their own views on how cities and the planet should be run – through careful economic superiority, scientific breakthroughs or martial warfare. Play nice or risk having war declared on you… or vice versa.  One of my favourite aspects of the game is the number of upgrade and research options. The scientific web might be daunting to look at at first, but completing research unlocks new units and gives you options to upgrade old ones.  Depending on your line of research, you can also develop hybrid units that merge the local species with humans and tech to produce awe-inspiring troops – if it isn’t for war, what is it good for?The character models give the units lots of well… character. Here’s a good rundown on the different affinities – Harmony, Supremacy and Purity.  Finally, sending your troops out to explore can provide great benefits – especially when you come across a ruin or a dig site and uncover an artifact. Artifacts allow you to discover new tech and benefits – basically another reason to go stir “alien” nests.  Like most Civilization games, some might find the turn-based gameplay slow… but hey they built a whole franchise that way. Prepare to spend many, many immersive hours on Rising Tide.  Rising Tide, more than an expansion, feels to be the missing element that Civilization: Beyond Earth lacked. I wouldn’t call it an add-on as much as an essential.  *This review was first published on justsaying.ASIA*",

The unit upgrades are a nice touch, though nothing revolutionary for a SciFi 4x game. The tech tree is a mess from a UI perspective, but the numerous technologies and lack of focus on completing all of them to instead strategically completing only the ones that will bring you victory is a refreshing change in the context of a Civilization game.

Pros: --A really nice new interface --New challenging game mechanics --A New dimension that game's adopted  through it's succumbence from other influencing  franchises set in future (though the other games do it...differently)  Cons: --Price...obviously --Emotionless leaders --I would like more Colonies (Civs) that you could play with...  9/10 - I really love it.

            "review_text": "If the idea of settling down on another planet feels exciting and cool this is a game well worth getting. The production quality - voice acting, music, visuals - is luxurious and highly immersive. The gameplay finds a nice balance of accessibility and challenge, resulting in something very addictive.  In the same way Master of Orion is a lighter take on 4X space games, the Civilization games - which inlcude Beyond Earth - are a lighter take on 4X games like Hearts of Iron, Europa Universalis, and Victoria 2.   'Yes' it is not as deep and complex as Alpha Centauri, and 'yes' the mechanics are similar to Civilization 5, however these are not good enough reasons for dismissing the game. There is enough complexity to make the game very challenging, and since when is 'being similar to' such a big crime ?   It is hypocritical to argue Beyond Earth is 'too similar' to Civilization 5, while not arguing that Civilization 5 is 'too similar' to Civilization 4, or Civilization 6 to 5. It's faulty reasoning. They belong to the same franchise, so of-course they share some strong similarities. In the same way the Total War, StarCraft and Hearts of Iron iterations are similar in their gameplay. Not to mention franchises like Dark Souls, Elder Scrolls and F1.  Also worth keeping in mind is that Apha Centauri was not an official Civilizations game, whilst Beyond Earth actually is. So naturally Beyond Earth will have more in common with a Civilizations game than Alpha Centauri.   While the gameplay mechanics in Beyond Earth are similar to other Civilizations games, it's still a completely different game. For one thing Beyond Earth is a sci-fi game, it does not take place on Earth but on alien planets filled with alien life, where you build and research futuristic stuff. This alone should make it highly distinct from other Civilizations games, yet even this obvious fact seems lost on some reviewers.  The bottomline, you might like Beyond Earth if:  1) the idea of a 'lighter' Alpha Centauri, or a Centauri + Civilization fusion, sounds fun ... or 2) you want a 4X game that's highly immersive and quick to learn ... or 3) like me you don't think there is enough of these planet-colonizing games around",

These are my major observations thus far:  PROS: - ALIENS! These replacements for barbarians make the game far more interesting, since they start off (mostly) neutral and come in all shapes, sizes, and strengths. Your choices may affect their behavior toward you. - New tech web is really sexy, lets you branch out in whatever manner you see fit. - As the game progresses, you can choose from the three Affinities (Harmony, Purity, and Supremacy) to shape your victory path and unit appearances/types. - Spying is also more interesting. I STOLE SOMEONE'S CITY WITH A SPY!! - You can find resource pods scattered around the map, like ruins but better. Also, excavating discoveries with your explorers can bring you interesting and helpful loot.  MEH: - The leaders themselves. I get that this is supposed to be different from the historical civ games (read: 'Beyond Earth'), but the new leaders lack the interesting quirks and backgrounds that made the previous leaders so enjoyable. Diplomacy is interesting but can still give you a headache. - The graphics are okay, but nothing really unique compared to civ 5. Different textures, same feel. - Stuff generally takes a lot longer to research and produce. Gives you time to enjoy each 'phase' of the game, but often gets a bit boring. - Miasma on many tiles adds a new layer of difficulty, but becomes largely obsolete late-game. - Satellites are neat but aren't as useful as they could have been.  CONS: - AI is still very dumb. It seems a bit better in Rising Tide, but: - RISING TIDE IS TOO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EXPENSIVE CONSIDERING HOW LITTLE IT ADDS. The aquatic cities are cool though. - Cities start off as little outposts that you form, but they can take a long time to become cities and in the meantime you can't do much with them. - Resources sometimes spawn VERY far apart, meaning that you won't often be able to have a close-knit empire.  The game really isn't as bad as a lot of people like to say, but I think it's safe to say that much of the enthusiasm was killed off by the lack of progress with AI and, more recently, the release of Civ 6. The DLC, Rising Tide, makes the game more enjoyable, but I personally don't think it's worth $30 more on top of the original game's price. Despite its shortcomings, Beyond Earth is a reasonably good game, though I would recommend either getting it (and the DLC) while it's on sale or bullying someone else into buying it for you.",
