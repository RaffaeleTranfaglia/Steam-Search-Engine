The quicktime stuff really doesnt bother me and its done pretty well. it doesnt feel the same as other quicktime things from other games. the timing matters alot if you want to get those perfect combos and such. Its easily overlooked if you arent TRYING to pick at it. after playing thru the whole game id say thats what most people did was pick at that as a sticking point but its honestly just a weak argument. the graphics are out of this world AWESOME. there were tons of times when the cutscene ended and i had no idea it was over and i was like 'why is he just sitting there!' then i realize im playing LOL.  i really enjoyed the story too. Probably the closest thing ever to the movie Gladiator as a game and then some!  just over a really enjoyable experience that surprassed my expectations and made me forget all the whiny console kids hate on this game.   also the COOP is REALLY FUN!!! like it was super surprising how good it is. i played with random ppl i was matched with and had an awesome time too. just dont get separated by a lot or you will be in trouble when one of you needs help. it is COOP mode so that should be obvious tho.  To me id say if you like action games or hack-n-slash or roman arena type of stuff then you will love this game!",

            "review_text": "I bought Ryse Son Of Rome during a sale for 4.99, I had been following the game since the release of it on the Xbox One back during its launch, and was delighted when I heard it was coming to PC. I am a huge fan of Roman History and had always liked Sword Fighting Games so this was a win win.   Pros:   The Game looks and runs Beautifully, It ran at most of the time 60FPS at 1080P with all settings maxed out on a GTX 980 Ti.  I loved the story, although it is only 8 chapters long, Marius's story is inspirational, and Voice Acting is well done.  Combat is Brutal and fun to watch.  Good Soundtrack.  Formation during missions is awesome and realistic.  Upgrades for more brutal executions.  Focus Mode.   Online COOP.   Cons: The game does suffer from FPS dips, especially in more densely vegetated areas or when surrounded in combat by multiple enemies.   Multiplayer rank 200 is a grind to get to.  Overall I really enjoyed Ryse Son Of Rome and am really happy that I got the chance to play and experience it on the PC.  My Review Score:  9 OUT OF 10, FANTASTIC GAME, DEVELOPERS DESERVE PRAISE FOR THE TIME AND EFFORT PUT IN.",

The graphics were really impressive, the story was actually pretty cool and pretty accurate to the timepiece, the characters were believable, the voice acting (and especially the main character) was amazing, the combat was intense. All around good game. In fact, the combat seemed to be the major complaint I read about the game and I really dont see it. the basic parry attack system was simple but effective and those executions....those were flat out awesome and never got old! The actual game length for me was about 8 hours, and I think co-op could easily extend this by at least as much.  I really recommend trying this one out. Despite the negative press upon its Xbone release, I can say for certain that the game is stellar at this point in time and well worth your consideration.   An all around solid 8 out of 10 for me. I would and will play this one again.",

            "review_text": "A short beautiful and cinematic eye pleaser that fails to deliver in just about every other way.   There's a lot of things I didn't like about this game but when it boils down to it, I enjoyed the presentation enough to overlook it's many pitfalls. This is a mini-series more than it is a game. Every level is a perfectly constructed stage. Every piece of action and each event is designed to keep pushing you forward at great pace. Every time the camera is out of your control whether in game or in cutscenes the directing and cinematography is perfectly framed. The actors, both digital and vocal, are amazing. The audio aspects are top notch. All of this keeps you engaged to the end. But you're stuck playing entirely on someone else's terms. You're merely a pawn of the video games Gods in this one.   The pace of the game was superb. Beyond the atrociously bad and repetitive boss fights you never had time to breathe. That only had one drawback because unlike other games in a similar vein you never felt encouraged to just take it all in. The environments and levels are meticulously filled with beauty but save for some very few uninteresting collectibles you have no desire to ever just admire and explore your surroundings. You're splashing headlong down an ever tightening funnel. Which is well and good as the pace builds adrenaline.  Adrenaline that you instantly dump upon getting into a battle. I can't imagine anything but using a controller on this one but combat basically amounts to the dreadful 'timed button mashing'. No combos, no skill required, no nuance. Just timing and patience. Dull dull patience. The only glimpses of satisfaction are quick-time event finishers... That get old fast. But those finishers are used to replenish health, or earn extra focus/damage/XP. So you have to do them like the pawn you are. Endlessly. I'd say I spent, conservatively guesstimating, at least thirty minutes of my five hours thirty minutes of playtime watching finishers. Gruesome and awesome finishers admittedly, but again, they got old. You can count the ultra-basic standard enemy types on one hand. And that same count is the amount of models you're presented with. No gear or clothes change ups, just endless barbarian clones for slaughter. The fat ones all have shields, the tall ones all have the same fur cloak, etc. Then the bosses... Oh the bosses. They're just drawn out versions of the standard hordes. But you can't be offensive. You just have to wait your turn to strike. Repeat with a block or dodge until your number is called, then strike. Only on their terms. Circle around and hit em from behind? Nope, they will have none of that! Afterall, you are but a pawn.   The story itself is average but engaging. With how much you have to turn your brain off for the combat anything more from the story would of made this more of a heartbreaking missed opportunity. So I was satisfied with the story. Especially with the very fitting ending. It was beyond appropriate for this game experience. But while the story serves as the force that keeps pushing the pace, its the visual experience that is all that you're after here. With any other aspect you have to keep your expectations reeled in quite tight. I enjoyed the parts where I was along for the ride, and trudged through the bad gameplay to get to the next part of the ride. Of course opportunities were missed and I definitely do wish the gameplay was more than it was.   I didn't like the menus, there's a technical complaint or two with how it ran on my toaster, I didn't even try keyboard and mouse, nor did I try multiplayer, and I'm sure something else is escaping me as well. And my recommendation is only if it is on sale for &lt; $4.99USD or bundled. But. I do recommend it simply for the direction or cinematography or whatever you want to call it.",

(summer sale price was €5) The game itself looks amazing, the graphics are really stunning! It plays pretty well, easy to learn but, takes time to master... Cinematic story-driven hack and slash is what this game kinda is. While the story is decent, 7/10 if u ask me. It is really short! around 5 / 7 hours if you lucky. The coop is fun if u ever can find someone else to play whit. In the end Ryse leaves you hungry for more... But not really delivers that in the coop experience.

It is, after all, a Crytek game, and Crytek games are, the way I see it, interactive tech demos, more or less entertaining. And this one is just that: entertaining. It also looks stellar, it runs good and plays good (I'm using an Xbox One controller), the story is nonsensical (something about a roman soldier..?) but is still well executed. The game is linear and short, which is GOOD in this case! Any longer and the gameplay would have overstayed it's welcome.  If you like Arkham-style combat and find the setting interesting you'll enjoy this game.  Go for it!",

Great Story/campaign Graphics are really good Fluid and smooth combat Protagonist is very likeable Facial expressions and voice acting done well Gore!! (Killing blows make you feel awesome)  Cons: Graphics Stutter (not the GPU, but have seen a lot of people complain about the same thing)  The game’s story isn't very long but that can be seen as either good or bad, but in my case this was perfect. The story of a roman soldier and his quest for vengeance, through killing hordes of enemies to leading your fellow Romans in tactical attacks…this is what kept me engaged during the entire campaign.  Overall, this was a very enjoyable game! Definitely a must get next time it is on special, even if it is to just add it to your already increasing backlog. ",

            "review_text": "If you're a history buff in love with the period of Roman Empire, this game might be a bitter piece of entertainment for you. Even more than the 'Gladiator'. You can't pinpoint any dates in the game. All we know, is that the action takes place between AD 60 (when the Iceni rebellion took place) and AD 90s ( Nero, who looks in this game as an old man in his sixties, in fact died in 68 at the age of thirty).  But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Nothing in this game makes any bloody sense. Eboracum is called York, despite the modern name wasn't in use until well into Norman Period.. but that's fine, because the fortifications of York look very medieval - but don't worry, barbarians are fully equipped with advanced siege engines - so the odds are even!  I could go on with countless examples of historical faux pas, but let me just say one thing: When you see Boudica riding a war elephant.. you know you reached the bottom of fanficition bucket and below there are only My Little Pony ships and HBO's Game of Thrones.  Now, that said - the game is fun for what it is. It's a simplistic button-masher with QTEs (I normally don't like them, but in this game, they work fine). Combat is simple, but performing executions is very satisfying - especially if you do your QTEs right. If you won't - that's fine too, but you'll get lower bonus. There are only few, if any, moments in the game when failing a single QTEs will kill you. Fighting system lacks depth and even ability to level up your skills doesn't improve that.  You can master the combat system within one afternoon... and that is pretty much how much it will take you to finish the game, sadly.  That is a big, massive let down. The game is surprinsgly short. Chance to build up the character relations and thicken the plot is squished within experience lasting but few hours. You get bare-bones of what seems to be an interesting story arc of gods playing their games using mortals as pawns. That's pretty much the only interesting thing in this whole storyline, everything else seems to be glued together by someone who had barely any clue about writing scripts.  While the game follows, to the letter, the Three Act Structure, it falls short on each of them - exposition leaves you clueless about what is really going on, second act fails at creating compelling character development and the climax feels artificial because you have barely any emotions towards main antagonist... whoever he might be (I'm still not sure...).     At the beginning Marius sees the Barbrians as the threat, towards mid-game you're introduced to Boudica and Oswald (... seriously? Saxon names in 1st century AD. How about Caratacus? Yeah, he wasn't Boudica's father, but we already established nobody cares about historical facts here...). And then the perspective changes - Roman leaders, sons of Nero, turn out to be half-crazy butchers and Britons start to look like people who just defend themselves from injustice. Marius goes on a rampage killing both sons of Nero and eventually goes after Nero himself.. (but not before killing Boudica leading attack on Rome) just to be introduced in the last scene to the true villain who was behind all the events from the very start - Aquilon, god of north wind who wants to destroy 'civilization' (WHAAAT?). You can see why building up emotions towards antagonists is so difficult - there are too many of them and they have too little screen time.     I blame mostly the lenght of the game for all of this - given more time for Acts I and II you could have much more compelling build up to the climax - which actually feels like the most expanded part of the game, as you deal one by one with all antagonists you barely care about.  Ryse shines however, when it comes to voice acting - which somewhat midigates medicore (at best) plot. Game has very distinct, pleasant artstyle and atmosphere - something between Lord of the Rings and 300. Put together with great care for details, the game can make you stop and look at the world around. Graphics are very good, with superb motion capture. End result is more than just sum of it's parts - as you get extremely well executed scenes where every detail is taken care of. You can watch cut-scenes with finger over F12, making screenshots of some of the most outstanding scenes and locations. It can almost make you forget the story is laughable... almost.  All in all, Ryse is a title that you should approach with low expectations towards historical fidelity and depth. It's good piece of mindless enterteiment for few hours. And that's all it really is.  You can get few more extra hours out of the game with the multiplayer and skirmishes, but all in all, the game doesn't change much - you just fight same enemies in different places with arena mechanics.   I give the game cautious recommendation - but buy it only if it's on sale. Don't pay more than 10 dollars/euro - the game isn't worth more. I don't recommend it to people who are historical puritans, who loves realism and/or deep combat.",

Aside from the short campaign and the somewhat repetivie takedowns, this game has a great storyline that I personally loved and it makes the game totally worth it. This isn't so much of just a straight up play through, it is half playing, half watching. It has about two and a half hours worth of cutscenes.

While this sounds really negative and might convince you not to buy this game is understandable, but hear me out for a sec.  I definitly don't recommend this game for the full price. Buy it in a sale when it's really cheap, because most people won't make it past 10 hours of playtime (this includes the whole singleplayer storyline).  However for some achievementhunters like myself, the game (and definitly the multiplayer stuff) might stay fun for a longer time. In my opinion the multiplayer arenas were fun for a while, but the challenges stay the same so they can get boring fast. The only part of this game I really enjoyed was the survival co-op gamemode, it's quite challenging and can really test your skill. It's only unfortunate that it's the least popular gamemode or it takes the longest to pair me at least.  The biggest problem with this game however is how it bugs out all the time and it doesn't do what you want or the camera gets stuck in weird angles or the animations take longer than they seem to (but maybe that's some lagg from my computer). And these problems only get worse if you play on legendary mode. Normally you can play the game at an easy pace, but on legendary mode (when you're threatened a lot of the time and your moves are more critical) it bugged me a lot how it seemed the game was screwing me.  So yeah, to end this review I'll say that overal I enjoyed playing this game and will play some more co-op in the future. Most of my problems were with the singleplayer and legendary mode, although the story itself is pretty decent (only really short). Another problem could be that the gameplay is a bit repetitive, but this will depend from person to person. So I DO recommend this game, only not at full price!  Thank you for reading.",

If that's not your thing, pass. The storytelling is one of the best I've ever seen in a game. The story itself is solid enough, even if it does get a little weird, but the way they tell the story, the cinematic experience, is what makes it.

I feel as though I am in a film (which is as the developers wanted us to feel) with the story line taking me from one scene to another, totally absorbed in the moment... and that moment always leads to extreme violence and death, and there are many of Rome's enemies to deal with and kill. Yes, on the down side there could be more and varied AI warriors to despatch, many look the same, but the whole feeling of being part of it all as the story unwinds, plus the amazing graphics and detail of the characters and landscapes really shine through.

Gameplay: Not its strongest feature but on the whole an adequate system which feels similar to other games in this genre. The upgrade system was not overly well explained nor seemed to have any impact on the game. Some of the boss fights were frustrating with having to wait for enemy bosses to attack so you can dish out a 1-2 riposte. Any other attacks are autoblocked, making the fights slow and a waited out rather than an actual challenge or enjoyable experience.  Graphics: This is obviously were the game really shines. Texture detail on the whole is remarkable however this is sometimes let down by the meshes not being as smooth as they could be on some of the characters. (I could be wrong about this). The Lighting, shadowing, water and fire effects, sky and clothing movement is all top notch however.   Overall: An enjoyable romp through some viseral and eyecatching combat, let down by the short and narrow story along with poor boss fights. ",

It's also not that long, but that's not necessarily a negative, given the nature of the game. My overall rating for the game is 7/10. It was definitely worth the $10 I paid for it, and I think it wouldn't be a terrible buy for even $20, but I wouldn't pay any more than that.  On paper it seems like I'd hate the game since it's a pretty repetitive hack and slasher, but somehow it ends up being more than the sum of its parts. I thought the combat did a good job of capturing the brutal and visceral nature of close combat. It was fun enough to play, even if it was pretty repetitive. The story was also solid, and I think that helped the game a lot. It held your attention and kept you motivated to fight through each part. Had the story been bad, I'm not sure how enjoyable the overall game would have been.   The graphics were also pretty good, and felt like they captured the feeling of ancient Rome, although at some points the architecture was pretty clearly exaggerated compared to reality. The environments are definitely not 100% historically accurate, but I could accept the areas where creative license was taken. The Arena section, in particular, was pretty cool. The levels were all totally linear, but that seemed to work alright for this game.   The upgrade system to me seemed like it served very little purpose. In my opinion, you might as well have automatically leveled up. I bought upgrades throughout the game, and they probably helped, but nothing I purchased had an obvious impact on the game play. I didn't even spend all my exp toward the end of the game, as I simply forgot to do so, and it really didn't seem to make much difference (granted at that point I was already pretty upgraded). It just seemed odd to me that they went to such effort to add an XP system, but then didn't really do much with it.   Lengthwise the game was pretty short. I estimate that it only took me about 6 - 6.5 hours to play through. Steam says 7 hours, but I know there was some AFK time in there. That being said, I think the length was actually a positive, because the game play could not have held my interest for more than another hour or two. If the game was 8 hours instead of 6, I doubt I'd have gone away with such a positive impression.   Overall, my biggest complaint is I feel the game could have been so much more than what it was. I think they had a solid core idea with the combat, and the story/setting, but they should have expanded on it somehow. I'm not sure exactly what direction I think they should have taken things, just that they missed the boat somehow -- the story and setting had a lot more potential than what the game ultimately delivered.",

The combat system is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, and is suprisingly easy to get into. My only complaint is there are some issues with the keyboard and mouse controls which does lead into some embarssing situations during combat.   Graphically it is well detailed and a very good looking game, with some animation issues being the only complaint here, now one serious side note is that it uses colour halo to highlight your targets and to inform you which button you need to use. While this does make it more immersive then other games that rely on QTEs, this can be an issue for those with any degree of colour blindess.

Fell in love with the story, can't really put it into words here, but it's very touching. Although, what bothers me pretty much are the mechanics (technological advancement) in some of the things in the game are pretty modern and was not made yet back in the days..you know, a mixture of modern scent and the old Roma was played as a gimmick.   I didn't like how Nero was portrayed, but that was just my opinion, it didn't ruin the game. It would be great if there's more unique units in the game. When you battle with the babarians for too long you will recognize their faces. They should have created more faces and stuff for the NCP, it's not that important, but worth keeping as a side note. The combat is pretty much like a hack slash..but you'll have to think well of your approach before commencing a stupid approach on the boss and high level enemies. Overall?

Good game with lots of depth with simple controls, and good story telling. Although, the skill system is pretty pointless because you get enough points to unlock them all. Would have been better to have a system where you must sacrifice choices.  In terms of gameplay, the game has some performance issues with stuttering in some high graphical areas (this has been experienced with players across all computer spectrums, from low-end to high-end). That can be ignored to some extent, but quite annoying. No fix yet (since 2014).  If you are a collection or achievement type of person, the game has many collectables. It also rewards players for exploration so you will always get something other than fighting around (beware the game is still going to be combat related, treat this like a side dish rather than the big meal).  The combat is simple and elegant, unlike other fighter games where combos require multiple button setups, the game focuses on timing and usage of perks. So anyone can get into the game, learn it quickly, but hard to master.  Multiplayer, does not have many players, so do not expect getting CO-OP matches or what not quickly. But still enjoyable for playing with friends (not so much for single players unless you want to be on the leaderboards).  Music is amazing and probably made the game a lot stronger than it was. Many times the music adds a layer emotion that attaches you to the character or makes connections to yourself. (So play with headphones or a good sound system)  Visuals, I am not much of a visual type of person. But graphical setups and scenes were good and well done. The game brings you through several environments and show off the Crytek Engine like deep green jungles, the english channel, the streets of Rome, and dark dense forests. I really enjoyed the invasion scene with the boats and fighting on the streets of York.   Story, some characters were pointless in the story. The gods are a good example because they did not have any depth other than being plot to forward the story. Most of the antagonists or villains were under developed and just silly with some exceptions in good character design.   For example, Commodus, Nero and Basillius could have been any spoiled rich kid with a superiority complex. Nothing interesting about them.   Characters that were good, Boudica, King Oswald and Vitallion. Their character shines out without plot and the player can make judgements about their lives without the game giving it to you.  (On the fence with the main character, his personality goes all over the place, from loving son to revenge driven solider, to vengeful spirit and to defender of Rome.) There is no core values or spirit in the character, he is pretty empty with goals that drive him. His entire journey to fight was based on revenge from the beginning of the game until the invasion of Rome.   His character really fleshes out during the end of the game where he defends Rome with Vitallion, but other than that, there are many disconnects in his character from the beginning to the end of the game.   In other words, his character goes from a naive revenge driven son to an honourable hero of Rome within one day. That is a pretty big personality change that no real human being truly experiences. Bring it down a notch.   Overall, the game gets a 8/10 on my list.",

I'd like to see that concept in more games.   Actual combat is interactive and feels a bit like Shadow of Mordor and the Batman games, but the commander style gameplay is unlike anything out there and very fun. Graphics are beautiful, storyline is rich and immersive with solid voice acting. I'd say this game is worth about 30-40 dollars.   Cons: Regular combat gets slightly monotonous after you get used to being entertained by all the interactive fatalities.

Pros: +graphics (still one of the best looking games ever) +setting +simple fighting mechanics (con for some people, but I enjoyed it)  +/- Story - it's not too complicated but you cannot say it's not there. I'd love another game which would use what Ryse set up with more complex story and which would introduce some choices affecting the outcome. There is so much potential here (ancient times, the size of the Roman empire back then which would allow locating the action in varied environments, gods who meddle whith the history of the mortals etc.).  Cons: - not long enough  I bought it during the recent sales and would buy it again.",

The Roman atmosphere is present at all times through your avatar, the legionaires you command and dialogue during both play and the cutscenes. I am myself not that addicted to fighting games - but this game did not let me go. The easy to remember commands for attack/defense, together with different enemies these commands need to be utilized to get an attack in, made it a satisfying experience. The 'execution' gives a breather during combat, focusing on pressing the right button at the right time (with no real drawback other than less experience), while giving an awesome killcam.   When through the singleplayer campaign (took me ~8 hours), the multiplayer continues the fun by providing a 2 player coop fight/survival in the Colosseum. Choose your gladiator look (roman soldier, gladiator or maybe a singleplayer character?), dun equipment earned from arena fights and what God you wish to worship for each 'campaign', and reenact that campaign - just like we remember from the Gladiator movie.  With the low current sale price for another 2 days, a smart move is to buy now and don't regret later.",

Flowing between enemies with sword attacks, deflecting attacks and rolling out of the way is so much fun. Then to top it off with a satisfying execution with great sound effects and yells makes it even better.   What I really like about the combat is its more than just looking pretty with the execution moves; there is a level of depth and strategy to be had. Depending on how quickly you pull off the execution you will get more XP, health, damage, or fill up a bar called 'Focus' that stuns nearby enemies. However you can only select one of these to at a time when doing an execution, so you have to choose wisely in a matter of seconds which one would benefit you in the moment of combat.  I HIGHLY recommend playing this on the hardest difficulty that you can select when playing for the first time. The simplicity of the combat might be forgotten just because you are really trying to survive or you know that you only have so much health until you are killed.   If you don't find the combat that interesting you might find this game rather ok, since the bulk of the game is combat. The story might keep you engaged but I wouldn't cound on it.   PROS: + High production values + Very well animated + Great acting along with face and motion capture + Fantastic sound effects + Satisfying combat + The game looks amazing + The COOP modes are very fun  CONS: - Combat might get repetitive - Clunky aiming with spears",

The story isn't great by any stretch and is somewhat forgettable, but it fulfills its purpose. The gameplay was surprisingly not terrible, repetitive yes, but not as much of a QTE-fest as I had expected and the visuals are absolutely dazzling.

Good: -Amazing graphics, beautiful visuals and artwork, and some of the best motion capture I've ever seen. -The visceral brutality of the combat is satisfying, in a visceral, brutal kind of way. -Refreshing ancient Roman setting. -Entertaining main story that didn't take itself too seriously. -Stable. In an era of rushed releases, bugs, and patches, a game this complex not crashing on playthrough is refreshing.  Bad: -Too short for the price. -Repetitive battle sequences. -Absurdly predictable storyline. -Odd supernatural subplot that doesn't mesh well with the main story. -Gameplay is extremely scripted and linear. -Execution upgrades are purely cosmetic and completely pointless. This would be fine if there weren't so many of them. -You can button-mash your way through most of the quick-time events and the only consequence is a lower exp bonus. -Enemies are comprised of the same 3 or 4 models recycled over and over. -Some of the technology fudging is jarringly implausible (e.g. the emperor's panic room with push-button retracting stone doors, a la Assassin's Creed).

CONS: - Repetitive, I expected it to be from the games Xbox reception and ultimately it was although not as bad as feared. - I could deal with the quick-time cause I signed up for it but it was far more linear than I expected with poor attempts of collectables which stood out like sore thumbs if you even felt like bothering. - Theres little variety in the missions, you can sometimes order your men from two options, use missile like attacks, or use stationary crossbows but whilst the locations change the missions dont and for a recent major release its simply not good enough.  VERDICT? Ryse is shallow and should only be bought at a sale price however I knew what to expect, bought into it and thoroughly enjoyed the game.",

I'm running this on a Core 2 Quad 3.4, 8GB RAM (DDR2) and a 970GTX (Fantastic Card and great value). The beginning loads up into a cut scene to begin the story, so I'm sat there watching, drinking my coffee and then realised that I was being slowly hacked to bits by Barbarians, I thought it was still a frickin cutscene! The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, the attention to detail is immense without a single element of lag, fantastic work by the developers. Combat can be slightly frustrating, particularly against some of the later boss characters where you have to combine dodge, with perfect and I mean pin-point precision blocking moves followed up with a quick attack. Initially, the combat is great and the execution moves are a nice touch but just when it starts to get repetitive, the developers throw a few elements into the mix, like the scorpion artillery piece which really is a rapid fire machine gun (not entirely historically accurate) or commanding troops ducking behind shield wall formations at the click of a button whilst being fired on by archers. Their are some features of the game which blatantly copies other games such as focus (Think Max Payne and several other games of note) and some features which are don't really have much of an affect like the ability to build up your damage meter. Character progression is great being able to upgrade your execution moves and so on. My only gribe about this game is replayability, I finished the game in 2 days and now am looking for the next best thing. I have yet to try multi-player and will update this review when I do. Overal though, if you want a decent John Cena turned Roman Soldier meets Gears of War with the ability to chop off a barbarians arm with the swing of a sword, then this is game for you but don't expect to replay the story line because once done, the surprise elements are gone. 8/10",

Timing your combat action just feels right + Some voice acting and most music are fantasticly done +Amazing animations and great eye candy action cut scenes  -Range attacks feel wonky -Games combat feels repetitive -Not enough variety in enemies, It feels like I am fighting in the Clone Wars -Environments feel constricted -bugs",

The Aquila sails made me /rage, but other than that, I've found it pretty damn enjoyable. Of course, I've also been obsessed with Roman games (of which there aren't enough) since Rome Total War (the first one); So for me, it's a bit about being able to be on the ground level of the campaigns I run in Rome 2. Even if they're totally unrelated.",

Why is this game only 61 on metacritics it's beyond me in my opion it deserves much higher score. It's the best sword game I have ever played and the story in fully captivating. Keep in mind that its rather large gamewith around 26gig of data so just get prepared for it. There a lot of nice perks in this game at first I had struggle a bit with all of types of executions and charcter's personal details. Combat mechanics are a bit complicated at first but with time you realise that you can evade block or bash your opponents. During the executions your foes will flash yellow or blue at this point you should use the sword or use you shield to bash the enemy. I never manage to do that correctly untill the very last fight were you just have to to perfrom these perfectly to survive. While I was playing this game I couldn't stop thinking that it feels more like an epic mini series about ROME rather than just a game.  I would defintly recommend this game for other it's a 9/10 score from me. Thanks very much and enjoy the game. ",

It makes me feel as though I am playing one of the Batman games or playing an Assassin's Creed game. However it is also very different from the two.  The story is not short in my opinion, it was about 8 hours long and I was consistant through the whole story. I don't know about you but I definitely don't want a movie lasting 8 hours, and this game kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The story is amazing and very interesting. You have skills and executions to unlock throughout the storyline and there are secrets to unlock throughout the campaign.  There is a lot to do also even after the campaign. You have the multiplayer gladiator mode, which is one heck of a ride the entire time. You level up your gladiator aside a friend or with some other person from around the world and you either complete specific tasks with arena mode, or just full on massacre with survival. (Survival mode is free with the steam version) You get new armor and new potions to unlock and buy depending on what level you are. There are also hero skins to where you could be Marius Titus (Main character) General Commodus, Democles, even the Nanosuit 2.0 (Crysis) instead of your gladiator. (The Hero costumes are free with the Steam Version)  The game's graphics and just detail in general is breath taking, it is the only game other than Battlefield 4 I could not run on max settings, the effects and the facial features are just mind blowingly realistic. The environments, the enemies, weapons, just everything is so detailed. It's the coolest to see your enemy's facial expressions while you are in mid execution.

I had to restart from last checkpoint to resolve this.  - Getting stuck in certain areas where I had to just move around a lot to get out.  - Replayability is lackluster.   +- Biggest gripe is the redundant combat among reviewers. I never had an issue with this, though. God of War is all about hack-and-slash, and I enjoyed it. If you can get through that or any similar game, I think you can easily disregard the deja vue combat here. There are even certain enemies where their guard will need to be broken first, so minor strategies will be needed.   Multiplayer:   + Co-op with another player is addicting and, if you are focused on achieving the best execution kills you can get, competitive.  + Grind to buy in-game gear from armor/weapons to one time use potions using the in-game cash.  + Select a god from four choices to use his/her special abilities.   - Solo matches cannot be played unless connected online to Steam.   +- Matchmaking can be a chore.

The combat is reptitative - block, slash, slash. Wait for counter, slash slash. It's the same from the start of the game to the end. The upgrade system of health/focus/gain is pretty lame and there's no unlocks of special abilities. You get to use 4-5 weapons through the game but mostly ever use your default sword and shield. The QTE can be satisfying at times - similar to what Shadow of Mordor gives you. Mostly, it felt more like Warhammer Spacemarines just back in the time of the Romans. Voice acting is alright, but there isn't much to look forward to. Scenes are predictable, which isn't a bad thing if it's executed well. The game is better played on a controller. I used a M&amp;K which took a lot of getting used to as the keys are not mapped natively. You'll find yourself feeling rather awkward throughtout the game.   HOWEVER. The beauty of the game is just in it's stunning visuals. But the linear sequencing of each level without the ability to free roam again takes away from what could have been a very pleasing experience.   Multiplayer It's pretty much handling waves of the same enemies. There are options to upgrade armor through the purchasing of booster packs, but after having played the campaign, it leaves you with very little interest of more of the same combat.

There's some absolutely amazing scenes and graphics in this game, with some sweet roman formations and some basic tatical choices where you command your soldiers.  You fight using quick and strong sword and shield attacks, blocking and dodging until you get an enemy weak enough to execute. Then you see a fluid animation where hitting the right buttons gets you extra points. In the single player mission you choose the rewards your 'style points' are getting you and I mostly picked XP so I could get the upgrades.  The game 'thoroughly recommends' a controller but I tried it and found it was harder having the block button being pressed by the same thumb as my attacks and I kept fat fingering my blocks. I went back to kb/mouse after 20 minutes trying to give it a fair go.  I would suggest picking the harder difficulty unless you really struggle with timing in games.

I've been playing it hooked up to my TV in the living room and the visuals are truly cinematic.  Gameplay and story is what I expected. Straightforward, save Rome, kill everyone. It's well told and well presented - its a subjective assessment.  Combat is mechanically sound. Attacks and blocks need to be timed correctly.

I have not tried the multiplayer modes to any great degree, however they do look interesting. Your mileage may vary.   One criticism on the technical side is that NVidia have yet to release an SLI profile. However, even using just one of my Titan's allows fluid gameplay at max settings @ 1080p.",

First off, its made on cry-engine, which is honestly probably my favorite engine in existence at this time. The engine just helps to create such fluid and beautiful games, and Ryse is no exception. Besides being utterly stunning visually, the story is quite intriguing especially for history nerds like myself. The mixture of revenge, duty, and morality helps to create an interesting plot. The gameplay and combat are cool to me. One of the biggest complaints I've heard is that its all based off of quick time events, this is definetly true, but what's wrong with that? It looks spectacular, and although it is a little repetitive, I really enjoy the quick time events and the basic combat itself. There's also this cool coop multiplayer which is awesome, and will provide tons of playtime for you after the story is completed. Overall, I think this is a solid game, and wish that it would get a little more credit.  Story: 9/10 Combat: 7/10 Visuals: 9.5/10 Multiplayer: 8/10  Overall: 8.5/10 Cool game, wish they had put a little more into it, but good none the less.",

Mostly corridor segments yes, but the attention paid to flesh out environments with nice looking things is a good thing to see in my opinion. - Voice Acting is excellent, the characters really do feel unique in their own ways. - Personally I love the combat, slow motion kills always make me feel epic ;) - Multiplayer can be fun with friends. - Uhh... You get to be a badass Centurion? Pfft... Need anymore reasons?  Cons: - Story is quite short, not Force Unleashed short but not many levels all in all. - Enemy character models are limited, I swear I killed the same Barabarian 'bout 80+ times and in various locations! - I just wished there was more. I get the distinct impression that the dev got so immersed into creating something fantastic looking... they forgot to make more of it.",

            "review_text": "This is Call of Duty: Ancient Warfare -- a backhanded compliment if ever there was one.  Obviously, the emphasis is on melee weaponry, not ranged. Combat is very similar to the Arkham games, both in terms of presentation and mechanics. Attacks are telegraphed with brightly-colored icons above the attacker's heads, and a well-timed shield block will stagger the enemy, allowing for several hits. There are two sword attacks (light &amp; heavy) and one shield-bash attack, which does little damage but causes the enemy to drop his guard. The formula for killing an enemy with no shield is light, light, shield, heavy, shield, repeat if necessary. For an enemy with a shield, open with a shield attack instead, but otherwise, it's the same formula. There's room for adding a little variety just for fun -- I like lowering two enemies to execution level and then taking both out with one execution -- and there's a fun but basically unnecessary bullet-time mechanic called Focus, but it's a little too easy to fall into a wrote routine.  Lowering an enemy's health below a certain threshold makes a skull appear above their heads, indicating that you can press E to execute them. Execution involves -- hold on to something here, people -- quicktime events. But relax. First of all, they're dirt simple; ony two buttons (blue for sword, yellow for shield) are ever called for. You can handle two buttons. And if you can't, guess what? Hitting the wrong button doesn't fail the event, it just awards you a lesser bonus. Any quicktime event you can simply ignore with minimal consequence, won't feel that much like a QTE. Honestly, I hate QTEs, and put off buying this game just because they come up every 30 seconds. Now that I've played it, it's fine. It doesn't detract from my fun at all, and I thought it would make me ragequit. Just FYI.  There's a high cut-scene/gameplay ratio, and they are un-pausable and un-skippable. I usually hate that, too, but it's just so pretty that I loved kicking back and soaking it in. It's really, really beautiful. Your character, Marius (not the historical Gaius Marius, but probably loosely based on him) is extremely well modeled and animated.  It's very short and very linear. I didn't chase achievements, and took about 8 hours to finish the game. That's way too short for a full-price game, but I picked this up on sale for $15, and I think that's a perfectly fair price for 6-8 hours of gory, macho, dude-bro ancient-world magnificence. If you see it for that much or less, pick it up. It's jolly good fun. If it's not on sale, pick up the cheapest Arkham game you don't already own for a very similar experience with way more content, and Batman.  Also, Marius looks kind of like Clive Owen, if he were built like a linebacker, and Clive Owen is cool. So, there's also that.",

I have been looking at this title for quite some time and was glad when I saw it was on sale for about 13 bucks. I mustered up the courage and pulled out my crying wallet who had already been abused enough during the steam summer sale. I then clicked to install the game. My life moved on. I grew up, I had a family and retired at a ripe old age. By the time I retired and met my grandchildren, the game finally completed it's installation. I began to play.  I was very reluctant about the game but I always found gladiators and romans quite interesting and I always thought that it would be cool to play them in a game. I was right! However... I didn't give me that exciting moment that great games give you, so I was not yet hooked. I continued playing...  About 3 minutes into the game, I engaged in combat with some dude holding an axe. I thought to myself, this is gonna be interesting. To my great pleasure I chopped off his arm and his head.   11/10  Would Play Again...Will Play Again...Am Playing Again.",

This is a quick, yet fun romp through the brutal and bloody world of a master melee combatant in the form of a roman legionary. Very impressive on the graphical front despite its age, the gameplay is also solid and - dare I say the cliche - deceptively simple.  While the game does have quite a bit of allowance (I completed it on the normal difficulty setting in 5 hours), it really shines when you're playing it well. It has the seemingly now common fighting mechanic that you see across the Batman games and Sleeping Dogs, where timing matters quite a bit and things play out like a very hectic and bloody Simon Says. The name of the game is executions. Being able to switch out execution bonuses on the fly and reading your opponents is what makes this eye candy shine.  Five hours might make you think 'What is this crap!?!' - but you'd be wrong. CoD4: MW was over in the same amount of time, and in both these games the time is just enough to get the message done. The fighting is intense, rarely lets up, and gives you enough freedom that a second playthrough for myself is already on the horizon. I have yet to play multiplayer, but if it's any good as the single player at the visceral level, then I can't wait!  About the only negative I can give is that the ending... oh... I can figure why it was done the way it was done, but why? I hope this is not common thing that goes on.   8/10 - Did they really have to do that in the ending? Sure, it worked cinematically, but... - There's no way to put this, but... Summer's boobs.",

The combat is very fun and visceral. The two player co-op mode is TONS of fun. It's basically like being a gladiator. Survival mode is awesome, basically just endless slaughter. It works best if you have a friend to play with, but this is a game that is also quite playable with randoms, unlike many multiplayer games out there. The only drawback is that it can be hard to find someone to play with occasionally. The main campaign is very short I will admit. Of my 20+ hours played only about 9 have come from the single player story, the real meat of the game to me is in multiplayer. Would I recommend paying full price for this game? Hard to say. Like I said, I got it on sale for $13, but in retrospect it would have been worth the retail price to me. The average person would likely not get enough playtime out of this game to justify the $40 price tag, but if it you see it on sale for $20 I would not pass up a chance to fight FOR THE GLORY OF ROME!

The faces are very well done and the voice actors are so good that you can suspend disbelief and believe they are going through everything and you start to get attached to Marius.

            "review_text": "I heard a lot of bad things about this game and thus I always avoided it. The biggest complaint I heard was that it is reptitive. And I'm here to tell you that...it is.  But is that really a bad thing in and of itself?  CoD 4 was repetitive, but it was the environments and the tone set by everything going on around you that made the repetitive nature of the combat enjoyable. That's what Ryse is, it's repetitive, but the varied environments and scenarios, backed up by some absolutely incredible graphics, make it an enjoyable romp.  Pro's:  Graphics, obviously. This game is absolutely stunning. A demo piece for your PC if there ever was one. Facial animations, combat animations, physics, it's all top notch. I'm constantly taking screenshots. There's a moment where you're storming a beach with flaming arrows raining down from the sky in a cloud that absolutely floored me.  Combat. Yes, it's repetitive, but I, personally, find it fun. You wear your enemies down and then execute them via QTE. There are multiple executions you can unlock and I haven't grown tired of them yet. The damage physics are also cool, cuts appear on their bodies, their noses bust, it really feels like you're doing some damage.  Mission Variety. I haven't beaten the game yet, but so far I've fought on a palace wall, a market, a courtyard, a senate floor, and a rain soaked beach. I'm over an hour in, but I hear it's a 7 hour game.  Voice Acting. This game is extremely well acted, there really haven't been any lines that have rung false. Even the pre-combat speeches are rousing, like the opening to Gladiator via video game.  Cons  Story. It isn't anything special. Usual sword and sandals, 'I will have my vengeance' fare.  Camera. I fought with it a few times, especially when 4 or 5 guys were surrounding me. It has gotten stuck on the architecture and they've gotten a few cheap blows in on me because of it.  In conclusion  So far I'd give it an 8 out of 10. I dont' see that changing. This game is a really polished hack and slash with incredible graphics. It's fun. Something to boot up when you want some mindless fun.   Is it worth 60 dollars? No way. It's definitely worth 20. But right now it's 4.99 on the Steam sale and that's an absolute steal. Grab it! ",

            "review_text": "Just finished the campaign. I have not tried multiplayer but single player experience alone is worth the cost in my opinion.  Pros -Executions (like the slow motion action scenes in God of War). Marius, the protagonist, is magnanimous. He's genuinely a good soldier who just wants to defend Rome and make his father proud. But if you cross him, he will make you suffer. And I love it. I love it even more in slow motion. I love it so much I wish I knew how to better control which executions I use. I think it's based on your position relative to the enemy when you initiate the execution command. -Visuals. The detail is incredible. I love that you have fluid camera rotation out the box. As you do slow motion action scenes, you can usual move the camera around to take in all the surroundings. -Story Length. While the story is short with unsurprising plot twists, it's solid enough. The game is basically replaying the story of Marius becoming a soldier like his father leading up to the point where Marius is alone with the emporer (the game introduction). Most people like in long,complicated plots; but in my opinion they kept the story details brief and kept action as the focus. HUGE PLUS FOR ME. -Responsive controls. There's no lag. In fact, I find the control inputs to be quick and forgiving for an action game. You can put a last second block in when you should have gotten hit. -Multiplayer options. While I haven't played multiplayer, you have options to do several different modes including what looks like a co-op story mode, arena, and survival. I like that they give multiple options here. -Save Points. The game automatically saves. OFTEN. You can't manually save as far as I know but there'd never be a need to. You will always restart at the latest fight. And there is a lot of fighting :) .  Cons -Story length is a pro and a con. While Marius' story is certainly satisfying in the sense of what events take place and how he handles them, some of the supporting characters (namely the two not-so-surprising reveals near the end) did not have enough depth. I believe it's due to the pace of the story. The story could have easily been told in the same amount of time without those two characters included. In fact, I believe the whole story could have been focused on Marius, Vatticus? (the general Marius reported to), the emporers, and the barbians. Even the small details they give the barbarian female could have been left out because most of her dialogue is yelling. It's nothing meaningful. She's just mad and yells. A. LOT. Kudos to whoever voiced her because she at least sounds believable. -Control explanations. The game does introduce most of the controls. However, I do not remember them ever explaining what focus was. Maybe I missed that. Needless to say, you can play the entire campaign without using it. -Picking up projectiles. It is extremely rare that you have to stop and pick anything up. In most cases, it's to get spears. But for whatever reason, the hitbox for picking up spears is so small you often sit there spamming E while Marius does a dagger flip move instead of picking anything up. It's incredibly annoying because it breaks the flow of the otherwise smooth and beautiful game. And because the controls are so responsive, you'll probably dagger flip 3 times before realizing you're not going to pick up anything. -Execution difficulty. It seems like even if you don't input the executions correctly, Marius still wins the brawl. The only punishment I found from messing up execution commands is that I get less points. Seems like it would be more exciting to have the enemy break out of the execution if I mess up too many. But even if you get all the commands wrong, Marius will still kill the enemy.  TLDR: Get this game if you want to use a sword and shield to kill waves of people similar to God-of-War style. Keep in mind the plot is short but sweet. Ryse: Son of Rome is pretty much 60% action game and 40% movie with nearly seemless transitions between two parts.",

You run down a corridor field of play and enemies are presented to you, there is no scope for wondering away from the narrow field the game wants you on. It does try to give you limited scope for various tactics, usually amounting to going left or right. The graphics are still nice and run very well on my system. Sounds are good.  Main character is a little unlikeable.  My main complaints:  Yes as others have mentioned the enemies consist of: Easy enemy with no shield Enemy with shield who requires the break and then two hit combos. Enemy with no shield who does power hits and needs avoiding, followed by two hit combos. Large enemy with no sheild who does power hits and needs avoiding, followed by two hit combos. Bloody annoying enemy with two swords who requires hitting with the shield until he stumbles then two hit combos. The only variation is the outfit they have on.  Boss fights are variations on the above, you can generally hit only twice.  Coming from York i can tell you that it doesn't have waterfalls and mountains, it's mostly flat on two rivers, neither of which are the babbling brook type shown here.  QTE's are annoying, the last sequence in particular is terrible.",

Rome is crumbling under a barbarian assault, and Marius, a proud and decorated Centurion, is escorting Emperor Nero through his palace. One moment later, Marius is a fresh-faced greenhorn of the Roman army. As I progressed, I enjoyed learning more about how the circumstances became so dire. And despite the abnormal structure, the story was never difficult to follow even when it took a few unanticipated turns.  Ryse’s biggest issue is that not even halfway through its modest six-hour campaign, you’ll have seen and experienced a vast majority of your offensive options. Combat consists of basic hits, bashes, blocks, and heavy attacks.  Enemy variety does a bit of work to liven things up. Some foes are unblockable, some charge you, and some assault you with a flurry of dual-sword attacks. Dealing with them requires you to care about your blocks, attacks, and movements, which is fun until you figure out their repetitive patterns.  With my GeForce 980-equipped PC I played Ryse without a hiccup.",

The play is scripted but there is a decent amount of exploration to be done on the map and certainly a wealth of stunning views. The ambience and soundtrack add a lot to the awesome graphics quality while the modeling and attention to such details as latin grafitti, copious flowers and quality lighting effects take the presentation to cinema quality.   The fighting mechanism I found to be slightly redundant but ultimately satisfying. You can scythe through hordes of the lower level enemy characters until more advanced characters join the fray to keep things interesting. There are several featured showdowns against heavily armored and heavy attacking characters that require finesse and careful timing of parry or deflect keystrokes to defeat. The execution feature adds a welcome element of stragety to the melee combat too. After giving an enemy character enough damage you can execute by following the on-screen cues. The more accurately you match the slash or shield maul attacks in an execution the bigger bonus you get to choose from, either health, focus (for activating a temporary slo-mo butcher fest), damage increase (good for taking out enemies with huge health stats), or experience (I don't use that because you can get XP easily anyway).  There are short portions of the game where you lead your fellow Romans in testuodo formations and javelin hurling. FINALLY I would ***highly recommend*** setting the difficulty to centurion or legendary if you are an experienced hack'n'slash gamer.

Excellent game! 9.5/10",

The controls were easy to master and the levelling / upgraded system was easy to understand.  The story was immersive and i did enjoy it.  My biggest complaint? Too short!

I've really never seen anything like it before and I enjoyed it from start to finish. I definitely recommend it, especially at the low price it is going for these days, I picked it up for a steal.  Obviously there are some flaws to the game. Enemies are very repetitive and I found myself fighting the same few types of Barbarians with absolutely zero randomization to make them look like different people. For example, there is only one type of archer, one twin sword guy, one shield-holding guy, et cetera. Yes this can be helpful at times to tell them apart, but it still makes no sense and ruins suspension of disbelief.  The combat system is also repetitive, as you must perform a Q.T.E. on every enemy when killing them in order to reap the most bonuses. These executions become boring after a while. Overall the combat is really more about getting the Q.T.E.'s correctly timed than actually strategically dodging and hitting, etc.  Therefore, the game will never really live up to the great action RPGs like Dark Souls in terms of depth of combat, it doesn't even come close. You are always forced to use one weapon, one shield, and one type of armor for one speed. The combat is quite shallow and lacks any customization besides upgrading. Its greatest strength lies in the amazing setting and levels, even if I wish there was more time to explore them rather than just run through linear levels beating up bad guys. There was obviously a ton of work put into making the levels look realistic, but a lot of that work will probably go unappreciated due to the speed the game pushes you through the levels.",

I wish Steam had a 'depends' option as this game would easily qualify for that, however, it doesn't so as it stands I cannot recommend it. I only recommend this game when it is greatly discounted. At full price, it's just not worth it. I also highly suggest a controller to play this game.   Ryse: Son of Rome is an interesting game that takes place in Ancient Rome (duh!). You control Marius, a Roman centurion whose primary motivation is made clear within the first half hour of the game. I was looking forward to playing this game as I typically enjoy third-person combat games and Ancient Rome is a location that not many games have mined for material yet. Obviously, there are some good Rome-based games already in existence, but the cinematic action genre has not been done in this specific time period. I liked this game on some levels, disliked on others, and overall it's the absolute definition of a mixed bag.  Here's some basic stats followed by a tl;dr selection of Pros/Cons.  I have played only the story mode. I played at 'normal' difficulty and I have not touched any mode but the story. Steam has my playtime clocked at 6.3 hours, a very short experience needless to say. I may consider returning to it and playing the 'Legendary' difficulty in the future, but I have no interest in the multiplayer.  Pros + It looks absolutely outstanding.  + Has some of the best facial animations ever. + Voice acting is solid. Supporting characters are memorable due to this. + There are some very cool set pieces/big action sequences that are done really well. + Soundtrack is fitting.   Cons - Extremely short single player game. - Story is predictable, full of cliches, with some very laughable lines.  - Gameplay is very monotonous. - There is an extreme amount of quick-time events (QTE).  - The attempts to vary the gameplay are few and when there are variations, they're done weakly.  - Historical accuracy was not something the developers took seriously.  I really wanted to like this game more than I do sitting here after completing it. Crytek did an absolutely outstanding job in the graphics department. There are variations in setting that help the story plow along and again, look great. That said, I can find fault in just about every single one of my 'Pros' bar the looks department. There are numerous cutscenes and for the most part they look great so I enjoyed them in this respect. I also liked the way the game goes from cutscene to play almost seamlessly in some areas. Facial animations are great both during play and throughout.  Combat is of a very run of the mill design. Heavy attack, quick attack, shield attack, and block. The game is designed for consoles, so playing with a controller is HIGHLY recommended. There is little variation in enemies. At first glance, one of the cooler gameplay elements is in respect to executions. Virtually every enemy you fight (aside from bosses) will allow you at some point in the fight to pull off an execution. This involves the game entering a QTE and then you hit the corresponding button. If you hit the right button, you get more 'Valor' points, which is the in-game currency to upgrade Marius' health, focus, and combat. This mechanic gets extremely old rather quickly. Unfortunately, its wise to enter executions regularly because it allows you to fill up your focus bar to enter what is essentially a powered up mode where you're super powerful and super fast. I also find fault with the executions because there are only so many variations. Early on, you will see them all and then the QTEs start becoming a chore. Another aspect of combat is that actions are signaled to you using color, rather than the typical A, B, X, etc. If you're not using an Xbox branded controller, this may become awkward for you. I do not believe there is a way to change this, but as I have an Xbox controller, I didnt bother to look. I imagine playing with a keyboard and mouse would be very cumbersome. To put it simply, the combat gets boring. Its not like the Arkham games where you're looking for a fight.  There are portions of the gameplay where it is varied, but they are few and not many. There are attempts at a mini-strategy game which eerily reminded me of the portions of Assassins Creed Revelations' tower defense mode. Basically you're made to position certain elements of your army to defend a position. Its not executed very well and one wrong placement could mean your doom. One change in gameplay I did like was when you're in formation marching on an enemy position. It looks cool and gives you the feeling of power. However, the execution of this is one dimensional and also very easy.   The story is not the worst I've ever experienced by any stretch, but it just wasn't that strong or enough to make me want to play again anytime soon. The predictability hurt it a lot, along with some really hokey 'supernatural' elements that are of no help to its quality. Marius is your standard Russell Crowe/Gerard Butler-esque hybrid cliche, but the voice acting is well done in virtually every respect, so it at least goes down smoothly. The score is decent and fitting, but not very memorable. Historical accuracy is not completely non-existant, but there are some aspects that stand out (an auto-loading crossbow that acts as a mounted machine gun weapon) as being stupid and impossible for the time period.  All in all, I really wanted to like this game more. I cannot stress enough how good it looks and I experienced no problems technically whatsoever bar getting stuck in an area once. There are some excellent sequences that are VERY memorable (the Colosseum sequence is AWESOME), but on whole its such a short experience and doesn't do much to seperate itself from the crowded action game pack outside of its fantastic looks. The gameplay itself is a real letdown and gets old quickly.  All of this said, I cannot recommend this game at it's $39.99 price point. At 50% or more off, I think it would be easier to recommend, but save your $40. Ryse can wait.  6/10",

You go through 95% of this game pressing shield bash, slash, slash and repeat on everything you fight, with an occasional need to dodge an incoming enemy attack. An hour into this game and I was already bored with the combat mechanics and it didn't really improve from there.    There was to much forgivness (even on the harder difficulties) in combat executions..if you press the wrong button, you still end up carving the enemy up in a very stylish way. It would have been far better to have the enemy be able to counter your attack(s) should you have pressed the wrong button or pressed a button too late. If you start an execution, and even not press anything, you still automatically end up killing said enemy... making the whole need for a button sequence pointless.  Every enemy in the game seems to be recycled over and over again, sometimes you are even fighting numerous enemies simultaneously that are just clones. It is extremely linear as well, so there is really no exploration to this game at all, you're just kind of funneled through, completing tasks the way the creators want you to.   This was on top of numerous bugs and glitches, mainly at the beginning of the game when having to break through doors, the character would end up spinning on the spot making the game un-playable untill it was closed and reloaded.   This game would be best experienced as a rental, as you will most likely do, and see everything it has to offer in 1 or 2 days. It is also not worth the hefty price tag that acompanies it (luckily i got this on offer at about half the origional price.I still say there are far better games out there at a much lower price.",

It ran, but the fluidity of the game varied on levels and I spent periods of time looking at various options and settings. My machine should have had no problem spec wise and yet the framerate dropped when there was no clear explanation.

            "review_text": "Did you ever watch a graphic demo or benchmark and wished this was an actual game? Well, that's Ryse. It's an awesome graphic demo,but it's not a good game. Everyting you see is beautiful in the first moment, but after some minutes you see how shallow it is.  Starting with the graphics, since this is the main product you buy here: They really look great. The buildings look great, the markets, the characters. But then: you can't interact with most things. There are no physics going on. You can hit some pottery, but everyting else is indestructable. Most areas can't be visited, sincer there is no free climbing or crouching. Basically you have one (or a few times more) paths like a tunnel and you can just follow them. Also there is no interaction with the envirnment. Your charachter does not get wet, either in the sea or under a waterfall. No grass or branches are bend you walk through.  The melee fights are generally well done (I play the hardest level), but in the end very repetative. It only get's harder with very hard to block enemies and archers, but other than that the same enemies attack in hordes and get slaughtered in the same execution moves over and over. And the execution moves are a joke again, since you can press any buttom (or no button at all) to finish them. Pressing the right one at the right time gains you some bonus and scrolling the mousewheel like crazy gives you some bonus too. But no skill needed for these.  The ranged combat is a mess. Throwing your spears locks to any target it wants, even to targets out of your sight and you see your character throwing at you to some enemy behind you. Also you don't see any spears on your character, as I said, everything looks nice but is very shallow. Using the various mounted ranged weapons, they can feel awesome when the enemy is near and comical when the enmy is far and stands up and ducks like some games on a fair.  The skill tree is a joke. You can just upgrade your overall statistics and get new exection moves, but nothing feels different. There is almost no progress that you can see or feel in any way.  So: if you buy this game for under 5 Euro/$ it's fair price for a nice grpahics demo with some awesome characters with well made faces and expressions and some fer hours of slaughter some barbarains. If you buy for a higher porice and expect a full fledged game, you will be disappointed. Since it still sells for 20 I have to be negative about it (bought it much cheaper).",

If your like me you slavered over the stunning visuals that Ryse, son of Rome boasts, and couldn't wait to buy the game and dive head first into the historical, fantastical action.  I did just that and despite the gaming living up to the hype as far as graphics and voiceacting were concerned, it left me feeling somewhat deflated.   Firsty, let me just say that I really, really really wanted this game to be good. the Cinematic nature appealed to me when I first saw the trailer and I have to admit, the assassin's creed style, press and watch, style of combat was very cool. For the first hour or so. Unfortunately, stunning visuals, and they are stunning by the way, did very little to distract me from what felt like a very rushed, flat storyline.   The protagonist worked well as a character, but his story arc was as bland as the art designer's choice of enemy types. The words copy and paste can't help but spring to mind after hacking down your fiftieth enemy who bears more than a striking resemblance to the last guy that tried to kill you.   The game just is not long enough either. I completed the campaign in around three hours, and although the developers clearly idended a sort of gears of war esque co-op system for the multiplayer, it doesnt really provide any incentive to make you actually play with other people. You can literally do the whole thing yourself.   Finally. My biggest gripe with this game was how shockingly innacurate it was historically. I must have missed the part in my history books at school where Boudica led a grand invasion of Rome from the back of one of Hannibals war elephants, which he had kindly lent to her for the weekend.   All in all this game promises a lot but delivers very little. Its redeeming features are few and far between and even if bashing your head aganst hordes of identical siblings for fun is your thing; Dynasty warriors fans i'm looking at you, you would be hard pressed not to be annoyed at Ryse son of Rome.   To buy or not to buy? That may be the question you are considering and the choice is of course your own, but if i were looking for a cool, visually stunning game with romans in I'd buy Skyrim, play as an imperial and try my best to ignore the Dragons.

Damocles... Nemesis... that's not roman, that's greek. maybe they existed in roman culture and mythology as well, but not to my knowledge... and maybe that's not such a huge deal to everyone, but with the amount of polish they put into the graphics and voice acting you'd think they would've done some sort of validation of the storyline.

Even Batman Arkham Knight runs better than this game, Sorry but cannot recommend.",

Campaign is repetitive and too short which seems odd to say, but I found the campaign not long enough and basically the same hack and slash fight over and over again. Graphics are stunning, story is ok. There could have been so many great things had this game attmepted to tackle them. I yearned for something more in the Coliseum. I ranked multiplayer 1v1 battle add on would be pretty amazing. They game feels rushed. Co-op multiplayer i boring and more of the same repeat. Why anyone would play it for an extended period I do not not know. If you are ok with putting about 10 hours into this game and never picking it up again it's fine. Replayability is 0 in my opinion.",

Very Batman like gameplay, however it's the little things that got me.  PROS: Visuals are amazing, which is not surprising for a Crytek game, you definitely need a powerful machine to run everything on high, even the settings I had I occasionally ran into a few FPS issues. Story was great for this era. I love roman era games, which throw you into the culture. CONS: Enemy AI's skins are limited - Unless they were cloning the Barbarians back in the day, seeing the same faces over and over and yes over again gets a little old very quickly. Repetitive gameplay - Here is the overall game...Run, hit with shield, slash, slash, slash. Occasionally throwing a spear or giving commands.  No Sandbox VERY literal gameplay. Just like in COD's single player, it's story driven and exploration is very limited. Now not saying that is a bad thing, but for me I can only hack and slash the same barbarians oh so many times.  MULTIPLAYER; I, to be honest only tried the single player where you are thrown into the coliseum. It started off okay, but near the end the crowd got bored, and I had no idea what was happening…Until the next wave came around the corner, and yes the same skins.  For cheap, I’d recommend you picking it up as you may enjoy it, at $30, I’d struggle to recommend many due to the repetitiveness of the gameplay. Too bad they could have had a real diamond in the rough game. ",

It is completely on rails, no choice at all, the story is already set and all meaningful decisions are out of your control. Not so much as an A or B decision which honestly is not ok in any story driven game anymore, ever. It actually does a decent job of pulling you in to care about the story which is where it goes wrong because your thoughts or feelings about what happens do not matter. You are along for the ride. The ending is also a dissapointment and a bit predictable. There are better games, don't bother. On a mechanical note, the combat is a bit of whack a mole, timing based on color. This can actuallty be somewhat fun during the cinematic fatalities but then you get to the boss fights which are REALLY boring. You have all this super combat ability and then on a boss you can't use any of it. Boss fights amount to block or dodge, swing 2 times, repeat, until their health is gone. Huge let down compared to the rest of the combat in the game and extremely tedious.",

And just like every single one of Michael Bay’s films it’s too long and too stupid for me sit through, but unlike a MB film I can’t fast forward through the dumb action scenes to see the equally dumb climax.  Can the video game industry please get past revenge stories, please? Here’s some advices, in order for the audience to get invested in a revenge story they have to like the protagonist so that they can fell their pain. You cannot just introduce a zero-dimensional character and then kill their dad/family 30 seconds later and then expect some kind of emotional impact. A better motivating factor would have been simply, I am a centurion I kill for Rome, boom, done that’s enough plot to get this game moving.   Finally, if you’re going to make a game about a roman centurion the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game should have you fight in formation with your legionaries, not just 10% of the game. There are so many battles where the romans are engaging in haphazard open melee, if true roman fought like they did in this game then the defensive line for the cowboys would be able to ♥♥♥♥ and pillage the entire empire. And seriously what is with all the soldiers that just stand around doing nothing while you kill the barbarians all by yourself.    ",

The reason being is that the combat is so monotonous. The battles are almost always you against 2-3 enemies where you are going back and forth with the mouse 1, mouse 2, and the spacebar. Then there are the few times where you have to go against archers and use your ctrl button. And to add to this it felt to me as if sometimes the responsiveness in game wasn't there. At times I would see and enemy attacking me, hit the spacebar to block but it wouldn't register and I would end up getting hit.   To compare, the combat is a lot like Shadows of Mordor yet less responsive.  However besides the combat I enjoyed this game and the beauty it offered.

You fight with a sword, but can´t really do anything other than 2 or 3 different moves with the sword. You can not do anything cool as chop of arms and legs or anything. You wear an enemy down by slashing at them until they are nearly dead, indicaated by a skull icon above them. You then get to finish off the enemies with some cool (QTE) animations.  It is not a bad game. The graphics are nice and the story is quite nice as well. It is just that the combat gets really tedious and uninterresting after a few minutes.

The game play is an exceedling over-managed experience, even for something that is a console port where such games are common, although not to this extreme. It's a corridor shooter with a knife.  The best thing about the game are the graphics and the setting. The Roman-inspired backdrops are quite good; but you can't interact with anything in the world--beyond the infrequent over managed color-coded 'click the Y button now' item. Don't worry about missing those or not figuring out what thing to click as there is only 1 way through every phase/level--remember, it's a corridor shooter in the worst sense.  The gameplay is dry, repetitive, and gets old fast; which is saying something for a 9 hour game. There's no camera customization options so you're stuck with the too close yo-bro-step-back default over-the shoulder camera. Might be a limitation of the engine, of the devs to add custom/zooming viewbox code, or simply console-SoP.  Regardless, probably around 7 hours in you might be finding it boring and/or irritating and want to accelerate to the end. Why? It's easy to delete, right? Well, gameplay is an excuse to show lots of cutscenes that make use of a really cool graphics engine we developed (seriously why else make games); and I think the character animation and corresponding voice-sync is indeed great. But ultimately it becomes irritatingly obvious that gameplay second, engaging interactive world second, engaging story second, everything second to showing off the cutscenes of our graphics engine.  The voice acting is quite excellent.  If you are at all a Rome aficonado, note carefully that this game takes place in alternative universe with no bearing on anything historical beyond some names that teens who skipped history class might still recognize from the multiple-guess tests they failed. In fact, those teens may have written the story for Ryse ([sic], should be Rise but friends of those same teens run the marketing department, fo' reelz).  If you can accept this minimal suspension of disbelief (ok, not minimal, but come on...game), you might want to pick up the game at a steep steep discount on top of a discount just to have a couple hours of fun swinging your spatha or coordinating some pila throwing with the other legionaries and maybe looking at all the lorica segmentata that is, well, everywhere. If Romans are your bag and you can do that, I'd definitely get it on that discount. It's all the sophistication of a Flash game or Candy Crush, but still...Romans.  Let's say $9-$12? Add an extra $1 if you will try multiplayer. Briefly.",

I spent a few hours fooling with 3rd party software to remap the keys. Granted if I knew all the tricks and rules about how windows can or cannot remap the keyboard, I could have done this more quickly. The quick fact is that the game does not support remapping of keys, so you better like WASD or the optional arrow key setup.   If you get past that part of the game, which will not bother you if you use a controller, you will see the familiar 'gameplay' style of waiting for the screen to flash some color, and trying to hit the right key with the right timing. I realize that for many people who believe that console gaming is the same thing as pc gaming, this will just seem natural. I do not think it is the right way to design a 'game', but so be it.  I did not have any issues with getting the game to run smoothly, I run an i7, win7, 660Ti, and it runs fine, but others have had issues with better hardware.  I have not played very far into the game, but from what I read, the actual gameplay will not get any better. It also is not expected to last very long, as many claim to be able to finish in 6 hours. I got this game at a discount, but I still could not recommend it at bargin bin pricing.   If your idea of gaming is watching a cgi scene, mashing a button once in a while, and being impressed by some kind of bloody audio visual effect, you may tolerate this. The voice acting, sound effects, and visuals seem good, I just don't think that makes for a 'game'.  -edit: Just finished campaign, so glad it is over. longest 5.4 hrs ever. Gameplay did not improve.

It is like rewarding the laziest possible attempt while at the same time we do recognize the lazyness involved. That is because you read a review, you see all the abysmally bad things mentioned in the cons... and then you see a thumbs up as well. WTH.  Yeah the graphics are neat... but also yeah... there are like 8 enemies cloned to death on a game where you actually do NOTHING else than seeing their faces, bodies and equipment while you quicktime event killing them again and again and again and again....  Yeah the moves are neat...but also yeah...there is absolutely no freedom, strategy, tactics or skill involved. In fact I would rather have the developers have a button, which if you were to press all the fights would be resolved automatically while you sit back and you enjoy a.... b-movie story with AAA movie production values. The fights after about half an hour or so get so boring that feel like a chore that you get to perform just to see the next awesome graphical setting.  Do not get the game if it is not on a 75% off sale, and even then you might think that your $5 could be much better spent on something else.  It is quite telling that I played this for about an hour and a half, I quit and I found myself playing Mount &amp; Blade: Warband which has ABYSMALLY worse graphics, animation, production values...you name it... and nevertheless it is a vastly superior game. I am not trying to compare the two as they are completely uncomparable. Different genres, different styles, different everything. What I am trying to say is that graphics is not everything in a game, and in this particular case, although you cannot go much better than that graphics wise, the game feels so hollow that one has to wonder what the heck the developers were thinking.  And to go back to my initial point... what the heck the reviewers - that keep thumping it up - were thinking. Do they want companies to produce more games like this, or do they want to push gaming developers in a better direction?  I would give to this game a 2/10 while being extremely generous.",

Except the over done motion blur when you turn the camera can make you dizzy and want to purk from tiem to time... And game always put you in situation that you can to deal with a group of enemy all at once, they usually got as 1 v 3, then reinforcement join the fight after you take out the first 3 enemy, but from time to time it will just toss you into a 1 v 7 fight, and enemy can easily forming up a group that can combo you to 'block freeze' state, that means their attacks will form up a combo that make you unable to do anything but just block after block after block for a while, which can be annoy and waste alot of time... And the excution is cool but yet dumb at the same time, cos when you go into excution phase, the camera will lock on you, everything become slow motion, it is all your glory to excute some poor enemy that you pick out from a group of enemy... and all other enemy will just stand there and let you do your business...

It was cool and enjoyable for the first hour but after that its the same repititive combat style. I didnt even read what I was upgrading because I just want to finish it ASAP and uninstall it.  However, towards trhe end, the game feels just maybe 15% nicer.   In summary... one word...BORING",

The combat is formulaic and boring, the story is terrible, the acting is worse and the enemy skins are reused ad nausium.  The only redeming feature are the graphics, which are pretty good. But since I have to disable my second GTX 970, otherwise the game suffers from massive slowdowns throughout, it can hardly be described as pushing any boundries there.  I've been disappointed by Crytek games in the past, graphics are alright, gameplay is awful.  Won't ever buy another.",

This wasn't really an issue until the later parts of the game, when timing was much more important against harder people. I didn't even finish the game, because it got so frustrating. - boss battles can be extremely frustrating when you're required to dive out of the way. I had to frequently perform time-critical dives and the controls weren't very responsive or you wouldn't dive in the right direction). You have to be extremely careful to press left or right key *before* the dive key or else you might dive backwards and get hit. This is ridiculous, since my computer build is very strong.  - it is repetitive and linear, but it personally worked for me. - can't skip cutscenes - if you die you may have to watch them again. Some of them are very long. - you can't change difficulty in the middle of the game - visuals can be laggy - not too common, but bad when combined with button latency - gladiator matches aren't explained properly",
