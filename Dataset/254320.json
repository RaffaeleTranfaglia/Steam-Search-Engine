The good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.  The bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.  So on the balance, it's mostly bad news.",

            "review_text": "I plan to create a full video review for this game, but here is a short list of my thoughts for now. Simply put, Duskers is the BEST sci-fi rouge-like since FTL.   You are alone on your ship in the middle of space with little fuel. The only thing surrounding your ship are ghost ships, silent space stations, perhaps even the occasional automated store. The only option left to you is to remotely control salvage drones to explore these derelict ships in search of fuel, scrap, ship modules, and other disabled drones to add to your fleet.   To control your drones you have to type out commands into a console window, or alternatively you can take control of one drone using your arrow keys. Typing out commands isn't just a gimmick to make the game stand out though, it is a vital tool to learn. With the command line you can send out multiple orders to drones all at once with ease (once you learn a few more advanced commands that is).   In order to explore these ships you will need to power the ship's systems with your drones. This will give you access to controlling various doors and airlocks on the ship, which you will need to use to avoid any xenomorphs as you scour the vessel. Like most Rogue-likes you are going to die... constantly. But everytime you reset the game you learn more strategies about how to safely collect supplies. If you listen closely you can somtimes hear each unique sound various threats will make when they are on the other side of the room.  As you explore the galaxy you will also find various text logs on ships and stations that can be put together to find out what happened to humanity. Your ship's computer will give you various objectives in relation to the logs you find, which you can in turn complete to learn more about what happened to the galaxy. The logs are very well written. If the gameplay and visuals weren't already engaging me enough, the story surely sucked me in. The only story in the game is through audio logs, and for me to say that it's a gripping story means the game has some damn good wrtting.   Overall I can safely say that Duskers is a game well worth $20. To say that the game is light on content is not entirely untrue, but typing out commands in dozens of different ways and learning to code your own commands (yes, you can CODE your own commands) is more than enough to keep you playing. I love this game and plan to spend much more time on it.  complete review1; publish; recommend duskers; return all home; end",

            "review_text": "Purchased during 'Early Access'.  I don't know how to talk about why I like this game so much without feeling silly, but I am going to do it anyway.  You know how in science fiction movies (especially those like Alien), where you would watch people operate various systems and such with funny looking interfaces? This game seems to be made to engender the same feelings I got when I would watch someone 'work' on a starship computer. It is a really neat experience (for me) to type little command lines and watch stuff go. That's it. I feel like I'm operating MU/TH/UR. And I love it. And if you don't want to type the whole command, it will complete it for you.  It has a nice, leisurely pace, cool graphics, neat sound (what little there is), a cool story...and a degauss function.  I guess I would say this has a bit of 'retro-futurism' appeal to it. The CRT monitor-like graphics and typing, being a bit quaint? I dont know.  I like it. It makes me feel like I am actually doing something as opposed to the almost passive way  I use a mouse.   So...if you want to type some and look at grainy images, I totally recommend this.",

            "review_text": "Duskers is quite the gem of a game. It's very sure what it wanted to be and aimed for it, and I can assure you that it is every bit as fun as it is tense.   And oh boy, does it get REALLY TENSE. We're talking your abs are tighter than you ever thought possible with sweat on your brow, all the while your fingers are shakingly awaiting the immediate and sudden need to belt out a command to slam a door shut to save your drones from certain destruction.  Meanwhile, or even when this is NOT happening, you are pensive. Scared, since every single room could be the very last you ever open. Relying on equipment that may be working perfectly, but will eventually start going faulty, and may even fail entirely mid mission, forcing you and your terrified little harem of drones must adapt to the situations at hand.  Weapons exist, but are few and far between. I have yet to find even one that wasn't a mine or trap of some kind. That aside, you have your brain, your other tools such as motion sensors, the ability to access destroyed ship terminals to scan for items, scraps which are used as currency and are also the only way to repair or buy anything, or use the defense turrets (If there are any) to remove the hostile entity. (There are more than one. I've encountered 3 different types so far.)  The enemies have this air of mystery about them. since the only way for you to 'see' the world is through the grainy, often glitchy camera of your drones, it only adds to the suspense as you inch closer to what could be your next big pay off, or your last inch you'll ever inch.  The atmosphere is spectacular, the premise is nothing NEW with the whole 'Last man alive? In space!' situation, but it's executed in such a unique way, being that you are NOT the save-it-all badass solution to the problem, but rather, more frail than your very own drones.  All of this, and you feel like you're actually the guy running the drones because they game operates entirley through an interface similar to the command prompt on any PC.  I absolutely love this game. It's one of the only rouge-likes I've ever enjoyed. Even with the deaths being permanent, and there is no real progress aside from the mystery to solve (Which you keep uncovered logs per death) there are no levels or stat progression. Only you, the upgrades you put on your drones, and your skill as an operator.  In a way, this reminds me of Dark Souls. Vaguely, with that similar feeling of 'No matter what, move forward.'  Because in the end, when all is dark and hopeless, will you sit and whimper, awaiting your inevitable demise as all that you knew fades into the deep, endless blackness of space? Or will you cling to life, and crawl your way to the answers you seek?  After all, is it not but our fate as humans to ever be drawn towards knowledge? Even if you are the last human alive, wouldn't you like to know the answer? 'What happened to everyone? How did the galaxy become a graveyard?'   TL,DR  Fantastic atmosphere, very few games beat it in my eyes. Even Triple A. Amazing execution for a simple idea. Intriguing story that poses itself more as a question to be answered. Rouge-like elements are solid. Your game has an effect that you can toggle, that makes it look like you're on an old CRT style screen.  &gt;navigate all r1 navigating all drones to r1 &gt;a1 airlock 1 closed &gt;exit are you sure you want to disengage boarding with this vessel?

When I first looked at some of the gameplay, it looked quite bland, as in drained of color and seemed very boring. But I decided to give this game a chance and It did not disappoint.   Duskers is a control-based game that gives you real-time control over all the events occurring on your screen. Although you may only be looking at a monitored-simulation, it truly gives a feel of one being present at the scene as this is happening.   To the objective of the game: As the pilot of a small ship, you are tasked with the job of exploring and unveiling the truth behind what has happened to the other humans aboard ships that are merely drifting in space. Boarding these ships, you may find subtle clues or messages (datalogs) that may shed light to the disappearances or what might have happened. Utilizing drones and a variaty of gadgets they come equipped with (all customizable), you pilot these units aboard frigates, freighters, and numerous other ships alike in order to accumulate necessary resources to keep your own ship from failing while at the same time, uncovering the mystery behind the disapperances of the crew members of these ships.   But here's the catch: You aren't alone. There are... these... things that are on board those ghost ships with you. And as far as I know, all of them are entirely hostile. They will attack your drones on sight and destroy them. The trick behind figuring out how to navigate around them either stealthily or to eliminate them will be up to the player to discover.",

            "review_text": "An interesting deep space strategy game, though a bit pricey for $20 in my opinion. You control a team of up to four drones with a variety of upgrades into ships, space stations, and outposts. You have to salvage these places in order to repair/upgrade your drones as well as repair/upgrade/refuel your ship. Only problem is that there are always enemies on board that you need to take care of.   The above doesn’t sound too hard in principle until you take into account that you almost exclusively control your drones through a command line, typing in commands. If you are playing this game you might as well just unplug your mouse because you can’t use it. You have to be carful about what you type and you need to be accurate because a simple typo can destroy all of your drones. That is why things should be taken slow and carful, because if you make a mistake and one of your drones is in trouble panic will make it even harder to type.    If you like enjoying yourself please, take all the difficulty settings and turn them to zero. By large request the developers eventually added difficulty settings as before ‘normal mode’ meant perma-death, if you make a mistake you either have to cut your losses or restart from scratch. Even on easy mode I’ve never had enough resources to waste on anything. Since the universes, galaxies, and systems you explore are procedurally generated, you are always at the mercy of RN-jesus.   I enjoy the game a bit, though I play it in bursts because it tends to get tedious, which is why I recommend you wait for a sale.",

Luckily, the game has Rogue elements so the information you collect throughout your many playthroughs (and there will be many - fat-finger goofs or not) will contribute to telling the overall arching story (which seems like it's asymetyrical in it's advancement, but I can't be sure (Which would be an impressive feat if it was)) and actual objectives in the game as well.   This is one of those games that makes the player the actual player, rather than the player playing a character (try saying that 3 times fast). The game doesn't beat you over the head with this and actually pulls it off quite well.      Story time: After one particular screw up (which I managed to save the majority of my drones) I had to wait for the 'flickering power sources' in the ship to randomly flick on in the room I was in so I could activate a teleporter. No problem, I'll just wait a while. An hour later I realized that the derilict itself was powering down and I experienced all kinds of interesting things along the way like random asteroids that may or may not collide with rooms in X minutes. Loss of video feed from drones and overview. Random doors breaking open as things crawl around on the ship I was in...

You are a what I call a Drone Ethusianist. You collect drones, go through ship after ship finding clues and collecting fuel to survive. After a couple of days of leading infestations (monsters) into rooms and either keeping them there or destroying them with turrets, I felt unstoppable and that the game was kinda easy. Then one of my motion detectors went out. Okay, no problem. I will use the other one- That one went out as well. Motion detectors detect movement (with some accurarcy) and is basically the east and most useful tool to have when exploring derlict ships. So...I went looking for one, using probes and various methods to combat it.  Then, without warning...a defense turret attacked my drones. One by one, they all fell, with nothing but one drone that I have towed in earlier surviving. All the junk gone as well as my upgrades, I am forced to make or break with one droid and one tool: Generator. The ship was a military ship. Plenty of turrets, one droid...no tow tool. But it had lures. They lure enemies into the room, but do not say whether it is succesful or not. I decide to commander the ship, as it has not only the drone but plenty of scrap.  Then, a droid infection comes in, forcing me to run all over the ship, closing door after door behind me in a vain attempt to prevent it from destroying me. Then, I saw it...a empty room, with one airlock present. I took a chance...I docked in that room, lured it, then moved in and pushed it further and further back into that room. It fell for the lure, I raced in and closed the door behind it and spaced it to hell. The ship was mine, the droid was mine. I felt so relieved and surprised at how good of a comeback I made already... I then died because I did not fully allow those charger infections to go into an airlock room.  The game is one of those that when you screw up, you feel like it is YOUR fault. Why didn't you pick up the droid upgrades before you spaced the room? Why did you rush into that or take too long? Trust me when I say this: This game rewards being bold but cunning.   Would I recommend this game: YES This game doesn't create jumpscares, but creates moments of regret, worry and joy that overshadow the idea of a 'horror' game. It is a puzzle game that is sci-fi and eldritch horror in nature. You will name your droids what you want, then be horrified at ever leaving them behind...but you must, because you MUST think of the others.  Suggestion to Devs:  making a better method of finding out what tools/upgrades mean what as well as how to repair items that are either broken or close to breaking would be fantastic.",

If you like survival horror, buy it. The graphics are intentionally limited to provide immersion, you really feel like you're the last hope of humanity, and the breadcrumbs leading to the story are enough to keep even the people that hate walking simulators going.  Only thing I've noticed: the commandeer command needs to be explained better. I found out about it from the Wiki. In the first starting area that is hand-crafted you should be in a puddle jumper with no J-drive and like 10 scrap capacity. You should have to commandeer one of those ships to keep going to forcably introduce the mechanic.",

Each derelict is a challenge and sometimes nothing can come about because of it. That being said, the game so far is something I would describe as quite fun.",

From the constant break down of upgrades, drones, video feed and with enemies in every ship you're pumping with adrenaline at each door opening.  With that said I am also getting a LOT of bugs. From crashing to distorted views I have had to quit multiple time in the short playtime I have had. Combine that with the roguelike of the game and you find yourself unable to enjoy Duskers. Such a shame.   If this is fixed I would definitly recommend it.",

For me it is a little too slow moving and difficult/tedious to control to be a good candidate for a roguelike. I was on maybe my fifth ship and accidentally activated a defense structure in the room I was in because my kid was distracting me. Killed most of my drones.  No problem I will just load up a save, oh no saves. So there was an hour wasted.   That is ok not all games are for all people. This seems well made and interesting, and maybe if I had gotten further or the controls were less annoying I would have stuck with it. As it is I have dozens of games I can play, no need to spend time on ones I don't love.",

            "review_text": "Well that's £13.50 poorly spent and a lesson in not believing that 'Very Positive' overall user review. Instead of periodic saves you get Reset; and it means just that, after a few times getting 2 or 3 salvage trips into the game and losing key drones to the ridiculously fast red things. The propsect of going all the way back to the start with randomised abilities on the drones was just too frustrating and dull to contemplate so I gave up. The experience isn't tense, it's annoying; I buy games to enjoy them not to be continually reset - where's the fun in that. At the speed it downloaded there's only about 20 lines of code and no graphics to speak of so a save command doesn't seem like too much to ask. The command line novelty soon wears off as you discover that to close a door in the face of a rapidly advancing red splodge that you don't get to see until the last minute and that your motion sensor didn't warn you about requires a down arrow plus a typed command. The most skilled touch typist on the planet is unlikely to be able to achieve that. Take my advice - buy 3 pints of beer, it'll be better value.  In light of comments and my sense of fair play I thought I'd edit my review after giving this another chance. I spent a couple more hours and actually It's worse than my previous thoughts. That said read Distantflight's review which is fairer and kinder than the game deserves. An example: After a dozen or so resets both to overcome the random spawning of drones with sub-optimal loadouts and to see if it was possible to get an 'interface' in the loadout (it wasn't) in order to use all the terminals that proliferate on ships that you visit. More resets when I didn't survive more than 2 ship vists because the game is hard for an old bloke with a job who has a life but enjoys a bit of recreational (look it up) gaming. Anyhow, I thought I'd cracked it - back on first boarding, should be easy. I new there was a red splodge in a room and I set myself up to retreat through two doors and trap my adversary in a room. It should have worked, a straight line so the counter intuitive arrow controls don't confuse me door close command typed in only waiting for a single keystroke. Drone retreats indistinct enemy follows - brilliant, what a game - just about to exit door 2 and press enter... red streak across intervening space, instant kill. There's such a paucity of resources, salvage and spare drones as well as modules that a player can't absorb the casualties or the repair bill and move on. &gt;Duskers_ Explore . Repeatedly Reset .
