Other than that, I think the storyline and characters are really great. How it all unfolds near the end is VERY interesting. If you would like a hard challenge and are familiar with Nancy Drew franchise... I would buy this game.",

            "review_text": "I've loved the Nancy Drew books since my youth. I'd also apparently lived under a rock for quite some time because I hadn't known that games were made based in her adventures. I really enjoyed this game since it was one that made you think and combined some casual games with some not so causal ones. I especially liked working with the wolf.  That darn Fox and Geese game irritated me greatly though. The man just wouldn't go to the quarter I needed him in. It took some time to get the wins I needed for that puzzle. I also am now going to have to get a Fox and Geese board for the kids and I.  I really recommend this game to a mystery lover that likes to think. I don't recommend it to those that are used to games that are just bash and trash.",
