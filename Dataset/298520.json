The movement system can be a little strange at times, but after a while, it became a key part to this game in terms of my enjoyment. Tie it in with the weapons and a full server, and the game becomes something I want to sink more than a few hours into after I buy it. Unfortunately, the issue you'll hear most is that there are not enough players, which is sad because this is a great game.",

But if you want a game in your library that you and a few friends can play on your couch, this game is amazing.  Screen cheating is a real problem though, as it can result in cross-map snipes where they can't even see you. I only recomend it to your mature friends who can deal with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  A recomended setting for local play is banning the satellite turrets, and the phase orb. Also excluding fusion core from your map choice. Satellite turrets are annoying and invite salt and toxicity, phase orb is a noob-tube, and fusion core is a ♥♥♥♥ map.  A few friends and I played this game for hours, and we loved it. I hope you find the same enjoyment.  I got this on sale for a dollar, but I would be perfectly willing to pay full price for this, though there are many other great games out there that you could add to your local coop collection if you wait to buy this on sale.",

HOWEVVVEERR the only singleplayer option is some sort of weird 'Time Trials' that contains a confusing layout and lacks fun (in my personal opinion) I feel like the single player could be done SO much better mabye fighing AI mechs our some sort of wave survival. One thing to also notice if your intrested in buying this game is that there are normaly about 1-2 servers going on with 2-10 players each (of your lucky) so I would recomend buying this game in four pack fourm next time it goes on sale its only a couple dollars and your friends will love u :D Over all very good game would be nice if price was lower it had better singleplayer and was updated more commenly but I really love the core concept of the side scroller shooter mech w/ gravety. Good game would recomend. Four Stars.",

The gravity will pull you down on the planets which could make the game unpredictable. There's a quite big variety of weapons for you to play with ranging from grenade launchers to pulserifles etc.   It's no game you would play hours in a row but works really well in short doses. Also, without any bot support you are to rely on online players. At the moment there are still people playing but they won't be in the dozens but this would make a nice party game.  Overall I found Orbital Gear to be a real fun and engaging game.",

You in space vs other robot enemies which also got good weapons , your main thing that you need to do is to destroy the opponents base , But you must kill them before you doing this. Remember to take the energy from them after you killing them!  Possitive Facts :     Great movement system.    Trading Cards    Honestly , The price worth the game   Bad Facts :     Not enought players to play multiplayer    There is no servers so you can't play multiplayer    I don't really like the soundtrack at all.   So , I probably really recommend this game , Really enjoyable game to play with your friends! One of the best 2D games I played in my whole time! ",

I'm not even that good, and yet, I still am laughing and having a blast whenever I decide to play it. It's fast, frantic, and wonderfully competitive, while being as simplistic as possible at the same time. I highly recommend this game. Get some friends together, start a Skype chat, and play. And now, until June 1, it's available for just a $1! Pros - Even when running at maxed out settings, it runs ridiculously smooth. Plus it looks gorgeous and has a perfect, distinct style. - The controls, while at first are frustrating, quickly become very familiar. - The use of gravity as a main gameplay element was actually pretty well implemented. Not perfect by any means, but it works for a majority of stages in the game. - The variety of weapons and stages is great. Each stage and weapon feels distinct. Having a favorite pairing of weapons, and a utility (a sort of enhancement for the user's mech) and then proceeding to master that loadout, feels just like having a favorite Smash Bros. character. Cons - Having controller support as an option may in itself sound great, but using a controller for this game sucks. It just doesn't work. - There are a number of different mechs to choose from from within the game. They all look different, with a great retro 80s 90s vibe, but the mechs themselves are just cosmetic, and don't really change anything. Plus within the game, they appear super tiny, so that was pretty useless. - Lack of replayability. Everything is already unlocked in this game the second you turn it on. Weapons, mechs, stages, everything. Anyways though, these cons are very minor as a whole really, and don't in anyway hinder the amount of childlike fun with this game. 9/10",

A very GOOD rage game, given how I managed to scream obscenities at it for a good hour without noticing.  When you get it right, it's a FANTASTIC feeling. 9/10ths of the time though, you're twitching and hitting quick restart because you messed up that one opening shot / Overshot the next planet/ mistimed when an enemy would show up somewhere for the most effecient run.  Seriously, some of these minimum qualifying times are ridiculous. I have yet to see video evidence of how people do these.   Multiplayer's a random chaotic mess, which isn't bad. I don't exactly find it engaging when my interaction with someone is, at most, pray the server takes my side and hits this guy before he, or someone else, hits me.",

Maybe not for $10 but steam sale. So maybe give it a try when that happens!  *Edit Playing this game on and off from time to time whenever there are people online and I've been having a lot of fun. Smooth fast paced gameplay coupled with trippy, delicious space backgrounds and a killer and stylish soundtrack really makes this game worth a buy.  The lag during some matches can kind of be silly since someone can jump from off screen and elimate you before you even see them but it's an indie game so you can't expect the servers/game to run without a hitch.",

The main flaw of the game is that it's completely multiplayer based and so few people play it that there's rarely ever anyone online to play. I recommend the game as this will help more people get it to encourage circulation. The graphics could use a slight improvement but they're pretty decent for the cost, and the mechanics are what set this game apart from other games. If you're looking for an interesting and different experience that is easy to learn, but challenging to master, then you should consider trying this out. If you like offline/singleplayer/campaign games then this isn't for you I guess. 8/10 as this game WOULD be extremely enjoyable, if it had a larger community behind it. The lack of the extra 2 stars is mainly the fault of the public not having any interest in the game.",

I wish I could reccomend this game, but I just can't. I would reccomend buying this game when it's on sale, but it's certainly not worth the $9.99 they are charging people for.",
