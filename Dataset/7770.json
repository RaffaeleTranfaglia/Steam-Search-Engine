Just pretend that it has nothing to do with the X-Com franchise and go on mindlessly blasting aliens.  But no, it's not worth $5.",

But, For some reason, music in my itunes started playing, thru this game. was music bu the band AFI  From their grunge days to their latest album. and while it freaked me out how it was playing. Gotta say, made playing this alot better. Turned the first level of a few enemies, into a fast paced game of don't die (even though it was still the same)  Some decent music with this game, some kind of rock of your preference, and this games isn't to bad. I wouldn't say out right buy it, but if you have it, its not the worst.  That being said, It this game even though old, is pretty much the same thing over and older.",

            "review_text": "Not really an X-Com game, it's only tangentially related, this game is a freakish frankenstien's monster of mashed together resources from cancelled X-com games of the era. They gave them to a few unrelated developers and said, make something we can sell out of this.  I don't recommend you buy it as a stand alone, but if you bought the complete pack you might have some fun with this if you don't look at this as a serious X-Com sequel.  What I recommend in this game is the shear sense of excess and abandon. This game is like the master levels in Doom II, except more so. At some point the level bosses become the regular enemies and they begin to fill up the smoldering remains of humanity in areas the size of the parking lot at disney world, and then they take more than one shoulder launched nuclear missile to kill.   Don't get me wrong, critically speaking, there is no story to speak of, the mechanics are basic, options limited and the exploration is limited to trying to find glowing letters that spell out B-O-N-U-S in semi open levels, but this game is like Smash TV meets Contra meets Doom meets Chex Quest.  When you're running 120 mph laps in a shopping mall with a helicopter blade strapped to your arm vertically, the aliens flying apart in front of you as if they've been thrown into a blender on the liquify setting, an effeminate lisping scientist is yelling something about 'BIG BONUSES' in your ear and your robot avatar says 'Back off space freaks' and you're only to the half point in the game you'll understand what I'm talking about.",

            "review_text": "This game is bad, it completely deviates from the turn based and strategy foundation that made ufo defense, terror from the deep, and apocalypse so good. All you do in this game is walk (or run so fast you cant see what you are doing) around these maps holding down the fire button as enemies and weapons spawn randomly all over the place. When you complete the mission it tallys the points and you upgrade your weapons and boosters etc. to become even more invincible than you already are. I dont really see any story line to it, its just collect as many points as possible and on to the next level. I bought an x-com 5 pack for like $3.27 on sale so i cant say that it was a waste of money beause it was less than $1 but i definitely wouldnt recommend this game. 2/10.",
