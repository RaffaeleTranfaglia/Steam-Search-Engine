BlazeRush is a top-down racer with a few different game modes and plenty of pickups to fire at your opponents. There's a singleplayer campaign as well but you'll be finding most of your fun with the multiplayer options. All the racers share the same screen so you get pulled ahead (or destroyed) for falling behind. There's a standard lap race mode, a mode where the person in first the longest wins, and Death Race. The last mode is by far most fun I've had with this game. A giant machine chases all the racers around the track until everyone is eliminated. The person that survives longest nets the most points, and it starts right back up again until you reach a set number. This leads to plenty of hilarious moments as players struggle to stay far ahead with boosters or sabotage the competition with firepower. I'd say it's a definite buy. Online multiplayer's dead though so grab this with 2 or 3 friends.",

On a side note, the only gripe I have is that you must accelerate with the left thumb stick if using the 360 controller. This leads to fatigue after playing for a while. !!!Developers listen up!!! Can you PLEASE change the right trigger to accelerate, left stick to steer and X/A for power-ups?!?! I think this would be the best layout, less fatigue.

If you have stuttering with Linux in a map or at first, try letting it run a bit then see if the stuttering disappears.

That said, that handicap isn't enough to keep someone who's simply much better from kicking your butt every race, which is what you would hope happens in a racing game.
