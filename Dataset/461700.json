            "review_text": "First, I must say that I  loved  Matthew’s route. He’s my favorite character, I love his cute personality, and his VA is excellent. The bad ending surprised me a lot   (and kinda creeped me out, but I liked?? Haha)  , and the good ending was cute. Sam’s route was another surprise, I’m not really a fan of “brute” characters, but the writing was good and I could feel that he really cared about the MC. The art style was good (I’m not so picky about that tho), BGM was great. But… Let me talk about the things that bothered me.   *** SPOILERS ***      The wives &amp; absence of Naomi and Suzu : I absolutely adore Naomi and Suzu. Their routes on the first game were ok, but I love them more as friends of MC. It saddens me that you can’t interact more with them, besides talking on the phone. And suddenly there’s the wives? I honestly felt happy that the other boys (besides the one you’re dating) got married, but I think it was totally unnecessary to make them a part of the story, and interact with the MC. And… get sucked into the Demon World together with their husbands. I can understand about the boys, but the wives? They don’t do ANYTHING. They show up once in a while and that’s it. That was kind of a let down, and I really don’t think that the boys would risk the life of their beloved wives on war field. There might be an explanation for that, but sorry, I don’t buy it. ._.       Erik’s route was all about Diana : Ok, Erik isn’t my favorite guy in the game. I’m not a fan of the playboy type, but I still care about this character. But honestly, his route was all about Diana’s sister. I couldn’t feel a proper interaction between him and the MC. Maybe it’s just me, but I think that kinda ruined what could have been a good route…    Despite my complains, it was great to play this VN. I loved the fact that each route is unique, the new characters (except the wives lol), the multiple possible endings, and the fact that every choice matters. I really like this developer, and I wish them the best of luck on their next releases!  7/10, because Matthew is love, Matthew is life.",

            "review_text": "Alright, giving this game a review because why not? I played Seduce Me The Otome on a lark because it was free, and I wanted to see what a free visual novel had to offer. I was not disappointed and became slightly obessed with getting all of the achievements. I was thoroughly surprised that the sequel was already out, and since I enjoyed the first so much, I was happy to plunk down 10 bucks to play the second. I highly recommend playing through the first game, which is again free, so it won't cost you anything but time. You don't have to, but you get more background into the characters than what K gives you in the beginning.  I really enjoyed this game, and it is a fine successor to the first. Character development is very solid. All of the boys have their own distinct personalities that are fairly consistent with the first game. You also meet other interesting characters, like your trainers and Diana's personal guard Saero, who all have their own motivations, if you care to find out about them. The voice acting is done very well, and I was very surprised to see a character from the first game come back and say 'You missed me, ♥♥♥♥♥?' I found myself saying 'Yes. Yes, I missed you tons.'  The story lines are good as well. It makes sense as to why you are in the demon world and what you have to do to get back to the human world, if you so choose. The story lines could've been a little longer, especially Diana's. I was able to knock her arc out and get all the achievements associated with it in about three hours. It's important to note that what you say or don't say actually matters in this game. Unlike the first game, which was incredibly formulaic and predictable in getting its endings, you have to pay attention to your paramour and his personality. I am leaving Diana out of this one because in her arc, you aren't paying attention to her. You're paying to Saero, who is a fantastic character and is easily my favorite new character. I wish there was more of him in this game.  Onto the not-so-great stuff. The art design for the game, on a whole, is better, except when it comes to the boys. Some of their default poses are so unnatural looking. It's like a few of their joints are at odd angles. Also, Damien's character model was the most drastically changed. While he is the youngest of the five, in the first game, he didn't look or act like the youngest. That was reserved for Matthew, and I understood it because of their personalities. Now, Damien definitely looks the youngest and sometimes acts like it too. No bueno. Finally, the wives. As a whole, I like the fact that the boys that you don't romance move on and find love. That's awesome, but with the exception of Carrie (Sam's wife) in James's arc, they have nothing to do, and it really pisses me off. I want to know about these ladies! I want to know about Irene's fashion sense, Noryn's cat leggings, and Iridessa, who looks to be of Native American descent. I still have a bit of the game to play, farming achievements and such, but if over 20 hours hasn't revealed anything yet, I doubt another 10 will.  Despite all of that being said, this game is worth your money. Doubly so if you've played the first game. The good endings are satisfying, the bad ones are heartbreaking, and the voice acting is superb. Good job, Ms. Laws.",

When it's finally time to get married to the love of her life, Mika find herself in the Abyssal Plains, the demon world.   I really enjoyed Seduce Me: The Otome, and I did mention to a few friends that I wouldn't have mind paying for it, since the story was really interesting and it was easy to fall in love with each character. I got really happy when I heard that Michaela Laws decided to make a sequel to the game, and decided to buy a copy rather quickly. For 9,99€ you get a really good love story, it took me over 40 hours to complete everything and I enjoyed every minute of it.  Seduce Me 2: The Demon War improved everything as well, the colours are a lot brighter and they raised the quality of the art. And of course, the voice actors did a splendid job and the writing has improved a lot. The creators of this game, and especially Michaela Laws herself, shows that you don't need a huge team in order to make a great Visual Novel.",

I will give a caveot, while it is NOT required, you will get a greater enjoyment out of this game if you have played the previous one (and even better if you've played through all 5 boy's stories in the first one).  I found the underlying background story even more compelling as the previous version.   Pros:  voice actors are on point story is engaging PERFECT sequal to the previous Chance to be a self rescuing princess Good story length for each play through Perfectly steamy if you want it to be. Perfectly sweet if that is the way you prefer it  Cons: There were a FEW places where the voice acting didn't match the writtentext, but it wasn't a massive distraction Some of the storylines will yank the heartstrings pretty hard I can't figure out the blessed password :D  The art style is a LITTLE different from the previous but I preferred some of the art in the second one more than that previous version. I *think* some of the voices changed and that was the biggest disjoint for me. Other than that, I LOVED this sequal and highly recommend it.",

This game is absolutely fantastic in every way. The voice acting is phenomenal. I can certainly hear the improvement compared to the first game. The art style is especially beautiful. The characters seem a bit less detailed when compared to the character models in the first game, but the art style is so amazing on it's own that it creates more than an exception. The modified and newly developed music is so lyrical. It warms my heart. Not to mention, considering how much time and effort the developers put into this game, (restless nights, countless corrections to minor issues, cranium and skeletal injuries) I'd say the game turned out especially fantastic. There are too many highlights to recognize with this game, but these were some of the basics. Thank you very much for reading! I highly recommend buying and playing this game and the first one as well. Thanks again! Have a wonderful day! ;) &lt;3",

            "review_text": "I'm partway through my first route (James) and was really enjoying the game... until the angels showed up. That in itself wasn't too bad. Co-opting a little more religious imagery to flesh out the universe isn't a bad thing, especially since 'demons' and 'angels' have basically become part of pop culture. Obviously these beings are no more related to Christian angels than the demons are to Christian demons (that is, not at all). That was my thought process, anyway, as I continued to play the story.  And then the use of cross symbols started.   I'll just go ahead and say it. I found that offensive.  Extremely  offensive. After all the consideration shown about trigger warnings and consent, to then use a religion's most holy symbol in such terrible ways... I couldn't believe it. And I was very disappointed, since until now I've loved just about everything in Michaela Laws' various games. I understand there was no malice here, only ignorance, or, at worst, a vague contempt for anyone who 'takes these things seriously,' but I still had to say something. I'm going to have a lot of trouble enjoying the rest of this game.",

There was so much more detail and depth compared to the first game and the stories were unique to each individual character. The soundtrack is just so beautiful and enhances the experience immensely; Christopher Escalante did a truly wonderful job on it. I have played through all of the routes and, while I enjoyed some more than others, I thought that they were all exceptionally done.   My favourite routes were definitely Erik's and Sam’s while my least favourite was Damien's. Damien's route was still well done, but personally I found his story to be a little too redundant. Additionally, I found Diana's route to be too short and thought her story should have been expanded and delved into a little more. I also really did not like the 'wives'. They had absolutely no significance to the story and were seemingly only there to spout a few throw away lines every now and then. I'm not against the other boys being married, but I feel a mention would have been sufficient.   There were quite a few grammatical errors and a few instances where the spoken dialogue did not match with the written dialogue. It did not detract from my enjoyment of the game though so I was able to overlook them for the most part. What did bother me a bit were some of the endings. The dialogue for some of the endings are not accurate when it comes to the fate of certain characters. Hopefully this will be rectified in an update at some point in time.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game. I really liked the first Seduce Me game but I would venture to say that I love Seduce Me 2. I am so pleased that it was able to live up to, if not exceed, my expectations. ",

            "review_text": "Alright, I'll have to give this game some props.  It was a pretty good story-line, the art was way better than the last game, and the voice acting was pretty on point. I enjoyed how the producers really took into account your decisions from the last game, which isn't something you see in dating sims, like ever. And the ending was pretty satsifying, you knew what was going to happen, but you liked it anyways.   I do have some complaints. The wives of the incubi come off as last minute thoughts, as if they were just thrown in to be placeholders for Mika, which, essentially, they are, and I get that. I just didn't like them, maybe it was just a personal preference. And then, the character development for Mika was there but then it wasn't. You knew from the first game that she was fiesty as ♥♥♥♥ and would kick ♥♥♥ if needed to. That didn't really come across in this game until the very end,   when she was killing imps left and right and didn't even flinch. You'd think that since Diana cried and broke down at the end of her battle, Mika might show some sort of emotion, too.    Aside from that, this was a pretty solid visual novel. You can tell Michaela Laws put a lot of thought into this, even just by looking at the tiny details of the world she's created. It's quite lovely.  All in all, I'd say this game was well worth the $10 I put into it, I enjoyed it, and I'm excited to see what else Michaela has in store for us.",

            "review_text": "A story worth the praise of the universe, for sure. I don't often write game reviews, but credit where credit is due: the attention to detail in this game is massive. Eschewing the grinding that you run into in many Otome, both Seduce Me and Seduce Me 2 emphasize pure story. It's not an incredibly lengthy game (especially if you turn off sound and read like the wind), but so rewarding - each path is worth playing for the diversity of the primary plot, and there are diverse subplots with support characters also to be enjoyed.   What you can expect: a visual novel with a number of turns and twists with better replay value through additional, very different storylines than I have ever encountered in the genre. Voice acting is quite compelling (I listened through a couple of storylines) and the soundtrack contributes substantially to the mood.   If you haven't played the first game, you should, exploring at least each of the demon paths. Knowing the backstory will contribute a lot to your understanding the scenarios presented here.  Adult content caution: Seduce Me 2 has a lot more sexuality than Seduce Me, but the jump is from PG or maybe PG-13 (in film levels) to a soft R. The real leap in terms of challenging content is implied violence. Parts of this story are very dark. But that's some of what made this game so compelling.",
