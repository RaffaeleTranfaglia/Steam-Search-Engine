I feel my burning Japanese spirit swell up with pride as I dodge the yankee devil danmaku and sacrifice myself so that my comrades might walk over my corpse and onward to victory. This is the spirit of kantorai, something you gaijin would never understand. Long live the Emperor. I give this game 10/10.",

Unless you're a bullet-hell/danmaku ninja, you have to save your doll roster for specific bosses and reaching the end of the game. Several unlockable units and bosses for the truly skilled. It's not Bug Princess (Mushihimesama, they made a port of that for iOS, LOLOLOLOL), but it's still hella tough.",

            "review_text": "An interesting gimmick for a bullet hell. You have to charge up a bomb by surviving during boss fights then suicide dive the boss to do any damage. If you get hit by a bullet, you die and therefore don't blow up and do damage, enjoy sitting around charging your bomb again. Better hurry up though, the boss goes full lunatic mode if you take too long. Oh and also, you can't run into the parts that are vulnerable while the boss is moving, because that means it's attacking and therefore makes it so you don't explode on contact for some reason. It's an interesting gimmick, but that doesn't make it fun.",

            "review_text": "Hitogata Happa is a Japanese bullet hell shoot’em up that will not only test your patience but your skill and reaction time as well. I have played lots of bullet hell games on steam, but none can hold a candle to how hardcore Hitogata Happa is. The bullet patterns are absolutely insane and the fantastic musical score will get you pumped as you wade through endless walls of impassable bullets. Unlike other games, Hitogata Happa offers you a ♥♥♥♥ ton of ship variety. Each ship has its pros and cons which require practice for an understanding of how they work. Boss fights are epic and they all have extra mechanics that make them extra fun to fight. Sadly, no matter how much I love this game, it’s not for everyone. It is very hard; the first boss fight will rage quit most people. However, if you are a fan of Japanese bullet hell, this is the best you are going to get until TouHou makes it to steam.",

            "review_text": "Hitogatta Happa would be a game that you'll hate to hate. It's a quite engaging little manic shooter, DoDonPachi-style, based on a buyable/sacrificable ship-bomb mechanic. A somewhat interesting feature that you'll forget rapidly when you'll be confronted to the load of flaws that the game suffers and the intense amount of frustration coming from cruel and unusual gameover mechanics (You need to suicide your doll/ship on the boss to bomb him, and inflict enough damage to kill him before the timeout, whatever your skill is, this becomes overly complicated passed stage 2).  Buy it only if you're really into manic shooters and are looking for a new game to beat. Otherwise, I can only advice you to spend your money on other games.  4.5/10  Pros :  + Relatively cheap + Localized + Not  that  bad  Cons :   - Glitchy controls on keyboard - Unreadable action - Terrible HUD - Uninspired patterns - Unfairly punishing 'instakill-on-timeout' mechanic - No visible hitbox ? Seriously ? - Locked in 640*480 - Gratuitous engrish everywhere. - Frustratingly near from being an actually good game  ",

            "review_text": "This is a surprising little gem of an overhead shooter. Never thought I'd be using dolls to blast massive bad guys out of the sky before. Thing is, this game is tuff even on easy mode but fun enough to keep coming back for more punishment. Other than blowing up bad guys outta the sky in this bullet hell game, you are also fighting the clock in the boss battles. I didn't care much for the clock because the boss battles were hard enough in themselves. Too have a boss on the ropes and almost dead, then lose to the clock... frustrating. In the first level you begin with only one type of doll, weak primary fire but has the most massive destructive bomb mode. Using the bomb mode is usually the fastest way to take down a boss, the difficulty is getting close enough with the bullet hell on the screen. Bomb mode isn't cheap nor easy, first the doll has to power up to it and second, you lose that doll's life in using it. But then you are going to lose it anyways if you don't beat the clock in the boss mode. Other dolls can be bought with the crystals you collected on the first level and each type has different modes of attacks and firepower and all have that bomb mode. The graphics are pretty average for a 2.5-D over the top shooter and the music is simple and doesn't distract from the game. The controls are spot on which is a must in a bullet dodging game with two modes of speed. Hold you shoot button down and you move slower allowing the finer points of dodging shots and tap to double your speed to dodge bigger things. Another positive thing about this game is it doesn't give cheap shots as you fight your way to a boss, no enemies that pop out of nowhere and boxes you in. But that doesn't keep the game from releasing dozens of enemies on the screen at a time. I really like this game even though I can only really play it on easy and this game may look simple, it's a really fun challenge. As far as recommending? I'd recommend this over 9/10ths of the other garbage overhead shooters I've seen out there...",

The selection of characters (after the first stage) makes it a lot easier and the experience more interseting and customizable-- definitely try all of them once you can.",
