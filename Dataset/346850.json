            "review_text": "This is a faithful remake using the CC2 engine of the orginal game. It's more closer to the orginal Lynx version with it's animated tiles, than the Microsoft made one that was in Microsoft's Entertainment Pack Four (and the microsoft version have a few bugs and mistakes). As this is a game I played since I even obtained my first Compaq 486 computer, I think this is one of the ulterior classic puzzle games and worth picking up if you never played it before.  The only complaint is that it runs at a fixed resolution, should been a option to zoom in 2x-3x.",

Admittedly, the music from the Lynx version was miles better than this, but that is easily rectified, due to some clever folks on here modding it in. A great time waster of a game, and one of my all time favorites at sucking you in, for that one more try at the level you cant beat. We never had saves back then, so you had to beat it to get code for next level. Ah, them were the days!  Great stuff!",

If people complain about the music just being some MIDIs of old songs, yeah you're right but  1. It's to remind you the game was originally on WINDOWS 95  2. You can turn it off in preferences.  The puzzles are incredibly hard (CURSE YOU NUTS AND BOLTS AND YOUR PATH!!!!), but there's alot of satisfaction when you complete a level because you solved it.  And by the way, Chips Challenge 2. It was previously unreleased (IDK why) but ported over, go give that a try (and the level editor!).",

Me am my younger brother played this as kids ages ago... until the old pentium PC gave up the ghost  The bottom line:   Collect all chips and head for the exit on each level. Colourful and intuitive. Despite a limited set of sprites and game mechanics there is enough variety to design a ton of levels. Excellent time sink or for a quick break. Music is repetitive but you can mute it. Price tag seems high for simple abandonware but I don't mind.  Definitely recommend for anyone who played it before and enjoyed it.  PS - who else thinks blobnet level 23 qualifies for cruel and unusual punishment?   ",
