When you play this game just relax and enjoy, for being their very first game it's pretty good, the voice acting it's superb and their graphics and ambiance really do their job.  I wish they did something else with the all being a dream thingy like bizarre architecture and such but still I enjoyed every moment of the game.  Maybe it's not worth the full 10 bucks price but if you wanna help a new indie team make better stuff just give it a shoot.",

Mhh, okay play it for the beauty: 'Recommended grafics: Geforce 950You Deserv'...might look nice... WRONG, it looks like it would run on Onboard grafics.  Oookay, play it for the story...Meeep, there no real story. At least I didn't experience any.  Right, then, ermh, play it to get the creeps...It's not creepy at all, sorry.
