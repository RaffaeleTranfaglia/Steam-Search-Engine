            "review_text": "Nice idea, but didn't work for me.  Part of it was using the gamepad. I've seen the gamepad work fine in VR, in such games as IO Moon. But it didn't work for me here. Maybe rewrite the game for VIVE controls and teleporting?  This is the first VR game to give me VR sickness. I can see why they went for flying, but the speed is way too high. Particularly the turning. Adding some speed control options might be a help.",
