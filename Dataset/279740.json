            "review_text": "I know this software is only 5 bucks..but.. I still wouldn't recommend it for doing special effects. The UI and program set up seems to be made for Win 95 or even lower. The file system menu seems to be out of order and needs quite a bit of work done to it. You cant even open up a new project under the File menu.  On the other hand.. if you would like a effect library to just use as a reference to do in other software.. I would recommend it. It does have a bunch of built in effects you may want to view just to get the feel of how you may do them in other software. Just remember you get what you pay for.",
