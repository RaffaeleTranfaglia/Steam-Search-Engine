I would recomend this game to anyone looking for a free racing game to waste time.  The things I do not like about the game is: No collisions Complicated menu Weird controls (not that big of a deal)  Things I do like: Customization  The look and fell of the cars as you drive them It's a free racing game (you don't see that often) The sounds  Note: Because I said it was good for wasting time does not mean that it isn't enjoyable. What I mean by this is its a fun thing to do to pass the time while your wating on something to be done.  (Thanks to the devs for fixing the login problem)",

Game has many flaws - window mode and can't replace window position... can't change video setting during race. Unclear menu... shop that is loading infinite time. :&lt; Graphics are nice, even gameplay is not bad, but overall it's kinda poor. And it's not even about lack of players.",

            "review_text": "Simply, a great racing game. Great mechanics, and a great idea … Not so great rewards for races, and, at this point, a non-existent community… In more depth, this game has been dead for the past year… The most players you would find online at any given point would be 2, maybe 3… Now that it is Free To Play, we will see if this changes. Suffice to say, however, The developers have basically said that Victory's fate is widely unknown, and I suspect that once their new game 'Racecraft' hits Early Access, Victory will be put to the curb.  Even so, I feel it does warrant a try. However, unless you are perfectly fine with having the game destroyed at some unannounced point, and all your progress gone with it, I wouldn't dedicate too much time to it…  ... Honestly, I'm surprised they brought the servers back up after their 'issues'...  I love the game to death, but it's completely based around the fact that there is a community behind it... Which there isn't...  In a brief summary, sadly to say, i don't recommend this game, or their new game, Racecraft, or any other game this developer comes out with, because, after all this time, all we are given is a crappy tach demo of a system that i would argue is borderline worthless in this style of racing game, and the announcement that the game we paid for, stood behind, and supported for so long while being left in the dark, is going free 2 play and has, essentially, already been taken out back and shot.",
