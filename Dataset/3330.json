That doesn't mean 'or newer', that's  just that release . So if you're still rockin' Leopard it's a good game and probably one of the few that will run on a system of that vintage. Or it's great if you have a PC, which is where all my play has happened. Newer Macs, don't waste your money. Thumbs up for the game itself, thumbs down for the misleading labeling of supported systems.",

            "review_text": "Other game I had contact in my childhood. This was my second PopCap game and it is other great puzzle game. Although it was heavily inspired in Puzzle Loop I really like PopCap's version. The goal is to control a (stone?) frog that sends coloured balls to destroy others of the same colour, and all of this to free a god from a spell and be accepted among them. It is fun and addictive, but it is a really difficult game. The Adventure mode gets progressily hard by adding more colours, harder maps and reaching 'Zuma!' takes longer. Be prepared for frustration after you clear the first two temples! Then there is the Gauntlet mode where it works as a survival mode and you try to break your own records as soon as you unlock more maps. And sadly it is all what Zuma Deluxe offers so expect repetitiveness. If you enjoy a casual puzzle game but yet challenging, Zuma Deluxe is worth a trial.",
