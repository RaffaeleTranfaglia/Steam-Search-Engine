The buildings and colonists are schematic - but who really needs them? It's as always only you and the contest. All the others are schemes. Always. And this game only shows it in it's simplicity.",

            "review_text": "The mix of resource management, tower defense and 'city builder' makes an interesting genre combination. That is all rymdkapsel is: an interesting idea lacking any substance. It is like a good puzzle game, but rymdkapsel does not give you a variety of challenges you would expect to get in a puzzle game ('it is too short').   If you don't mind me oversimplifying - you choose rooms to construct which are randomly tetris-shaped - then your job is to assign tasks to your minions (to construct or defend). But you do not control your minions directly, you only assign tasks, and if lucky the AI will do exactly what you want. Periodically waves of enemies will invade randomly destroying your minions and resources. You need to be challenged but the way the enemy work feels like your success is more based on luck.   The graphics are simple pleasing geometric shapes. The soundtrack adds to the casual atmosphere and you never feel too threatened - until you suffer a major collapse of your minions and die the next wave.   If you are interested in playing a time sensitive puzzle game, then rymdkapsel is a worthy purchase if it is on sale.",

If you're looking for a different kind of RTS, or a different kind of puzzle game, this fits the bill in both cases.",

            "review_text": "To be really fair, I'm rather mixed about this game. Rymdkapsel is a minimal real time strategy game featuring a space station that you're supposed to manage, whether it's about expanding it or defending yourself from waves of hostiles. The whole premise is in fact quite simple: survival. But here's where it gets perhaps too simple.  There's no story, leaving you to come up with your own adventure and fantasize about whatever comes into your mind. That's fine. But what about adding some actual depth to the gameplay? The latter consists of a few types of room you can build/manage, three kinds of resources that you'll almost end up not using (especially food, which becomes rather useless since you won't need it that much compared to energy/blue cubes and minerals/pink squares), and only a few side objectives that become your main once you realize this is what the whole game has to offer.  The monoliths could have been used to actually shed a bit of light on a possible backstory involving space archeology or perhaps even the origins of your own space station. Who dispatched you there in the middle of nowhere to begin with? Who is your people, consisting only of blocks in an isometric square world? You know, giving some more spice other than 'here's something, grab it'.  I also would have loved if the AI leading your work squad wasn't so sluggish and primitive. For instance, if you have a series of corridors you need to build in order to get to a Monolith and have more than two minions working on it, you can witness the AI's incapacity for queueing tasks, leading minions to BACKTRACK and start over again if a piece of corridor gets finished before they're able to deliver the needed resources.  Furthermore, since Monoliths actually grant some substantial boosts to your management, you'd want to get there ASAP and make sure your minions don't get annihilated by incoming waves... something very likely to happen because the route is often quite long from the starting point and minions don't have enough time to reach their turrets, leading you to build extra minions again and wait countless turns to even build more weaponries near the Monoliths. I'd consider that more a design flaw than an actual challenge since it's also the only thing providing some difficulty to the experience and the game itself is designed to be 'finished' under 45 minutes.  The soundtrack is almost non-existent, consisting only of a single drone ambiance that vaguely reminds you of 70's space music and a few sound effects functional to the game itself and that's about it.  Overall, I expected a lot better from this game since I was initially intrigued by the design choices which ultimately left me quite 'cold' and wishing for more. It's not easy to work out a 'minimal' formula that works in a certain context, often leaving the experience at a mediocre state because it fails to provide depth to the lack of elements which is pretty much rymdkapsel's case.",

It sets out to do a purpose and it performed it perfectly: A small streamlined base-building game with only click-touch control and simple goals.

It's just that you'll probably play this game and then feel as though it wasn't a good way to spend time. There's not a lot to it and not a lot of compulsion to reach goals. Hang on to the money for something with even a bit more meat to it, that's my call.",
