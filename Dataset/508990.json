            "review_text": " I mean,  Handsome Mr. Frog  isn't some great gem, but what it sets out to do, it does quite well - and it's only a buck.   The worst part about the game is how simple and one-dimensional the gameplay is.  Essentially, you use your tongue to catch enemies and knock throw them around to kill them in a couple of ways.  Other than jump, it's your only other action. The whole level is seen on a single screen. While there is a theme with animals, the artistic cohesion is debatably wonky.    Pros:  +Fairly tight controls +The artwork is crisp, albeit fairly 'meh' when it comes to pixel art +It is cheap   Cons:  -Overly simple, and in a bad way - this results to it not really being that addicting to be honest -You get wayyy too many lives IMO, which means games go on for entirely too long -Some level design is questionable because several times there was a safe area where I could just spam attack and I would never get it; it amounted to reduced fun, to be sure -The hit-box to catch things with your tongue is too large, allowing you to pull off some wacky catches that look more like a glitch than a clever trick   I almost gave it a negative review, but the price-point made me switch.  Just understand that the game is really simple, so don't expect meta-game progression, items, leveling up, story, unlocks, or really anything other than the two actions you get.  Peace, ",

            "review_text": "Disclosure Disclaimer: I know the composer personally. Didn't realize it upon purchasing the game, though. Got the game because I like old-school arcade titles.  Either way--this game is a surprising fun romp with elements similar to Mario Bros., Snow Bros., and Bubble Bobble. At some points it can get challenging, but that doesn't fully occur until the third and fourth world change. It's difficulty is balanced enough to where I think somebody with enough experience with platformers could have an engaging experience, but simple enough to where it's not too demanding, and feels classic. It's a great neo-arcade title, that's a great deal for the mere asking price of a buck.  If you're interested, another good neo-arcade title that nobody knows about is, Gon' E-Choo (that one plays like Popeye, 1982).  If I didn't feel morally wrong giving this a proper review (since I know the composer), I'd easily give it a score over or around an 8... though... I suppose recommending it counts as a review, so my credibilty is gone... It's a fun pick up and play, nevertheless.",
