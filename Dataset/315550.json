            "review_text": "The game isn't as bad as some of the other reviewers indicate. The graphics are antiquated. Neither the driving nor the management simulation portion are as good as they should be. When I bought it, it was priced at 12.99. I would say 4.99 would make this a good deal to kill a couple of hours.  The repetition of the driving missions gets tedious. It takes too long to build up money. It's too easy to lose it. So, it's accurate to real life. I would recommend a bit more time spent developing the management side and then beefing up the driving portion. Perhaps the developer could spin the game into two separate components that can be combined? Maybe handing off the driving portion to someone who specializes in that, and work on a more sophisticated economy and management sim? I don't know. Just remember, this is an indie offering, and it really COULD be worse.  For those still reading, there is one trick I found to help you get off the ground more quickly. Sell the first car you get immediately. That car is worth 2000. Then you can buy two of that same car right away, and hire a driver. That should help those who don't mind giving this simplistic indie offering a chance.",

            "review_text": "Typical indie game, this time it's about driving the taxi. - game is a bit bugged, but nothing that can kill the mood. Be careful with hired drivers though, they have a tendency of being dumb when you spectate them - only one view, but camera is doing an okay job to show you the road. Traffic lights are shown not only as usual, but as lines on the road too, which is helpful. Speed limit is shown all the time, it's 30 or 40, depends on the street - no Steam Achievements, no trading cards. Yes, it has few in-game achievements, but when do Steam users care about them? - 3 different cars per each of three regions (makes 9 cars at the end), first one is unlocked, others are unlockable by collecting 5 of their parts - not too many opportunities for an actual management - hire driver, buy him a car, upgrade it a bit, tell him to go out and start picking passengers, spectate him, drive for him. That's pretty much it. Oh, and upgrades aren't enchancing the perfomance of car, but decreasing it's maintenance - money can be earned easily if you know what to do (you can fill 8-slot cab depot in 10 minutes by only completing emergency client pickups) and can be spent even easier on cab upgrades, which will in overall cost you ten times more than your car, trust me - physics.... It's an arcade! What would you expect?  At the end i can tell you one thing:  Look at the gameplay videos. Ask yourself, do you think it will be boring for you if you will be driving around like this for couple of hours? No? Not boring? Well, that means you are like me, who likes driving games. Spend some money, spend couple of hours, maybe couple of evenings, then forget about this game. Boring? Go find yourself somethins else, this is just an indie game about driving taxi, not some Crazy Taxi ",

The game is fun and something i can spend hours in, but there is no fun when the GPS dont work, the AI cars stops up, Cars in the street stops that makes your cars stop to, etc.  Recommended? Not for now If they fix the glitches its worth buying, but intil that, its not good.",
