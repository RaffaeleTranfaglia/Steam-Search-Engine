            "review_text": "Lack of free for all mode in versus: brought over two friends and one of us always had to have an AI as a partner.  The map layouts are kinda stagnant, but that could just be me comparing it to Powerstone. Also online multiplayer would really benefit this game.  Beyond those complaints it's a solid well polished game. ",
