            "review_text": "This game feels like one of Reiner Knizia's board games. It's very well constructed, much thought over, easy to learn but difficult to master. And, what's characteristic to Knizia's games - it's pure mechanic. The story is redundant. You could as well play as a square gathering circles from the map.  I am really into Norse mythology and was looking forward to playing Munin because of the connotations, yet I feel fooled. It's platform, not 'adventure' as one of the main tag states.  Another reason why I give a 'thumbs down' for this fairly good game is because its puzzles do not give you the sesne of satisfaction after solving them.  No reward, just tedious level after level after level.",

            "review_text": " tl;dr -&gt; If you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a grid-world with rotating pieces and stab yourself in the brain multiple times, then this is the game for you.   I got this game gifted to me by one of my super generous friends, and I've since added it to my list of go-to puzzlers (that also drive me crazy).   If you like fairly casual, puzzle platformers with a novel mechanic, then you will probably enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are decent, the artstyle and detail in the background is okay. The music and sounds are calming, which can sometimes cause irritation when I am struggling to solve one of the stages and failing miserably over and over; however, it matches the ambiance of the game. I eventually turned off the sound, as it got repetitive pretty quickly.   The controls are very simple - you click to rotate parts of the world, and move with the WASD keys. Due this simplicity, there isn't really a difference between using the keyboard+mouse combo vs. a controller, so it comes down to personal preference. There isn't really a tutorial, but the main goal is simple enough, so it isn't required - you just have to collect all of the raven feathers littered around each level without dying. The learning curve is minimal to (probably) challenging, depending on your proficiency at puzzle-based games. A lot of pre-planning and trial and error will be used here, so understanding how the level pieces fit together (and the correct order to gather the feathers) is essential to success. It is possible to get physically stuck in a level if all the surrounding level pieces are inaccessible, and if this happens (with no way to escape, like filling your piece with water so you can reach another piece), then you will have to restart.   There are different 'worlds,' each with a unique theme and a set of levels. For example, one world will have rolling rocks that you must manipulate to help you reach higher areas, while also avoiding them crushing you to death. Another world (I am currently stuck on this one) requires you to play with water streams to help you reach places - you will fill spaces with water so you can swim and jump higher. The mechanics in each level add to the variety of strategies you must use, and you can invest at least a few hours playing through the entire game. Other hazards like spikes, fire pits, etc may litter the levels, and touching these will instantly kill you, forcing you to restart. This can be particularly frustrating if progress through a level requires many steps, but persevering will really help you find the solution (eventually). In the later levels, you may also encounter a new mechanic - rotating one square in the level will also rotate another one. Keep in mind, you CANNOT rotate a square that your character is standing in. I've found a sort of loophole - if you can hop between two squares quickly enough (this is quite rare), you can rotate a block and then immediately land on that same block; however, I have not noticed any puzzle requiring you to do this so far. It also has not really helped me solve any particular level.   Overall, the game is the right amount of challenging, and puzzle enthusiasts should definitely give this one a try.  Recommend.

            "review_text": "Nice puzzle game with loads of twists and turns. You will use all your brain capazity on later levels. The firsts ones just to get you warm. I can promise that you will bend your brain more than once. The gfx is not bad but not super great either but that is not important here! The game mechanics is fun and the game runs fluid. I would recommend that you played this together with some friends so you could laugh on each others attempts to complete the levels or just help each others out.  GFx 7-10 (Gfx of the character and some background animations are really good but levels could use some polish if you want to be nick picky) SFx 8-10 (Music is ambient and fits this type of game) Gameplay 9-10 (Controlls are great and the puzzles are fun and challenging)  I will gladly recommend this game. Daedelic have once again released a quality gem.",

You have to collect all the feathers of metal so he can bring the metal back to Midgard and save us from all the crappy autotune pop music.  Also, it's a really cool puzzle game where you rotate parts of the screen to make your way through. Sometimes the sections of screen are linked, which makes for some interesting puzzles.

Each world has a different obstacle you have to work with, like platforms, water, lava, boulders, matching runes. Only the last world combines some of these obstacles to make it trickier. You spin parts of the level in order to make a path for your character to walk through safely. Most of the time you have a lot of time to think about what you are doing. A few times you need to move quick.",

Safe to say, I was very wrong. A poorly-animated and uncanny creature runs around 'interesting' puzzles and refuses to speak or do much other than perpetually stare at me, the player, with that uncanny-valley face that's as much bird as it is human. While I appreciate the concept, I am thoroughly disappointed in its presentation. 2/10, the puzzles are at least enjoyable when they aren't dumb as all hell (the water mechanic makes no sense)",
