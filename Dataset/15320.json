After destroying 4 A-20 bombers, I then decided to drop down to about 1000-2000 feet to get a better view of the map. Now I am no pilot from the 1940s and this proved it because in my mind I figured the best way down was to just point the nose down and drop. This was a mistake. Around 4000 feet, my engine stopped and my left flap had literally sprung off the plane. I ended up gliding until I reached Caen and then crashed landed....all in all this is just utterly fantastic as a flight simulator and a dog fight game. 2000 feet out of 2000 feet.",

For it's age, it still looks really nice, planes are fairly low poly by todays standards but highly detailed, especially cockpits. You can also use a shader injector like Reshade to add some ambient lighting, HDR etc to make it look more up to date. Can't recommend this game enough to anyone with a joystick or even a gamepad as it's perfectly playable with just a pad too. Bargain.",

            "review_text": "Probably 10 years ago, I was heavily invested in the IL-2 franchise, with both 'Aces' and 'Forgotten Battles' expansions, and later the 'Pacific Fighters' module. It just BARELY ran on my cheap, office desktop, and i had issues with the CPU overheating because of this game, but I played anyway because it was AMAZING. I had always been a fan of the WW2 flight sims from Microsoft, but this was a cut above. I really felt like I was IN the plane, not on a simulator.   I had heard a lot of people saying that 1946 wouldnt work on Win 10. Recently, I heard a large number of people had success getting it to run. Since I hadn't enjoyed the game in 6-8 years, I dropped my $10 on trying it - and was blown away by how well it held up! See, I had just bought IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad a week prior, and was (still am) in love with it. However, I loved reading about all the old planes as a youngster, and to be able to fly 229 of the most famous, and the most obscure, aircraft of the era is like a dream come true.   The only gripe some may have are the interior visuals - they look very dated. They are, however, immersive, and entirely 3d, so It isn't unplayable. The exterior visuals really hold up well. If you compare it to BoS or Even 'Rise of Flight' you can tell it's a bit older, but it still looks good. The worst textures come from ground units - tanks, jeeps, AA positions, all look like theyre from the 1990's, but since you won't see them for more than a second, I really don't notice.  If you're a Win 10 user, thinking about trying the more expensive BoS, maybe give this a try - I find myself playing it more than its hotter, newer sibling.  :::UPDATE:::  I ordered a USB Bluetooth adapter for my PC, as I play several controller-based games also. I neglected to remove my controller from both the USB charging cable, and the bluetooth device manager, and it ultimately deactivated my joystick. Once I realized the error, and removed my PS4 controller from the computer entirely, my joystick began to work again. Simply a word of caution to avid gamers.",

Of course, its graphics have aged quite a bit and you will probably need a good flight stick to get the most out of it, but all in all, the experience is amazing and it's a must have for aviation fans.  10/10 BF-109 best planefu",

Plenty of planes and maps, as well as pre-made missions. Comes with a great career mode too, where you join one of the many different airforces available and serve in historically accurate missions. The fun part is that the career continues as long as your pilot is alive, meaning that all of your air kills, rewards, medals and promotions throughout the war are tracked up to the point where your pilot dies, making you actually give a damn about that little silly looking model in the cockpit :D   The only downside to this is that multiplayer is a bit hard to get access to, the base game requires you to specify IP to whoever you want to connect, and there is no server browser, but you can fix that by downloading Hyper Lobby which acts as a server browser. You may also have to downgrade to 4.10.1m(I believe thats the version UP and similar packs use).",

Ideally, you'd also want to use a joystick, as the control scheme is much more fluid and easy to use with a stick compared to the keyboard.  Once you start the game you can choose between doing the story missions or trying out pilot school, which is intended to prepare you for the more intense story missions. There are also video tutorials available to watch, which are extremely useful and strongly recommended. The videos will teach you everything from taking off, to landing, to dropping bombs on your enemies and dogfighting.  At the start, I had A LOT of trouble getting my plan to even successfully lift off the ground. Be patient, as you will probably see many 'engine inoperable' notifications (if you haven't already blown up or overheated your engine by this point). The control scheme is a little spread out, but it shouldn't be too difficult to familiarize yourself with the layout. The learning curve for the game is not too steep, but it can be difficult in the beginning. Give yourself plenty of time to get used to taking off, and everything else will be easy to pick up after that.  The graphics are a little dated, but when you get into a skirmish or large-scale battle, you will love the intensity of the fighting.   Definitely recommend for the (war) flight simulator junkies.",

            "review_text": "Recommendation with a big asterisk.  Il-2 isn't for everyone. It's not really a game but rather a WWII combat flight simulator with incredible depth and a large selection of available planes that come with great mechanical detail. Before you purchase or play this game you need to be prepared for that. Furthermore you have to prepared for the fact that there is no easy way in. You will need to spend several hours before you can even hit an enemy once. If you don't have a big interest in WWII warbirds from both sides there's nothing to keep you intrigued other than the gameplay which is incredibly customizable and deep though.  Enter the big asterisk. Everything you get from the game is what you bring into it. There's no storyline, no interesting campaign, just no character to any of it, nothing to welcome you into the world of historical air combat. The 'training' is laughable and the included missions are plain boring and uninspired. Unless you want to delve deep into the mission editor you're lost, the quick mission builder is less than stellar. The community is not very helpful either when it comes to modding the 15 year old engine so with every aspect of Il-2 you're basically left to your own devices. With a little effort from the developers this could have been a wonderful experience for a wider audience. Much older games like the Red Baron series have shown what an immersive campaign mode can add to a simulator.   I can still recommend Il-2 though based on its mechanical strength and commendable wealth of content. Ever since my earliest childhood I've been a hardcore airplane nerd and just being able to fly my fantasy league of planes into combat with my entire keyboard scattered with shortcuts is enough to recommend this simulator to like-minded inviduals with too much time on their hands. Everyone else will be left standing in the rain. You will need patience, dedication and a good joystick and even then it's no guarantee you will like it. I can't blame anyone who never got into Il-2, personally I fell asleep playing similarly deep and realistic games like the Arma series.  For those who are complaining this game is unplayable without a joystick: no sh*t, this is not war thunder.",

The tactical depth is infinite and the difficulty is high but the satisfaction of improving your skills is immense. This is a hardcore flight simulator, so don't expect a shallow learning curve. Speed, accuracy and finesse with the controls are a must. Situational awareness is equally critical, as are reflexes, decisionmaking and tactical analysis, teamwork and communication, etc. The demands are high, but the reward is great. Of course you also have to fly your plane; proper engine management is very important, as is a basic understanding of aerodynamics and flight physics.. However, while the game DOES expect alot from you, it does also strike a near-perfect balance by introducing the challenge of a flight simulator while avoiding overly-complicated modern avionics and difficult-to-learn computer systems. cont'd..",

The campaigns are diverse as well, where else can you fly for the Finnish air force against Russian invaders in a Brewster Buffalo? I spend a good amount of time just flying different aircraft around and checking out the scenery. The one thing I would like is that New Guinea could be included in the flying around part, you can only fly New Guinea as part of your combat tour.",

You have all kinds of planes and you can have even more so because of the mod compatibility which is another reason why this game is worth the buy. If you like the IL-2 BoS but you don't have the money or the PC to play it, then this is the closest thing you'll get to it.   +The game can be very fun and action packed and very boring and dull from time to time. Like when you're flying to Black Sea with your Pe-3 to bomb some ships, that can be boring but when you get to the action, it definitely is worth it.   +Playing as a bomber, you can control your gunners. Not just in 3rd person mode as in War Thunder but also 1st person. (Oh yes).   +Flying a fighter and setting someone on fire or blowing an engine out of a twin engine aircraft or just shooting planes down in general is very very rewarding.  +The game has national voices. That means you'll her '♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥s' and 'UUURAAAAA's when you fly Russian. Jokes aside the voice acting is really good and feels realistic.  -Altough some of the sound effects are not that good, you can always use the help of the modding community to improve it. As in visual effects goes the same.    So yeah just go for it as it is on a discount which is almost free when you look at it.",
