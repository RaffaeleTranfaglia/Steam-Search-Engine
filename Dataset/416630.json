Pros  British humour. Nice mini game. I like the lighthearted nature of the game which means no downers.  Negs Story arc is kinda fixed and left me wanting more. No text for audio messages. Story wrapped up too quickly. ",

            "review_text": "A good improvement after “Last Days of Spring”. The art style is nice (even tho there are some issues… Mostly with the proportion. Even so, the coloring was nice and the characters were pretty), but I highly disliked the BGs and the videos during the VN. In my opinion, it didn’t matched at all. I think that the game would be better with realistic BGs with filters (like in Higurashi), and with no videos. The soundtrack was good, some songs are catchy.  The minigames were ok, but after a while they might get a bit annoying, and there’s no point on them: they do not have any influence upon the story. The VA by the ending was so bad that when I listened to Santiago’s message I laughed so hard that I chocked on my tea. That voice doesn’t match that character at all, he doesn’t sound sexy, he sounds like some stereotypical Spanish character, a very bad one. Scott’s VA was bad too, but far better than Santi’s.   The endings were dull. The 3 endings are literally just a few lines, and that’s it, the end. This game had some potential, unfortunately it turned out bad. It takes effort to make a good VN, especially one dealing with romance; people will not feel a connection with characters after they speak 3 cheesy pick up lines. I felt a better connection between the MC and her best friend Lucas. It was nice reading their conversations, and I wonder why there’s no route for Lucas. He surely is more interesting than the 2 main love interests.   Still, I wish the best of luck to the developers, and I will keep looking forward to their next releases.   3/10. Get it on a good sale or better, don’t.",

            "review_text": "Even though not the intended target group (women) I can safely discuss all the things that are wrong with this from a technical and artistic standpoint. And if women actually like the 'love interests' in this game I have to seriously question their mental health.  First off, you can now skip cutscenes unlike other reviews say (thank god). Minigame re-do is offscreen (wtf?), log is horribly unusable, everyone uses the same color for talking. Skip button also gets stuck, but at that point I stopped caring about the game altogether anyway. Aside from that there's a weird mix of drawn characters with real-life action vids, photographic backgrounds (including ones with people the drawn ones are placed inmidst, extremely jarring) and does this VN use the 'few hours later', 'a wild night later', 'some drinks later' rather than, you know... describe it like a VN should. Also shouldn't have stopped my IT-studies, it can help you fix telephones, laptops, engines, ships. Minigame is done to death on everything, really stretching the limits of IT (or how often your phone/tablet breaks in 24 hours).  Saving the worst for last, Santiago. This rap'ist-would-be that's extremely creepy and you want to get rid of ASAP is FORCED upon you not once, but twice. Sure you can reject him the first time but the game still conviently responds the evening after if you slept with him, and doesn't even gives that leniency the second time when GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE in your mind makes you click 'go away' it just re-loops the conversation till you finally sleep with him. HOLY CREEPY SH-IT game. After that, I can't say I really bothered much with this VN anymore, definitely not cool game.",

            "review_text": "This is the first review I have ever left on steam (or almost anywhere) so know that I truely felt the need to to say my piece on this game. Like many others, I too was immeditatly pulled in by the look and premise of this game. however after over an hour game play that was mostly just intrusive and mandatory 'mini-games' that honestly take up more of the game than the game itself I had to turn it off.  CONS 1. Mini-game, after mini-game, after mini-game. I don't think the tags 'visual novel' or 'story rich' should be on this game at all. Also if there was a way to skip them, I didn't see it. 2. the characters are awful, as in poorly written fan-fiction bad. 3. the MC's only personality trait seem to be: 'I can fix that!' 4. As some have mentioned before me, the awful, awful forced 'sleep with the masogynist' plot. I thought my option was me turning the jerk down. Nope!  5. The 'story' was hard to imerse myslef in as the few cuts scenes I got were so abrupt that they were just jarring. the live action cut scenes ruined the feel for me. After a while I seemed to not be getting choices at all, just mini-games. 6. All of the characters are supposed to be in their mid to late 20's, but most look like high schoolers at best.",
