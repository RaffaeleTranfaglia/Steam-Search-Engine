The original game used to run on some low resolution, and was so obvious. The age of the title had something to do with it ;)  But as it was, it didn't really matter to me. I would love being able to sit down and do what I wanted to do. I didn't have to kill everyone off, I could get the 'artifacts' or build a wonder to win. Even the Regiside (kill the enemy king(s)) gamemode is a good gamemode.  Multiplayer isn't as good but it's nice to be able to play with friends again. With all RTS titles, it's whoever can rush the enemy the fastest. That's what bugs me about the multiplayer. If you can get over that, there's no major outstanding issues. ELO ranking has been added, but don't base your skill off of it.  Even though it may look like it supports old machines, there was a requirement for some new shader/texture thanks to the water. Not sure if it really is the water, but you need a dedicated card of some sort. Old Intel GMA graphics don't support it. So any reasonable card such as a GT 8600 or GT 9800 would make a great choice here.  7/10",

            "review_text": "Age of Empires II: Age of Kings was originally released in 1999, and it is one of the most influential titles in one of real-time strategy’s most celebrated franchises. It holds a special place within gaming history as a solid, meat-and-potatoes RTS generously drizzled with rich historical gravy.  Age of Empires II: HD’s main changes are updates to the graphics engine, allowing the game to be compatible with modern machines. The game has been overhauled to allow players to take advantage of HD displays and multiple monitors. But one of the strongest elements of the re-release is the score, which has been lovingly remixed. The music now evokes a more sophisticated mood than it did previously, and it’s something that adds greatly to the feel of the game.  This edition of Age of Empires II includes The Conquerors expansion, so fans wanting to replay the campaigns will find hours of familiar scenarios. These haven’t aged particularly well; the scripting system compares poorly with other titles, particularly Blizzard’s Warcraft III and StarCraft II. There are many instances of breaking the fourth wall, where victory and activation conditions are very obviously scripted rather than fitting seamlessly into gameplay.  The new textures added to water, fire, and earth add a nice new look to the terrain. It’s subtle, but the overall impression is refined and almost painterly. The terrain itself has been one of the biggest changes, with a mesh system now used to give a more even natural landscape. Also gone are the 256 colour UI elements, and the icons have been updated to a more rustic feel to go with the softer 32-bit colour scheme.  The only significant change made at all to gameplay is the raising of the maximum population cap to 500. This is a lost opportunity to fix the kinds of problems that even diehard fans consider simple annoyances. The ability to select more than 20 units would have been a worthy addition, and is simply a control flaw rather than a balance or creative issue. Running at 1920x1080 allows for a huge number of units on one screen, which still need to be divided into small divisions to command in battle.  The most positive change – and one that will justify the price tag for most players – is multiplayer. Although alternative matchmaking services have done much to keep interest in the online game alive over the years since the demise of Microsoft’s clunky Gaming Zone, Steam integration puts players back onto a universal ladder system. The platform’s social features and existing framework also mean players can come to the game with their own networks firmly in place.  So for better or worse, Steam has come along and is now selling a game it’s quite possible many gamers already own in some form or other. The changes are subtle, but well-intentioned and admirably executed. Multiplayer is excellent. Those who loved Age of Empires II should happily indulge in some nostalgia with this HD facelift. Anyone new to the game will be frustrated by the lack of modern control systems and responsive hot keys.    Recommended ",

The gameplay is really addictive and it is so satisfing to watch your civilization grow and dominate everyone else. Playing with other people is a lot of fun and the game compares your skill level to everyone else's so you always know whether or not it will be a far match. That's not to say the game is perfect. As satisfying as the game is when your winning, it's really depressing when your losing; all that hard working building your civilization gone to waste. The learning curve is also really steep, especially if you're unfamiliar with this genre, and getting to the level of skill that most people have online is a bit of a chore. If you can go toe to toe with a 'hardest' level COM your probably ready to play with most of the average tier players. I'd also recommend a youtube channel called 'spirit of the law' if you want any advise on how to play the different civilizations. But it's a lot of fun to learn. I'd recommend it, even if you're not into strategy games. Come on in and play. More people need to. 10/10",

To make matters worse, the latest DLC broke the game even more just in time for the developer to seemingly abandon the game in an absolutely devastating state. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN. If you want to enjoy Age of Empires II get the original game and use a free service like Voobly to play multiplayer.  Original review: Maybe the best RTS game of all time with the 'HD' version adding support for widescreen and a few other minor features. The singleplayer campaigns are perfectly playable and just as fun as they were 14 years ago. Steam Workshop makes installing mods very easy.  HOWEVER, the multiplayer has since release been absolutely riddled with bugs and glitches. FPS lag even on high end PCs, far more lag than the original version, many connectivity bugs and lobby glitches, sometimes forcing a lobby to be recreated several times before it actually works . It is not completely unplayable but the multiplayer experience will get very frustrating very quickly. For now I cannot recommend buying this game, if you already have the original version, stick with it, if not, wait until the bugs get fixed or just get the original.  edit: removed the out of sync part, as this has apparently been fixed in the latest update, all other bugs/annoyances are still in though.",

            "review_text": "I very tentatively recommend this.  'How can you say that?' you might ask, knowing full well that Age of Empires 2 is an excellent game that is widely praised and regarded as a classic. Well, I'll explain.  Age of Empires 2, as a game, is a classic RTS game where you manage a Medieval Civilization, going from a tiny settlement to a sprawling empire. If you don't get invaded first that is. There is a massive focus on combat in this game, most games are decided on the battlefield, with players fielding massive armies against each other to knock out buildings, defences and eventually innocent civilians. But of course, these armies don't come out of nothing, you need to build up some money, gather food, collect wood for buildings and stone for castles. If you aren't familiar with Age of Empires 2, I suggest you look for reviews of that game.  Age of Empires 2 HD is a little different, and not always in a good way.  The upgrades from the original are primarily on the graphical side of things, the updating to a modern lobby-based multiplayer, better mod support and two expansions not originally made for the game. Make no mistake, these aren't all what they're cracked up to be and there's a few problems in this release.  As far as graphics are concerned, the game looks as nice as ever, with only the water reflections, the larger resolutions (which aren't easily adjustable) and a few changed in-game graphics, most of which are welcome additions. To call it HD is perhaps a stretch, but it is graphically superior to its original counterpart.  The modern lobby-based multiplayer is a welcome feature, theoretically allowing for easy and simple online play, without the need for third party clients like Voobly and Gameranger. In practice, the lobby system is very suspect to bugs, with crashes upon game launches occuring frequently and dropouts that halt the game halfway through happening somewhat less frequently. For all the unreliability in Voobly and Gameranger that this system could do away with, it is in many ways inferior, with these problems ocurring less often in either client.  Another couple of things that Voobly and Gameranger players would be able to avoid is the problems that actually happen in-game. Path-finding was never stellar in the original game, but many claim that it has been significantly degraded in this version. Not to mention that the actual game seems to typically run slower, with more log and with more connection problems than it does in Voobly and Gameranger under similar conditions.  The mod support is nice, but the amount of content for AoE2 that isn't on the Steam Workshop is gigantic, which leaves mostly classic and popular scenarios as well as an assortment of other bits and bobs to choose from. Your typical AoE2 player won't be missing out on much, but for those who want really specific things, they might have a hard time to get a hold of them.  And lastly, there's the two expansions. Opinion is divided about these; some say that the new African Kingdoms are extremely powerful, to the point of possibly being imbalanced. And The Forgotten Empires is perceived as being a slew of rather lacking civilizations that don't boast much power, but seem to have very little place in the game. Personally, I think that the African Kingdoms expansion adds a lot to the game and is very fun to play with, even if the new civilizations, particularly the Portugeuse can seem a little tough to play against. As for the Forgotten Empires, it's fun in much the same way, but the civilizations added seem too timid to really add all that much beyond a few interesting unique units and techs to open up a few more strategies than there used to be.  The bugs that make online play well under optimal for such a multiplayer focused game, not to mention one so old and a few of the gameplay problems make me really hesitate to recommend AoE2 HD, because these issues are extremely frustrating and can feel like a dealbreaker. But when the game works, it's as fun as the old AoE2 and sometimes even more so with the higher resolutions, the extra content and the new community. I can't blame you if these bugs get the better of you and you end up going back to Voobly though.",

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, and if you've never played an RTS game, how does creating an empire and conquering your enemies sound?  Endless hours of gameplay are available for even single player alone, and even more hours with LAN or even playing online.

Today you shamelessly take a game thats rattling its bones on the deathbed, and release it in SUPER MODERN HD VERSION™.  Its bones are screeching, its whining, 'free me from the pain!' is what the game is shouting at them, 'end it all!', but the devs put on their best business smile and put the game out onto steam with a 20$ price tag.  20$ price tag! For a game thats 17 years old (as of 2016)!  And the 'expansions' which are 10$ each amount to 20$ extra, if you want the full experience you have to gash out 40 grand. The game didn't cost that much when it came out, and with steam you don't have the excuse of printing disks, shelf space, or included collectibles.

( note that this is my first review )  first i will talk about the cons of the game, ill save the pro's for later. - the game uses the 'genie engine' wich is a old engine, originaly used by the old age of empires. the engine is weak and outdated, there are some big maps in this game wich the engine does not quite support. i also get in some trouble when play with more than 3 friends with the population cap set to 500, probably because of the engine as well. i am using a gaming pc, and i still have this problem, so it can not be because i have potato specs.  - unit pathing is horrible, units will often get stuck or regroup in weird ways, this left me to lose a couple of battles. - the isometric view of the game is iconic and comfortable but also gives fair amount of trouble because some things are unclear to see. - maybe a bit hard to get into the multiplayer, but practice against bots easily customizable, and playing with friends gives you great benefits ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) in learning the game. - 20 euro's is a bit expensive for a game that basicly is from 1999, even when remasterd, it is and stays the same game.  pros - everlasting graphics style, the graphics stayed the same since 1999. - random maps bring a constantly new experience to the game. - a lot of different civilizations to choose from, with each unique units and every civilization can use unique tactics to win the game. this causes a unending stream of experience and replayabilty. - multiplayer is fun, and had great modification options to optimize the game to everyone's needs. - steam workshop, with nice and usefull content. - single player campaigns with voice over. - every unit has its counter, wich makes nice gameplay. - co-op against bots, is a very nice way to learn the game and have fun, while still being challenging. - improved unit cap over the old age of empires. - new dlc's with nice content. ( civilzations, voiced campaigns, maps ) for decent pricing. - the game is often on sale and easy to get. - it is playable on older pc's/ laptops.  the final verdict. in my opinion this game set a standard for rts games, the hd remaster give's a nice nostalgia feel, while still being refreshing. i played the old age of empires when i was younger, and it is almost the same, but this new age of empires brings great improvements, personally i would never spend 20 euro's on a game like this. and i waited for one of the regular sales. it is a nice game to play with friends ( if you have any that is ). i personaly would give this game a 7,5/10  it is a good game, but has some mayor flaws, the biggest must be the outdated engine.  i hope this review was usefull, good luck aging.",

Though I first played this game when I was 12 yrs old i.e some 4-5 years back(not a long time). Though I don't have many play hours on my steam account but I can say with a 100% guarantee that I've played this game for more than 500+ hours with the old disc version.   Secondly, as the title says 'Age of Empires II:The HD Edition', I will only say that its no worth buying if you're buying it for some improved graphics as it has only some minor(0.01%) graphics change(or say texture change) only on reflections of water and the colour of cliffs. Other than that its just the old AOE2.  But the good thing is that it has multiplayer which is no dead and you can easily find a decent amount of people playing online.  In short here are the pros &amp; cons of this version of game-  PROS- 1.Multiplayer reborned 2.Buy this if want to remember some good old memories of this game(having it on steam) 3.For new players I would say you should try playing this best classic RTS game if you want to. 4.Some minor changes like-  -Select more than 40 units in a row(not sure how much, maybe 50 or 60)  -Supports a maximum of 500 population limit in standard game mode.  CONS- 1.Don't buy if you're concerned only with the HD graphics. 2.Its no remastered edition, its just an old AOE2 with steam workshop and steam trading cards available. But yes it has multiplayer to play.  I really don't mind its graphics as I am fine with its old retro style graphics. But they should have improved its graphics as it says 'HD Edition' which it is not :C  Finally, I'm happy that it is on steam, and also the developers are releasing new contents for this game.",

The game is still recieving developer attention, although progress has been addmittedly very slow and patchy. Neverthless, things are slowly moving in the right direction; bugs are gradually being fixed and in general the experience is improving. It's certainly playable at the moment although plenty of people whine in the Forums about all kinds of diverse issues.   So, in conclusion: If you liked the original Age of Empires II, you are in for the same experience here, except that the game is now once again being supported by Microsoft. It is not a modern game with fancy graphics, it is an old classic that been reinvigorated with new life.  The standard price for the game seems rather steep to me, so I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale to get it.",

Never played the game, you say? Well then, don't wait for anything, buy it!  Been playing AoE2 since like 2000 and it's still brilliant. The HD edition brought much refreshment for the game, with better graphics, native HD resolution and multi display support. What's the kickass for a casual player though, is the Multiplayer and Steam Workshop. Multiplayer is now ran through Steam, which eliminates all the trouble we've had since ES shut down.  If you're deciding on buying, i can't do better than encourage you and wish you good luck in the next hundreds of hours of wonderful and for some of you nostalgic gameplay.",

            "review_text": "This game was one of my childhood favourites, and inspired my interest in history, especially history surrounding the nomadic empires of Atilla and Genghis. The gameplay is fairly standard when it comes to RTS gameplay, you start with your Town Hall and a few workers and micromanage said workers untill you've got a town large enough to build a sufficient army to take on your foes.  Personally I never got very invested in the multiplayer, which is why I'm glad to say the singleplayer is very extensive with campaigns surrounding certain wars that were fought in times long past, for instance the rise of the mongol empire, and the events that unfolded when spaniards first set foot on aztec lands. I wouldn't say the game is 100% historically accurate, but the campaigns are definitely based around real events.  Beyond that, all and all I think it's a fun game, the HD edition doesn't add to much beyond making everything look a bit smaller, but nothing too upsetting, atleast it lets me play Age of Empires 2 again, a game I'd gladly pay for to relive.  Word of warning though, I have come across a lot of issues with the expansion 'The Forgotten', and as it was based around a mod for the original game, a lot of the AI feels clunkier. (The AI will spawn tons of units in their fortress and the campaigns can feel more like a grind than usual), and the pathing is sometimes difficult to manage. There's also the issue of invisible walls in favour of pacing, which all comes down to your personal preference.  All in all I love the original game, and due to that I can bare The Forgotten's campaigns, but if you're trying this for the first time I'd recommend starting off with the game without the dlc.",

Lets start up by comparing it to the original AoEII.  The base texture quality (Terrain, grass, snow, etc..) have not improved much. It still remain the same, but it still looks good if you ask me. There is no zoom option anyway so you can't study it real good anyway ;) But the water texture have been updates, infact it's been upgraded compleatly. In the original game, the water was just like the ground, plain and flat. But here it's 3D (At least it's animated). It make the water more 'Alive'. The Cliffs have also been updated from a brown desert like texture to a more gray stone color. Making it more neutral towards all types of maps (Desert, Grassland, Snow, etc...).  Other thinks that the HD verion have is a more or less inproved options menu and not to mention Widescreen support. Everyone who played the original AoEII knows it only supported letterbox (4:3). Now it support all screen resolutions and aspects, big + from me.  The addition of Steam Workshop, Steam Play (And Achivements) are a big big BIG welcome to all of us.  I have yet to toy around in the new Senario creator (If new at all). So no oppinion there.  I like that they raised the max selected unit from 40 to 50 and allowed more than 200 units pr player.  The fact that they added the Forgotten Empires mod in as a DLC was cool as well. 5 more civilisations, 4 new Campaigns , new map size, new Techs, Capture the Relic, Twitch streaming support and a propper spectator mode. Not to mention treaties, which in my oppinion will help new players agains't better players while they climb the ranks and earn there stripes. Only bad thing is that there is no voice acting in the new Campaigns, but that fine.  Now, there are some issue i still have with the game itself. The pathing is still kindof broken. If you click on a pre-explored part of the map, the units will walk the correct way instantly instead of doing it on the fly as they explore more of the fog of war.   Now, before you other veterans go buy this game. Remember that the system requirements have gone up quite a lot compared to the original. The graphical and memory requirements have gone up quite a lot (1 GB ram and 2 GB HDD). So be noted about that (Because I do get frame drops from time to time).",

I went into the game and started a standard game with 7 different AI all in individual teams using the '-' in the team options. but of course with my brain I could only see as far as I can stretch my arm, thus forgetting to put the LOCK TEAMS on... yep! they al teamed me and kinda ♥♥♥♥ed me over. but i was astounded by this! never had the AI form AOE 2 used strategy before. usually they would have spammed every available unit they got. now they did exactly the same but this time the varied in a way that made the groups they sent more diverse. each different from the other. this time they actually countered what I was throwing at them. Example: I sent a group of Kamayuks (new spear unit from the inca's), and spear throwers. and what do they send? Champions and ballista's. so i sent a lot of Paladins (full tech tree option) to counter his Champions and to quickly eliminate the ballista's. And he sends Halberdiers! I loved this constant thinking of what to counter but your enemy always being one step ahead of you!  then i made my own map! I loved making fortress maps for me to defend againts the AI in AOE 2. but the strategy that the enemy uses is really hard to comprehend in this kind of situation. I always turn off the Trebuchets because I flipping hate those things. and then the enemy comes to the gate of my grand city! with siege rams, lots and lots of siege rams. so i send my Kamayuks outside to deal with them. and you'll probably guess what was in the rams.... Arbalests and Champions... he countered my Kamayuks just because I went scouting with one earlyer in the match.  This game has it all.

The reworked singleplayer is untouched only adding new and better graphics. If you decide to play multiplayer then you may play ranked or unranked starting with an elo of 1600 in ranked. The game is rather recource oriented like starcraft, exept the major materials are wood, food, stone and gold, each holding a decisive role in the middleage game. In the beginning of each match you start with a towncenter and 3 villagers, these can build buildings and gather recources and the towncenter can produce villagers and provides other upgrades like a number of other buildings which require recources. The game supports a number of playstyles as a player you have the option to defend yourself and advance through the four times: Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age to defeat your enemy, turtling your way to victory or you can rush your enemy. The game features a variety of civilizations which have different attributes &amp; which allow an even more free playstyle.  I used to play the oldest version of the game, in which the ai was extremly unbalanced on a more intermidiate level. To my suprise alot of extrem fans of the franchise play the game frequently, so its hard to improve if you play against pros all the time, thats why I would recommend this game to a bunch of friends when its on sale, since the game itself is extremly enjoyable, but to reach a competitive level you require an extrem amount of patience and practise like in any game, which I myself did not have. I lack a profound devotion to master this game but maybe you have it. As a horrible player who only plays with friends, I would give this game a 8/10 it has extrem potiential for new players, but you get destroyed if you dont know how to play this complex game.",

Unfortunately, I lost the CD when I was moving and haven't played it until I heard that they were remaking the  game as a HD version. Nothing has changed that altered my view on this game and I love it.  One of the appealing parts of this game is that the scenarios are really playable, specific, and historically accurate. Unlike other 'history' oriented-games, this actually provides an accurate view of the historic battles. One such example is the Battle of Noryang, where the Koreans had to protect themselves from the Japanese invaders even when they were overwhelmed (around 140 vs 500). Also, this is the battle where Admiral Yi-Shun-Shin died in battle on his famous Turtle Ship. Like the historic facts provided, in the game you are able to commandeer the famous Turtle Ships and defeat the invaders.   For those who haven't entered the world of RTS, this is your chance. Your chance to experience one of the most ORIGNIAL RTS game on the market and in my opinion, the best game there is.  ",

I still have my disks to AoE1,2 and 3, so only bought this verison when it went on sale with the additional campaigns, and I have to say it was worth it. Now, If you are looking for soemthing completely new, or an updated UI, or massively improved graphics, no, you are not going to be pleased. However, there were tweaks in many areas, one being that unit selection seems to have been boosted, there are now options much higher unit caps allowed, and the water doesn't turn a splotchy purple and the grass a red speckled blur on my monitor, as the original version does. Pathing for units has also been changed... but that's a mixed bag. Sometimes better, sometimes they hang up an entire battalion on one lone tree.  As for the new campaigns, I'd say they're as good as the old. Definitely a challenge (though that might be artific of not having played them a dozen times, as I have Ghegis Khan, Barbarrossa, Joan of Arc, and the Aztecs) with the new factions being fairly interesting.  If you go into it expecting the same game, merely updated to be playable on a modern machine, you'll definitely be getting what you want. If you are doing it for the nostalgia... wait for a sale, or you'll probably feel you overpayed. And, again, I'd definitely suggest getting the 'Forgotten' campaings, too.",

I'm impressed with the amount of attention Creative Assembly have poured into the game, most notably the new expansions and added units and civilizations, new maps and map sizes, the game really feels twice as much more than it did in the past.  The only thing that irks me about the game, and has done so since day one, are the vast array of units that every civilization shares. There are a few unique units that each civilization has all to their own, but it's still a little off putting seeing an army of European man-at-arms being recruited from a Japanese barracks or swarming the jungles of the Aztecs and Mayans. But that's what AOE2 has always been about, I suppose. It's a small complaint and doesn't take away at all of the true core gaming experience. And with the aforementioned community mods available, a lot of fine folks have alleviated this problem, a bit.   If you're a huge fan of medieval gaming, you may want to check this one out. If you enjoy real time strategy games, well this is one of the most classic examples of the genre and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you passed AOE2 up.  If you can stomach the price for a 17 year old game, it is worth it, but if you're patient enough to wait for it to go on sale it would truly be a steal. It would be most worthwhile to purchase all of the added expansions as well to get the full AOE2 experience. I waited until the Summer Sale because I wanted to also purchase it for my girlfriend, who I am trying to get into the game and although she really doesn't play any games whatsoever, she can't resist just how damn fun this one is, especially playing online, together.   Online is a whole other story. Personally I haven't dabbled too much into online with people I didn't know, as my skills aren't quite up to par to the general level. But I'm starting to be a little more brave and I really don't mind getting my butt handed to me as it's quite a learning experience and still much fun to be had, as long as it doesn't happen too often!  So long story short, if you haven't heard of this game before, get out from under that rock you've been living under and experience one of the most timeless, funnest, most in depth games ever created. And for those who have played the original before but felt they've grown out of it, well be prepared to spend more countless hours falling in love with it all over again, as I have!",

Regardless, I was very excited to see that it was going to be available on steam. I bought the early access and with over 240 hours of play time, I would completely recommend this game.   Microsoft has done an excellent job revamping the graphics without losing the original feel of the game. The units, buildings and game mechanics are exactly as I remembered and the ability to play multiplayer once again is a dream come true for me. The interface is about the same and the Lobby Browser System for multiplayer is quite easy to use. The Lobby is always full and there is always a game to be had. Creating a game is just as easy and the kick user from lobby function never really has to be used. The player base is fairly mature, but entirely intolerant of “noobs”. I’d suggest playing through a few of the campaigns before jumping right into multiplayer like I did. The players in the chat can be very unhelpful, prefer to yell at you in all caps rather than provide suggestions. There is a learning curve but by playing a few single player games and 4v4 multiplayer games, it is very easy to be a decent well rounded player. 10/10 would recommend.   I have not played the Forgotten Expansion pack so I have no place to review that.  This game is a no brainer if you liked the original release or if you like RTS/RPG style games. It is a very tempting buy if it gets below $10 and an absolute steal below $5. I’d also recommend buying the 4 pack and getting some friends to play with. That way, you can hone your skills without the ridicule of others.     ",

I remember being shown this game at a friends house when I was a teenager, and I was immediately captivated by the medieval setting. I would spend hours in the Scenario maker designing my own medieval lands and the online games I played with my friends were so fun we would talk about it the day after at school. I couldn't wait to get home and play AOE2, again!  I played AOE3 a bit and AOM quit extensively, the latter being a very good game in it's own right, but there's just something about AOE2 that resonates something deep inside me to this day. I didn't know about the HD remake until last year, and when I found it I had to get the game, again! The graphics still hold up, and with hundreds of community mods in the workshop the game has a lot of appeal to almost anyone out there. I'm impressed with the amount of attention Creative Assembly have poured into the game, most notably the new expansions and added units and civilizations, new maps and map sizes, the game really feels twice as much more than it did in the past.  The only thing that irks me about the game, and has done so since day one, are the vast array of units that every civilization shares. There are a few unique units that each civilization has all to their own, but it's still a little off putting seeing an army of European man-at-arms being recruited from a Japanese barracks or swarming the jungles of the Aztecs and Mayans. But that's what AOE2 has always been about, I suppose. It's a small complaint and doesn't take away at all of the true core gaming experience. And with the aforementioned community mods available, a lot of fine folks have alleviated this problem, a bit.   If you're a huge fan of medieval gaming, you may want to check this one out. If you enjoy real time strategy games, well this is one of the most classic examples of the genre and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you passed AOE2 up.  If you can stomach the price for a 17 year old game, it is worth it, but if you're patient enough to wait for it to go on sale it would truly be a steal. It would be most worthwhile to purchase all of the added expansions as well to get the full AOE2 experience. I waited until the Summer Sale because I wanted to also purchase it for my girlfriend, who I am trying to get into the game and although she really doesn't play any games whatsoever, she can't resist just how damn fun this one is, especially playing online, together.   Online is a whole other story. Personally I haven't dabbled too much into online with people I didn't know, as my skills aren't quite up to par to the general level. But I'm starting to be a little more brave and I really don't mind getting my butt handed to me as it's quite a learning experience and still much fun to be had, as long as it doesn't happen too often!  So long story short, if you haven't heard of this game before, get out from under that rock you've been living under and experience one of the most timeless, funnest, most in depth games ever created. And for those who have played the original before but felt they've grown out of it, well be prepared to spend more countless hours falling in love with it all over again, as I have!",

Anyways the game is great, a prime example I love to use when describing the 'strategy' section to my friends. The game succeeds in almost all places, including but not limited to: animations, variety, content and overall fun. Now that this game is on Steam, don't hesitate! if you have any interest in the strategy genre you will love this game.  Gameplay You will spend most of your game hours organising your village/kingdom/town/empire (the word varies from culture to culture damnit!) This usually involves sending your settlers to build things or sending your troops off to war. What I really love about the gameplay is when you get into battle, you can control troops to utilise rush tactics as well as flanking. You will put many hours in the game just testing out strategies on AI just to see what happens. The game is that fun and honestly I don't think they could have done a better job considering the time period for when this game was originally released.   Performance This is one of the few things I dislike about this game, performance. Now because it is an extremely old game, I must obviously recognise that they didn't use 60 FPS back then and that the technology then wasn't capable of pushing the types of textures and frames per second I route for. However, when you call your game a 'HD Edition' yoru customers will assume it is a scaled up version, thsi includes texture quality being improved (significantly) and frame rate being modenised to a solid 60. AOE 2 does not do that, instead of actually taking the time to change the game at all, they converted it onto a file and shipped it off to steam to make a further profit. This is not the route they should have taken, I don't care if your game was originally released in the 90's because if you re-release that product as a 'remaster' or a 'HD Edition' then you MUST and NEED TO update the game to include better FPS and better Texture Quality, those should be requirments.   Conclusion if you were a big fan of this game when it released, you will still like it now.....mainly because nothing has been changed to improve the game. With that being said, I still really enjoy the game despite its technical issues as it allows good, juicy nostalgia to flow through me once again. Hurray!  -JoshuaUpham",

From people editing a whole civilisation to bring you ROMANS to additional maps and mods like Jurassic Park/Hunger Games mash up. The people are and have always been willing to add their own ingenuity to this game that really keeps people coming back to this game over and over. The maps get smarter, and the players get new and exciting ways to challenge their opponents.  There is a major problem with desyncing when using certain mods, and your friends will all have to have exactly the same mods active as you to immerse yourself in a multiplayer; but who cares! For the most part, it works gloriously, and I can wreck havoc with my Roman Legionnaires or my beloved War Elephants. As computers have grown and evolved, it has really helped with online gameplay, and we can increase the population size using mods to make the game last even longer than previously anticipated in the games first release. If you've got the internet speed, and the processing speed, then you're going to have a glorious time with the 'Unlimited Population' mod. #justsayin'.  This game definitely deserves to win the Test of Time Award, for being a 17 year old game that we all play not just for nostalgia, but because the strategies keep on adapting!",

(Spaniards, Mayians, Goths, Romans, Azetecs, Franks, Huns, Chinese, etc.) Gather resources such as Gold, Food, Wood, and Stone with Villagers, in order to produce buildings and army units for which to defend yourself while attacking your opposing armies. There are a couple ways to win; like udderly defeating your opposing armies to which the point they can nolonger build, or building a Wonder (a building that takes the longest to build and just wins in 350 years {Which is like 5 Mins.}). You can play online from 1-8 players, if I remember correctly, with a mix of you, friends and Computer AI. Randomly generated maps make every game a unique experience; Or you can use Map Builder to create your own enjoyment with mazes, islands, extra resources, etc. Now to talk about Campain Mode. Unlike SIngle and Multi-player Modes, Campain Mode is you playing through a specific story of historical relavence, in which the game gives you your group and starting resources to build up and fight the given enemies. With 3 difficulty modes even the tutorial can give the experienced player a run for his money. Win within the given parameters and you can prove yourself to be the Strategy Champion.  I own both Age of Empires II, the Forgotten Expansion, and Age of Empires III (Which I have not played yet) As far as Strategy Games go this is by far the best.

            "review_text": "In the year 2002, my cousin introduced me to Age of Empires II, a week after he let me play my first game, he handed it over to me and i played nonstop as a child. It's taken me a year to properly get aclimated with the HD Edition. So here's my thoughts.  Age of Empires II is to least to say, not out-dated. The gameplay and mechanics are just as fresh as they were when the game first came out. It has a huge online following that keeps it updated with new maps and mods to play, The online aspect has been smoothed out to make it easier with the inclusing of a matchmaking service, something that previously was messy due to a lack of offical online support after MSN Game Zone closed down. Hidden Path did a wonderful job here of taking such a old game and bringing it into the new generation.  But this isnt a game for everyone. You wont expect everyone to pick this up and enjoy it. Most games last over 30 minutes, some going into the 2 hour range. Devoting time to learning every civilization is key to knowing how to win every game you play. There is a single player that acts as sort of a tutorial that helps you get better over time. It's the same learning curve as in the past, outside of A.I games, there is no difficulty setting. Sometimes the A.I will dance around you, while sometimes 5 minutes into a match they will be at your gate with battering rams. It's a mixed bag, the bots could use a lot more work to make them act more human instead of rushing bases.   Pros The ease of steam for multiplayer games, the matchmaking is spot on and can throw you into games without having to set up anything Steam Workshop intergration of maps, mods is excelent. Widescreen Support, High Resolution Support  Cons Framerate is extremely iffy to this day, at launch it was an unplayable mess, but now its at a stable rate. Outside of the population increase, no new additions to the game (minus The Forgotten, the 5 new campaigns are a welcome sight) The Higher resolutions can create some issues with reading some of the text on screen, makes units also seem small compared to the world.  Pick this game up. You wont regret it or get bored with it. Play though the single player, play random map games, play online, get friends together and get a game going on a friday night",

If you already own the game, then getting this is also recommended since it's optimized for modern systems and supports steam online play. The HD remake was unfortunately riddled with bugs at release but most of these seem to have been fixed. However even though online 'works' and there is a sizeable population, the HD remake still is plagued with many of the problems that affected the original AoE2 such as random out of syncs, atrocious lag every other game, and players dropping randomly. These are problems more to do with AoE2 itself and are not unique to the HD remake.  As for the expansions, thankfully you can filter multiplayer games according to which DLC is required. I would say that The Forgotten is easily forgotten (no pun intended) since the campaign scenarios lack any narration and really although the civs have new art styles, the only one that people seem to use are the Incas. The African Kingdoms on the other hand is a true solid expansion pack. The campaigns are very well polished and are narrated. It's also a blast to play as the Berbers, Portuguese and the Ethiopians. I just wish that both xpacks got the same treatment but apparently The Forgotten was already a fan made modification that was just modified further for commercial release whereas the African Kingdoms was a fresh new xpack. All in all though the online community for this game is still fairly active suprisingly after all these years and it's welcoming to all skill levels.",

I love how it has many tribes and maps to play on, which makes your game expirience much better. If you want to buy DLC, I recommend the Forgotten Pack. It gives you more tribes to be, and if you know what your doing, they can do very good. ALERT: If you do not like games that take forever, this is not the game for you. Me and my friends play, and an average game takes atleast 2 hours. Overall it is a very good game. The only reason why I give it a 4/5 is that they could of added more ages to cycle through, with more buildings and militia. I love playing this game, and I hope they continue making good games like this one.",

For a fan like myself, this brings back childhood memories and I was very excited for its release. First of all, there have not been that many changes to the game. Apart from the food, wood, stone and gold icons and the fire image there are no noticeable changes. What I say is don not fix something that is not broken and it seems that the changes that would have been made which did not make any changes in reality. The A.I is no different from the original game, which honestly I would have liked a little tweaking, they are still find ways of getting trapped on bridges and in woods. This should have been fixed. Expansion aside, the HD edition brings no new features to the game (no new civilisations or maps or campaigns). Again I would have liked new features to this classic game, the HD edition by itself does feel quite outdated but then again in RTS, that is not necessarily a bad thing. RTS has not really changed since AoE2 was released. The price of £15 is a major rip-off and is the biggest reason why not many people have bought this HD re-master.  Pros - Classic game re-mastered in HD - Steam servers for online playability (which the original had major problems with) - Ability to save a game online and then come back to it is another great feature. - No compatibility issues  Cons - Little difference between the original and the HD version  o Same A.I problems  o Textures have not make a noticeable difference  o Same nations and campaign  Rating 7/10  The expansion for the HD Edition is what the AoE2 game was crying for. The forgotten is an excellent expansion to the game and adds features which should have been there is the HD edition. There are new nations, extra features, better textures, new campaign and even more fixes to the game. For me this expansion should never have been there it should have been included in the HD edition but both of them together makes a huge difference to the game and the classic game feels re-mastered and up to date yet still retains the core gameplay that made the game so appealing in the first place. When boths games were 75% off about £7 total price, I felt that this price tag is what the actual price shouls have been, £22 is too much for a remaster of a play no matter how good it was.

Pros and Cons:  + Great blend of games like Starcraft and Civilisation. + Graphics aged well. + Campaign for people who like story and Sandbox for people like me who just wanna play. - AI can hurr durr at times - Poorly optimised, but gradually being patched - not recommended on pre-2012 computers.  Notes:  AoE II is a superb game worth your time and money. From the nomadic times, all the way to the Post-Imperial age: you will see your choice of Civilisation through it (or be destroyed horribly). AoE's blend of many different RTS (and strategy for that matter) games will engage you for many playthroughs, whether you like the thoughtfulness of Civilisation 5 or the action of Starcraft: AoE has something for you. However, it is very poorly optimised and the AI can be a dunce on occassion - but fairly rairly.   Verdict:  8.5/10",

The last game I played it was a Water match. 2 players vs 2 bots vs 2 bots on standard difficulty. The AI's beat us to imperial.. But never made any move. Not even against eachother. The most the AI did was act defensively with Monks against Galleons. After I got more then 8 combat ships, they started to show signs of glitchyness. The ships got stuck on one another permenently and I had to kill one to free the other, they didnt attack anything at all, they froze in movement with more then 7 units in one grouping. Even when I attacked one AI's island, and they had British longbowmen moving about.. None of them shot at me. The only thing that attacked back was its castle. I love this game and games like it (Age of empires 3 sucked and so did Age of Myth. I dont like their feel and how they limit the gameplay capabilities.) but right now the games glitchyness... makes me cringe.   7.8/10 - Rating  Will play, but cant recommend to someone who wants a strategy game that doesnt bug like crazy.

The path noding and AI seem to have taken a hit as well. Armies won't navigate well. All the hotkey buttons have changed from the original. The extra campaigns (African and Forgotten) are just awful. No nice way to say it. The voice acting seems to be done by one amatuer. NOTHING like the original AOK! Severely lacking in quality and story! As somebody who owns multiple copies of AOE, I cannot recommend this. You are not missing out on anything. Anyone who wants to play this game online should use the original and connect via Voobly (pretty much replaced GameSpy network for matchmaking) instead of Steam. I don't have much confidence that they'll be able to fix all these underlying problems. The game has become crippled and not nearly as lightweight as it once was.",

The only real reason I bought the HD version here on Steam was the convenience of not having to load in and out a disc all the time. In truth the game is solid, it's the game that you all remember. The AI was never very clever, but AOE2 took the next step on from AOE. It's a decent balance of build, strategy and has (had) a half-decent multiplayer too. This HD version takes the original and makes a few minor surface tweaks. It's slightly better looking, but it all looks pretty much the same.   There is one tiny problem. The pricing here on Steam. I was fortunate enough to get this version through a Humble Bundle, but I'd NEVER pay £14 for a copy of the game. Even $14 is too much. The HD 'extra' isn't something that really justifies the extra spend. If you're after this game get the original on disc or keep an eye out for sales. Paying the extra for the HD really doesn't seem worth it. The original disc still runs fine on my Alienware 14, it doesn't always look wonderful, but it's perfectly playable. My opinion is that it's just not worth the extra cash for something that isn't that improved.  Additionally, the new 'Forgotten' Campaign certainly isn't worth the extra money. There are literally thousands of user generated maps and campaigns that you can get out there for free.  If you've got AOE2 already on disc, keep using that. If you've never played AOE get it on disc (it's probably cheaper), or wait for a sale somewhere.  To be clear I'm recommending the game over the HD extra stuff here on steam.",

The first is massive groups of units, the second is how they can be crushed with very effective area of effect attacks. The gameplay itself is very fast-paced and challenging; if you're finding yourself waiting around when playing you aren't playing right: this game will challenge you to complete as many actions as possible as quickly as possible. The maps have a good variety and unique challenges for the players.  The game includes a non-military victory option, wherein you build a 'wonder' and a timer counts down from 250. I have mixed feelings about this mechanic. On one hand it gives a 'multiple routes to victory' flavor like the Civilization series, but on the other hand it encourages a very defensive playstyle, which might work against the AI, but will leave you very poorly prepared for multiplayer matches, which are still very popular. Did I mention resource gathering and management is constant and frantic? It is and it's awesome.  I don't feel comfortable rating this game on a number scale. It's a classic RTS from the 90s, like Warcraft 2 or Starcraft, with a world flavored like the Civilization series. If this game has one flaw it is that the developers made the different factions too similar (this game is not Starcraft), but to make up for this there are maybe forty of them, all with unique units.",

However, there are still a lot of problems. my dad adores this game and wont play any other, he is playing it right as I type this. however its the old vertion, not this one, why? 3 reasons, there is a game breaking error that makes the play map all white. you can not click move or play at all. you would think for a computer that can run the old one just fine, it could most definatly run the new. of course, you likely wont have this issue, I just think it contributes to microsoft wanting a quick buck, or several bucks for that matter. $20? are you joking? you could go onto eBay right now and find the same game made in 1999 (I think) and buy it for 99 cents. 20 times less than this, so only buy it while its on sale. and finaly, the multiplayer is messed up. not only are there those 'out of sync' errors, but There is no LAN option. THIS GAME TOOK A STEP BACK!!! I dont expecialy like playing with online players with this game, expecialy when I had a father and an older brother who will play with me. this is very hard with no LAN support. you might say you can just use the regular internet, but then you encounter firewall problems and the info has to travel all the way to the google center in california and back just so you can see what the other person is doing who is sitting right beside you less than a foot away.  as far as I can tell, microsoft does not plan to update this game at all any more, and even if they do these problems likely wont be fixed by them. even with the graphical problems you get with the old game and windows 7, buy that one instead not the HD crap. its cheaper and better. microsoft made this for a quick buck and there is no denying it.",

Only seldom memories of the dark days haunt my mind, when Windows was the main operating system on my machine. In the last years even gaming became not only a choice, but a pure joy on Linux. Anyway, in a recent rush of grace I decided to commemorate one of the few positive aspects of these rough Windows-days and bought the HD remake of Age of Empires II. This game was always fun and (according to my believes) is the sole reason why Microsoft is not on the list of designated terrorist groups. As long as the HD remake is somehow close to the original it cannot really disappoint. That were my thoughts. Autumn-sales, even cheaper, what could possibly go wrong? A no-brainer! So its time to start up the good old VirtualBox running XP, which allowed me to play similar Windows-only games: Desperados, Diablo2+3, and even AoE3. The installation via Steam is as easy as expected. Right-click, Launch AoE II: HD. My mind was already playing the awesome menu tune tadaaaaa tadadadaaaa.. But instead an error message shows up: 'ERROR: The application is not a valid Win32 application'. Immediately all my joy was gone and I am in the middle of this sober and dry Windows-world, where the user is confronted with cryptic error messages, left alone in a complete mess of unresolved responsibilities. Reluctantly I start the tedious search for hints, what might be wrong and whose fault it is. And soon it becomes clear: This game requires Windows 7 upwards. I can't believe it. Windows 7. It was my fault, as I did not read the system requirements. Shame on me, ok. But after playing AoE3 and Diablo3 on that exact same machine, it was out of question for me that AoE2 might not run. And even if it is the HD remake, I simply did not expect this issue. As I categorically refuse to spend any more money on that pile of bananas which Microsoft sells as operating system, I am stuck with a game I cannot play and some memories of good old times. Probably not that bad at all, except the disappointment which stays.  (In the end I had to get the win10 iso to install the game and get 5 minutes playtime to be able to write this review. I start to question life itself)",

I played this game when i was a kid about 7 years old (14 years old now), this is the game that made me play many other games and the first game i played on an electronic device.  It all started when i was a kid with a very boring life, and then all of a sudden my uncle gets this game with a pc for me on christmas. I have never experienced a game better than this before. I do not like 2D games that much but this game is exceptional. After we had to move to another country, i lost my pc including the game. Throughout the years i have been searching for this game everywhere. I have finally found this game and never felt happier. I played this game about 9 hours a day (this is the first day).   It may look stupid and boring, but once you buy it and play. YOU WILL NOT STOP!!!!!  I love this game, it brings back many memories.  Games that bring back memories and are top on my list: Age of Empires, Call of Duty Black ops 2, Tomb Raider, Army of Zin.  I reccomend this game because i know that everyone would love it!!",

There are many, MANY other things that need your attention.

Lets start off this was in an age where instead of everyone being balanced everyone has that op factor yet they arn't broken. We start off as the little weak village and build up to the ♥♥♥ kicking empire that you wanna be. You either build up with allies or destroy everon.  It has tons of content and was in the age when you buy a game for £40/$60 you got more than 40+ hours of game time and it actully worked on install. The game even has a tutorial campaign to help you play!  I recommend this for anyone and rate it a 10/10",

My personal favorite parts of this game are the historical campaigns and the in game database. Both give some insight into the age after the fall of the western Roman Empire starting around 500CE. There are also plenty of non-historical match ups that can be made, such as Spanish Conquistadors fighting Persian war elephants. Additionally, there is an incredible editor that is easy to use to make your own scenarios. All of this was available in the original version of this game, but what the HD edition offers is renewed internet accessibility via the Steam network, improved visuals (I no longer need to kill explorer to run the game), and Steam workshop integration for modding and scenario sharing. Alltogether, it is the strategy game all your friends can play and now you don't need to share a CD at a LAN party.",

But now in 2013, I am able to recreate the same fun I had as a wee boy. Even though it’s true that the developers and publishers are profiting of Nostalgia ♥♥♥♥ like me, I would rather thank them than damn them.  With many single player campaign missions, 8 player multiplayer games, different game modes, plenty of factions to choose from, steam workshop and custom scenarios, it is obvious that there is hours upon hours of fun to be had, as long as you have a friends to play with of course.  It’s fun, you totally should buy it, so says I.  ",

I've also played Age of Mythology, and probably sunk a good few thousand hours in across the whole series.  Age of Empires 2 HD Edition is not exactly a HD edition. The game would probably be better named if they just called it 'Steam Edition' in my honest opinion. Rather than just sticking the game on steam and leaving it at that, they also added two new expansions - the African expansion and the Forgotten expansion.  It looks the same as it did before, with new textures for expansion units and buildings. The game sounds pretty much the same too. The gameplay is unaltered as well, so for all intents and purposes this is a repurchase of the old game with steam functionality including achievments, mod support and the expansions - which are the selling points you should focus on, if you're comparing this game to the old one.  The expansions are definately worth it. While i've run into some inexplicable performance issues as of the African expansion, the units, buildings, and civs are definately worth the purchase. The campaigns are... hit and miss, but they're generally pretty alright.  The mods for this game are amazing. Ozhara is definately one to check out if you're interested in exploring and looking at excellent texture and sound upgrades to the game.  As for the achievments... well, i'd honestly say some of the achievments are a little silly, such as losing 50,000 buildings, and winning 100 games with each faction. Now, it did use to be a LOT worse - you used to be able to need to win 1000 games with each civ to get all the cheevs, which thankfully was removed.  All-In-All this game is definately worth the money to purchase it now. The steam implimentation and support for mods, achievments and expansions makes this a solid purchase and a solid, fun experience. Would highly reccomend.",

Matter of fact, a friend of mine bought me a copy of it about 2 or 3 years ago and we played one or two games. It was fun, but I never really picked it back up after that because I didn't think I'd like playing solo.   Fast forward to about 3 or 4 months ago, and I am playing this game nonstop. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it's just the sheer replayability, or if it's the pick up and play style, but this game keeps me entirely entertained for hours a day.   Pros: - Incredibly easy to learn, and you will find yourself getting signifigantly better with each game. - Different every time you play, considering Civ bonuses and random maps - Flawless steam integration - Decently active multiplayer, despite being a decade and a half old - Steam Workshop support - Low-end, so it will run on damn near any machine; no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ your 8 year old compaq is - Just plain fun  Cons: - Graphics are a bit outdated, but there are high-res Texture packs in the workshop that aim to fix that.  - Most popular multiplayer games are against people who are going to be a lot better than you. You will lose. (Better to play with friends if you're new) - Slightly unbalnced civs. Sometimes when you do random civs, you'll get one who's bonus is just trash, so I recommend picking a specific one. (The Huns get +20 production speed on mounted units /winkeyface)   All in all, a fantastic title, worth every penny, and I'd reccomend it as a great start into the RTS world if you've never played; and if you like RTS games, then you propbably already have this game. 9.5/10",

Don't let my measly few hours on this game make you think I don't play it much but I have clocked over 200 hours when I was younger. I would not put this and the original AoE down. This game is fantasic. You start off with a few villagers, a town hall and a scout. Not much. And then you have to start building, picking berries, killing sheep and other animals. And that's just for food. You have to chop wood, mine stone, mine gold and then you can start building bigger and better. And then advance through the ages until you build your wonder and keep it for the required time or until you vanquish every enemy team.  There are many different civilisations to choose from. Ranging from Brits to Japanese. And each civ has it's own look for the buildings and different troops. Every civ has the basic swordsman, scout, archer, ETC. However, each one has their own unique troops. Japanese have Samurai and so on...  This game has wasted many hours of my life - and that's a good thing.  If I am totally honest, the price is asking a bit too much £15 for this gem. Yes it may be much but usually on sale it's 75%-80% off which brings it to around £3 (about $5 I think) so pick it up when it is on sale. It is an ancient gem that is still amazing even today. And not to mention the vast amount of mods for this game: Texture replacers, new maps, resource mods and so on. I would actually rate this game 10/10 which is very rare from me. Thank you for reading the review.",

The graphics are fine, but it really isn't the reason why anyone would play Age of Empires. If you're reading this and haven't heard of or played it before, I can only tell you this: it's easy to learn, the pace is set by the players (you can go slooooow or lightning fast when developing your empire), the strategy element is wonderful (there is ALWAYS a way to beat that obnoxious friend with the 'perfect strategy') and there are tons of ways to set up your empire in a way that suits you best.  When I play AoE with my friends, you can immediately identify each of ur empires by its looks. Not just the skins of the different factions, but rather the layout of our empires.  Amazing game, well worth it. I'd pay 60 bucks for this, easy. If you like strategy games, playing with friends (or just messing around on your own) and exploding suicide monkeys, buy Age of Empires II.",

Sure, there is a workaround and you can simply reload the last seconds of one battle 100 times to get it. But this still takes about 9 boring hours. I am, however obsessed enough to do it.   On the plus side:   Bash a sword into a castle made out of rock, and fire comes out!!! 10/10  On the funny side: Played a standard game the other day: Byzantines vs Korean&amp;chinese Achievements Unlocked: Champion of the Mongols!!

I again would recommend all people who enjoyed the game since it first came out to get this mainly for system/graphical reasons. I found that on Windows 7 when i installed from the disk version of Age of Empires II (which i still have even in 2013) it didn't fit the screen properly and there was some colouring issues. That simply comes from the age of the game. However with this edition all of those small bugs were fixed, and indeed while the graphics havn't been changed at all so it still feels like the original game, HD is a good term for this version as it all just feels sharper compared to the non steam version. The expansion that is steam release alone has given me enjoyment aswell, with a good couple of campaigns and new factions there (though I'm still trying to figure out a few new features which I read in the campaign but can't find in skirmish).   Overall, can't really fault the game on steam as it's exactly what it says it is; Age of Empires II. However, I'd suggest getting this while on sale, because £15 seems a bit excessive for a game of this age. With the new campaign included in that price I would find it reasonable. I managed to pick up AoE III the complete edition, AoE II HD AND the Forgotten expansion this Christmas sale for £7.49. I don't recommend getting AoE II alone for anything above that, especially as the extra content isn't included.",

Overall, it's an excellent RTS game. I'll try to sum up its major features.   NOTE: I strictly play the singleplayer so I won't refer at all to the multiplayer.   PROS: --High replayability --Depending upon difficulty, the game can be quite a challenge. If you set it to very difficult and begin a deathmatch, for example, expect an enemy to come knocking within the first ten minutes with an adequately equipped army. Of course, you're probably still in that necessary stage where you're training enough villagers to begin harvesting supplies, but... you know.  --Even in HD, the graphics are a little outdated, but still good even 10+ years after release. Units and buildings are moderately detailed. If you really don't like the graphics, there are mods to fix that. --the soundtrack, sound effects, and voice-acting for the campaigns is excellent and immersive, sometimes even a little amusing (the Mongol accents are admittedly funny in my opinion).  --Gameplay mechanics are fluid and sound; rather than an entire unit, you recruit units one by one with a population cap normally at 75. Of course, you can change population cap to 200 prior to starting a deathmatch, but this can get very messy very quickly. There are two singleplayer game modes, campaign (all of which follow historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Joan of Arc, etc.) and deathmatch, which is possibly the most important feature in terms of replayability - there are many options for maps, opponents, population cap, victory conditions, etc.  CONS: --the AI can be frustrating at times. Your units will normally travel in formation, but when they accidentally run into each other, the game freaks out a little. By this, I mean one unit will strangely freeze and only begin to move again once the offending unit has moved on. Moreover, sometimes one unit or two will decide NOT to travel in formation, riding ahead by itself / themselves into ambushes. Always fun. The enemy AI, however, is freakishly all-knowing. Normally sends a scout out to discover the map and will continue to use this scout for the duration of the game, preventing you from hiding any buildings later on because they WILL find you and they WILL kill you, Liam Neeson-style.   THE VERDICT: Overall, it's an excellent game for fans of RTS, especially at its relatively low cost (compared to the Total War games, for example). Easily scores a 9.8/10 for me. I highly recommend it. :)",

I had lost my previous AOE II disc so I had to go and buy another one anyway. But right on time this came and and I immediately bought it. This was the game of my childhood and I still get 100's of hours out of the series. My favorite will have to be the third game due to the fact that the units are well balanced. For example, in AOE II there is a Spanish civi. The spanish have a Conquistidor units that does 17 damage, it weilds a gun so it is also on horseback. A normal Knight fully upgraded only does 12 in the castle age, and hes on horseback too! Don't get me started on the persians. 600 Health, 20+ damage, no range (thank god) , and their reletivly slow. (Their War Elephants) Other then the Spanish, Turks, and Persians, their all well balanced. Except the longbowmen, in the imperial age they can have 12 range. But that takes some time to get to. Anyways, enough of my rant. This game overall is good and its a slight upgrade from the last with the easier online play and workshop. If you already own this game is it worth it? Absolutely not. Their are hardly any improvments in graphics, LAN was taken away, AI still remains broken in some aspects. (Don't get me wrong the AI is great, just in some cases when their stuck between other vilies or take a long route when clearly they can just take the short route, it can get anoyying) This is pretty much a resell to people who already own it. Its practically the same thing for 20$ more. Would I recomend this to a person who doesn't have it? Definetly, this game is well rounded and with enough time on your hands you can gets 100's gameplay hours out of it. I haven't hit 100 on steam, yet. BUt I definetly have over a thousand outside of steam. Total Score 9.2 Out Of 10.0",

Players will be able to engage in diplomatic activities such as trading resources for needed ones, (Wood to create houses for iron to create warriors). In the end you will be either a winner or a loser weather you are either of these determines the skill you produce.    ***My opinion on the game***  I highly recommend this game, for the $19.99 you will spend can never amount to the fun you will have while playing this Everything that is in this game is just awesome for it's time, me and my school-mates  Would all join a local server and battle it out as we all ate our lunch, in a group of about 8 or 9 of us would play until we we're defeated then we would log out and the remaining players would keep battling until eventually a winner emerged It's been so long since we did this but the winner got a nice prize for winning and it was usually my good friend Ryan :)  we'd sometimes find ourselves ingulfed in this game to the point the school board took the computers out of our school. This is where it gets a little off topic but im sure you will think this is pretty neat. One day we all came to school stoked on lunch time so we could all see who's been training the most. At about 12:00 PM we all went to the battle-room  This is what we called it :), just to find out that 90% of our computers had been taken away by the school board and only 2 remained with locked passwords so none of us could access it, and anyone who could access it was  indefintely not allowed to play AOE II, so a bunch of young lads we we're bent out of shape by this and one of our teachers who had actually played with us, came forth and encouraged that we played this game, considering it was educational, it gave us a brief understanding of ancient civillizations, and organization. Which i would occasionally speak forth about. Eventually we had a huge debate imploring that they put the computers back, but they thought it had  brought us away from the academic system, only to later find out that it gave us a great understanding of history. With some help from my teacher we ended up getting our computers back, and remained playing AOE II till we had  graduated from the school i was attending.    ***Moral of the story*** This game is 100% worth the hard earned money that you are paying, i would never sit here and tell you otherwise this game gave me confidence in myself and also made me understand that even though you may be the best at something their is always someone better. Which is beautiful i think. So please buy this game because its too good to not buy.     God Speed ladys and gents.",

With 3x2 monitors you can see pretty much an entire small map at once.  Overall the game is very well balanced and promotes multiple approaches to play. The single player campaign is as fun as ever and a great introduction to the mechanics of the game.  The multiplayer/skirmishes add another level of strategy with team bonuses.  The new expansion adds some new mechanics, units and maps which again feels very balanced and trying the new civilizations definitately keeps the game fresh.

By all means, I am glad someone worked to bring this game forward to modern systems, allowing it to be enjoyed for many years more.  However, there are a few issues we had with this new version. Several changes are a minor issue. The new AI is ridiculous, acting more like a highly coordinated swarm. Buildings and units are scattered, all moving independently, and good heavens if one spots your army all units converge on your location immediately. This style of AI makes it extremely difficult when you they AI makes ranged units, or even bloody monks. With regard to their cities, the new AI fixes some building placement flaws (not as many castles built in back), but many times I now see the AI scattering mines randomly outside their city, and on multiple occasions had to smash my way through a 4-deep wall of bombard towers. It's cute, and actually kind of fun... sometimes. The old AI, while admittedly flawed in ways, at least acted human in ways, moving troops in groups. While I could once defeat the old AI in 1v1 on Hard difficulty no problem, I now struggle with Standard, often dying very early in the game, and I'm no RTS noob. This all said, there is an option to choose between the new AI or the old - last I played, at least. Both have their flaws and perks, so really it's a matter of preference.  Also, I don't really care that it's HD. I just want to play the game, and got along just fine without HD for over a decade. This wouldn't be a problem for me if there were an option to adjust the resolution and some graphics settings. This HD edition makes modern systems very laggy that, while low-power by todays standards, could demolish any game put out when AoEII was introduced. Kind of ridiculous, I think. Especially when not much has actually improved visually, in my opinion.  But really, who cares. This is a classic. I'm simply overjoyed that somebody brought it back, and understand that renewing old games with old engines isn't easy. The game runs, I no longer have to wait ages (har har) and spend hours troubleshooting server connections to play a single multiplayer game with my brother in the other room. Steam makes this all incredibly easy and relatively smooth. The developers even added a version of the modern A-move (though here it's a tab-move, and not totally reliable).  RTS is easily my favorite genre of game, and I'm a huge fan of StarCraft II. But in a time where RTS games are few and far between, and often require fast reaction times that make it difficult for casual players, it's great to have a familiar LAN-party favorite back. Cheers to the developers that made this possible, and here's to many years more of great RTS.",

The game is the same right down to the intro movies - low res and pixelated as all heck, but exactly as I remember them. The landing menu is the same, and the game plays exactly as it should.  Playing online with some friends, both the nostalgic good and bad comes out. The AI is still as rudimentary as it used to be, which can make pathfinding and attacking occasionally frustrating. For example, I was attacking an enemy civilization, and instructed foot units to follow seige weapons into battle. A one point, the seige weapons attack a town centre, and the entire foot group follows suit, taking splash damage from my own units in the process. When you get used to these (20 year) shortcomings though, they begin to seem charming.  One unique, interesting aspect of the game is that you can play with a friend on the same team. This allows you to strategize in a much easier, more fun way than as allies, because you can create rolls and efficiently defend and attack. That's one thing I used to love about AoE2 when I was younger, and I was glad to see it intact.  It's a little expensive at $19.99, but I felt that it was worth it since I used to love the game.

The addition of the Steam Workshop can add HOURS of content  -----  All in all, this is one of my favorite games ever.

AoE II's AI isn't exactly all for the 'Epic Grand Battle' stuff, if you pick Moderate+ difficulty, get ready to be spammed by waves and waves of Petards, which can get very annoying. But their's good ways to counteract the Petard Spam; Mobile Ranged Units. But after the Petards the AI will spam you with Catapults and Archers. Even though I've only played about 17 hours of this game currently, I can easily counteract them, but my friend who is less skilled than me, not so much. He entitles himself a 'Master of RTS'' even though he can't beat me in a game of chess.   Now that the personal stuff is over, let's give you what you came to read. AoE II is a fantastic game, but you can't automatically become a master at it, it requires practice and (A LOT OF) patience. Beware this game will test your wits of RTS to the finest if set on the right difficulty. This game is also better than AoE III IMO. It's because AoE II has nations that technologies can turn the tides of battle even though you may be outnumbered 10-1 (unless the dude your facing Petard spams, remember kids, don't be that dude) but AoE III is basically 'Whoever has more riflemen and siege equipment win' but it's not a bad game. The Campaign of AoE II keeps you occupied too, but beware, if you do the Joan of Arc Campaign, the English have what they were good at in the actual Hundred Years War, Archers/Crossbowmen.  Evaluation  Pros: Entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat hoping you won't be destroyed, active Community, strategic decision making and planning, overall good AI, Okay Campaigns, not so steep learning curve, and accurate locations (sort of)   Cons: AI tends to spam Petards and Etc. if difficulty is Moderate+, Graphics are semi-old (I put this here for those people who complain about graphics), Some idiots in the community (But there's always has to be in every gaming community), Some people head straight for online instead of learning so beware of noobs, Buddies for this game are almost a must, beware of copycats of the AI stated above in PvP matches, and a final one is I suggest do not jump immediately into the game, do the tutorial campaign first.",

If you're gaming taste is medieval/RTS it's right down your alley way. It also does have a map editor in the game. Which is great it's better than having to close down the game and open a separate program  I would probably have to rate it, 7/10 Garmes",

Edit 2: UPDATES BOYS, with the announcment that this game is getting more stability support and ANOTHER expansion with new units, civs maps and modes as announced in their 'Age of Empires II – The path forward' news article/thread i was so excited that this game will not be so broken and forgotten to time. in the near future i hope to read more about what is coming.

Now here I am today playing this re-release. I can still say I love this game. This HD remake captures the feel of the origonal. It also stuffs in so much more! You get the Conquors expansion included with the game, and the option to buy very well done expansion made currently.  Everything you need to know that the game includes is in the steam video. Anything I say praising this game is redudent. (except gamemodes and map types, there are so many of those. It's spectacular!)  Buy this game if you are an AoE fan. Buy this game if you are a RTS fan. Buy this game because it is awesome.  TL;DR: It stands the test of time and it is still great. More mechanics included. Buy it now.",

That is big,why you ask? Well, back in the day age of empires didnt have a proper multyplayer mode.But now,it is a true masterpiece.New buildings,new units,new civilizations,new added triggers and a lot more! Another sweet feature is the map creator system with which you can create maps to even stories that you imagine,of course it will take you some time to learn the triggers and all,but thats not important for the game.Last two things are: 1)the trainong system,which teaches new players a lot of usefull information,and trust me,it does a realy good job at giving the basics, but it still cant fully give everything. 2)the steam workshop.Now i know what you are thinking:what?why is that important? Well you better read here friend becouse its huge.back to the old versions that didnt exist making age of empires a little bit boring after finishing it.But now you can play maps other people make,and some people are really talented!!try it out!  So that was a review than a recomended text but for strategy fans its amazing, while for first person shooter fans not so much.all in all,its a good game for just strategy fans,which is ok but that unfortunatly cant change as Age of Empires is meant for that. as a score i would give it a '' 9.2 / 10'' ,a great game but only for just some people.But your money is worth ok?thats for sure.anyway,if i helped to making your decision then i am happy and if have any different opinion then comment it.thats all.

Multiplayer used to be a lot of fun too but I haven't tried to play it in several years so it might be dead.  To say something bad about it for balance - the AI is predictable. It will send an army to a certain location in your territory and once it has given the order that army will travel until it reaches that destination. You can attack it as it travels to that location but it will not respond so if you have a powerful enough army you can pretty much kill it before it arrives.",

It can be extremely chaleging, even more if you try to be good with all kinds of warfare (infantary, cavalry, archer, siege, naval, defence and so on instead of focusing in only one), or it can be a walk in the park - even after finishing all campaing on hard I still like to play them on easy.  Being casual or hardcore game, old school or graphic lover, action or strategic player - no matter that because Age of Empires can have the perfect map and civilization for you.

You have other units that are decent towards other units, and have no real weakness. If we're talking in terms of Starcraft, you have the units such as the Terran valkyrie, or in Starcraft II, the Protos Pheanix, both great against air, but very exposed towards ground. Then you have the well known marines, that are decent towards anything, but again, no strenght or weakness, In Age of Empires II you have the swordsmen, no pluss or minus, and the cav, good against swords, weak against spear. So as I mentioned, the mechanics are pretty much the same as Starcraft. But the concept is a bit different. You start in the dark age, and can chose to get up to the imperial age, giving you a lot of benefits in terms of military and economical strenght. In difference to Starcraft, economy plays a bigger role in Age of Empire II than it does in Starcraft. Age of Empires is more like the full RTS version of Rome: Total war, economy is just as important as anything else.   THE VERDICT:  So Age of Empires have it's simularities, which I think is great. But everything isn't fun if it is the same story again, and the developers have made sure to take that into considiration. Age of Empires features simple economy management, which plays a big role in the game. It's not hard to handle, but if you focuse to little on one resource, it sure will give a knockback when you really need those resources. To put it all in a easier way, you will like it like any other game, but it all comes down to the player, and if he likes to have a mix between settlers and starcraft.  ",

Includes more map types, tooltips are added for every option in most menus, and has an active modding community. This game deserves so much more attention than it gets, and is vastly superiour to it's successor and matches up with it's predececcor. Multiplayer is simply set up using steam's native servers.

            "review_text": "(This is an old review, written again. The old review was very messy and based on my emotions towards a certain aspect that I will mention in here as well.)  Age of Empires 2 is a game I had loved AND it was one of the first more mature games that I have ever played on PC. Back then I was alot younger and mainly played games for... well... kids. I mean, I was like nine years old when I first played it and that mainly due to my father. But what I got is what I loved from that moment on. And in fact it changed my gaming future as it now became one of my favorite genres in gaming. I just loved how much you had to think about what you had to do and how you manage your own people and troops.  But of course, as time went on the games I played varied and AoE was forgotten. Until one day, years later, I found that old disc and shoved into the, now new, PC. Safe to say that it didnt live up to standards. Simply because Windows 7 and old AoE just dont really fit together anymore. At some point the game just broke on me and I couldnt play it anymore. I was sad until i found out about the HD remake of AoE2 on Steam. I instantly bought it and kinda did the same as before. I hopped into a sologame. Aaaaaaand I got rekt by the PC cause it was the highest difficulty.  But now I was looking for something new. When I first played the game I did everything. Played solo, the campaigns, made my own campaigns and all the good stuff. But, I never played online. And since I didnt really wanted to repeat it all, I thought: 'Lets have some fun online!' And, well, so I went online and had a good time! Or at least that is what I would if it would be true.  You know, I understand how a game (especially when its played online) can turn competetive. I myself want to win the game as well. Nothing bad about that, right? But when the whole experience turns into competetive garbage, the fun is left behind. The first time I went into the online experience I got about 6 people. We played on four Islands and I was together with someone else on one of them. So we said that we would not fight each other and declared each other as allies. We built our defenses and got some good stuff up. Until, all of the sudden, one of his guys started to attack my people. And soon after that he ran in with his whole entire army to just wreck my stuff. Safe to say that I was kind of surprised. You can win this game with an ally but this guy just went for it.   Being a bit disapointed and angry I started a second game, after that cluster♥♥♥♥ and got about 7 people. This time we played on solid ground with only a few rivers here and there. I I noticed that one of the guys was fairly close so I had to build up my wooden walls. But I soon, not having reached the first age milestone, realised how I was already attacked by a good amount of military units of the guy close to me. And again, I was disapointed. I had lost the game, soon after it started just because I didnt do the same thing he did, which is literally bumrushing the enemy.  And here comes the thing. Upon looking up what is going on, I found out that these are the strategies of the players today. There is no more old school strategy involved with working together or simply hoarding all of it for yourself. No trading, no building up your best stuff to send the army against the army of the other guy. Its simply just 'Kill when he least expects it' or 'Bumrush him so I dont have to fear him later on'. And here is my question for people like this: Where is the fun in that? I mean, I would get it if this would be like CS:GO where you level up and play against other grand players. But this is a game that is as casual as it can get. And to be honest, you are ruining the game for people that have never even played a strategy game.  So, would I recommend AoE2? Yea. I would. But not because of the Multiplayer. If you want to have a good time with an oldschool game and play some solo games, go for it. If you never played multiplayer or dont know any advanced techniques: DONT PLAY IT.",

In the Forgotten Empires DLC there are now one unique- research for every civilisation added. There are some techh-trees changes, that improoves the game a little bit more. In the African Kingdoms DLC, camels are no longer definied as 'boats' so they are now better against buildings and the research heated shots now doesen't makes extra damage against camels, which is a huge change.   I like the fact, that there is the steam workshop added for the game, that means that you can install texture packs, maps, custom scenarios, custome AI's (Like Ressonace Bot and Bruteforce,....) and much more stuff, that the community is creating for the game.  When I bought the HD edition the multiplayer servers were very bad and the game started to lagg at the beginning of the game. Right now the servers are improved and the multiplayer is now 'playable'  One thing, that i don't like about the HD expansion is, that enemies can glitch through you walls and can easily raid your economy, which is a little bit annoying. With double walls and some castles you can avoid that pretty easy  Beside this little bug I personly think that buying the HD Version was totaly worth it!

The interface and AI is shamefully bad and the gameplay is really quite boring and annoying. Expect units (yours and enemy alike) to get confused, distracted by irrelevant targets, and often getting stuck and tangled as they attempt to form pointless formations (you can't turn it off).  Worst of all are the campaigns. Hardly any building, almost all are 'take this small group to that part of the map'.

The different maps and civilizations allow for plenty of different strategy styles, but the gameplay remains simple and very streamlined, and is still superior (in my opinion, at least) to AoE III and Age of Mythology. The game has even held up visually as well (thought I do appreciate some of the improvements made in the HD edition.)

My friends and I are all in our 20s and we still have giant LAN parties throughout the year where we all drag our computers to a central friend's house. As we pass around our game disks to start the game, we connect to our 2 or 3 routers with 200 feet of Ethernet cable. There are computers all through the house, in the kitchen, the living room, and the bedrooms. Waiting for everyone to join the game, the lobby is full of in-game taunts: 'Quit touching me!' 'No' 'Quit touching me!' 'No' 'Yes' 'Smite me!' 'Raiding party!' 'Sure, blame it on your ISP' 'All hail, king of the losers' 'Wololo' 'Quit touching me!' 'No'  Now, the games begin. We play Regicide for 8-10 hours in a knockout tournament style. As we battle in 2 vs. 2 battles we drink enough Mountain Dew and Monster to stay awake for a month and enough junk food to give a herd of elephants diabetes, until only two teams are left. The rest of us either start playing matches or spectate the final battle that decides the winner. The final in-game taunt of the night is 'You played 2 hours to die like this!?'  Your experience will be similar when playing multiplayer.   This game is a blast to play, either solo or with friends, although it's more enjoyable when you can look into your friend's eyes as their king falls to the ground, dead. I highly recommend buying this game with the Forgotten Empire pack when it's on sale for $5. Heck, go buy the original game from Walmart for $10 and get your friends hooked with a LAN party, you'll have great memories for years to come.  That being said, the HD edition is only slightly different graphically from the original. The textures have been updated and the game now supports a wide selection of monitor resolutions compared to the original 3 settings. The best part of the HD upgrade in the Steam Workshop, lot's of cool stuff in there.  The only downside, and I mean the only, is the server lag. It can be pretty bad but compared to how awesome this game is it's a minor inconvenience.  Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 8/10 Audio: 9/10 'Quit touching me!' 'No': 9000/9000",

I managed to pick this game up during the Steam Winter Sale, for a mighty five smackeroonies! Oh boy, oh boy, what a fantastic purchase for a medieval and history buff such as myself! I was skeptical of my purchase due to the somewhat intimidating gameplay! It features 2 main campaign stories, and i've heard from colleagues, that the DLC content is quite enjoyable! and if you enjoy the African variety of DLC, lemme jus say, WE WUZ KANGZ &amp; SHHIIEEET ! haHaa",

The only changes they've made graphically is better resolution support, and slightly better textures and water, as well as multiple monitor support and various other minor changes.  The game has a working multiplayer, and it still has the original music and sounds. Very much like the re-release Age of Mythology.  So, do I recommend this game? Yes.
