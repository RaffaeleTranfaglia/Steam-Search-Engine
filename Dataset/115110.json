Oh, and not to mention the fancy classical soundtrack that is so fitting and really sets the atmosphere.  Only downside of this game is that it was too short. ",

There are multiple solutions for every puzzle, some of which can be quite tricky to get, and lots of interesting easter eggs. The game world feels alive with all the NPCs going about their business. My one complaint is that they didn't make good use of the middle doll in the stacking concept. Usually you only need the biggest doll in your stack, so you can fill up the middle between Charlie and that doll with anyone who's the right size. Other than that, though, this game is awesome and you should play it.",

It maintains a very stylish approach to storytelling, constantly being very meta and aware of itself which is what allows it to be genuinely funny.

The characters, the settings, the details great and small; like each Double Fine game I've played, I didn't want the leave the world behind when I wrapped up everything. Stacking is deceptively fun; it seems like it'd get monotonous and tedious, but there are so many small possibilities that even walking around and interacting with the characters doesn't have to be boring. The uniqueness of each doll is a stroke of genius; their abilities are unexpected and often quite funny, and as you start to recognize regulars from scene to scene you do start to feel a bit attached to them. Also, the protagonist is adorable. He's the tiniest kid in the world trying to save his family from peril, and he's so brave and optimistic that you want him to succeed. It's a feel-good story for every short kid like me.  One thing I will say, though, is that like many DF games the color scheme here is very brown and green, with rustic and dingy details. If these sorts of games make you dizzy or nauseated, steer clear, because this one's not very brightly colored and the camera is in constant, meandering motion to navigate around the surprisingly large environments. On my machine I wasn't able to use the camera without plugging in a controller, but once I did, Problem Solved and I had no other issues beyond that.  A short, sweet, clever feel good title. Sometimes creepy, often funny, and endearing. An absolute steal if you get it on sale.",

If you can't seem to figure out a puzzle by yourself, you can always get a hint from the menu. The third hint will literally tell you what to do to solve the puzzle, so only do that if you are completely stuck. There are also the 'Hi-jinx' that you can pull off in each area, and some of them are pretty funny as well.  Overall, I really liked it. It's definitely worth the $10 that they are asking for it.",

Stacking is oozing with charm, humor, and a plethora of small details that make DF games my all-time favorites! If when you play an adventure/puzzle game you enjoy getting every snippet of dialog, trying every combination of items/abilities, collecting everything there is to collect, completing every side quest, and just generally playing with the silly antics the genre can afford, Stacking is a no-brainer.  The game is *not* a point and click adventure game, though the puzzle solving and general tomfoolery will feel very similar if you're a fan of the genre. Instead it's 3rd person, with a ridiculous amount of unique stacking dolls you can hop in and out of (all of which have unique abilities, even if they're just for playing around with, and often times have unique situational dialog), tons of silly challenges, and a fantastic 'solve the puzzle multiple ways' system that will have you scratching your head in the best possible way.  This is not a game to play if you want to just rush through and beat the 'main quest' (ie solving puzzles the minimum number of times, ignoring unique doll collecting, etc). 100% completion is where you will have the best time, and will really push your creative problem solving jiggly bits.  Overall fantastic game, a must-play if you like to solve logic problems in strange and wonderful ways, and a top tier gem of the geniuses at Double Fine. (also, I believe, a successful from-prototype-to-product of the 'Amnesia Fortnight' gamejam they do internally from time to time)",

Puzzles consist in figuring out whose doll's power is necessary in the present situation. Each puzzle has three to five different possible solutions, each requiring different dolls. The storyline feels fresh and pleasant, in a children's tale way (but with added irony). I can't help loving all the characters, especially Levi the Hobo.   I recommend this game to anyone who is willing to try something different, challenging and, as I said, adorable.",

It's a nonviolent Double Fine adventure game about the cruelty of child labor laws during the Tammany Hall era based entirely around Russian matryoshka dolls. This should be the absolute peak of what I like. This review should be me wildly ejaculating onto my screen and extolling the virtues of Tim Schafer and Brad Muir and how much gaming needs more of everything they do.  Stacking's just sort of okay, and that is heartbreaking.",

            "review_text": "Stacking is a puzzle game coming from Double Fine studios.   You play as a russian doll called Charlie Blackmore who is on a mission to save his family from the evil Baron. To do so you can take control of other russian stacking dolls who all have their own unique abilities, like making shocking alarm noises or pumping out water.   The atmosphere of the game is very late 19th/ early 20th century with a lot of coal/steam power, victorian era fashion and a lot of the story being focused on child labour.  The controls are nice and solid and it really doesn't take long to master, however you can find that unstacking yourself will get you stuck a few times if you're not careful about where you do it. This wouldn't be an issue if there was someway to rectify mistakes, but if you find yourself stuck you will have to quit to the main manu and reload your save from there.   The game is only a few hours long if you play solely through the main story without going for 100% completion, but there are plenty of other things to aim for. You can try to collect all the unique dolls in the game, try and complete all of the doll stack series' as well as trying to find all solutions to each puzzle and completing optional challenges in each area.   There is also an extra adventure but it's basically the length of a single level, not that that's a bad thing as it prevents it from outstaying it's welcome.   Overall the game is well worth playing and considering that it's only going to kill a couple of hours if you blast straight through it won't require too much effort.   8/10",

When your family is kidnapped you use your stacking powers of posession to use other dolls to solve puzzles.  The story is plain and takes a backseat to the puzzles themselves. The stages are very formulaic but still manage to keep things fresh by constantly introducing new dolls with new powers. Also, the asthetic design is strong, setting you in an industrial age silent movie for the cutscenes.  That said, I couldn't play the game for extended periods of time because I really just got bored with it. I did eventually finish the game but when I did I was glad to be free of it. If you love adventure games and the nesting doll posession tickles you then its a fine adventure game but for anybody else it is very difficult to recommend. I love Double Fine but safe to say Stacking is not among their best work.",
