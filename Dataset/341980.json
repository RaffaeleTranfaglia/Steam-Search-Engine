This is the perfect example of an half-♥♥♥♥♥ game and released too fast!  Dispatcher do have very nice visuals and sound effects but the lack of direction in this game boils down for a solid thumb down.  It had potential but now that it's a 'released game', no excuses for the lack of depth and directions in the gameplay, beside collect stuff, hide... run... and die. Repeat...  You can 'give the finger' but that doesn't seem to help much against the monsters!  Dispatcher: Missed opportunity!  Instead of spending 10$ here, get yourself Alien: Isolation, Outlast, SOMA and Amnesia games!",

The game doesn't give you any clues what to do, where to go, what it's all about. No tutorial, anything. I think if developers put more into it, it would be more than a 'playable' game. And also there is no story line. The sound of your walk is a bit off, so you think someone is behind you walking but there isn't. Overall I think this game is fun, and could have been a big hit if developers wouldn't left it.",

            "review_text": "I like it so far. I don't know why, but I like it. It scares me, even though I think it's just because of how god damn loud the monster is.  Pros:  +Spoops me pretty well. +Can play with friends.  +Decent replay value. +Good atmoshpere.  +Seeing those things fly at you out of the shadows really does give me a good scare.  +Low price, especially when on sale.   Mixed +/-Level design is ight. +/-You spawn in one of a few predetermined spawn points every time at random, as does the monster(s). This means that you never know exactly what to expect. BUT, it also means that sometimes that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ spawns within seemingly feet of you and you're dead in the first 15 seconds, though that's a rarity.  +/-Don't really know how I feel about the character creation stuff, it's interesting but feels unescessary.  +/-Giant boobs on headless corpses. You're always far more ashamed after you finish.   Cons: -It is often too difficult to escape from the monster. Your character can't sprint for longer than a few seconds even though there's a hellbeast, mutant, thing, chasing him/her down a hall. Apparently not getting eaten alive just is not worth the extra effort to him/her. And there aren't many places to hide. Unless there is a shield wall or a closet to hide in, he'll hunt you to the end of the Earth. Simply springting around a corner and then hiding in an adjacent room, hoping he'll search the other one won't work like in other titles. It's clear that he knows exactly where you are, and his route isn't based on searching, it's purely coming for your booty UNLESS you get inside the closet at which point he just loses all sense of direction and wonders away like an idiot. Because of this, survival often depends on staying undetected which ties directly into the next flaw. -The stealth sucks. The game wants you to hide from the monster, yet doesn't give you much capability to do that. It seems that if you're close to him and there isn't a wall, you're spotted even if he's looking the other way sometimes. Hiding in a doorless room in the corner as he passes in the hallway? You're done kiddo.  In conclusion, I can't really tell why I'm recommending this. I gave a great deal more negative feedback than I did positive, yet I still enjoy the game. Looking at it critically, it's not good, but it still scares me, so it's succeeding at its goal. Right now, it's on sale at $0.99. I'd say it's definitly worth a go at that. At the full $5, can't say either way. While deeply flawed, it's still scary and fun. Do with that information as you will.",

The translations are laughable, the UI is a stunning recreament of dog barf through the guise of a HUD, the story is.. wait nevwermind, no story. There is no gameplay. The gameplay is walking down a hallway until a spiked sex toy appears and collides with your bounding boxm, after which a 'restart?' prompt appears. There is only one correct answer to that question.  This game will give you five minutes of entertainment laughing at how such an awful thing was published, which disappears when you remember you paid a nonzero amount of money for it.",

            "review_text": "This game is still in Early Access, and BOY, is that a good thing! I'd be despairing if the developers thought this was anything even vaguely resembling a 'finished' product. And while I appreciate it's just Early Access, a few more clues as to WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING would be appreciated. Even if said hints were just on the Store page, and not even in the game itself (though that'd be nice, too). Here's an example, in any case, of what IS on the Store page: 'Chicks in skinny clothes, blood, screams and other possibility.' So yeah, okay, I'm a bit of a ♥♥♥♥wit if I thought this game was going to be eloquent in its instructions, but a bit of brief scene-setting and/or a tutorial wouldn't go astray. Now there IS an option to try something called a 'Practice' mode, but unfortunately that gives us NO more of an idea as to what's going on than the 'Start' game does. Considering how much influence the devs seem to have taken from both Monstrum and Alien: Isolation, here's hoping that between now and the 'official' release they study those games a little closer to learn how to better clue the player in on what to do. Monstrum, for example, only gives you the bare minimum you need to know, but it's still WAY MORE than we're gettin' here. Which is regrettable because...    THIS GAME SHOWS MASSIVE POTENTIAL. I say that a lot, especially about Early Access games, but rarely do I mean it as much as I mean it here. The graphics are fantastic, the atmosphere is great, the sound is spooky, and the monsters are sufficiently gnarly. Its 'heart' is TOTALLY in the right spot. But its 'head' still needs a great deal of work! My few attempts at play thus far have consisted of: 'Oh, here I am in a room. I can pick up a few things - don't know what they do yet - but I can pick them up. One way out of the room, I'll go that way I guess (though I'm not yet sure why...maybe I just feel like a quiet stroll). Roam some more corridors. Take a bit of radiation damage. Work out that that's what the pills are for. 'Cause let's face it, they couldn't possibly be to counter any damage caused by the monsters, who within mere minutes seem to track me down and corner me at the end of a corridor and kill me more-or-less instantly. GAME OVER.' Either this, or I step into some electricity...which zaps me for many seconds and maybe attracts monsters, but doesn't do any damage in and of itself...or failing all of that, I might step into some Alien-esque green gunk dripping from the ceiling and accumulating on the floor, which gets my foot stuck and promptly leads to me being killed by something unseen before my game unceremoniously crashes.    Let's see, what else? Well, unlike the games I mentioned earlier- and Outlast, to name at least one other - you don't seem to be able to hide in lockers or under beds; indeed, I always seem to end up in situations where I'm not sure where to hide at all. And considering that I don't even know WHY I'm walking around in corridors teeming with monstrous beasties in the first place, I can only conclude that my character has watched all their space-friends die horrible deaths, and is thusly resigned to SUICIDE. I also don't know, for the life of me, how you actually 'outrun' monsters, as they're always two steps behind and, like I say, you can't seem to properly 'hide' anywhere even if you DID manage to outrun them for all of three seconds. I'll also be dang-♥♥♥♥ed if I know what all the stats are for when you 'create' a 'character'. Though there is one small bonus for all the lonely male gamers out there: If you play a female character, you can look down in first-person and see your own BOOBIES. I guess that's what the devs meant by the sentence I quoted from the Store page up above. After all, if you're gonna run around a spaceship with no purpose in mind other than to git yo'self kilt, you might as well do it with half yo' boobies hangin' outta yo' jumpsuit. I know that's what I'D do, if was a sexy, big-boobied chick stuck on a spacecraft with rampaging aliens. One, two, three, sing along wit' me: 'My milkshake brings all the monsters to tha yard...'   Look, with a bit of work - okay, a LOT of work - this game could end up being EASILY worth the ten dollar asking price. But right now, unless you're like me and you just like wasting your money so that you can write reviews in which you whine about unfinished games with the words 'Early Access' in the title, you may want to be SMART and wait to see if they actually knock this into some sort of shape. All we have here, right now, is a quick run-around inside the corridors of a spooky spaceship before you get space-smushed. If they manage to add a PLOT to all of this, well, we may just have a winner on our hands...  Verdict (for now): 6/10.  (UPDATE - as of 14th November, 2015:  Okay, so apparently the game is now officially FINISHED...and, I'm sad to report, things haven't improved much! In fact, I'm tempted to say they've gotten worse...   First of all, there's been no discernible 'story' added. No set-up, no explanation for anything...you just appear in a room and don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing there, EXACTLY as you did in the Early Access version. And things only get more frustrating the second you step out of said room...   I just tried replaying this, twice. First time, I wandered around a bit, picked up a few random objects, heard a monster before I even saw it...and DIED. Second playthrough, walked out of the room I spawned in...IMMEDIATELY DIED, from stepping in some electrified puddle or something. So the devs of this game still have absolutely no interest in building any suspense, developing any kind of scenario, tutoring the player in any kind of gameplay mechanics...it's just walk outside and, well, ♥♥♥♥ happens. And boo-sucks to you if you don't already know what to do.   Let me know when the NEXT 'official' version goes up, and I'll maybe...just MAYBE...have the patience to try it again.)",
