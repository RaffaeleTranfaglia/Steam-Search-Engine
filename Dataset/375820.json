They expect you to google to learn the concepts, then do the exercise in all but the most simple puzzles at the start. The game is more like a question booklet rather than a textbook, so you are solving problems not learning the material you need to solve problems. If you have some programming background and need a referesher on assembly, or if you know programming and want to try your hand at some assembly type problems without actually doing assembly code.... this game could be useful and entertaining. But if you are looking to LEARN, this game will not teach you very well. You will need to do the learning else where and come back to this as an exercise.  As an exercise, its good and I reccomend it. As a learning tool, I do not reccomend it. You should be aware of this before buying. I will reccomend it because I like it, but really take my words as a warning before buying it. Its for a specific audience.",

It works because they keep it simple, with a user friendly interface and an appropriate learning curve.  It will make you think, debug and improve. Sometimes you will feel frustrated but also very rewarded when you get to solve a problem your own.  There is even challenge for the 'experts', as in each task there are goals regarding iterations and number of instructions to optimize code.  The most complicated task might bee too hard for people who have never been into programming before, but you can always look for help or solutions in the forums or the Internet.  One of the things I don't like about it is that, as many have mentioned, it doesn't support Steam Cloud, which would be great to save your code. I hope they'll implement it eventually. Also I miss more game modes (like with different instruction sets), leaderboards and even a Workshop implementation where users could create tasks that others download and try to solve.  All in all, a pleasant surprise that made me look for similar games that have to do with programming.",

            "review_text": "An adorable assembly language programming game where your character executes the programs by 'read'ing from an input conveyor, 'writing' to an output conveyor, and using numbered boxes for storage, carrying intermediate values between these entities (the PC is the accumulator register!) The instruction set eventually includes read/write, load/store, add/sub, inc/dec, and jump/jump-if-zero/jump-if-negative, including indirect variants of the memory operations. Probably an excellent way to learn about pointers.  Took me about 3 hours to finish the main campaign and most of the optional side-missions, but some of the ones I haven't finished yet look like they may take a bit of work, and others could definitely stand to be optimized. No actual programming experience should be necessary (the game introduces concepts slowly, provides hints, etc), but it'll probably take somebody who has no programming background longer to work through all the content.  If you enjoyed SpaceChem or TIS-100, this will probably appeal (though it is simpler). If you enjoy Human Resource Machine and want more visual programming challenges, SpaceChem has a lot of that, or for more textual programming puzzles with a similar instruction set but multiple nodes, give TIS-100 a look.",

            "review_text": "This game simulates simple programming concepts using a corporate mail room as the setting. The player selects a list of actions that achieve a desired result. For example, moving odd numbers from one side of a room to another or adding two numbers together and putting the result in the mail room's 'outbox'. The concepts start fairly straightforward, but there are some particularly onerous (optional) challenges that make things interesting for the more experienced developers. Most puzzles include at least 2 optimization challenges: use the least number of commands, and perform the task most efficiently. I'm a programmer and I find some of these challenges difficult.   The ambiance captures a satirical heartless corporation filled with clueless managers and soul-crushing orders from the executives. The mood is kept light with colorful and cute characters, despite the dreary brown office interior. Several 'interludes' provide some brief comic relief.  In short, Human Resource Machine is a very enjoyable, casual game. I highly recommend it for anyone who appreciates or wants to hone their programming skills.",

            "review_text": "If you enjoy programming, then buy this game!  The majority of puzzles are simple and the 'language' itself is based off low-level Assembly with a single accumulator so you are met with constraints compared to the majority of programming languages; however, if this game based itself on modern programming languages, there would be no challenge since every puzzle in the game would be trivial!  Solving the storyline puzzles is pretty easy in itself but figuring out the optional problems can be tricky and fun, especially if you enjoy wanting to optimize them (as I did).  I did find it annoying since the only jump conditionals you have are 'Jump if Negative' and 'Jump if Zero' compared to any assembler's multiple jump conditionals as having a 'Jump if Positive' would have definitely saved me a few lines here or there.  The UI is a bit clunky since copy and pasting segments of code only works for your entire program and not for sub-sections of it. If you want to insert comments into your programs or give your memory cells names, you have to use an awkward drawing tool using the mouse instead of typing what you want.  Needless to say, this is still a fun game for those who enjoy solving math and puzzle problems using programming. It's also a nice introduction for people who want to get into assemblers.",

Don't be intimidated by all the reviews mentioning programing, the puzzles start from the absolute basics, and anyone with decent logic skills can solve them. I couldn't stop playing until I beat the game.   As of writing, I have played 7 hours, and solved all of the main missions, but have not taken on some of the optional side missions.

            "review_text": "Short answer: It's basicaly a RISC assembler for kids. I like it, event when there are few tedious levels.  Long answer: The middle part of the game was annoying a bit until all concepts were unlocked to be used. I would do few things differently, allow to change font sizes, allow type things on keyboard (you have to drag n drop everything, even comments you need to draw, can't type), or some shortcuts space for playing the simulation and [ ] to adjust speed would help. The visual jumps are nice when there is 3 of them, but when you have more of them they just annoy you. There is copy and paste and probably I enjoyed typing it manualy in other application and paste it back. I would allow CALL, RET instructions which would create routines / libaries, maybe allowing people carry over some libraries they made before. Now you have to start from scartch every time, one level checks for duplicates in memory, where the mem is already populated, next level is basicaly the same but you need to populate the memory yourself now. having nice common routines you could focus on problem solving and not the tedious work. What i enjoyed are the optimalisation parts a lot where you need to push limits of the architecture to the max. Definitely they should fix few things and create second game. I liked the backstory but was bit dark and maybe bit depresing for kids (but other games are much worse).  Definitely worth trying or even giving it to kids to experiment with coding.",

If that realization tickles some odd bone in your body and makes you cry for joy this game is definitly up your alley.

            "review_text": "Human resources machine is odd, so odd in fact that I’m not even sure that I can call it a game. This game attempts to target two very different audiences by having the main simple track for puzzle enthusiast and the complex track for experienced programmers. As such I will be splitting my review in two so you can better decide if this game is for you.   To the puzzle enthusiast:  This is a logic and mathematic puzzle game that you not only have to solve yourself but you have to write a program to solve for you. If you’ve never programmed before the game walks you through everything you need to know in order to play. It gives good instructions and hints to help you get along. I think it strikes a good balance between teaching the player different concepts without handing the answer to the player. The puzzles can compound on each other as the knowledge of the answer from the previous puzzle might be vital to discovering the answer to subsequent ones. If you get to the end of this game then you will have learned some basics of simple programming.  If you enjoy cross words, logic, and/or mathematical puzzle games you might find this game enjoyable.   To the programmers:  This game adds an artistic overlay of a man executing a series of simple, low level, or assembly like commands. (i.e. add, jump on zero, etc). Every level you are presented with the challenged to create a specified output with a given input and your job is to create a function to achieve those requirements. I played this game on a PC but I think it would be easier on an iPad or tablet. Everything is controlled by the mouse and you even have to drawl your notes to keep track of things. (no option to type your notes in.) I’ve solved most of these puzzles in school assignments when working with assembly. The only challenge they have for programmers is that they have two challenges for the advanced levels. Create the function using the fewest number of commands and create the function using the fewest number of steps. You can’t always do it both was at once. I never have trouble creating the functions to complete the given task. If you have always wanted to see a compiler where a little man runs around executing your commands than this is literally the game you’ve been waiting for. If that doesn’t appeal to you there is really no reason to get this game.   5/10  Would I recommend this game? That’s not a straight forward answer. I would recommend this game to someone who likes puzzles and is interested in learning what low level programming might be like. I would not recommend this to anyone else. Because the people I would recommend this game to is such a small niche I’m giving the review a thumbs down.",

HRM does manage to remind me of an intro to C++ course I took a while ago, only there's no help or professor to give you a hand. Some of the attempts to aid the player are so bad they're laughable.   For example, the first puzzle where I needed help only the required output was provided. No first steps, no suggested pieces, not even an idiot-level 'do this' hint. Just an image of what the output to the puzzle would be, which would be obvious to anyone who can read instructions. I did find a solution in an online walkthrough, but I cannot explain why the solution in the walkthrough worked where my similiar ideas completely failed.  I tend to find puzzle games more work then fun, so the positive reviews are probably from people who actually enjoy puzzle game logic. Everyone else should be wary of this BS.",

It has a very niche appeal that I appreciated, but I would have liked maybe a bit more window dressing. Especially regarding the ending which for me is the thing I am working towards in games from this company.  I thought the last segment in Little Inferno did a good job at giving you just a little bit extra for your time and I could see a scenario where you get a bit more of a glimpse of what you, the employee, have brought upon this world with your optimizations.  I initially wondered if this was a good tool to get friends into programming and it is for some aspects, but it is not comprehensive and I think by the time they reach the end they will be too frustrated and not finish it. I think the critical path ramps up a bit too much and some of the later puzzles should have been on the side branches to avoid frustration. Maybe a hint system that gave you a bit more info would have helped. Letting the player adjust their own difficulty.  To sum it up, this game is a great teaching tool and refresher for computer scientists and people wanting to be, however do not give this to your friends and expect them to finish it on their own without previous programming experience.",

Many programmers do not learn assembly or machine code at all these days, and do not understand the concept of a microprocessor, registers, pointers, pipelining etc. These are simple concepts to understand when starting out with an open mind but it seems harder for experienced programmers to get their mind around. It's amazing how many programmers don't grasp pointers but it's pretty fundamental to understanding how to write efficient code and effectively using a debugger to test code.  Just bought this game and ran through about a dozen and a half levels, but I am already addicted and know this game has infinite replay value. Absolutely worth $10.

If you are interested in learning how to program, this is a great place to start. You will most likely never use what you learn here directly, but it will prompt you to think and visualize in the same way that you must in any serious development project. When you are done, you will also have a new appreciation for the higher level languages, their vast libraries, and all of the memorization that comes with them. After all, what's a little basic memorization compared to this?  That said, a couple of the challenges were a bit dull and uninspired. The first time I had to unwrap my loop into duplicate commands to complete a speed challenge, I appreciated it for the lesson it was trying to teach; however, doing this without proper copy/paste is such a chore that I absolutely loathed it the second time around. If it happens again, I may very well break something.  Other than that, this is a really cool concept nicely executed--if a bit short.",
