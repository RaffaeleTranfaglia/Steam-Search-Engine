In my opinion I think this game is totally worth the $0.99 that you have to pay. The levels were simple, but became harder at about 35ish. There are only 50 levels currently in this game. I would like to voice my opinion that I wish there were more levels. This could possibly be achieved by maybe opening up level design to the steam community and the workshop. I also hope that what is so far in the game could maybe be an introduciton. Another thing I loved about this game was the simplicity of it. It created a very relaxed enviroment, which the music also contributed to. I would reccomend this to anyone and everyone.",

            "review_text": "Have you ever wanted to play Pick-up-sticks in a minimalist 2D enviroment? Well now's your chance.  Hook is a deceptively simple puzzle game where the object is to clear the field of all sticks. The sticks don't lay over or under each other but pass through and interfere with each other. Because of this the order in which you remove the sticks is vitally important. One mistake and you have to restart the level though the last 10-15 levels allow 3 mistakes.  The game starts off simple, the sticks don't even overlap, but after a while they interlace and have bumps that must be accounted for. They also introduce switches to control the flow once you hit the go button or one of the go buttons and even 'wireless jump' elements to further complicate matters. The higher levels often contain 10+ sticks, 10+ switches, multiple paths and multiple wireless jump elements.  Herein lies the weakness in the game. While it will probably only take you an hour to finish the game, the first 40 of 50 levels feel like tutorials to introduce all the mechanics and once you get to the high level problems, the stars of the show, it's over all too quick. More of the complex problems would be ideal or some sort of steamworks integration.  All in all it's still a great little puzzler for the price and well worth a play.",

Can be a good entry to puzzle games, as the while requires logic, everything can be seen - no obscure cascade system or anything present. Just look up where the wires lead and should lead, modify it, then press the black button, then look for the next step. I really enjoyed the game, especially the more advanced latest dozen of levels - I think the game's best aspect is that it doesn't try to sugarcoat itself. It's what it looks like, from the reviews it's easy to see that it's 1-2 hour long, has 50 levels, and the game only cost 1€. I really recommend this to you if you like puzzles, it's a good deal - especially if you get it during sale, but full price is also a fair amount for it's content.",

            "review_text": "Hook is a very, very relaxing puzzle game. Minimalist in its design, with only a white background and black lines and buttons for presentation, you’re thrown straight into the puzzle without so much as a tutorial. And that’s okay, you don’t really need a tutorial. Every time a new item is added to the puzzles, you’re given a very simple version to solve that teaches you what the new symbols do. The basic idea is that you will remove the items in order, taking care none will hook or get stuck with another.  When I say the game is minimalist, I do mean it’s minimalist: it doesn’t even have a menu. Normally I’d be pretty annoyed without control over the sound, but in this case, I didn’t need it. Hook’s sound effects and backgrounds music/sound are soft, pleasant, and as relaxing as the rest of the game is.   The puzzles themselves aren’t difficult, in fact, the game is quite easy and short with only 50 levels, and only the last few levels are more complicated (because of all the ramifications, and not because they’re actually hard) The game even offers you 3 tries on those latter levels, so that you won’t lose at the first mistake.  The only complaint I had was the windowed mode. Alt+enter did take you out of fullscreen and into window mode, but at the same resolution. I made the mistake of resizing the window on the hopes it would help the resolution aspect, but it only cut off part of my puzzle area; alt+entering back to full screen did not reset this, nor did resizing the window again, so I was forever left with a thin black line at the top and bottom of my game screen that cut off a tiny bit of the puzzles. Still, it wasn’t game breaking as I didn’t resize it too small (thankfully).   If you like these kind of puzzle games (and even though you might not find a huge challenge in this), if you need something relaxing to play then I definitely recommend it. It’s worth the money.  * Key Provided by Developer",

The basics of the puzzles are that you need to hit a button to remove lines from the board, but you need to make them in a certain order so that the lines do not hit each other. New mechanics like rotating junctions and portals/transmitters are added every few levels to change things up and keep you hooked. Pun intended. There isn't really music as such, more like ambient sounds but given the relaxed nature of the game it fits appropriately.  I'd say the price is about right but some people might think it is too much for a game this short. Regardless, I can easily recommend the game for people looking for a casual puzzle game.",

            "review_text": "I'm a little sad the experience is over already. I went preparing some coffee while the game was installing. The day was quite hot, I wanted something to wake my sluggish brain up for good. So I browsed the Steam front page searching for casual games and I landed up here, on 'Hook'. I thought it was quite cheap, installing didn't take long.  While still being inebriated by the smell of coffee, I just went on and launched the game. No start button, no fanciness, just a gray button. Tried to drag it, but my ape senses clearly weren't appropriate for the sort of mechanic this game was supposed to introduce me to. So I clicked the button instead, and surprise, surprise- the hook was released.  In the next few levels, I discovered the hooks didn't have to cross or I'd have to restart the level, and the increasingly complex mechanics from the deceptively simple framework felt somewhat refreshing. Indeed, I was getting hooked. The sounds coming from the game felt essential. They never aspired for glory or honor, they never wanted to reach for the stars and rub their obnoxious attention on my face all the time.  Instead, they wanted to blend with the environment. I'm pretty sure that if you left the game running on your phone, and you went on doing other things, you almost wouldn't notice that lingering presence in our ears. Yet it's there. A few ambient sounds, sometimes the rustling of leaves in a windy day, sometimes a bit of light rain coming in, and a distant piano playing very sparse notes. The game sound effects are probably about two or three at best, but you know... it fits. I don't really imagine this game to have such a brilliant score or anything.  It's still a puzzle game at its core, featuring 50 levels with a nice learning curve and a relaxing, laid-back atmosphere. The geometrical graphics are functional not only to their identity but they help setting out the premise brilliantly. You don't need complex graphics to convey a simple rule, in fact. Button does this action, hook disappears, hooks don't have to criss-cross. That's it. And it works.  Should you buy it? For its steal price, I think it's well worth your attention, especially if you're into deceptively simple puzzlers like Hook. In the end, I did finish my coffee as soon as I cleared the last level. I think I might need another round.",

This game is exactly like that moment. However, this time the hook is already 'hooked', and... it's your job to unhook it. Be careful though, if you make one wrong move, you'll have to start all over (on the level that is).

            "review_text": "If you like rods then this game has you covered! As the game itself is so eager to stress, Hook is a short puzzler based on a web game prototype remade for Steam with 50 original, format-specific challenges. Looking not too dissimilar to a monochromatic circuit diagram, a series of sexy, sexy rods are laid out across the screen, connected by not so sexy pathways to thoroughly unappealing buttons. When these buttons are fiddled with, they retract the rods and remove them from play, taking the button and pathway with it. Remove them all to pass to the next challenge.  The catch is that some rods cross through one another, or have sweet curves surrounding the tips of other rods. If a button is pressed for a rod that isn't clear of all other rods then they bang hard against each other and force you to restart the puzzle (though, later, more difficult ones allow you three bangs before you're out). Remove them in the right order to gradually free them all up and reach the white screen climax.  Along the way they make it harder for you by adding things like buttons that deshaft multiple rods simultaneously, or pathways that can be altered, or having buttons and rods that aren't directly touching each other but are instead activated over distance remotely. But as complicated as this all sounds, in practice it's a relatively straightforward task to work out which order to tackle everything, or in a worse case scenario, it's pretty simple to figure everything out through a process of elimination as you push on these mysterious little buttons and try to understand just what the hell they do.  It's a fairly basic game that tickles your mind a little without taxing it too much, and in the hour it took for me to complete, I had fun at every point without ever feeling stressed out or frustrated, as can sometimes be the case with other puzzle games. It's short and minimal, but that's reflected in the low price that makes it an easy proposition to take a chance on. Hopefully this is just the start and more challenges are planned, as I'd gladly invest in future puzzle packs if they were released periodically for the same price until I either ran out of money or stopped being so interested in rods, that's how much I enjoyed this. I guess you could say I'm, ahem... hooked!... Please don't ever tell anyone I said that, this is just between you and me, OK? Cool.",

I can not stress this enough, if you develop for PC you MUST have at LEAST some basic windowed/fullscreen options in addition to sound options. My computer's monitor for instance has a HUGE scar that covers up the puzzles.

After you complete a few puzzles, new tricks are added in a thoughtful way that teaches you problem-solving and increases the difficulty. However, once you really get into the game it ends after 50 (quick) puzzles.

A slight sense of dread at the beginning of each complex puzzle but resolve quickly takes over as the first element disappears from the screen after a succesful click. The gratification is immediate but it doesn't feel cheap. Resolve however, has a inverse relationship with tension. As you continue, the stakes are raised. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, you begin the level again.  Though tension excites but doesn't overwhelm thanks to its relatively short levels, soothing music, a neutral colour scheme and not obfuscating the screen with superfluous embellishment - though isn't devoid of character either. The formal qualities of the puzzles and the few necessary stylistic choices do not bore.

The game's only con in my opinion is a lack of options menu, as far as I am aware it's impossible to play the game at windowed and it is automatically set to full screen at your monitor's resolution. And the music's kind of loud so I had to mess around with the sound mixer.  But considering it's dirt cheap and you can probably get it by selling some cards, I would say it worth your money.   It also took me less than 2 hours to finish, so if by the time you've finished it you'll feel so deeply unsatisfied that you need to deny the developer his hard hard dollar, you'll be able to refund it   ",

Just about 1€ is definitely worth it, if you like puzzle games(And you don't mind the short game time; look below).  Cons: -It's to short. You just need about an 1 hour(maybe 2 if you really take your time). -It's too easy at the start and the last puzzle isn't too hard either. It could be way more challenging. -The first 20-30 puzzles are really just the 'tutorial' since the game is really easy at the start. So you really just get about 20-30 'real' levels(there are 50 in total). -Feels like a 'home-made' university project(although a good one), since there is really little content.   Ideas for next time: -A level editor would be great so you could play with the interesting mechanic and share harder self made levels. -Definitely harder and bigger levels so you would need more than 5minutes per level. -Part 2 would be appreciated. -maybe a timer or some sort of measuring device, but that could be also a con.
