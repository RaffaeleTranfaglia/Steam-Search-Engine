            "review_text": "In the future, mutants and/or aliens deep below the Earth's surface, threaten everything we've ever stood for. You just might be the hero that the world needs. So hop in that conveniently-nearby protoype mech, stuff your face with cake, and get ready to make some magic. Explosionade is what I like to call a 'thinking person's shooter'. Yes you control a sweet mech that's loaded with fun toys, but that's just the beginning. In order to master this game you have to understand your movement, your weaponry, and most of all, your enemy. Only then can you quench your thirst for explosive goodness.   A 'thinking person's shooter' is probably not the most appealing description for a game. It sounds so technical and boring that I get tired just thinking about it, but that's how the cookie crumbles. Your adversaries choose cowardice over suicide, and they will retreat to more favorable positions at every opportunity. They also don't have any problem with clogging your passage with bullets and grenades. If you want to get the most out of this game, you have to adapt. Your gun can fire in any direction, but there are walls everywhere. Your grenades can break through some of them, but you can only fire three at once. Also, while your mech is capable of jumping and hovering, its walking speed is pretty slow.   This is where you begin to appreciate your shield. While it can be used entirely for hunkering down and deflecting enemy bullets, it's most effective when your mech is in motion. While the shield is up, you can bounce off of walls. Through the usage of momentum, finding the right angle, and a grasp of physics, you can become an unstoppable force. Mowing down a handful of aliens with your machine-gun could take 10-15 seconds, or you could barrel through everything in a quarter of the time. The shield isn't always the solution, but it's your most effective tool for when everything seems hopeless.   Explosionade really comes into its own, when you get over the initial hurdles. You'll find yourself rocketing through stages, leaving no mutant alive or pile of gold un-looted. This makes the learning curve rewarding. If this was just another blastemup, there wouldn't be walls and the enemy wouldn't have anything approaching AI. There is an unexpected level of thoughtfulness that goes into each stage. You can't approach every situation in the same manner, but at the same time you're not wasting several minutes debating the pros and cons of your approach. This is a very short game, with play-throughs taking thirty minutes. Just think of it as more time to hone your ability and increase your scoring potential. Along with multiple difficulties, there are also different speed settings. If you're having trouble grasping the ins &amp; outs, you can slow everything down. If you're looking for a real challenge, then crank everything to the max. At double speed, this game can move extremely quickly, and deaths become more common. Oh, and if you're looking for something completely different, try getting the 'no-kill' bonus in each stage.    While it would be easy for me to write 'HOLY SMOKES THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME!' and make a bunch of dumb jokes, the fact remains that Explosionade is cut from a different cloth. Underneath the ridiculous plot, the 80s references, and a heaping helping of kaboom, this an action-puzzle-platformer-shooter. An odd concept like this is usually a recipe for disaster. Thankfully, through solid controls, accurate mechanics, and strong game-design, Mommy's Best Games is able to deliver on their unique vision.

            "review_text": " Disclosure: I helped with pre-release testing for this game, and was given a key by the developer for that purpose.   So you're a put-upon grunt in humanity's army, relegated to depot duty while everyone else is out exchanging laser fire with alien invaders. One fateful night, in a distant corner of home base, you stumble upon a secret prototype combat walker...whatever do you do? Oh, and did I mention there are snack cakes in the glove compartment?  These and other life-altering questions will be answered by playing Explosionade, in which your job is to, come heck or sewer water, get to the exit in one piece, one screen at a time. Of course, there are boatloads of nasty critters and obstacles between you and the 'stage clear' screen, but thankfully your newly-discovered war mech is as armed to the teeth as you'd hope. While smaller ground troops can simply be squished by touching them (a guilty pleasure if there ever was one), you've also got an endless-ammo machine gun, auto-reloading grenades and a regenerating force field to ensure you're ready for anything that crosses your path. The basics aren't tough to figure out, but there are a couple of essential tricks to master: if you activate the shield just before descending from a jump it will 'reflect' you higher and allow you to reach most any part of the screen, while grenades will either bounce off of or stick to walls depending on whether you hold the 'launch' button as they travel, allowing you to sneak the little buggers into all manner of places with a little practice.  As you progress from room to room you are granted a small point bonus for finishing quickly, but greater rewards are obtained by taking your time, bombing walls and exploring everywhere you can reach (including those tricky areas the developer has hidden behind foreground elements) and eliminating every last Horrornym in your sights before moving on - of course, you'll want to collect all of the chunks of gold (which refill your health and eventually enhance your grenades, since your mech, naturally, is powered by it) and obligatory pies you can, too. A rather lengthy health meter and frequent pickups combined with the shield makes for fairly easy progress, at least at first, but even the lowliest of your foes can be uncharacteristically aggressive and resourceful once they've spotted you, so death can quickly make a surprise appearance if you let your guard down. Your mount also has an appropriately heavy feel to it, which can become floaty when using the 'shield bounce' to get around, both of which take some getting used to, but a bit of combat experience should solve that issue fairly quickly.  Out on the periphery, the game's looks might best be summarized as 'endearingly chunky', though the music is easily overpowered by the sounds of detonating grenades and death-screaming cannon fodder. My personal favorite bits are the occasional, exasperated exchanges between your in-over-his-head soldier and his chronically PO'ed commander, though they can be skipped if you prefer. While not everything comes together perfectly here, several improvements have been made since the XBLIG release (a laser sight for easier aiming, better bullet visibility, etc.), and the game still has one of my favorite taglines attached ('When life gives you explosions...'), so it's tough for me not to recommend parting with a few dollars and taking it for a spin.   Just don't mention my name if the commander yells at you.",
