            "review_text": "Very mixed feelings! On one hand I want to give this a positive review because it's a great gaming experience with some neat writing, fun ideas, amazing atmosphere and immersion, etc. It hits on nearly every single element a VR title should.  Some gripes though....  Why does the first video on the store page for Gallery spoil the entire ending? Like, I think they show every single segment that happens to close the chapter in that one minute video to preview their game. Seems really....Strange.  30$ for a single episode of a multi episode series? Will this be five episodes? To finish the story we'll be paying around 175$ after tax for this product. Jesus. I mean....That's like a full fledged triple A product with the largest DLC bundle that'll be dishing out content for 12+ months to come....Maybe they'll be cheaper? Hope so.  Secondly the content is short, I mean, really short. Don't let my two hours fool you, I started and restarted and started and restarted and spent like an hour in the main section of the game. I'd say this game could probably be beat in one sitting spending around 30 mins if you know what you're doing. Probably less.  So for 30$ we only get the first episode (as bizarre and economically shady as that sounds) and hopefully enough excitement to sustain interest long enough to purchase Episode 2....Whenever it comes out and however much they charge for it (the fact I don't know these things is also disconcerting).  I guess....Please just make it longer. You've kind of trapped me between my expensive new device and curiosity because I've already dropped money into your project. So, please make it longer and even offer different avenues and solutions to puzzles so the game can have a tiny bit of replayability.  For now? Negative I guess, wish I didn't have to. I just don't have a positive feeling despite really enjoying the product, I think how they have handled that episodic system is really amateur and it leaves all of these early adopters who just spent thousands on gear standing yet again outside waiting to be let in with the hope and promise it'll be nice and warm when that time comes.",

All i can tell you is that if you own the Vive, you need to buy The Gallery: Call of the starseed. I was trying to think of a way of describing how i felt about this VR game and it hit me like a ton of bricks. The Gallery reminds me of PRE-DOTA Valve!!! I am not trying to do Cloudhead games a disservice by comparing them to Valve but their games attention to detail in the environments, the physics of the world and the story completely remind me why i once loved Valve and i think i found my favorite new developer in Cloudhead games. I just started playing The Gallery earlier today and i played for 2 hours straight because they brought their world in this game to life in an amazing way and it sucked me in without any hesitation. I keep reading about people complaining about the price of the game but 30 dollars is a fair price for the best VR game out there right now on the Vive or any other headset bar none. BUY THIS GAME, ENJOY IT, LOVE IT!!   BTW, the voice acting is top notch, brilliant even.    Just updating my review of The Gallery to say that i nominated this game for a Steam award for WOOAHHHH DUDE, COOL!!!! It deserves it for the last 20 minutes of the game which blew my mind!!!",

            "review_text": "IMO This game is to VR what Half Life was to PC Gaming. Polished, Innovative, story driven and ahead of its time. The game is exactly what I have been looking for in a VR experience. The controls just work and the inventory system is very innovative. There is a level of polish seen here that is truly breathtaking for a first gen VR game. The real con here is the lack of content on offer. This game doesn’t feel like a $30 piece of content. It took me only 2 hours to finish and that was after having the final puzzle break on me the first time after completing it; albeit The only bug I encountered in my play through. Seeing as the game does not offer much on the replayability front, it is a hard sell at the current price. I strongly recommend this game to anyone once it goes on sale for $25 or less. I am excited to see what the next episode has in store.",

This game took me 3 hours to complete, but I found myself playing only for 10 minutes here and there until I solved the first puzzle, then really dived in.   Above average voice acting. Good music, color scheme and advanced teleporting system compared to Valve's 'The Lab,' in the way that you can select post-teleport facing direction, which is very helpful.  Nice to have chapter select after game completion and I dig the retro tape recorder motions to listen to audilogs.",

The game has a very noticeable level of polish and production values, and the visual quality is probably the best I've seen in the Vive so far. There's a lot of things in the environment that can be interacted with, and even if something isn't related to a puzzle it can be a lot of fun just messing with things, like throwing beer cans at rocks and watching them fizz around or cooking popcorn on a campfire. As a first episode of a larger series, a typical playthrough will last maybe 1 or 2 hours, but it can easily go more depending on how much you like to interact with the environment. My only complaint is that the checkpoint system is somewhat lacking, and if you encounter a bug or something that makes you quit the game you can sometimes find yourself replaying a lot of gameplay, particularly in the longer early areas. But the game is so good that you probably won't want to quit anyways, so barring the rare glitch it isn't much of a problem.",

This episode begins a bit slowly, with the atmosphere seeming a bit understated. Regardless of if that is intentional, it definitely has a sort of way about it that seems very unique and fresh. By mid-episode, you start to get a handle on where things are headed and boy are they headed for an interesting place.

One huge downside that I wish I knew before I started the game - If your chaperone bounds tend to show up when you stretch both arms you will be constantly shown the stupid chaperone grid due to how you move around in this game. Having enough room to at least get 1.5 your arm span would be most ideal. My temporary setup was a rectangle and the narrow side was very annoying for this title. Not the game's fault really.  Worth $30 USD? Hard to say, I really do wish it was at least $10-15 cheaper personally. Got a few bucks to spare for a few hours of a very immersive game? Go for it..On a budget?

How this didn't cause red flags in QA, I don't know. It feels horrible... so much that you have to limit any moving around and teleport everywhere, which broke my immersion.  Pros - Good art direction, sound and music - Really inventive inventory system - Some really cool visual moments in the last third  I would probably normally return this game because I am under the refund time limit, but I would like to support VR developers in this new market. I'm just hoping I get more for my money next time.",

This will be one of the best Vive adventure games (in two years time there will be a ton to choose from) but judging by the length of episode one there will be about five of them to make it even close to AAA length game.

The game was the perfect fit for the Vive's setup, even though it started development before all of that, and it shows. It's the perfect showpiece of what roomscale VR can do, it's the most immersive experience I've seen to date.  As an old adventure games fan, this pushes all my buttons. It's (rather simple) puzzles, story, amazing scenes and exploration of dark caves. I felt like a child again, that discovered an old underground cave system and goes on exploration with a flashlight and a lot of imagination. Only this time, the fantastic stuff is real, and you are actually inside of it.",

I'd expect way more than 2 hours of gameplay for that price, so I'm hoping the following episodes are either longer, cheaper, or both.
