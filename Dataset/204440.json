            "review_text": "A great spin on the hidden object games. Most of the gameplay time consists of quite the opposite of pixel-hunting. Everything becomes clickable and it is your task to find something click-worthy (resellable). It is quite relaxing, as the experience is much less streamlined and you have more than one way to overcome a bunch of different and diverse challenges that the game presents you with. Less tediousness, more fun to play. Recommended!",

            "review_text": "Pickers is a Hidden Object Game. What that means is that it's essentially a point and click adventure game without the adventure part. Instead it's simply about finding the right part of the screen to click on. You play as a pair of antique pickers that travel the US looking for hidden treasure in a bunch of predetermined locations.  The gameplay happens in two parts the first of which is the buying of items where you pick a location to go to and then click on various objects on the screen to add them to your cart and then haggle for price. Most of this is either spam-clicking the screen trying to find little hidden items and simply knowing which items are valued at what price.  The second part is when you have bought the items you take them back to your shop where you can combine certain items, restore others, have your items valued for a fee and then put them up for sale in your shop trying to make the most money within the game's time frame.  Unfortunately the gameplay boils down to mainly knowing in advance where the valuable items are hidden and what they sell for so you can make the leaderboards and it's all very simple and monotone. I suppose it's a genre I am simply not that fond of personally but I really have trouble seeing how a game like this would appeal to anyone.",

            "review_text": "The Mac version is a truly awful, unplayable port that shouldn't be sold. It's broken all over the place. From the store where you sell things (you can't see your items, and have to randomly click on the shelves, incurring charges as you end up 'buying' extra shelf space in the process), to the auctions (can't properly set your bids or see them), to the stores where you go to buy your discoveries (any time you click on a zoomed-in area, you're just given a circle of razor wire and have to randomly click within it without seeing anything to perhaps get items, and perhaps not). It's not a great game to begin with, but all of the glitches make the game extremely frustrating and unplayable, and the publishers are essentially stealing the money of anyone purchasing this game for Mac by not providing them with a functional product. Stay away.",
