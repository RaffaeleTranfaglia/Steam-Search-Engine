            "review_text": "This is a brutally honest review of system crash for the PC:  Pros Great soundtrack!! Get the Bundle upgrade while its on sale. It comes with the soundtrack from the game as well, as wallpaper for the pc. If you like industrial music ranging from EDM,ambient and that gritty noisey industrial (Nine inch nails- ish) from early 90s then get this for the soundtrack.  Amazing gameplay that is inspired by movies like metropolis restored, bladerunner, I-robot and AI(okay the last movies mention is not as good as the other two...)  Story-line rich in cyberpunk and film noir.....  Gameplay is easy to understand and it doesnt require you to memorize rules like other card games....(like magic the gathering and pokemon )  Cons  For 14 dollars....I feel there should be more cards and missions get repeative at times. and sometimes down right frastuating.....   right now, it looks like the storyline takes place in one city...(?) cant confirm other locations  Computer AI doesnt take into consideration that you should not stack cards of the support cards and vice reseveral....In other words, You can get slammed by a computer's AI for stacking a card that can damage you for 7 points for example 3 turns in one round....., same goes for player  For what its worth I am giving it 4.7 out of 5 and i would of given this game a 5 star rating but if it wasnt for the fact that you can stack or get stacked with the same insane instant cards for 4 rounds...maybe im just complaining you can be the judge of that.",

Good graphics, authentic cyberpunk vibe, pretty nice artwork, and some tight sound effects/soundtrack. All in all, I give it a thumbs up.",
