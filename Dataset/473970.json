            "review_text": "Right, so I am playing this game on PC without VR or anything. Some of the reviews are for the mobile version and not the PC version so please keep that in mind.   In my opinion Zombie City Defense 2 is a good game to buy and play if you are one for strategy-micro games. I would not recommend it as a first strategy game. The game controls could be improved upon, however it isn't game breaking, just learn your hotkeys.  This is my first actual review (and not for a steam achievement), and I have only played a few hours of this game, so this review sucks and I will rewrite it in the future :p  Overall I would rate this game a 8/10, and not for new bloods to the Strategy Genre.",

            "review_text": "Recommended, but perhaps on a sale.  The game is really enjoyable if you enjoy these kind of top-down short strategic/tactical games. I've played through the first 3 missions and redid them in infinite mode, unlocked some cards, tried some different strategies.  I will defintely play this more often and personally I think it was worth my 10 euros, but for others I might suggest to wait till it's 7.50, that'd be a good deal, 5 euro would just be generous ;)",

            "review_text": "Actually kind of a difficult game. Which is why I like it. You have a satellite view, typical RTS, but the strategy is complex. Tactical upgrades are available but very fixed - ie you don't get a lot of them so you have to choose very wisely. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get challenged.",

            "review_text": "I will be recommending this game. I will also be refunding it.  In a period in my life where $10 is a very important figure for me, I cannot use it on this game. Sure it's $10, but for $10 I expect a little bit more than what this game gave me, but not much.  To save you the read, you should definitely pick this game up when it's on sale. Install this on a laptop and you'll be having fun on a flight, or even as a means of killing half an hour in time.  --  The art style is 'militaristic' which fits this game well. There are a small amount of gripes however, one of which being that you can be confused where to click in order to select a unit. Unit icons in this game are rather small, however dragging to select works just fine. A minor gripe but a gripe none the less.  The title of the game gives you exactly what it says, but that's it. It has the story of a mobile game, and that is probably because the first game in this series is just that. For $10 I'd expect a little more, but that's just me, and I know people who would not mind one bit. That's all this game really is to me. It's just not 100% me. I bought this game because defense games is 100% me.. But this one isn't. It's not all there for me, but for a sale I will be rebuying this game.  Mission times last 15 in game days, or in otherwords, around 10-15 minutes. That's why I say it would be a great time killer, because you feel progress fast. That's not my preference. Thankfully there's an infinite time game mode, but it's rather futile considering enemies get increasingly harder, the 10-15 minute mark won't be seeing much more time added onto it.  The game has typos but is generally fully functioning. I encounter no bugs in the 1 hour of consecutive gametime I gave this game.   I recommend it, it's just not 100% me. Probably 70%, and that's why Ill be rebuying on sale. ",
