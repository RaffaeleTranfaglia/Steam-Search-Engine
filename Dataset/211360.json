            "review_text": "This game literally caused a blister in my thumb, but after getting 100% completition, I finally feel ready to review this game properly.  As you may have already read from other reviews here, Offspring Fling hides much more than it seems at a first glance. Playing this game casually results into a peaceful experience with a puzzle platformer with short levels and easy-to-get mechanics, including the basic as jumping, grabbing, throwing...   But playing this game in a serious way uncovers the true potential it has to offer. Offspring Fling is actually a game crafted for people who loves to speedrun, and challenge you not only to beat the levels, but also to do that in a certain time mark. Most of them are extremely tight and accurate, and involves doing very hidden skills that could even look like game flaws for some people, while they're actually crucial techiques in order to beat most levels in time. Even the most basic techniques require a huge amount of timing if you want to do all the tricks this game has; it's even comparable to executing long combos in fighting games, no joking.  If anyone of you check my game stats, you'll see that there's a lapse of TWO YEARS between some achievements. This proves how much time I've been denying this game 'cause it basically felt too strong to me back then. But after 2 years playing A LOT of platformers, I eventually felt ready for Offspring Fling, and even like that it's been a true challenge for me.  All in all, this game can be played by anybody no matter what's your purpose in games (either casual or hardcore gaming), and will successfully give you what you want. Nevertheless after taking the challenge I truly recommend playing this game for the time trial stuff since you'll be surprised about how deep and complex this title is.    Final Mark : My Blistered Thumb UP.",

Levels are (mostly) single screen and quick.  Pros - (So Far) Every level is challanging enough without seeming impossible. It does get a bit dicey on a handful of level though. - Level Editor - Charming art style. - Fun!  Cons: - Crashed several times on loadup. Might be controller i had attached? - There are a few levels where you have to catch one of the kids in midair after a jump. This is made super akward in that you pick them up (normally) by pressing down and they didnt change this for these types of situations. So pretty jump, then a direction, and then down in mid-air, and then a direction or command while you are holding them. All in a few seconds. I managed, but it can get frustrating.",

But, because of this, you'll need to be patient. There's a lot of levels to play, with 3 different grades defined by the time you spent to beat the level (blue = normal time; gold = good time; rainbow = excelent time).  It may look simple, but it's not. There are some techniques that are necessary to learn in order to beat some levels.  Although it's very hard, it's still very fun! And it's not that expensive, what makes it even better.  Do you like cuteness? Do you have the money? BUY IT!   100/10",

The music is good, but there aren't enough tracks to remain enjoyable. The 16-bit art style is cute, but the main character's design is too derived from Nintendo's Kirby.  Offspring Fling is okay.",

The levels start off ease but incress in difficulty and you also will have to advoid hostil creatures and hazzards. At the end of each leavel you you be given the time you did it in and a flower. If you finnished over the par time you get a blue star or if you get par or under you get a golden flower. If you choose to replay the leavel you get to see a gost image of yourseld from the last play through you did to help better and improve yourself. If you got a gold star you see a gost image of the dev playing the leavel. The deve has a time lower then the par time but i dont know if something special happens if you pet the devs time because i havent been able to do it it.  I have only played it at this stage on the keyboard and the controlls fell a bit slugish so you are proble better off using a controller but i cant confrem that.  The menu is basic and apart from the level selection the it doesnt explain that well what the other selections are so it is trail and error. The option menu is basic and nnot much to speak of although it doent need much but would be nice if there was diffrent resuloution options.  Over all it is fub and enjoubale and at times addictive. If you enjou pazzle platfomers and or like speed running games and enjoy challange your self to constle improve at leaves to see how fas you can do it then i recoment it   Even if you not into the speed running part it is still a fun game to play or have a look you do get a sence of aclopshment and pride when you figure out a level. This is sutible for all ages and icausle players or speed runners  ",

And then I had to call in a specialist, because what I wanted was a puzzler that used platforming as an aesthetic rather than a key mechanic. I have no ability nor patience for twitchy exactly timed actions, and that's the entire latter half the of the game. Likewise, while the sound design is cute, it provides no 'information'. This game has absolutely no aural cues. The times for gold and white flowers are equivalent to 'perfect' and 'you have done something fishy'.   That said, while I can't give this game a blessing for all players (twitch mechanics and exact jumping put it right out of the running for accessibility), if you enjoy platformers more than puzzlers, you will like this game.",
