            "review_text": "The game seems very short. I've visited three of the four islands in my hour with the game so far, and they are very tiny with very few interactive elements. That's not to say the game isn't worth it. It's quite cheap and clearly a passion project, and a lot of love and care has gone into this game.  However, my own personal experience has been marred somewhat by several bugs. I've fallen through the floor numerous times, which reset you at the starting island. Additionally, I have also accidentally glitched through doors while examining them, which cause very confusing sequence breaks.  I'll check it out again in a while after some patches, but for now I will give it a pass.",

I played Myst when I was younger and the graphics to this game are very similar which I think the developer was going for and he hit the nail on the head. There are a few puzzles that aren't explained well which is where I got stuck, but I don't know how they could have been explained without giving away too much detail.  All in all I'm really happy with this purchase and can't wait for the next one!",

Would have liked WASD movement. The puzzles were not well integrated into the story/narrative. Many of them seemed to be an afterthought. I don't think the game can be solved without hints; too many of the puzzle solutions require thinking in a way that differs from the way a brillant engineer would think if he were truly stranded on a moon for a dead home planet.  I am eager to see what the designer produces next.    ",

            "review_text": "This was a good throw back to the days of Myst for sure. I think the developer should continue to create games like this because they make you stop and think about what your doing and why. Some puzzles were just plain find the easter egg, but for the most part the answers were all put in front of you to decipher. Very well done, now make another one.",

            "review_text": "Haven Moon is a nice and very beautiful puzzle/exploration adventure game, heavily inspired by Myst and Riven. If you liked the Myst series, you'll probably like this one as well, as it's quite faithful to the original.  The Good:   The visuals are downright excellent, considering the whole game was developed by one person. What an achievement!   Both mouse and keyboard controls are easy and straightforward.   The puzzles are challenging, but mostly fair.   Captures the mood of Myst pretty well, being stuck in a strange place and having to figure out what has happened, how things work and what you're supposed to do.    The Bad:   The story is kind of bland, and there are no other characters at all.   There's not much variety, both in the environments and puzzles.   Some hotspots only become interactive once you have the right item. If you discover something too early, the game makes you believe that you can't interact with it.   There's some pixel hunting involved, though usually there are enough clues if you pay attention.    As mentioned, this game is inspired by Myst and Riven. So even though it may be unfair, I have to compare it with these games. And then it becomes obvious that Haven Moon lacks the imagination and variety of these games. Similar to Riven, it takes place on a couple of connected islands. But unlike Riven, these islands are pretty generic. History, culture, flora and fauna, all the things that made Riven and its puzzles so special, are missing. So in this regard, the islands feel more like Myst - more constructed than natural. But then Myst had a lot more variety in its worlds and puzzles. So while Haven Moon implements the Myst formula well enough, exploring the world is not as satisfying and rewarding.  Having said that, I still enjoyed Haven Moon. It's a nice and challenging first person puzzle game with great visuals, and if you like this kind of game, then it's well worth its price.",
