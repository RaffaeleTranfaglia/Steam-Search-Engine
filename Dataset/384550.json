            "review_text": "Loved the  free version  [www.kongregate.com]  of the game, finally it's released on Steam! And now it's clear what took so long- this is an immensely expanded and lovingly polished version that adds a multitude of content and mechanics to the game.   There's different artistic styles now, large projects like painting churches, management and ability to hire new artists, oh and you can expand and personalize your home as well. Do I need to mention that the entire game is gorgeous? I'm sure you are aware. What you can't see from the screenshots is the amount of polish this game has. Every click feels and sounds great, the user interface is helpful and intuitive, and you  have  to hear the little guys squeak when you pick them up!  Basically, if you enjoyed the demo, you will love this game and waste way too much time in it, no doubt.",

For a couple of quid in a sale, I'd say go for it, it's a super relaxing time and could entrance you for a few hours. But I think at the full price it's a little much. With a few patches and a bit more content, this really could've been an excellent little title.",

            "review_text": "This game should be priced under a buck or offered online while paid for by ads. In fact, there already is an online version you can play, and the additional mechanics here really don't amount to much.  The idea is great, and I really wish the designer expanded on it. Unfortunately, he didn't. The game leaves a ton to be desired. You generically train artists, recruit generic artists, paint generic paintings, buy generic furniture...  ...and just do this over and over again to keep your painter guild alive as one generation passes away before the next. The game lasts until a certain point where you reach a high score.   If you're a real life artist, you'll probably get a kick out of the game for a few hours and will like the novelty, but beyond that, it's really not worth much.",

            "review_text": "Painter's Guild is a simplified take on the management genre, wherein you micromanage painters to fulfill orders, mix up paint and sleep. You start with just one painter, and have the opportunity to expand your studio in order to hire new painters and buy more furniture that will help your painters out. That said, you don't have much of a primary goal in this game outside of buying the best furniture or simply expanding your studio until you grow bored of it, which is a shame because it grows samey and tiresome within a few hours.  Painter's Guild is a fun, little game but I would not recommend buying it full price, simply because you likely won't get much time out of it. Definitely worth a shot on sale!",

            "review_text": "Painter's Guild is a little management, simulation, time management game. If you can get it at a lowered price it's worth it, given that you like games in that spectrum at all of course. For such a small game in retro pixel graphic style it's rather complex. You can change the look of your painters to your liking with a dresser, you can decorate &amp; furnish the rooms which increases the comfort for the painters, improves their skilling options &amp; elevates the prestige of the guild, which then attracts richer clients. The painters you hire have a quite complex personality as well, there are two traits, both painting related which make the painter either faster painting, quicker skilling, healthier, easier to get into trouble &amp; prison, painting more beautifully or changing quicker the initial painting style ... Besides of painting at the easels painters can also work outside the guild on murals, which pays better but is strenous enough to even kill your painters. There are three options to hire new painters, from cheapest &amp; immediately arriving to most expensive &amp; requiring some time for the painter to arrive &amp; you're also able to hire some of the greatest painters of that time like Leonardo daVinci &amp; Michelangelo Buonarotti. You hire the painters at a very young age, often as teenagers, after having some training at the guild they go on a journey, come back &amp; skill further, can become a master painter, become even more skilled, age, get gray hair, become ill &amp; die. In that respect it is quite a depressing game, the time is flowing, the masters which you trained &amp; nurtured over the in game years are just gone one day &amp; your guild is left without them &amp; may not be able to provide paintings anymore of similiar quality, unpaid apprentices may even leave the guild &amp; you will be left with the remaining handful of journeymen.  I noticed only one bug so far. Sometimes the easel with the painting gets stuck somewhere, making all clicks irresponsive. Though i was able to come out of that bug without loosing the progress, it's still unnerving.  Overall highly recommended.",

The game is buggy which makes it even harder to enjoy the already small amount of content. The developer hasn't updated the game since September 2015 (one day after it came out out of early access and was released), and it seems like they have cut and run. Will update my review upon the game being updated.",

Painting system along with the skills, styles etc was deeper than I first realised. Ways the painters grow, fall sick, get arrested for gambling debts really added to the experience.  Only a few things I'd love to see in future updates: Relationship system - children would have skills of parents and gives your originally edited character a legacy born through his/her progeny. (Or instead of relationships, you can directly tutor other painters in the guild to develop your skills/traits) Special requests for paintings as bonus quests - to work alongside the historic moments in the game. More building/aethetic options/furnature.  ",

I wish there where different mediums that you can train your artests in (paint, scupting, etc.) however, since the game is called painters guild (not artists guild) I guess I can see why but it would have been interesting.   Other the that the game is really only worth picking up if it's on sale. I got it for 2.50 so I did not feel ripped off.",

You quickly learn about the different painting styles while you try to keep your head above the water and throw painting after painting out the door.  Occasionally you get requests to help paint works of art for local buildings, which soon ask for more than just two painters.  So you take on a second apprentice, build out to accomodate them, then a third... and soon you're juggling them all trying to get their skills up, keep the paint flowing, and worry yourself sick about whether your master painter will survive long enough to see their apprentices become master painters themselves.  It's a good game, but if you're expecting a casual approach, you'll soon find you're mistaken. This game gets progressively more difficult to manage.",

It has a wide avantage of evolving. Developer team seems to be willingly consider our opinions. With updates and DLCs, i believe this game will be one of the ''avant-garde''s.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  EDIT: I was wrong with the developer.",
