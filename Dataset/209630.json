            "review_text": "Ok so yes i will admit why i bought this game first,i am a huge H.P.Lovecroft fan and allways have been (read all the stories he has written and found that i enjoy his works but THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH and THE CALL OF CTHULUH and probablly me favorites) and thats what first intrigued me about this game. MAGRUNNER is very similar in play style to PORTAL,whereas in portal you have the 'APERTURE HAND HELD PORTAL DEVICE' (god thats a mouth full) in MAGRUNNER you have the MAG GLOVE which fires 2 coloured charges.1 is green and one is red (push and pull mechanics come into play here-1 attracts and 1 repels) and it plays in much the same way as the 'APERTURE...........oh lets call it the portal gun (its easier and doesnt take as long to wright) does in both of the PORTAL games.The graphics in MAGRUNNER are good and the music and overall feeling of dread that something may be coming for you at any point is quite intense at some points during the game.The story is told with gusto and never lets up (i havent finished yet but i am enjoying the story so far and i love the LOVECROFTIAN-(is that even a word DUH)-overtones in trhe story),as what starts out ot be a sci fi story about energy comsumption and finding new power sources soon turns into a horror induced nightmare and you find out why you and the other MAGRUNNERS are there and your purpass in the greater story is revealed.The main character is called DAX WARD and this sounds a lot like a character Lovecroft created himself CHARLES DEXTER WARD (any relation to this character is not know at this point as i havent finished the game just yet),DAX will no doubt before the end of the game encounter more similarities i dont doubt and will come across more of the horrors that Lovecroft created on the way. I like this game and it is good to see a developer investing in a Lovcraft based game as there is not a lot (if any) out there (or film,tv series or any other medium for that matter),i would also reccomend that if you want to play anything inspired by Lovecrofts work also search out the game CALL OF CTHULUH : DARK CORNERS OF THE EARTH (also available on steam) as that is one of the best survival horror first person games i have ever played (finished it on the X BOX and going to play through on steam as soon as time permits). So in closing if you loved PORTAL you will more than likely enjoy this and if you didnt steer clear and probably try DARK CORNERS OF THE EARTH instead as that game really does grab you by the throat and doesnt let go.",

The storyline in this game may not be a masterpiece but its all about puzzle's and this game has a lot of them. Some of them can be really frustrating though :P  I would give this game a sold 7/10.",

When the more...mysterious things happened I screamed like the little girl I am and said I would never touched it....and was back at it after an hour or so. I recommend playing it in small segments, to get a break and come back with a fresh aproach for the more frustrating levels. Or use the time to look at a guide, cause some essential things are easyly overlooked. And forget the 'magnets of the same colour should reject each other' thing-&gt; maybe those arent magnets! Xander could have some mumbojumbo put into it! Great game, great story. Still I thought I would be able to play as different Magrunners but it wasn't such a letdown since Dax grows on you and you want to get him through this endless maze of madness. If you liked Portal and Quantum Conundrum you should give Magrunner a try!",

            "review_text": "Magrunner exists to make you appreciate Portal. Yes, the graphics are good, and yes, the magnets are an interesting gameplay mechanic, but the storytelling is thoroughly second rate. Unskippable cutscenes are everywhere, character development is worse than flat (some of my allies are actually repulsive), and the voice acting and dialogue are clumsy (no one talks like that). This game has less emotional impact than a companion cube. I'm left feeling that Cthulu is a crutch, an almost desperate way to try to make me care about the story by using someone else's cool ideas hoping they rub off.  Even trying to put up with the story, the gameplay left me frustrated. It's a steep learning curve, and again because of poor delivery: they just expect you to know things. Trial and error can only get you so far when you have to perform yet another new maneuver they haven't taught you. Recipe for frustration.  After a couple hours of Magrunner all I could think was how much I wanted to go back and play Portal instead. So I did.",

            "review_text": "Magrunner = Portal with a Cthulu story. Sorry but it just is. Magrunner is nowhere nearly as superbly designed and polished as Portal, but it is a very solid effort.  Visuals are good and the story is not bad. The puzzles are interesting because of the novel 'magnetic fields' (but weirdly work the opposite way of real world magnets) - unfortunately sometimes the puzzles do tend to cross the thin 'unfair' line (eg. puzzle pieces are usually subtely hidden) - then again some puzzle fanatics love that ( i don't until i solve the puzzle and then I might).   This one is for people who can't get enough of Portal or who simply love interesting FPS puzzle games.",

As with all puzzles games they always have around 3-4 puzzles that really ♥♥♥♥ me off and almost had me rage quitting.

            "review_text": "Comparisons to Portal have always been inevitable, but I wish they had learned from Valve somewhat as far as the puzzles are concerned. I've found them to be fairly inconsistent - you can have one map that's hairpulling-ly inscrutable and then one that's babby's first block puzzle. They also seem to introduce concepts without giving the player any idea of how to interact with them or what they do. Also, the magnetic effects seem to be somewhat unpredictable, in a way - platforms will still drift if they're neutral; using a jump pad with two boxes launches you high rather than wide, etc. It really does seem difficult sometimes to gauge how different cubes and platforms will work together whether they're red, green, or neutral.  In a change from Portal, you can interact with monsters - and by 'interact,' I mean that they will try to chase you and kill you. At first I didn't care for it, because it didn't seem apropos for a pure puzzle game to add 'running away from monsters' into the mix, but it actually adds a bit of interest and it doesn't happen that often anyways. The Lovecraftian stuff is done quite well. Like Portal, you start off with pristine, shiny test maps and then start moving down into collapsing, disheveled environments. Except in Magrunner, they're that way because of eldritch horrors busting into the world. It's quite creepy and effective. I also like that you can fall from any height without dying (as long as it's not into a bottomless pit). The voice acting is completely cheesy, though. All in all, I'd say it's worth checking out if it's on sale but some of the puzzles may frustrate.",

            "review_text": "This is a great Portal-like game that uses magnets. Who doesn't like magnets, right? A fun and innocent puzzle platformer with magnets, what could possibly go wrong?  Mwuhahahaha!!!  Seriously, though, this was a very enjoyable game. Each new level adds a new twist on the game mechanics and requires you to keep thinking in new ways to solve the puzzles. Just when you start thinking,  this is fun, but the novelty might start wearing off soon , that is when Cthulhuthian horror starts creeping in to give the levels an extra sharp, terrifying edge. By the time you reach Act III, you just want to crawl under a warm blanket until the voices stop.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Cthulhu mythos, it is nothing like typical horror which can be both dull and disgusting with its mindless, rampaging zombies or masked, knife-wielding weirdoes and an excess of pointless gore. The literature of H. P. Lovecraft doesn't try to gross you into fright, it strikes at the underpinnings of your very concept of reality, leaving your sanity to tumble helplessly into an endless abyss. Just thought you ought to know...  Anyway, although the physics system is good, the portrayal of magnetism is not accurate. I hate to be nitpicky, but as an engineer, I can't help noticing that the game objects act more like they are electrically charged than magnetically polarized, except that I've never heard of a cylindrical electrical field. It is possible to create a cylindrical magnetic field, but only if there is an electrical current at the center, which the game frequently omits. If you can work past these inaccuracies, you will surely enjoy the harmonic motion mechanics and application of chaos theory.  The story behind the game is a bit light, and the voice acting is second rate, but it is enough to set the creepy tone for the later chapters. The ending is quite odd, but what else can you expect from a game inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Overall, the creative gameplay and unnerving atmosphere more than make up for the game's weak points, and I can recommend this game for anyone who enjoys puzzles or things that go bump in the night.  Whatever you do, don't look!",

Outside of this, Magrunner satisfies in difficulty and interesting magnetic puzzles.   Portal with magnets instead, and an opposingly cheesy and bad story.  ",

            "review_text": "So it's magnetic puzzles with Cthulhu, basically. Normally you'd expect magnetic fields to attract fields of opposite polarity, but not here - here opposites repel, it seems. I guess that when we're talking about alien horrors that drive you insane, this is what we mean now.  All things said and done, though, this is a competently executed puzzle game. I'm not great at puzzle games and I got stuck a few times, and some of the puzzles rely less on planning and more on timing than I'd like, but overall I found the difficulty fitting for a casual puzzle player. The story is fine overall, though some of the voice acting is a bit wooden, and the ending is actually kind of interesting, though it also features some fashionable criticism of social media that feels unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the game. Cthulhu likes to sit on the edge of certain maps and growl his name at you over and over again, which is cool the first time but quickly gets kinda weird. Seriously, Cthulhu, we get it. Calm down.  Overall, a decent game though not really outstanding by any measure. Give it a shot if you like first-person puzzle games!",
