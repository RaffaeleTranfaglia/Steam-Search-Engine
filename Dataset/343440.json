            "review_text": "This game really surprised me. Basically drive around, go through rings and do stunts, and every once in a while a challenge happens where you can earn money to buy more cars. However, the twist is that everything is online and you are competing with other players in the open world. It is very addicting. My only complaint is that the controls with a controller could be better (such as being able to use buttons/triggers to accelerate instead of the control pad/stick), but I wouldn't be surprised if that is patched soon. Overall, an excellent buy for 5 bucks (the current non-sale price).",

            "review_text": "My steam collection seems like an uncharted territory full of titles that I've never heard of. Sometimes I just pick a random one, run it, and expect nothing. Optimism was never my strong suit after all. So, I run Crash Drive 2. Expecting the worst.  I entered the menu of the game, exhaled with irritation. Everything looked unpolished to the point that I felt like pressing quit instantly.  I am glad and lucky I did not. You see, yeah there are all kinds of problems here, interface wise. But, buuuuut, and that is a big but (I like that point in every review I write. I like it, and I cannot lie). The core gameplay mechanics are pure bliss, fun, or any other similar word you could put there to simulate a happy warm fuzzy feeling in your gut.  There is the stage, open not linear, and the players with their cars in it. Driving around, roaming freely. Then the events start to come, one after the other. King, with a crown and all, every other car chasing you to get it from you. The winner will be the one left wearing it proudly on his/her hood.  Stunt contest? Sure, there is that as well. Racing? Yeap, this is a random event that just may happen. Also it is the one event you can opt out for the round, if you wish.  Play play play this game, if you love fun racing titles. Do not let the sloppy interface put you off. The heart of Crash Drive 2 is golden.  One last thing. The in game invite friend system does not seem to work. You have to invite your friends via steam, in order to play with them. In fact the best way is to start a game and then the rest of the group join that game you created, via Steam not inside the Crash Drive 2 menu. Cumbersome? Yeap. Sloppy? Sure sure. But if you have friends who own the game you have to play it with them. If you do not have friends who own the game gift it to them. If you don't have friends, go make some. And then play Crash Drive 2 together.",

The amount of time played is how long it took me to complete the game in full and for the cost of the game it is definitely worth it and the tank battles were a great addition to this game. It does get repetitious after awhile and I was kind of getting bored of it by the last 5 cars I had to unlock and maybe even a little bit earlier but the tank battles when unlocked was such a refresher and got me back into the game when I actually played it. Good game, would give it a 7.5/10",

This is one of the best mobile ports I've ever played on the PC and it's certainly cool playing against people on Mac Books and iPhones. The controls on the PC using a wireless Xbox 360 controller are tight and responsive in game but you'll need your mouse and keyboard to navigate the menus. My only complaint is that there's only 4 maps to unlock along with a 'Tank Battle' set of maps. I won't go into the games descriptions because you can probably go in YouTube and Google and get a better understanding of it than I could write. But if you're looking for a cheap, casual game that all ages can enjoy this is it.",
